The competitive world has caused technologies to improve rapidly in the 21st century .
One of the advancements in technology would be surveillance technology .
The concerns for safety and security have increased the extent of use of the surveillance systems .
Despite the proper usage of surveillance technology , there is a widespread abuse of the technology by some criminal organizations .
Hence , the potential for abuse increases .
Surveillance technology has been used as a tool for illegitimate activities which in turn threatens public safety and security .
This issue has become a main topic in public discussion .
Thus , due to the risk of misuse of surveillance technology , I fully concur that the use of surveillance technology should be banned .
First and foremost , surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been used as a tool for hackers and identity thieves to commit " 'contactless' "crime against victims without their consent (Lewan , 2009) .
RFID chip is largely used in some official identification documents such as driver's license and passport in America .
Once the RFID number is intercepted , it is possible for the criminals to track the movements of their targets without their knowledge .
Additionally , it has been concluded that the use of RFID has no benefit on the achievement of national security , but it resulted in an increment in risk of personal privacy and security (Lewan , 2009) .
Hence , the use of RFID should be discontinued .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it has been misused by people for illegal activities .
The misuse of surveillance technology not only invades users' privacy but also increases the risk to personal and national security .
There are many types of genetic testing , such as late-onset disorders and newborn screening .
Genetic testing allows early detection of diseases , which  may be useful to mankind .
However , genetic testing has brought about issues if such genetic results are revealed and abused .
Thus , I agree that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
First , we will discuss  the relationship between employees and their employer's organisation .
There is tension between employees and employers regarding genetic testing .
(Stephen , 2003) .
If genetic testing indicates susceptibility  of an employee to diseases , there is a  chance  that the employer will dismiss the employee .
This is supported by the fact that most people with disabilities or diseases are discriminated against .
Most companies are not willing to employ them as they may be seen to be inefficient because of their disabilities .
Thus , genetic results should not be revealed to protect people from losing their jobs .
Opponents to this position may argue that such results should be revealed to protect the employer from an employee who is vulnerable  to illness .
(Stephen , 2003) .
However , the primary basis of employment should be work performance and efficiency , rather than on genetic testing .
(Kankowski & Capron ,1991) .
Hence , individuals should have the final say to protect them from  that may harm them .
(Stephen , 2003) .
Next , a further difficulty issue involves revealing of genetic results to insurance companies .
(Stephen , 2003) .
Applicants will be at a disadvantage when applying for insurance .
For example , if genetic results are revealed , the cost of the insurance will be expensive such that it may not be worth it .
Critics of this position claim that insurers will also be at a disadvantage if such results are not revealed to them .
(Stephen , 2003) .
I must admit that the insurer will be at a disadvantage if the situation is switched .
However , the cost of insurance should be on the current medical status of the applicant and should not be on the results of the genetic testing .
Genetic testing is a test performed to allow genetic diagnosis of inherited diseases .
Not only so , genetic testing (fingerprinting) is also used to determine the child's paternity .
[1] Genetic testing does have many advantages in today's society .
In the society today , many have debated whether we really have the right to have the final say whether to reveal the results of the testing as many will think that it will lead to many ethical and social issues .
Or is it that it is a must to reveal it due to reality and we , individuals do not have the final say to reveal our testing to the public .
In my  opinion , in the high technology society we are living in , we do not have the final say in revealing of our genetic results to the public .
Companies do have the right to know the genetic testing results of an individual who is applying for the job offered by them .
For companies that offer jobs that require physical strength , it will be necessary to obtain the genetic testing of the individual .
For example , if one have inherited genetic disease like muscle dystrophy , it will be dangerous for them to work in the construction site .
Accidents might occur and it may also result in death .
Although many have debated that this is discrimination as companies may not employ those who has inherited diseases , but companies do have the right to choose employees with concern for their profits and the safety of others .
Individuals that may inherit genetic diseases should not choosejobs that are beyond their reach .
Hence companies instead of the individuals have the right to know the genetic testing of the individual .
A spouse does have the right to know the family disease of their partner .
If a couple is planning to have a child , it is best for them to go through genetic counseling if the parents are carriers of genetic disease [2] .
It will be unfair if the one kept the truth from their spouse .
The spouse does have the right to know whether the child will suffer from the genetic diseases .
This is a basic respect towards your partner in a marriage .
It is a must to declare it  and thus individuals do not have the final say in revealing of their genetic results to the third party .
The education sector  does have the right to know the genetic testing of their  students .
Those with genetic diseases like mental retardation and Down syndrome are asked to be enrolled in schools like MINDS and bright sparks .
Some may debate that this is a form of discrimination and violates the human rights of these children .
However , according to the American Association for mental retardation AAMR [3] , revealing of genetic testing results is not a form of discrimination but it is to be fair to those children with these genetic diseases as the children will be enrolled into the school that provides a better environment for them to study in .
It is a must to provide the school with the genetic testing result .
Hence individuals do not have the final say in revealing of their genetic results to the public .
All in all , in my  opinion , in the high technology society we are living in , we do not have the final say in revealing of our genetic results to the public .
It may not be a disadvantage and can even benefit many people based on the points mentioned above .
Thus individuals requesting  genetic testing do not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
With rapid technological advancement , myriad forms of surveillance technology have surfaced and people are using it both intensively and extensively .
From forms as high level as satellite surveillance to the common Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) , surveillance technology has served us well .
However , due to the improper exploitation of it , surveillance technology has become more  detrimental than beneficial .
Intrusion of privacy and upsetting of the various balances in society are concerns people are increasingly worried about .
Hence , with so much discomfort people are experiencing with surveillance technology , it should be banned .
Due to the immense usage of surveillance technology , the society has become relatively transparent .
On the intangible aspects , information of individuals can be easily retrieved with the ease of data mining (Easton , 2006) .
With high speed connections and data transfer rate nowadays , an enormous bulk of data can be moved around in a very short period .
Classified information like credit card , banking and medical records can get into the wrong hands , producing many repercussions .
(Easton , 2006) Identity theft is flagrant and many more will suffer from financial losses .
Moreover , as RFID technology becomes increasingly popular with the retailers , privacy of consumers is again compromised .
(Hariton , 2006)The tags are usually not "killed" and this allows consumers' movement to be tracked and habits to be observed .
(Hariton , 2006) This thorough understanding of consumers has certainly gone overboard .
Last but not least , biometric surveillance has given checkpoints the capability to monitor people down to the skin .
(Monahan , 2006) Evolved surveillance here is so revealing that people appear literally naked on screens .
Furthermore , surveillance technology has created many  and upsets in the balance of our society .
Society will see the rise of discriminations since the entire background of an individual can be easily traced .
Dates cancelled , different standards in pricing of insurance premiums and harassment of political dissidents are just a few to mention .
(Easton , 2006) Next , surveillance technology also widens the gap between the rich and the poor .
The rich can afford to encrypt and protect their data while engaging in better surveillance over the less well off .
Moreover , by selling information (Easton , 2006) , the rich will get richer .
With regards to RFID , usage mentioned earlier  will reduce the variety of products available in stores because retailers will only consider the better selling items .
Society will witness a smorgasbord of changes in the various balances and the birth of more deviants such as stalkers .
Therefore , with all the worrisome disadvantages  surveillance technology will bring , we ought to ban it .
It makes privacy lose its meaning and is unhealthy for our society .
Consequences will be disastrous if we do not put an end to it .
With the revelation of human's DNA structure by Watson and Crick in 1953 , it shows that there will be a totally new science and engineering related subject being brought to the world , which is genetic engineering .
By utilizing the sophisticated technology tools , together with the perseverance of researchers , many genetics related approaches have been made possible .
One of the noted breakthroughs is genetic testing .
However , the advent of genetic testing does not bring unanimous consent from the public .
There are uproars regarding the moral and ethical issues which cloud the topic of genetic testing from time to time .
Some think that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in disclosure of the results .
In fact , individuals requesting genetic testing should not have the final say as they would possibly make wrong decisions .
First of all , if the individuals get diagnosed with hereditary genetic disease , they will probably be overwhelmed by guilt or anxiety , thereby making a wrong decision , which is nondisclosure of their results within families .
It is primarily caused by the desire of protecting family members from troubling information .
Conversely , siblings of the subjects should be told immediately as they may carry the same genetic disease as the subjects' .
Some diseases are treatable in the presymptomatic stage .
Therefore , the siblings must know it so that treatment could be administered as soon as possible .
The general practitioner , who is the one they are consulting and also experienced in handling this kind of case , definitely has the final say to make a more rational decision for them .
After that , parents who request genetic testing for their children must provide the genetic information of their children to school authorities for the enrollment .
This aims to divide the group of children according to their learning skill and to ensure that every single child is provided with the most appropriate education .
Individuals requesting genetic testing usually decide not to disseminate their genetic information as discrimination may be put forth to their lives .
In fact , there is one of the federal laws that has been applied to genetics nondiscrimination which is Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) .
Besides forbidding the employers making adverse employment decisions , GINA also prohibits insurance companies reducing their coverage and pricing on the basis of information derived from genetic tests .
Thus , there is no fear of revealing the genetic results .
On the other hand , individuals are responsible to inform employers about their genetic conditions so that a better and safer working environment could be provided .
Finally , it has been said that individuals should have the final say on not disclosing their genetic information for research purposes .
Indeed , research teams should have a direct access to the genetic results so that the further genetic sequence on DNA could be unmasked in a faster pace .
As a result , individuals must provide their genetic information .
Ultimately , individuals requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in disclosure of their results .
This is because individual  is less capable of making a suitable decision .
It may end up with not only affecting one's life , but also influencing a few generations .
Hence , by having a requirement to reveal the genetic results , rational decisions will often be made to the benefit of the individual as a group discussion always comes up with fruitful conclusion .
Genetic testing will bring about many consequences .
First , by doing genetic testing , people may be able to discover about their genetic disease early .
For instance , a man , who acsupport and oppositionHuntington's diseaford one day he takes the genetic testing , will then onIn that situation ,s outcome will certainly affect all of his family as Huntihandn's is a genetic disease .
(American Society of Clinical Oncology , 2006) Due to thedisclosureffects that may present , people should discuss with their family first before deciding on scrucial; thus 
Second , some people argue that genetic testing is a privacy and sensitive problem .
In addition , the result may be emssing and can affect their prestige .
For exampmana man has mutation in his gene and the takes the genetic testing one day and finds out the truth about his condition .ave the final say to reveal the result or hold it (Wertz , 2001) .
However , in the reality , the result of genetic testing is so important and could give impact to all his fmay be present may comprise information about hereditary disease .
withholdIn conclusion , the result of genetic testing that inprivates about our herissue disease , will not only affect us as individual but also our family .
Therefore , the final say should not be in individual but the whole family .
Genetic testing has become a common practice in the modern society .
Its general purpose is to check if one has the potential to develop certain genetic diseases .
However , this has brought about many debates on  ethical issues in  society .
Some argued that individuals who have requested the genetic testing should have the final say about revealing their test results so as to preserve individual's rights .
However , this will have a  negative impact on  society .
Thus , they should not have the final say .
Employers are able to help their workers by making it compulsory for the latter to reveal their genetic test results . .
Some may say that it is a kind of discrimination against employees who have certain genetic traits .
However , one must be reminded that there are many occupations that required the employees to work in  hazardous environments  and their welfare can be protected through the revelation of genetic test results .
For example , people with the thalassemia gene will be at  risk if they were exposed to lead (The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics) .
By getting employees to reveal their genetic test results , employers can determine if the job applicant is suitable for the job and therefore assign them to a job environment that will not have any exposure to lead .
This benefits both the employees and the companies .
On the other hand , it will be disastrous if a soldier who has the genetic traits of Dissociative identity disorder (DID) were to be deployed in the field .
In another example , a colour-blind pilot has caused the crash of a FedEx plane in Florida , USA .
This can be prevented if he were to undergo genetic testing and the results were revealed to the company . .
Thus ,  individuals should not be given the final say about revealing their genetic test results .
Giving the insurance companies the final say about revealing genetic test results can prove to be beneficial  .
Many may think that insurance companies used the test results as  excuses to deny them from claiming or even buying certain medical policies .
These are just myths because proponents of the federal legislation would outlaw the acts (Harmon AA .
) .However , insurance companies have the rights to judge if the declarations of the clients are truthful by comparing them with the test results .
This is to prevent abuse of policies .
Moreover , many insurance companies used the test results to encourage the clients to buy certain policies that can maximize their benefits .
Clients should not have the final say if they want to enjoy the coverage of the insurance policies .
In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say about revealing their genetic test results since it will be more beneficial to the society .
By revealing the results will benefit the majority  .
After September 11 2001 , surveillance became important as it is one of the tools to prevent terrorism .
This then brings about the debates on whether surveillance technology should be banned  This is because surveillance could provide security , and it could also invade our privacy and disturb the society .
In my view , surveillance technology should be banned as the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages .
Surveillance technology should be banned as it invades our privacy .
Surveillance technology could be used to track people's movements , lifestyles and habits unknowingly (Hariton , Lawford and Palihapitiya , 2006) .
Furthermore , this information is not only available to the owner of surveillance technology , it  might also be available to affiliated people or people who bought the information (Easton , 2006) .
Hence , our privacy is being invaded as our very personal information is being known by a lot of people .
In addition , surveillance technology disturbs the society .
The economy gap between the rich and the poor will be wider (Monahan , 2006) as the rich is able to purchase information and use it to their advantage , This enables the rich to make more money than the poor .
Hence , surveillance technology should be banned .
Some might argue that surveillance technology should not be banned as it provides security .
With surveillance technology , terrorists could be more easily identified  .
Surveillance technology also prevents people from committing crime as they know they are being watched (Easton , 2006) .
However , this might not be true .
In fact , it might bring additional work to the security force as they now have to take care of minor issue captured by the surveillance technology (Monahan , 2006)  , and this may cause them to overlook the real threat to our security .
Hence , surveillance technology should be banned .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it invades our privacy and disturbs the society 
The past two decades have brought about huge technological advances in the areas of nano-engineering and information systems .
With the help of  modern technology , humans are able to create increasingly efficient devices which are able to store relevant personal information or to trace one's location .
The use of sophisticated personnel tracking devices has long been an ethical quagmire , with people holding polarizing views debating if  surveillance technology can be  allowed to track people .
Proponents for the use of tracking devices on humans assert that patients can be easily identified in cases of emergency with their medical profiles easily accessible , since information is stored in a database that can be accessed via the internet (Lewan , 2007) .
Administrative procedures are greatly reduced , and the patient's vital records , for example drug allergies are readily retrievable .
Patients will be able to receive immediate and proper medical attention , which in certain cases can be a matter of life and death .
Moreover , tracking devices are able to assist law enforcement personnel to monitor suspects closely (Michael , K & Rose , G , 2007) .
Unknowing crime suspects can be monitored closely by the police over a period of time .
This allows discovery of new evidences through observation of the suspects; and to  prove if one is innocent or guilty .
Some arguments brought forward by opponents states that tagged identities could be easily duplicated by identity thefts (Lewan , 2009) .
This argument is flawed , as there is no concrete evidence showing the existence of such crimes .
The argument also blatantly ignored the fact that there are additional measures being taken to preventing such crimes .
Opponents also claim that the government will be able to use such devices to monitor , instil fear , and ultimately control the users (Lewan , 2009) .
This assertion is a fallacy , as it is based solely on foresight , and is cynical and biased .
In conclusion , tracking devices should be allowed in tracking people , as it is able to change human lives for the better , and it may even prevent or reduce crime rates .
Nowadays , advances in technology have made tracking people no longer an uphill task .
Due to this , many surveillance technologies have been created in order to make the tracking job efficient .
A controversy on the benefits of the surveillance technology and the effects of the surveillance technology has been aroused .
Nonetheless , the use of it has brought along significant benefits and therefore it should not be banned .
There are two main benefits that the use of surveillance technology has brought  .
Firstly , it helps to tag "high-risk" patients (Todd Lewan , 2007) .
A microchip is implanted into the arm of patients who had heart diseases , diabetics or Alzheimer's disease .
For the Alzheimer's patients , it helps to track them in order to ensure their safety .
By using this technology , the location of the patient can be easily detect by a reader and immediate action can be taken if the patient is in risk .
This system really benefits the Alzheimer's patient who are often lost due to their degrading memories .
Another benefit is to use GPS (global positioning systems) tracking device to track criminals (Michael K , Rose GL , 2007) .
The GPS tracking device helps in the investigation of crimes .
This system can trace the position of an individual globally as it helps to trace the track of criminals .
This helps to smooth and speed up the process of investigation of crimes by the police .
Besides , GPS is also widely used to monitor the action of the terrorists .
Terrorists are under the tracking of the system as when they arebeing traced .
Immediate actions will be taken by the authorities .
This technology fights terrorism to make the world a safer place . .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
It benefits not only the individual but the whole world .
There are two major advantages of using surveillance technology to track people .
Law enforcement agencies are able to identify terrorists and put a stop to their plans .
Recent happenings show that a number of terrorist plots have ceased because of  surveillance technology (Michael & Rose , 2007 , p . 8) .
It consequently helps to prevent major catastrophes ,  which involve the loss of human lives (Michael & Rose , 2007 , p .8) .
Other than that , the technology also helps in reducing crime rates all around the world .
It is especially useful in stamping out "transnational crimes such as drug and people trafficking , money laundering , and the smuggling of things" (Michael & Rose , 2007 , p .8) .
Besides that , surveillance technology also enables the tracking of criminals who are on the run  , and  even kidnappers .
Once being tagged , the lawbreakers' positions can be monitored and crimes can be solved within a short period of time .
Critics argue that such surveillance technology is able to track an individual on a regular basis , thus there is a compromise of one's privacy (Michael & Rose , 2007 , p . 2) .
Similarly , the United States has been criticized for promoting the use of human tracking technologies after the 9/11 event (Michael & Rose , 2007 , p . 8) , as it indicates the beginning of an Orwellian era as claimed by many privacy advocates (Lewan , 2007 , para .
7) .
However , this unfounded argument is not adequate to outlaw the use of human tracking technology .
Jacques Ellul noted that "to be sure of apprehending criminals , it is necessary that everyone be supervised" (Lyon , as cited in Michael & Rose , 2007 , p . 20) .
Safety of mankind is not worth being sacrificed just for the sake of their privacy .
A balance should be reached between the two extremes - the banning of human tracking technology and privacy being stripped away from innocent citizens .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned as it helps to prevent terrorism and crimes .
Consequently , an agreement should be reached between the privacy advocates and law enforcement agencies on the degree of control in surveillance .
This is because  innocent citizens have the rights to live in secured environment without facing erosions of their human rights and privacy .
Easy access by third parties such as insurance companies or healthcare professionals to an individual's genetic information may cause invasion of privacy and discrimination .
Although medical personnel are entrusted with the ethics of genetic testing , commercialization and easy access to certain genetic testing may lead to compromising situations for members of the public (Bioethics Advisory Committee , 2005) .
For instance , genetic information that falls into the hands of insurers and employers without the consent of individuals will be used to prejudice against the tested individual .
Society might treat the person differently or even deny basic rights to equal job opportunities , income , education , mental well-being , housing status , health , and medical treatment .
Racial discrimination still exists today in various parts of the world despite government efforts to eradicate it .
Who can say what will happen if a patient's genetic information falls into the wrong hands ?
Besides that , disclosure of genetic information to close relatives without informed consent may also cause internal family problems .
Often , prediction based on genetic information is uncertain , especially by those who are not well informed about the nature of a disease .
This misunderstanding not only creates unnecessary psychological , economic as well as social burdens on the carrier of a known genetic risk , but may also affect family ties . . A couple with a positively tested disease has to sacrifice their dream of having children if they do not wish to pass on their defective genes to their offspring .
As such , the couple suffers in silence , having to face the social stigma of not having children and having their dreams of building their families shattered .
Moreover , the in-laws , usually the more traditional type , may be dissatisfied with the daughter-in-law for not  being able to produce a 'perfect' offspring , or being unable to produce any offspring at all , to sustain the future generation of a family .
In conclusion , the patient of genetic testing should have the final say in  revealing the results  .
Until proper steps such as enactment and reinforcement of laws are taken by the governments , genetic information of individuals should be kept private and confidential to avoid exploitation by unscrupulous parties and also to avoid the disintegration of family relations .
The release of genetic information of a patient has wide and lifelong implications on his or her life , and therefore this vital decision should be made after careful thought .
Genetic testing includes special techniques to examine the information carried by DNA which are held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes .
DNA is taken from a person's blood , body fluids or tissues .
By analysing an individual's specific genes , some diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia may be detected .
An individual can prevent some diseases or get the appropriate treatment for the diseases after getting the results of genetic testing .
However , if the result of the test can be easily assessed by a third party , a lot of problems will occur .
Therefore , the patient should have the right to decide whether he or she wants to reveal the results of the genetic tests .
The privacy and confidentiality of a person will be affected by revealing his or her undesirable genetic testing results .
The issues of privacy and confidentiality may affect the individual , the family and the group to which the individual belongs .
If the result is being publicized , third party may stigmatize the other individuals in different group , with potentially discriminatory consequences .
Misconstruing the results of genetic testing will affect  an individual's self identity and sense of self-worth .
Besides , the individuals will feel embarrassed of their potential weakness if they get undesirable genetic testing results .
They will have no confidence while socializing with other people and this is due to their low self-esteem after getting the result  .
Hence , they may underestimate  their own ability in certain field .
This issue will strongly affect the relationship between employees and employers .
Generally , all of these genetic results will be revealed to the employer and if the employer knows that some of the employees  are prone to certain diseases , it is likely that the employees will be fired .
This is because people with disabilities are often being discriminated against .
These people have to look for other alternatives to earn a living .
Once the results are revealed , employees will have difficulties finding other jobs .
Hence , results should not be revealed to protect employees from environments that might harm them .
Another difficulty involves the disclosure of genetic information to insurance companies .
Applicants for insurance will be under increased pressure to undergo genetic tests and those prone to diseases are less likely to be eligible to buy insurance .
In conclusion , genetic testing results are a matter that should be kept private for the benefits of the patient and should only be released under certain extreme circumstances . .
Genetics plays a role in every disease .
Genetic testing informs individuals and families of their genetic status; this knowledge may enable them to take adaptive measures against a genetic disease (Jacobs , & Deatrick , 1999) , if the disease is treatable .
However , as technology advances , exploitation of genetic testing increases , resulting in the breach of human rights of privacy .
Removing individual's control over the results will in turn lead to freely accessible genetic information , which may cause social problems and family dilemma .
Firstly , every human's gene is unique and personal .
The sharing of personal genetic result is akin to being exposed to public scrutiny . .
It is undeniable that one is morally obliged to inform the relatives of the patients about the genetic test results .
However , one has the rights to confidentiality and decision on what information to reveal and how to disclose it .
Moreover , relatives , being the recipients of the bad news should have their choice whether to remain ignorant  .
Therefore , one has the rights to one's genetic privacy .
Secondly , being able to access one's genetic information will reveal the list of diseases one is susceptible to , and the one who possesses the information may have an ulterior interest .
This can in turn cause social issues like genetic discrimination in the terms of employment and insurance (Bereano , 2000) .
For example , potential employers may want their interviewees screened to determine if they carry the ideal genes for the job .
; insurance companies may deny or increase their premium for carriers of certain genetic disorder (Bereano , 2000) .
Thirdly , family members generally inherit the same set of genetic codes from their parents , and may be susceptible to similar diseases (Jacobs , & Deatrick , 1999) .
However , one would not be able to determine their preparedness for such information .
It may cause not only unnecessary distress and anxiety to relatives , but will also unravel family secrets; namely adoptions and parentage (Doukas , & Berg , 2001) .
Thus , it is still up to the discretion of individuals to go for genetic testing if they are at high risk .
Therefore , individuals who have requested for genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Genetic testing has made it possible to identify individuals who are at risk of having a disease , and to test the probability of them passing on a disease to their offspring .
There is an ongoing debate in whether these individuals should have the final say in whether or not to reveal the results .
This is because these results will affect not only the individual , but also his family , offspring , the future generations and even the society .
Thus , individuals should not have the final say in the disclosure of genetic testing results .
First of all , it will benefit and protect the individual's family members and offspring .
Research has shown that individuals tend to keep risk information to themselves (Forrest , 2000) .
But the disease could be due to hereditary genes .
The individual's family , offspring , and offspring of the family members might also inherit the disease .
If individuals did not reveal the results , family members and offspring will not know they have a risk of inheriting the disease .
When symptoms of this disease appear , their chances of full recovery will decrease .
Secondly , individuals can receive better family support and further harm can be prevented .
If individuals do not have the final say in revealing genetic test results , their family members will know their condition , and they can be more sensitive to the individual's feelings , such as giving them better support and encouragement .
Also , people diagnosed with chronic diseases are more prone to getting depression (IMH) .
Bottling up emotions will worsen the condition , and in severe cases , will lead to suicide (IMH) .
This will do more harm than good to the individuals .
Thirdly , revealing of results will benefit the future generations and the individual .
It will benefit the future generations as scientists will be able to find new or more effective cures and treatments for the disease .
It will also benefit the individual as governments will be able to come up with anti-discrimination acts to protect their rights .
Governments may also educate the public so as to minimize genetic discrimination , and build infrastructures and prepare  medical teams to provide them with proper care .
Thus , individuals should not have the final say , as it will benefit the individual , their family , and the society .
In modern times , there is an increase in the types of threat that can affect a nation's security .
People need to collect intelligence about a situation before they can act against it; and this has led to the increasing employment of surveillance technology .
The use of surveillance technology has raised concerns over the intrusion of personal privacy (Sim , 2006) .
However , since surveillance technology can help to identify problems , a solution or preventive measure can be formulated to prevent these problems from occurring , and this in turn lead to the protection  of people's health and the country's socio-economic stability .
Hence , the use of such surveillance technology  to track people should not be banned .
Firstly , the use of biometric surveillance in the form of a biometric passport will make it more difficult for terrorists to travel in and out of different countries , due to increasing passport security and border surveillance .
Furthermore , this information which is kept in a central repository can easily be updated and shared among other government agencies by wireless internet , making biometric surveillance timely and accurate (Sim , 2006) .
This method is highly efficient compared to traditional passport controls and surveillance methods .
Not being able to track terrorist movements could allow terrorists to enter a country and possibly carry out a terrorist attack; and it also makes it easier for them to escape .
Another possibility of using surveillance technology is during disease outbreaks , such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 .
An electronic card embedded with a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip was used to monitor the movements of patients , healthcare workers , and visitors within a hospital (Defense Science and Technology Agency , 2003) .
This system resulted in an increased efficiency of the contact tracing process and quarantine procedures when a patient was confirmed with SARS .
Contact tracing and quarantine procedures would normally take two days with the previous method; and it was also more taxing on manpower (Defense Science and Technology Agency , 2003) .
Thus , if the previous method was used , more people would be at risk of contracting the virus as it would take more time to identify and quarantine an infected person .
Some people would not support the use of surveillance technology as it is an intrusion to their privacy  .
There is a fear  that personal information could be stolen and used against their interests .
However , citizens should understand that surveillance technology was developed as a tool to help society; but it is the exploitation of people with criminal intent , or more often , the use of surveillance technology without careful consideration that makes surveillance technology harmful (Sim , 2006) .
Perhaps a better solution is for the government to introduce a privacy act to ensure security and prevent the misuse of personal information (Sim , 2006) .
Over the years , there has been an increase in the use of surveillance technology .
This has brought about a wild debate on the banning of the use of surveillance technology to track the movement of people .
While most propositions agree to ban the use of surveillance technology , they have in fact overlooked the actual and potential benefits of the surveillance technology .
These benefits include disease surveillance and private surveillance on family members .
Thus , the use of surveillance technology should not be completely banned .
Surveillance technology can be used to control the outspread of acute diseases .
Firstly , the use of electronic cards allows hospitals to track the time and movement of people within the hospital .
This has helped to accelerate the tracing of contacts and implementation of quarantine procedures .
(DSTA , 2003) .
Next , those who were under home quarantine during the SARS period were instructed to install a camera in their isolation zone to make sure that they are always visible and contactable , to prevent further spread of the disease .
Also , the use of infrared fever sensing system in Changi airport and along borders allows mass surveillance of body temperature , which can detect and isolate feverish passengers (Basu , 2003) .
The SARS outbreak in 2002 clearly demonstrated how the surveillance of patients , suspects , healthcare workers , and the general public led to the eventual containment of the outbreak and prevented it from escalating into a pandemic .
Surveillance technology could also be used to ensure the safety of our family members .
Through the use of the permission-based location tracking service , which is provided by our local telecommunication provider , SingTel , the location of our loved ones can be detected readily by this new surveillance technology (Daily Singapore News , 2008) .
This is very useful for families with young juveniles and aging parents because their location could be tracked easily if they are lost in the crowd and thus this may prevent  them from any possible harm they may encounter .
Over the years , drastic advancement in genetic testing allows the detection of defective genes associated with many hereditary diseases .
This impact of genetic testing posed on the individual and their family has brought up many debates on the ethical , social and family issues .
Some suggest that revealing of genetic results could benefit family members as they could seek appropriate medical treatment if tested positive (Jacobs & Deatrick 1999 .
However , negative implications such as violation of privacy , long- termed psychological and sociological effects inflicted on the  , outweigh the  .
Therefore individuals should have the final say in whether to reveal their genetic results or not .
Firstly , an individual should not be robbed of his basic right to privacy .
Although , it cannot be denied that it is ethical to inform family members about their risk of hereditary  ,  one does not have any obligation to reveal their genetic status since this information could be exploited and misused by othersthus threatening their welfare (Jacobs & Deatrick 1999) .
Thus , they should have the right to decide either to disclose their genetic information or not and also to what extent  they want to publicize it .
Secondly , revelation of one's genetic status subjects the individual to many social issues related to genetic discrimination (Bereano , 2000 .
For instance , insurance companies would reduce healthcare coverage , increase health premiums or terminate the health insurance policies for individuals with potential genetic risk (Bereano , 2000 .
Furthermore , discrimination imposed by employers and colleagues could influence an individual's self- esteem and psychological well-being .
Lastly , family dilemma could arise due to the tension caused by the unfavorable psychological influences of genetic testing (Doukas & Berg , 2001) .
Since every individual has a different level of acceptance , disclosure of genetic results could cause them to experience unnecessary emotional distress (Doukas & Berg , 2001) .
Hence , an individual should decide rationally whether to disclose their genetic results if it inflicts harm and misery to their family .
In conclusion , individuals should have the privacy to determine whether to reveal their genetic results or not since it not only inflicts emotional distress on their family but also subjects them to social discrimination .
Advancement and breakthrough in technology has now made tracking individuals using surveillance technology a reality today .
This has sparked many controversial debates on ethical and moral issues on using such technology .
Some have highlighted that usage of such technology infringes on individuals' personal privacy .
On the other hand , surveillance technology can also protect the well-being of people .
Since the advantages of surveillance technology far outweighs the disadvantages , it should not be banned .
Surveillance technology can be applied to private surveillance .
Private surveillance of individuals restricts their movements and helps to prevent the spread of a pandemic in the country .
This was especially seen during the SARS crisis back in 2003 .
( , 2003) .
Probationers are also tagged  for better control on their whereabouts .
Furthermore , loved ones can also be tracked , with Singtel's Location Tracking Service ( , 2008) .
Arguments presented for the ban on the use of surveillance technology to track individuals are totally flawed .
For instance , the existence of surveillance technology in the virtual world helps to curb crimes against copyrights , piracy and bank frauds .
Copyright protection such as the TurnItIn Online Programme , is designed to detect unreferenced copying or plagiarism in individual's work .
In addition , illegal file distribution , sale and download are acts that tantamount to promoting piracy .
Individuals can be sued by the relevant distribution companies and authorities .
Moreover , surveillance technology helps protect against bank frauds and illegal activities , such as hacking into personal Internet banking accounts .
DBS Bank has in place security surveillance systems that regularly "monitor and detect any potential form of illegitimate activities" ( , 2007) .
As  genetic testing is making rapid progress on providing information on the hidden DNAs which might cause diseases , the techniques have also aroused a large amount of heated debates on the ethical and moral issues surrounding the control of final say of the testing .
In terms of individual rights of privacy and long-term social influence , the one requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
First of all , the individual has the right to determine whether or not it is necessary to make the genetic testing results public .
According to the definition released by Bereano (2009) in his article Does Genetic Research Threaten Our Civil Liberties , the right of privacy "involves notions of the dignity and integrity of the individual" .
The individual who received the genetic testing should determine for himself or herself how and to what extent the relevant information is communicated to the public .
Although it cannot be denied that the other family members to some extent also have the right to know whether they share the same suspected genes as the tested , they can choose to test their genes by themselves , rather than to depend on other people's testing results .
If one's privacy cannot be protected so that the result might be made use of on any purpose , the human rights are endangered and hence this decision should be made by the individual requesting the genetic testing .
Secondly , social problems such as genetic discrimination tend to be implemented .
For instance ,  insurance companies can require the testing result before signing for a contact with a client who may be potential carriers of diseases .
Despite taking the risks of catching a disease , the client should  own the right to buy the insurance .
Nevertheless , insurance companies judge clients on the testing result and either refuse the healthcare coverage or even transfer this suspect diagnosis to the next generation" (Lynch & Lynch , 1996) .
This kind of problem will be wide-spreading .
Thus the individual should have the right to decide whether to reveal the result  , considering his own benefits .
To conclude , the one who requests genetic testing should have the final right to determine whether this result should be made public or not .
Surveillance technology was first introduced in the seventies where video tape surveillance became the global norm to watch human behaviours in a small area .
Over the years , advances in science and technology has empowered surveillance technology by introducing many forms and magnifying the scope of surveillance .
This has brought about many controversies on the ethical , health and social issues surrounding the notion of mass surveillance .
While supporters argue that surveillance technology brings benefits to the human race , the harms it causes when it is excessively misused outweigh the benefits .
Thus , due to the implications of surveillance technology , it should be banned .
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology invades our privacy .
Privacy is a  fundamental fundamental human right and we have the right to lead our lives without public surveillance .
In Britain , there are 4 .2 million CCTV cameras on the streets , about one for every 14 citizen ( , 2006) .
Mass surveillance has infringed our rights to lead a personal life as all our  actions and behaviours are being watched and tracked .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned as our basic right is being infringed upon .
Lastly , surveillance technology , such as RFID , might cause health problems in human implants .
Research shows that that implanted RFID tags are associated with tumors in rodents , mostly sarcomas (Foster & Jaeger , 2008) .
This result is alarming as it suggests  the possibility of a similar effect in humans (Foster & Jaeger , 2008) .
Surveillance technology has advanced rapidly over the years and is commonly seen in many places , from leisure places to workplaces and even to our lifts and homes .
This monitoring of other people's behaviour , activities , or information has brought about many debates on ethical issue , security issues as well as individual's health issues .
Though some suggest that surveillance technology benefits us  the negative implications outweigh the benefits .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned .
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology has dehumanized and violated our most basic right which is privacy .
This is because surveillance technology such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) allows others to watch and track our daily activities .
We have lost our rights in leading a personal life and have to live in  constant fear that our every movement is being monitored .
Furthermore , unethical companies could easily obtain our personal information through social network and use it to manipulate us .
When we lose our privacy , we become vulnerable psychologically and easily manipulated by others .
Therefore , it is ethically wrong to invade other people's privacy and there is a need to ban surveillance technology to protect our own rights .
Lastly , surveillance technology such as implantable radiofrequency identification technology (RFID) brings about potential health hazards .
Today , the use of RFID offers important health benefits such as convenient access to patient's contact information and medical history .
However , it has also been testified that RFID brings about other health complications such as infections , especially in elderly and weak individuals .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned as it may do more harm than benefits .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it is not only ethically wrong but also poses threat to our security and health instead of protecting us .
Genetic testing has been in  forefront science research area in this 21st century .
With this unparallel knowledge of truth , came the issues of an individual's ethical rights on whether the person should have the final say in revealing his own results .
Society that include doctors and family members need to know the truth .
An individual should not have the final say in revealing his genetic testing result .
Three important points can be raised to support this stand .
Firstly , it is an ethical issue .
"It is widely recognised that one of their roles is to inform  may be at risk and patients are encouraged to discuss this risk with their relatives" (Forrest , 2000) .
If they decide to keep mute about it , it may cause harm to others .
Early detection of cancer will not only keep it under control but also keep  loved ones safe .
Family planning with genetic testing can help married couples to prepare themselves mentally and emotionally if the probability of them having a genetic defective child is high .
Secondly , it is a political issue .
People have grown fearful of genetic testing due to the negative results for life insurances .
The government has to intervene by implementing policies that will help to prevent discrimination .
It is important to  the public to change their mindsets towards genetic discrimination .
Joly , Knoppers , and Godard (2003) found that  Thirdly , it is from the psychological point of view .
Individuals will tend to keep the results from their family as they are afraid that they might be a burden and will cause tensions within the family but understanding the situation will give them better emotional support .
"Don't bottle things up .
Try to talk to someone close to you .
It helps to have a good cry and talk things through"  , 2009) .
In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say in revealing their genetic test results for the benefit of the people around them .
With the revelation of the results , trust can be generated and relationship between them and their loved ones will become closer .
Surveillance technology has advanced rapidly , and it has dominated our lives .
This has brought about many debates on the ethical , security and health issues surrounding the use of surveillance technology .
While some suggest that the use of this technology brings benefits to both the country and the world , it in fact not only affects the country's safety but also the citizens' privacy in the country .
Thus , due to the negative implications that outweigh the benefits of using surveillance technology , it should be banned .
There are three factors that arise from the use of surveillance technology .
Firstly , surveillance technology dehumainzes citizens' basic right to privacy .
Under this technology , citizens are being watched .
This results in the loss of personal space and people live in fear as they tend to be very cautious in their every movements .
An article said that in US , "there is evidence that President Bush's executive order authorizing eavesdropping on phone conversations of U .S . citizens , monitoring email and gaining access to private computers while failing to follow the law requiring court- ordered warrants may amount to criminal activity ."
(Flocco , 2005) .
US citizens involved in the process have to be very careful with their daily lifestyles .
, In Britain , there are 4 .2 million CCTV cameras on the streets , about one for every 14 citizens ( ,2006) .
This is ethically wrong as , in general , humans have their basic right to privacy .
Too much intrusion of privacy could also lead to  psychological factors of one's mental status .
Hence , surveillance technology should be banned because it is ethically wrong to invade other people's privacy and it is an obligation to respect other people's privacy .
Secondly , it lowers the level of security of a country when terrorists are able to hack into their system and take control of the country's well-being .
As we know it today , the use of surveillance technology is globally used as a mass communication .
It is also  used as a safety to watch over one's power grid just like what US is doing now .
"According to officials , cyberspies from China and Russia have hacked into the US electricity grid and hidden software that could be used to disrupt power supplies ."
( , 2009) .
This imposes a high risk to the US in a time of war or even crisis due to the disruption of network by these cyberspies .
Thus , it is ironically contradicting the purpose of having a surveillance technology to secure us which in fact is back-fired .
Finally , critics have argued that by implanting a biochip (eg .
Radio Frequency Identification , RFID) into a dementia person , it eases the hospital authority to locate the  patient's whereabouts .
However , there is often a health issue that is involved in this implantation which causes complications to patients' health .
In late 2007 , an anti-chip activist  an important point that for more than one decade it has been known that implanted RFID tags are associated with tumors in rodents , mostly sarcomas (Blanchard et al .
1999; Elcock et al .
2001; Tillmann et al .
1997) .
This causes a controversy about possible carcinogenic effects; a substance or agent that tends to produce cancer () , that may occur in the implantation of chips on humans .
Thus , this affects patients by adding a new disease to them when they are already ill .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology should be banned as it brings negative implications not only to the citizens but also the world and thus poses a high risk of insecurity to the world .
Surveillance dated back all the way to ancient times .
In the past there was no real technological advancement , hence Surveillance limited to mainly watching over live stocks and prisoners .
As the world advances so does technology .
surveillance nowadays covers a wide spectrum of life from the wellbeing of a child left alone in the room to national security to prevent events such as terrorism and political instability .
As there is always a consent threat to the equilibrium of peace , surveillance technology has played a huge part in society to help enforce law and order and should not be banned .
Due to the broad spectrum of various surveillances technology  , I would address only a few that is of  .
Namely national security and disaster security .
National security as the name  , means security measures taken by the various governments to ensure that its country is a safe place for its citizens .
Some of the devices that have been set up and used are for example biometric passports .
It allows the immigration officers to have an idea of the background of the tourist or citizen that is entering the country .
This helps in preventing terrorism as appropriate measures can be taken to stop terrorists from entering the country .
In 2001 , the capture of terrorist members prevented a bomb explosion at Yishun train station in Singapore .
Critics may cite the flaws of the system in the case of Mas Selmat a member of the regional Islamic group called the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) , who successfully escaped to Malaysia .
This however does not mean that the system of surveillance should be  .
This is where flaws of the systems are examined to come up with a more fool-proof system where such a terrorist cannot make use of the loop holes of the system to escape .
Pandemics and epidemics have been prevalent since  ancient times like in the 18th century where small pox caused massive deaths .
Today with the recent spread of SARS , H1N5 (bird flu) and the latest H1N1 (swine flu) , having surveillance technology helps us to  battle these disasters .
In 2003 when SARS spread causing thousands of deaths all across the world , the temperature radiation surveillance technology was invented to help identity those possible infected people from those who were not , and to separate those who are likely to be infected from the healthy population .
home tracking devices  implemented especially for those who were quarantined for the 10 days duration to ensure that they did not break the rules and venture out of their homes into the community .
Critics of tracking devices have lobbied for tracking devices to be banned as they have  been said to invade privacy .
However in this  , although the tracking device ia an invasion to a person's privacy , it serves a good cause to ensure the safety of the general population . 
Over the years , genetic testing has become more available to the public .
An individual can request and afford to undergo genetic testing to find out whether or not his body houses a defective gene .
When the results of the test are given to the individual , the question of whether the results should be revealed or not arises .
Although the individual may feel that he should have the final say on the revelation of the results , in fact , having the physicians decide whether the results should be revealed would be much more beneficial to the society and the individual himself .
Therefore , the individual should not have the final say on whether the results of such testing should be revealed .
Firstly , the physician is in a better position to decide if the results should be revealed .
This is due to the physician being more knowledgeable about the results , especially if a defective gene is detected in the individual .
The individual is unlikely to reveal their results to their family , potential and current employers , insurance companies for fear of discrimination from them ( 2007) .
However , by doing so , he is actually putting his family at risk as they will not know whether they too carry the defective gene which would put them at a higher risk of developing the disease associated with the gene () .
Furthermore , the physician would not be able to determine if the defective gene is hereditary and whether the other family members have that gene or not .
Secondly , for his own reasons , such as family disputes , the individual may choose not to act responsibly and withhold the results from family members .
In such cases , the physician would have the right to reveal the results to the family of the individual , especially if the test results indicate that the defective gene is present , there is the possibility that others in the family have the gene as well .
Also , with regards to the problem of discrimination , which is the underlying factor for the individual not wanting to reveal the results , there are laws in place in many countries that states that it is against the law to discriminate against people who have tested positive for a particular defective gene .
The physicians also have their medical code of conduct that states information about the patient which is confidential unless it poses threat to others ( 2008) .
Genetic testing has made possible the determination of genetic diseases .
However , the release of genetic testing results has brought about a controversy .
If family members havesimilar   genetic background , individuals may feel the need to disclose their results .
However , being likely to face discrimination from society , individuals should also have the choice to conceal the information from others .
This freedom of choice provides respect for their basic human rights .
Thus , individual consent should be obtained before the release of genetic testing results .
Firstly , the disclosure of a positive test result for a certain genetic disease may cause an individual to be susceptible to discrimination .
He may be treated less favourably than others due to his genetic disability .
For example , employers may prefer to employ individuals who are not predisposed to genetic diseases  , 2005) .
Health insurance companies may also avoid clients with genetic disorders ( , 2005) .
Thus , the discriminatory treatment an individual may be subjected to makes it essential that their consent be obtained in advance .
It may be argued that the legalization of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) may solve the problem of discrimination ( 2008) .
However , limitations in this policy may still subject individuals to discrimination due to the exclusion of those applying for life insurance , disability insurance or military benefits  , 2008) .
Thus , the ability of GINA to solve the problem of discrimination may be limited .
The failure to gain an individual's approval to release the results denies him of his basic human rights , which is "the right to determine for oneself how and to what extent information about oneself is communicated to others ."
( .
By releasing the results without an individual's consent will subject the individual to a violation of his human rights .
Thus , it is important that each individual's approval is obtained before any circulation of the genetic testing results .
As a type of surveillance technology , RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is drawing increased attention and has caused many conflicts with regard to privacy , security and health issues .
Advocators suggest that using RFID to conduct social control and tracking of suspects could benefit the whole society .
However , RFID in fact is not as ideal as they thought .
On the contrary , it not only leads to an invasion of privacy and identity theft but also poses health risks .
Hence , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
Using RFID to track people raises many issues .
Firstly , the abuse of RFID invades privacy .
It is hard to guarantee that every tracking is innocent and conducted in proper ways and .
For example , overzealous employers and criminally intent people could take advantage of the RFID readers to track employees and victims' movement (Jean 2007) .
In this case , victims may lose their privacy even without awareness .
Secondly , because a RFID embedded card can easily   be skimmed and cloned , to some extent , it is a loophole for identity theft .
by using the cloned card , anyone could pass into a restricted area through the secure and locked entrance (Jones 2008) .
Hence , using a RFID equipped card to track and control entrance is not secure and effective at all .
Thirdly , implantable RFID chips have connections with health issues .
Research showed that "implanted RFID chips caused cancer in mice and rats and may cause cancer in cats , dogs , and humans" (Jean 2007) .
Additionally , "although an RFID chip in particular may not cause cancer , the inflammation caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object can increase the instance of tumor development" (Jean 2007) .
sacrificing the health of people when conducting tracking is therefore unacceptable
However , RFID advocators may argue for the purpose of alleviating the fear of privacy invasion .
For instance , the reader needs to be within about ten feet of the chip in order to extract data , so it may not handle long-range tracking (Jean 2007) .
However , it is still highly undetectable if the reader is installed inside doors or walls .
Furthermore , within such distance , RFID readers could still function (Jean 2007) .
Hence , people are still under the risk of being tracked and losing privacy without knowledge .
Genetic testing is a test whereby the individual is tested for any deficiency in the genes that could indicate the presence of future diseases .
But once the result is out and the person has some defective genes , different issues starts to surface .
The person might be subjugated to discrimination and not even the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) would be able to solve the problem .
Furthermore , the individual has the right to decide on whether the result should be disclosed or not .
Hence , I strongly agree that the person should have the final say on whether to reveal the genetic testing result so as to avoid these problems .
Firstly , the person would face discrimination by society if the results are declared openly without his consent The person would be unable to purchase insurance since they would cost the insurance company more money than the company had bargained for (Henry T .  2005 , ) Moreover , employers would not want to hire them as the employee's health problem would have an undesirable effect on the company's productivity , such as , costing the company more money on the employees' frequent sick leaves and medical reimbursements (Henry T . 2005) .
In addition , the person will be ostracized by the community due to the community lacking the knowledge of genetic diseases (WHO , 2009)
Secondly , critics at the other end of the table may argue that there is the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) in the US that was passed down by the former US president , Mr . Bush on 21 May 2008 which states that 'the genetic carriers would be protect against discrimination when it comes to work and health insurance' (Kaiser Family Foundation , 2008) .
However , these laws generally fail to offer comprehensive protection to all people at risk for genetic discrimination .
Tera Eerkes , founder of personal genetic testing company  states that 'this measure does not prevent genetic discrimination against people when they are applying for life insurance , or long term care and disability insurance' .
Moreover , the insurance companies will be forced to hike up the cost of their premiums and might result in healthy individuals being quoted the same rate as the genetic risk group (David , L .V .
2008 , ) .
Thirdly , the individual should not be denied of his rights in the decision on whether the result should be disclosed or not , or else , problems might occur .
The European Convention on Human Rights states that "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence ."
(Patrick , N . ,1993) .
If an individual is denied of his right to decide on the disclosure of his test result , probably no one will dare go for testing since they know that they do not possess the right to decide whether the result stays secret .
This will result in dire consequences , for example; there will not be proper family planning since genetic disorder is not taken into consideration , which might result in continued breeding of undesirable genetic traits in one's offspring .
In conclusion , the person who went for genetic testing should have the final say on whether to reveal the genetic testing result so that he will not be discriminated against or even denied of his basic human rights .
Recently , Radio Frequency Identification technology , also known as "RFID" has been a hot topic for discussion .
In the past , it was used to track equipmentequipment and data and this did not create much controversy with regard to the issue of privacy .
However , as technology improved RFID is now more frequently used to track people .
While some argue that the use of RFID to track people is unfavourable , it in fact not only ensures one's security and safety but also saves time and cuts cost for an industry .
Thus , due to the immense benefits of RFID , it should not be banned .
There are two important benefits of RFID .
Firstly , RFID is used in hospitals to keep a close watch on people for their own safety .
(Getz , 2009) .
This reduces the need to hire full-time nurses to accompany the Alzheimer's patients wherever they go .
When these patients wander around and get lost in an unfamiliar place , we are able to track their whereabouts and know where they are immediately .
Secondly , RFID is used to monitor employees' movements .
(Getz , 2009) .
This is especially useful in hospitals during emergency to track the whereabouts of doctors .
In life and death situation , doctors that are in the vicinity of the operation theatre can be called in for help instantly , hence saving time .
Arguments put forth to ban RFID are faulty .
For instance , it has been argued that the excessive use of RFID tags result in deterioration of personal privacy .
(Ward , 2006) .
However , for the group of people who requires constant attention , safety outweighs privacy issues .
Furthermore , RFID tags can be snapped in half to prevent the transmission of data when it is no longer in use .
Thus , this will not threaten individual's privacy .
Finally , there has been greater concern about RFID not only tracking the data of the patient , but also tracking the patient's actual whereabouts .
(Getz , 2009) .
On the contrary , this is a minor issue as only those with access to hospital's database can interpret the information .
Otherwise , this information is purposeless .
Advances in technology have made mass surveillance possible , even to track humans .
However , this has stirred up much controversy due to the privacy , security and health issues surrounding its use .
Supporters claim that surveillance technology can increase efficiency and effectiveness in tracking criminals and potential terrorists , and decreasing crime rates or track runaway or Alzheimer patients in hospitals to provide better care for every patient (Jean , 2007) .
In fact , it causes more security than health threats thus using it to track people should be banned to ensure their safety .
Threats discussed here would be with reference to Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) .
The main argument to support the banning is the risk of identity theft .
RFID tags and cards can be easily hacked and cloned and used immediately to get past what we presumed to be secured (Jones , 2008) .
If one had their pocket picked , he would know and can take measures to prevent it .
However , if one's personal information had been stolen without one's knowledge , one is completely vulnerable .
It is against the law to steal another persons identification card but not the information by "skimming" (Jones , 2008) .
The problem is worsened by the fact that these RFID tags and cards carry unlimited information and there are no regulations to include these virtual crimes .
RFID has enabled potential criminals to commit crimes more easily than ever with technology that is so readily available and surprisingly inexpensive .
The rapid advances in medical technology present genetic testing that is used , to identify specific genes responsible for a significant disease in an individual (Centre for Genetic Education , n .d .) .
The perception of whether an individual should have the final say to reveal the results of genetic tests has lead to an ethical dilemma in  society and amongst individuals , particularly in family-relationships .
Since , the advantages of revealing the results of genetic tests outweigh the disadvantages in most situations ,  an individual should therefore not have the absolute authority to reveal their test results .
There are two main benefits of not having the absolute authority to revealing the results of genetic tests .
Firstly , physicians are able to carry out studies on the gene occurrence in the family , by using the samples of family members .
This would benefit both the individuals and the relatives on their own health and well-being .
It also provides understanding of specific gene occurrences to others (Centre for Genetic Education , n .d .) .
Secondly , the awareness of deleterious genes in individuals that could lead to disease , like HIV , ensures their responsibility within the community .
The organization involved in genetic care has the authority to disclose the genetic information to appropriate people if harmful genes could lead to serious disease .
If an infected individual does not  reveal it then  little effort is made for diagnosis and treatments (Minkoff and Ecker , 2008) .
This would cause harm to others , like the spread of HIV to the uninfected sexual partner and the future generations .
In addition , moral support from sexual partner would be a key determinant factor in motivating infected individuals to seek help .
Radio-frequency identification , more often known as RFID in short , is one of the most pervasive technologies developed since the late 1940s .
Today , enterprises found the use of RFID chips in a wide variety of places including hospital , transportation system , corporations , schools , and worryingly , human beings (Andrea Jean , 2007) .
In this paper , I would like to discuss some problems in the use of RFID chip on human beings .
Human implant is experimented and studied deeply in many countries .
However , this has  proved to have huge problems unfortunately .
Volunteers participated in a controlled experiment on skimming  proved that a hacker is able to skim and clone an access card in a split second and using the card to get entrance to a "secure and locked" entrance (Jones , 2008) .
This absurd result brings into question  the security use of the human implant .
One area which benefits greatly from RFID technology is the health sector .
Firstly , due to RFID , the safety and security of the patients are ensured .
RFID is used to track patients' locations in order to make sure they are safe .
This is especially true for elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease .
Patients suffering from Alzheimer's have the tendency to wander .
Hence , RFID will be able to lookout for these patients and ensure they do not go missing , making them safe (Getz , 2009) .
Also , RFID technology can prevent newborns from being kidnapped .
With RFID , the locations of newborns can be monitored .
Thus , if there are to be unauthorized movements , immediate action can be taken (Getz , 2009) .
With the newborns' safety being ensured , their parents will not have to worry constantly when they are not able to take care of their infants around the clock .
Thus , RFID technology is able to protect the patients and ensure a safe and secure environment in hospitals .
The completion of Human Genome Project has contributed significantly to the rapid development of genetic tests , a valuable tool that aids in diagnosis and prevention of genetic diseases .
However , due to the nature of the information generated , there have been many debates over who should hold the final decisions to the disclosure of genetic test results .
While some propose that giving individuals the authority to decide curbs arising ethical implications like discrimination , this in fact stops physicians from preventing illnesses and saving more lives .
Thus , the final decision should not be made by the individuals tested .
An important reason why patients should not be empowered to make the final decision is that it prevents doctors from tending to potential patients who could be at high risk of developing a disease if disclosure is not made .
Due to the need to maintain confidentiality of results , doctors will be compelled to watch patients with the defective gene fall ill when appropriate intervention can be done to avert  harm .
This  has gone against their 'proper medical and ethical practices' (Minkoff & Ecker , 2008) of preventing harm or avoiding serious jeopardisation of the health of others ) .
Considering  these competing obligations faced by physicians , the genetic care and counselling organisations have devised guidelines which accept disclosure to relatives without the consent of those tested when there is going to be a high degree and immediacy of risk faced by them (Minkoff & Ecker , 2008) .
In the event in which the patient tests positive for a particular terminal illness , and refuses to receive the results , should the physician then respect his/her wishes although it violates the physician's ethics of putting patient's safety first ?
[2] Physicians trained to deal with the emotional burdens of a positive test result , are capable of properly counselling the patient of the implications of not knowing the test result and also providing the needed medical treatment for the long run .
[1] As the medical professionals would know what medical treatment the patient would need , and also understand the encumbrance such knowledge would bring , it is best that the medical professionals decide whether or not to reveal the test results .
Technology has made our life so convenient that we have overlooked the {repercussions that comes with it .
An example would be the use of surveillance in this case radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in our everyday life without considering the health risks , consumer privacy rights and also its vulnerability to information thefts .
With that the usage of RFID should be banned so as to safeguard the general public .
Firstly the health issue poses a big threat to the usage of RFID as these chips are used in close vicinity to our body .
Patients who wish to keep their medical information might choose to have the chip implanted right under their skin .
The safety of using these chips is still uncertain even its exact position as the chips "(could) migrate under the skin and become difficult to extract" (Bacheldor 2007) .
Another concerning issue is that the "RFID tags may electromagnetically interfere with electrosurgical devices" (Bacheldor 2007) with particular attention at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans .
Instead of aiding the patients to recuperate , the tags might in turn cause further deterioration to the patient's health .
Secondly , consumers might be ignorant to the fact that the products they purchased could be tagged so as to provide companies with the sales data and for market research .
Customers could also be tracked with the products anywhere so long as there is a right reader that could read the frequency (Free 2007) Consumer privacy will no longer be existent as consumers lose freedom of choice and also consistently losing personal information to marketeers .
Lastly as another information-carrying device , the RFID is also vulnerable to cyber criminals out to steal information about the users .
The attempts on hacking and spoofing the RFID tags had already been successful and so long as the frequency is replicated , the hacker would have access to the functions the RFID tag was made for (Halamka , Juels , Stubblefeild and Westhues 2006) .
The user might lose his password for access to areas or monetary items and also his identity .
The possibility that the RFID technology would prove to be more of a hindrance than a convenience is evident .
Therefore it should be banned in order to protect us from such vulnerabilities that the RFID would cause ,
Surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) makes use of technical means to track individuals .
This has brought about many controversial issues regarding the privacy and health concerns surrounding the use of RFID .
While some argue that the adoption of RFID is a violation of human privacy , it  indeed helps to protect the safety of families  ,the public and to identify patients .
Hence , the use of RFID should not be banned due to the uses it brings about .
There are three important uses of RFID in tracking people .
Firstly , RFID protects the safety of loved ones by tracking the movements of kin in cases when they got lost or were kidnapped .
With the help of A RFID tag worn by senile elderly ,  the police can identify the missing elderly and then contact their family members .
In addition , RFID tags help to  assist the police to locate the hostage and kidnappers .
Secondly , RFID ensures the safety of the public by monitoring suspicious people who might pose a danger to  society so as to prevent them from causing harm to the public .
RFID is useful in combating crime .
Thirdly , RDIF improves the speed of patient identification in hospitals .
Upon admission to hospital , each patient is given a RFID wristband which reveals the patient name , patient identification number and patient medication record (Antonio , n .d .) .
This is to prevent misidentification of patients from happening .
Admittedly , the use of RFID presents some privacy and health issues .
Nevertheless , the current legislation is sufficient to deal with the development of RFID so as to prevent user privacy from being invaded .
For instance , the setting up of RFID Security Alliance (RFIDSA) provides assistance in RFID privacy issues .
Furthermore , the RFID tag does not bring health problems to  users .
An example is European council proposal on the limitation of the exposure of electromagnetic fields to the public (Council , 1999) .
In conclusion , the use of RFID should not be totally banned but it could be restricted in some cases .
RFID serves as a tracking device and an identification system in safeguarding the safety of loved ones  , the public and for identifying patients .
Human genetics has made tremendous leaps over the past years , and consequently made a significant impact on many people's lives .
As such , the growth of genetic testing technology has initiated considerable debate over the privacy and confidentiality of genetic information .
In any case , it can be advocated that the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing or not .
This is due to the legislation polices that have been implemented for genetic testing 
Firstly , genetic information is not like any other medical information .
Basically , it is far more confidential as it may contain more  individual personal health issues  such as determining whether one carries any defective genes .
Hence , it is rightful to say that genetic information should be kept confidential and should only be revealed by the individual .
In accordance with federal law inthe United States  ,  medical information should be kept confidential and genetic professionals or doctors do not have the right to disclose any information without seeking the consent of the patient .
Though , they may assist  patients by informing them of the likelihood of their relatives contracting the same diseases , the final decision ultimately still depends on the individual .
On the other hand , critics may argue that genetic professionals can interpret the genetic testing results more accurately than  patients .
Thus , they can explain the implications of the results more precisely to  family members .
However , only  patients will understand their family members' different behavioural patterns .
This means that they are more suited to revealing the results by using a more desirable method .
As a result , they may help reduce the psychological stress on family members .
In conclusion , the decision of whether revealing the results of genetic testing should lie only with the individual and not other third parties involved .
Any disclosure of results by third parties will be considered a breach of the genetic privacy and confidentiality law and may cause unnecessary moral implications .
Genetic testing is generally used to test for any diseases that arise due to gene mutation .
Genetic testing has become more ubiquitous in recent years .
Issues that revolve around genetic testing are no longer limited to whether the individual should go for a genetic test but include the concerns of privacy and confidentiality .
I advocate the idea that  patients should have the final say to decide whether to disclose the test results to relatives and families .
First , the law and human rights declaration recognizes the right to privacy of  individuals .
A law , under any circumstances , is justified and objective .
The law , by no means , states that moral implications have to be considered by the individual .
In serious cases of diseases which are infectious , even though the doctor thinks that the family has a right to be informed of the risk , he cannot breach the confidentiality agreement between him and the patient .
Under the European Convention , article eight states clearly that "everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life ."
(Abrumsky ,L . , Berry , C . , Carltan ,L . , Chandler ,J . , Dimaricius ,J . , Ennals ,P .
et al . , 2009) Unless there is mutual agreement on both sides , the final say should lie with the patients .
Secondly , the final say should lie with the patient as he knows what is best for his family members .
The patients knows the different behavioral patterns of his family members and will know the best way to approach them regarding their genetic condition .
He can also decide not to tell his family members if he thinks that they might not be able to cope with the news emotionally .
In this way , the family members of the patient are protected from  emotional harm like stress and anxiety .
A doctor cannot determine how the family members will react to the news and hence should not have the final say in the disclosure of genetic test results .
In conclusion , the final say in the disclosure of genetic test results should lie with the patient according to the legal jurisdiction and to the fact that the patients understand the different personalities of their families and will have their best interests in mind .
The advancement of Science and Technology has lead to many possibilities , one of which is the ability to predict one's risk of contracting certain diseases , mostly hereditary , via the study of one's genes .
Called genetics testing , the test results , though not definitive , are highly accurate .
Hence this predictive power leads to one of the many controversies- should an individual have the final say in whether to reveal his/her results ?
Because the results could potentially be used to save lives , yet at the same time be misused , the individual requesting the test should not have the final say .
In fact , this authority should go to  medical professionals; basically physicians undertaking the proceedings of the test and  interacting with the patients firsthand .
Firstly , a physician is a profession that is bound by standard protocols and most importantly  physicians possess medical ethics .
As the genetics results also apply to the family and relatives' health risks as well as the patient's own , many lives are concerned and any unjustifiable reason not to disclose should be overwritten .
The American Society of Human Genetics even propose conditions whereby patient autonomy should be disregarded (Bioethics Advisory Committee ,2005) , emphasizing the importance of disclosure of results .
Secondly , there are laws such as the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ({HIPAA}[HYPERLINK: http://www .hhs .gov/ocr/hipaa/]) (Norrgand , 2008) , which protect the confidentiality and interests of the patient .
These are laws that  physicians adhere to , which the patient may be unfamiliar with and overlook , despite pre- test counselling .
Thirdly ,  society benefits when sound decisions are made by pragmatic , rather than individualistic , individuals .
Patients can make informed decisions and adopt healthy practices when they face the harsh truth of the results; something the patient may not anticipate at first hence must be brought to picture by the physician (Lee , 2005) .
The opposition may state that leaving the decision to a third party who may be insensitive ,may jeopardize the patient's chances in employment and insurance .
However , there are laws in place (Norrgand , 2008) that will prevent such occurrences .
Moreover , physicians still respect patient autonomy unless certain conditions permit otherwise .
It has also been suggested that the harsh truth of inheriting a genetic risk may create an emotional impact , especially when disclosed despite the patient's reluctance .
However , the physician is present to provide advice and post-test counselling .
Moreover , the mental preparedness of the patient is most likely moulded on the pre-test counselling before genetic testing is carried(Lee , 2005) .
In conclusion , physicians should have the final say in whether to reveal the genetic testing results as they have the know-how on managing the entire situation before and after the patient is subjected to the test .
Genetic testing is an issue that mankind has placed great emphasis on .
After test results are analyzed by physicians , there is a dilema about whether the information should be made known to others or whether itshould be kept confidential by the individual .
Despite the fact that human rights exist ,  physicians actually have a clearer understanding of the results and the ethical and social issues that surface by withholding such information .
Hence , the proposition that genetic test results be made known to others by the medical professionals should hold .
Firstly , genetic testing has led to the ethics of medical professionals being questionable .
There are instances when a patient tested positive for a disease , but refused to know their results (BAC , 2005) .
I must admit that the rights to privacy should hold .
Nevertheless , by not sharing this critical information , it creates more problems for themselves .
This is clearly true as test results indirectly reflect genetic information related to family members as there is a possibility of them inheriting the disease too .
In such a situation , the authority to release the resultst should lie with the healthcare professionals .
Secondly , genetic testing has also been deemed as a social issue .
It has been speculated that discrimination occurs during employment and the application of health insurance when genetic information lands in the hands of  employers and insurance companies (Lee , 2005) .
However , they fail to realise that there have been laws legislated to prevent discrimination of such forms (Lee , 2005) .
As a result , the employers and insurance companies should have the right to request genetic information from their employees or clients directly , or indirectly from medical professionals who have a better interpretation of the genetic test results .
In conclusion , although on the surface there seems to be disturbing issues in sharing genetic information ,  when observed in depth , the information  shared can be  an advantage to the individual as well as those around him .
Eventually , the stand that test results should be made known to others by the medical professionals should hold .
The use of the technology such as radio frequency identification (RFID) in tracking people has been heatedly discussed recently due to privacy and security concerns .
Nevertheless , these concerns are outweighed by its pros due to the benefits it brings in ensuring the loved ones , the public as well as identifying patients .
Hence , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people .
Firstly , RFID can ensure the safety of loved ones .
In the case of kidnapping , those who had RFID implanted can be easily located by RFID readers .
For elders who suffer from memory loss , RFID can provides their identities once they are found lost their way home .
Secondly , RFID can ensure the safety of public .
By implanting RFID tags on prisoners , their movements can be monitored and their location can be easily spotted should they escape .
It can also be used on ex-convicts to track their movements and prevent them from committing crimes again .
Thirdly , RFID helps to identify patients .
A RFID tag which contains patients' complete medical history can be implanted to enable treatments by doctors according to their conditions .
Furthermore , RFID tags help to prevent wrong prescription of medicine and any delay treatments which will endanger the lives of patients (Antonio , Putten & Gerald) .
Medical advances in technology have made it possible to detect if one has a genetic disease through genetic testing .
Genetic testing can be defined as the analyzing of one's DNA to detect the possible risks of contracting a genetic disease .
This has brought about a lot of debate on the ethical and law issues on whether the individual has the final say in revealing the genetic testing results .
Due to privacy and the effects of emotional stress , the individual should have the final say .
Secondly , there will be emotional stress experienced by relatives , if results are revealed unnecessarily .
For example , letting parents know about the genetic risks may cause them to have a guilty conscience , they may feel responsible for passing a genetic mutation on to their child .
However , there is a common misconception that being tested positive means that they will definitely get sick(Varga ,2008) .
This is not necessarily going to happen as many other factors are needed to occur as well , like non-genetic risks such as smoking(Varga ,2008)  .
Therefore , revealing  results could be redundant if relatives do not have non-genetic risks , and furthermore it could create undesirable emotional stress for the relative .
So , the individual should first observe  any signs of symptoms of the genetic disease the relative may have , such as deformity or behavior problems , before deciding whether or not to tell .
In this case , third parties such as doctors should not reveal the results , as doctors are usually more concerned with alerting the person of the possible chances of contracting the genetic disease , rather than the possible negative impacts this news may bring to the person .
In conclusion , due to the law issues and  possible undesirable emotional stress caused by relatives , the individuals should have the final say in revealing the results , as it is their personal information , and  they understand their relatives better emotionally .
Tracking of an individual's  movement using RFID technology is made possible when it is used in a combination with Global Positioning System technology , as proposed by RFID vendors .
A person's movements can be tracked if the RFID tag is associated with a person .
The RFID tag could be  in an article of clothing or under the skin in some part of the body and it could also serve as an identifier for the person wearing it .
RFID should not be banned as it brings many benefits to our lives .
There are many advantages to using RFID technology to track people's movement .
Firstly , companies/family members could leverage   RFID technology to locate their loved ones/employees if they were missing or working in a dangerous environment .
(Jerry , David , Manuel & Thompson , 2007 p .469) Secondly , in hospital , a positive patient identification system using radio frequency identification , RFID , to identify patients can led to fewer patient misidentifications .
Patient misidentification has been the leading cause of medical errors and medical malpractice , posing a serious risk to patient safety .
(Antonio , Putten & Gerald , n .d) Thirdly , monitoring of RFID tagged convicts in prison can prevent possible prison breaks .
In addition , using RFID to tag offenders that are serving their term in the community can help to enforce  home curfews . 
It is often argued that the implantation of RFID is a violation of privacy .
However in  cases like working in a dangerous environment , safely is prioritized over privacy violation .
Furthermore , the tags can be deactivated to prevent tracking if there's a need .
There are also worries over leaked confidential information through RFID tags .
However , the tags can be encrypted and cleared of information before being discarded .
Finally , there are health concerns over exposure to electromagnetic fields , EMF , from the usage of RFID .
But guidelines of recommended limits of EMF exposure have been adopted internationally to prevent any known negative health effects .
(The Council of the European Union , 1999)
In conclusion , tracking  people's movement using RFID technology should not be banned as its benefits heavily outweigh the downsides it might bring .
Advancements in technology have allowed the invention of new devices that have helped improve lifestyles and  helped bring  convenience into our lives .
Surveillance technology such as the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one example .
It has made tracking people a simpler task .
Hence , it should not be banned due its benefits .
RFID is an essential tool used for tracking  people .
It can be used in various situations .
In hospitals , RFIDs serve as a means for tracking  patients as well as indentifying them .
Instead of having to go through long procedures , one's personal details , medical histories and other information can be obtained through the use of RFIDs .
This reduces time taken to track down these details and hence makes procedures simpler .
It also allows for the tracking of patients when they are lost .
This is especially the case for elderly people suffering from illnesses such as dementia who tend to lose their way .
Hospital staff and family members can thus easily track down the locations of their loved ones with the use of the RFID ({http://www .antonio-aguilar .com/files/papers/hisi_paper .pdf}[HYPERLINK: http://www .antonio-aguilar .com/files/papers/hisi_paper .pdf] , 2009) .
RFIDs are also used in monitoring crimes and in keeping our society safe .
Through the use of RFIDs , escaped convicts can be easily traced .
Locations of ex-convicts can also be known so as to track their daily activities .
It also makes things easier for the police and government agencies to locate them should they engage in a crime .
Hence safety of  society is ensured .
Alternatively , RFIDs are a beneficial tool for convicts as it gives them a chance of entering society again .
This is because the police would be able to track the locations of the convicts and hence would be more willing to allow these convicts out of prison and into society .
(Banks , Hanny , Pachano & Thompson , 2007)
However , there are also downsides to the use of RFIDs .
The main issues concern privacy and health .
The use of such a tracking device would mean that the locations and actions of the person will always be known .
Hence the person might feel that he is always being watched and would not have the freedom to do whatever he wants .
Health is also a concern as the implants of RFID into the body might lead to complications and hence cause health problems .
Nonetheless , these problems can be solved with advancing technology .
Data protection technology has already been put in place to ensure that privacy of individuals is not compromised(http://www .rfidconsultation .eu/ ,2009) .
Restrictions can also be made to prevent leakages .
With regards to health concerns , precautionary measures can be put in place to ensure the safety of the human implants .
Operations can be carried out with extra care to reduce the risk of complications .
In conclusion , RFIDs should not be banned as it can benefit society widely in many ways .
Despite the disadvantages it may pose , these can be offset by appropriate actions put in place .
Hence , society should not totally shun away from the use of RFID to track people but put in place measures to overcome the problems so as to ensure its optimal use .
Today , Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been used almost worldwide .
Many countries are developing this technology with positive anticipation of its useful applications and benefits .
However , the use of RFID in tracking people has brought about a lot ofcontroversy .
Nevertheless , the use of RFID technologies to track people is essential in today's society as it is effective in locating people .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track people should not be banned .
There are two important reasons why RFID technology to track people should not be banned .
Firstly , its use in hospitals is important as it reduces the chances of misidentification of patients (http://www .antonio- aguilar .com/files/papers/hisi_paper .pdf , 2009) .
Besides , there have been many cases of infections that spread rapidly among the human population .
Thus , it is a challenge for authorities and medical personal to keep track of infected patients .
However , with the use of RFID to track people , this challenge may be overcome as hospitals use a "specially developed Hospital Movement Tracking System (HTMS) to trace the movements of Health care workers , patients and hospital visitors" (Banks , Hanny , Pachano & Thompson , 2007 p .420) .
Secondly , the use of RFID to track people r the safety of workers who are working in hazardous working conditions .
In the event of an accident , rescue operators can locate workers who are RFID tagged and save them as soon as possible (Banks , Hanny , Pachano & Thompson , 2007 p .469) .
Moreover , RFID technologies are durable  and are able to withstand adverse conditions (Banks , Hanny , Pachano & Thompson , 2007 p .469) .
Thus , this can help reduce casualties and assist rescue work to proceed smoothly .
Arguments against the use of RFID to track people could be the long- term health implications to the human body (http://www .rfidconsultation .eu/ , 2009) .
However , the World Health Organization has found out that safe use of RFID will not have any adverse effects on human health health (http://www .rfidconsultation .eu/ , 2009) .
Moreover , others oppose this as it causes invasion of privacy due to leakage of personal information to the third part (Banks , Hanny , Pachano & Thompson , 2007 p .269) .
Nevertheless , there is data protection technology that is already in place to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessingsensitive information .
(http://www .rfidconsultation .eu/ , 2009)
In conclusion , we should not ban RFID technologies to track people as there are many benefits and because of its use as an effective measure to locate individuals during times of emergencies .
In recent years , the aging process has affected many countries as the life expectancy of people has increased .
This is due to countries becoming more affluent , and thus people  better living environment and are also more educated to be conscious of their health .
However , living longer also means the need to depend on others as aging will weaker a person physically and thus results in a person unable to contribute to the society .
In order to ease the aging process such that the elderly can live without being neglected and also in comfort , various policies have been implemented .
To a large extent , these have helped to ease the aging process through investing in healthcare for the elderly , giving financial aids to the elderly and also enhancing the psychological well being of the elderly .
Firstly , Governments are setting aside more funds for healthcare to meet the growing demand of the elderly .
In Singapore , $4 billion was committed over 5 years to expand the healthcare infrastructure which includes redevelopment of older hospitals and also building of 2 new hospitals(Government of Singapore , 2009) .
Healthcare professionals like nurses are also trained to be able to handle more complicated procedures as compared to the past (The straits times , 17 August 2009) .This provides quality healthcare for the elderly in a high standard of living environment .
It may be costly to implement these policies , but it is necessary as in future the aging population is projected to soar .
In Japan , it is expensive to create and own a nurse robot , but it is necessary as in future there will be lack of human resources to take care of the elderly(James Brooke , 5 March 2004) .
Such technology will allow the elderly to be self equipped to take care of themselves , which is vital in the current competitive society where their children will be overloaded with work to take care of them .
Secondly , the financial aids plan policy makers come up with  also manages to ease the aging process .
Governments help to reduce the burden of the elderly by subsidizing healthcare , giving financial aid and also forcing  people to save for retirement .
In Singapore , the elderly are entitled to a subsidy of 75 per cent of the fees charged at polyclinics and even free medical service for frail or disabled elderly(Government of Singapore , 2009) .
However , some may argue that the financial benefits may still be inadequate as the elderly may need long term medical treatment and take longer time to recover .
Also , the elderly may abuse the medical services when they are provided with financial aid .
Thus , to counter these problems there is also the Central Provident Fund (CPF) which consists of compulsory medical savings in Medisave , health insurance in MediShield and government aid in Medifund to make the people save for their own retirement(Government of Singapore , 2009) .
This will lighten the financial burden of the elderly , easing the aging process as they can retire with more security and less worry .
In addition , enhancing the psychological well being of the elderly can make aging less depressing and cultivates a pleasant lifestyle for the elderly , thus making the aging process more enjoyable .
There are policies like revising the retirement age from 65 to 67 in the United States (U .S . Social Security Administration , 1 April 2009) and also from 60 to 65 in Taiwan(The China Post news staff , 19 April 2008) .This allows older age group to continue to contribute to the economy and feel useful .
There are also retraining and upgrading programs , like the Senior Community Service Employment Program initiated by the United States Department of Labor (U .S . Department of Labor , Employment & Training Administration (ETA) , 13 Jan 2009) , to make them be as competent as the young people , making the elderly still feel young at heart .
These will have positive effects on the mental health of the elderly , easing the aging process .
Although it may be difficult to totally change the mindset of the elderly as aging will wear them out , these policies at least allow the elderly to not feel like a burden to the society .
Moreover , these policies will give the older aged group more choices for choosing the kind of lifestyles they want .
If they prefer a relaxing aging process , they can also engage in activities in the community centre which will also enhance their mental well being and ease the aging process .
However , Critics of this position point out that there are also policies that have not helped to ease the aging process .
This is particularly the case for policies that aim to increase birth rate .
By increasing birth rate , there will be more productive population who can generate income to support the future aging population .
For example , the baby bonus scheme in Singapore has been ineffective as the birth rate remains at 1 .28 .
The attractive financial incentives like giving cash gift of up to $4 ,000 each for the 1st and 2nd child and $6 ,000 each for  a 3rd and 4th child and also providing  of 4 months have not been enough to make people want to have more children .
This can be due to the lifestyle of Singaporeans like having long working hours and high standard of living; thus , they prefer not to have any children .
As long as the government considers solutions to these issues like encouraging working from home , the policy may be more effective .
If these policies were successful , they will definitely ease the aging process .
In conclusion , current policies have helped to ease the aging process in many different areas .
In the coming years , more countries will also be facing this problem and thus different types of  policies should be explored to prepare for the future .
That there should be a limit on public spending on the aged so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development (Peterson , 2001) is a suggestion that should be implemented in order to combat the rising cost of healthcare for the elderly .
With the rapid growth of the elderly population , for example in a country like Singapore , where the median age is expected to hit 41 years old from the present 36 (Wijaya , 2009) , increasing public spending in healthcare could further strain the government's expenditure as more money needs to be poured in to cater to the growing numbers of elderly in the country .
There are several factors that explain the need to limit public spending on elderly healthcare .
Government needs to focus the spending on more important sectors first like economic development before worrying about healthcare for the elderly .
As Friedland and Summer (2005) suggested , with more economic growth , the country will be able to have more choices and more resources to invest into the elderly healthcare sector .
This move will be beneficiary in the long run as it does not only ensure that the country is progressing economically , it is also securing a brighter future for the healthcare sector as more money could be spent on it  .
In contrast , if the government decides to cut back spending on economic development and rather channel it into the elderly healthcare sector , tougher choices like tax increase have to be made in the future if the economic development is unable to sustain the rise in healthcare spending .
For example , assume that the government has 100 dollars and it has 2 choices of either investing it for 2 times the return or spending it on healthcare .
Assume that the government decides to invest all of the 100 dollars at first and gets 200 dollars in return .
The government can now choose to allocate some money on healthcare , invest the remaining money and as time goes by , not only the government will be earning more profits but the healthcare will be getting a bigger allocation .
However , should the government decide to spend all of the 100 dollars into healthcare , there will be no profits and the government will also suffer from a deficit .
Secondly , public spending on elderly healthcare should only be limited to the elderly who really need it to prevent abuse by other citizens .
If no limits are set , other citizens can abuse the system by using it indiscriminately  , denying the rights of healthcare to truly needy patients .
An example could be seen in the United Kingdom  , where healthcare is fully subsidized by the government .
People would go to the doctor for even the smallest discomfort , causing doctors to waste time on non critical care and forsaking those that need immediate attention (Messerli , 2009) .
This may in turn cause a clogging up of cases where there will be more patients waiting longer for their operation  , reducing the quality of the healthcare sector (Press Association , 2005) .
Besides encouraging abuse , increased spending in healthcare for the elderly will also cause an increase in taxpayers' money to subsidize the cost , placing a heavier burden on the people .
This could probably cause a public outcry as the current economic crisis has yet to fully subside and the government should instead focus on recovering the country's economy first .
Public spending on the elderly should therefore be limited to those with chronic conditions or need immediate attention who cannot afford the cost of healthcare to avoid abuse and increase of taxpayers' money .
Finally , the responsibility of taking care  the elderly should first rest on the children , not the government , if the elderly has any working child .
Some might argue that it is the government's duty to look after the welfare of its citizens , but if the government were to look after all of the elderly without the help of the children , it would certainly cost the government an enormous amount of time and money .
The government needs to first concentrate on more important matters regarding the country  , for example in issues regarding national safety , trade , education , international relations and defense , to ensure that the nation's interests are safeguarded and that the government does act as a nursery home for the old .
Public spending on elderly healthcare must not be raised to compensate for the failure of children to look after their parents .
Children should be taught the importance of filial piety since young to ensure that they do not abandon  their responsibility of taking care of their parents when they are old .
The government could also enact a law to compel children to support their parents if the children are capable and the parents are in need .
An example would be the Maintenance of Parents Act in Singapore , where parents could lawfully demand support from their children in court .
In conclusion , there are many reasons  why  public spending on elderly healthcare should be limited to allow governments to channel the money to other areas of development .
While healthcare for the elderly is still important ,  governments must ensure that other important areas will not get neglected as well .
Ageing population is a serious problem faced by many developed states .
It is mainly caused by the increased number of elderly and the drop in birth rate .
The ageing population is creating many social problems such as healthcare problems , high government expenses and high income taxes , which are causing stress for  young workers and the aged people .
Many states such as the US , the UK , Japan and Singapore start to implement various policies such as increasing child birth rate and introducing plans for the elderly and health care policies to ease the ageing process .
However , most of these policies tend to be ineffective in easing the ageing process because they either have their limitations or fail to solve the social problems behind the ageing process .
This essay is going to examine the limitations and the problems ignored by those current policies .
Health care policies in many developed countries ease the ageing process to a very limited extent , because they create social burden and fail to service minorities most of the time .
For example , the UK has tried to make the nation a welfare state , but this leaves heavy tax burden to the working class and creates low working incentive for the workers .
It shows that medical policies must be planned well to provide health care to people who really need it .
For example , Japan has introduced medical service which allows its citizens to save for their personal medical account so that they can use the money when they fall sick in their old age .
Similarly , Singapore has introduced the same kind of policies called Medi-save and Medi-shield .
However , these policies cannot help those people who have long term diseases because these diseases require a huge amount of money to cure .
Ironically , the World Health Organization has released a report in year 2006 which shows that the number of people who have long term diseases such as heart disease and cancer is increasing sharply .
The data also shows that stressful working life contributes to the poor health of the people .
Moreover , the minorities who and do not have proper job or income do not have a medical care account will not be taken care of by the health service .
They will have nothing to rely on when they fall sick .
Therefore , the health care policy in most developed countries should be improved to help those patients with long term diseases and those who are neglected .
The baby bonus policy also has its limitation in easing the ageing process through increasing the birth rate to support the elderly .
Today ,  two leading states  in the areas of slowing down the ageing population , Japan and Singapore ,  have implemented "Baby Bonus Policy" .
Basically , families that give birth to more than one child will get economic support from the government as they help ease the the ageing process .
This is because  many elderly couples only have one child to support them and this always puts a heavy burden on the child .
Hence , with more children , more economic support could be provided and the old parents could be taken care of better .
However , the "Baby Bonus Policy" does not work well although almost everyone is aware of its benefit .
For example , Singapore's birth rate is 1 .28 , which is the lowest in the world .
This is because firstly , the stressful social environment  forces couples to put their time and effort in their work , so that they are unable to spend time with each other .
Secondly , getting more salary through longer working hours makes life much easier than appealing for limited economic aids by having many children .
Thus , the government fails to notice the two root causes of the evil .
Therefore , baby bonus policy could not increase the birth rate effectively in easing ageing process .
The modern society today is imbued with modern values that lead to the ageing population , thus causing  some government policies to become ineffective in easing the ageing process .
Many states have introduced housing policies , which allow the young couples to live near their parents or which give priority in purchasing houses to those people who have married .
This allows the couples to take care of each other especially when they are old , or to take care of their parents when they are still young .
However , the states fail to realize that people's values towards family are changing today .
The family bonding in most western societies is very weak and the young generation does not really have a sense of filial piety in their minds .
Also , the stressful working market created by capitalism today is taking away so much time and effort from people that they do not havetime with their family , or even cannot think of having a family .
It creates a modern value that allows people of opposite sex to live together without having a family .
So , what if people do not get married ?
What if the idea of family vanishes ?
What if the young no longer care about their parents ?
If all these assumptions occur , the housing policy  will not be relevant at all .
Hence , besides housing policies , the governments should also raise the awareness of having strong family bonding .
In conclusion , most of the current policies in easing the ageing process have their limitations or are ineffective .
The fundamental problem is that the states fail to realize the underlying social problems which contribute to the stressful ageing process .
Hence , in order to ease the ageing process , the policies should be designed to solve the root problems of the evil rather than just focus on the surface of the problems .
Population aging , as stated in the introduction of the report World Population Aging: 1950-2050 (2002)  , is the process by which older individuals become a proportionally larger share of the total population .
It was at first experienced by the developed countries , but is now taking place around the globe .
Why is our world aging ?
This can be explained through two main factors .
Firstly ,  the elderly are leading longer lives .
A special report from Economist .com (2009) states that average life expectancy for the whole world was only 30 years during the 1990s , and that for the rich countries under 50 .
However , the figures have each increased to 67 and 78 , and the increase has no signs of stopping .
The next factor contributing to the aging phenomenon is the declining of birth rates as people tend to have fewer kids than in the previous years .
Therefore , as this phenomenon poses a certain threat to the development of a country , many governments have produced policies and initiatives to ease the aging process .
Nevertheless , the strategies taken do not seem to help ease the aging process .
Between the two significant contributing factors to this phenomenon , declining fertility is likely to hold primary responsibility for the aging global population .
As a result , new policies are now introduced to increase the birth rate .
For instance , the "Stop at two" policy that was once carried out in Singapore is now replaced by "Three , or more if you can afford it" policy , together with other incentives .
Despite these measures , the birth rate of Singapore has not increased significantly (Mui Teng Yap , 2003) .
The "Stop at two" policy had been so successful that couples in Singapore saw that they could have a better standard of living with a smaller family .
Educated women prefer to pursue their careers before getting married; thus , women have a sense of insecurity in losing their job when they have to take maternity leave or when they are about to give birth to their child .
Other than that , educated women do not just want to be successful in their careers , but they also want to be  a good mother .
Therefore , by having a small family , a woman may be able to be more attentive to each and every child , in terms of education , values , and overall well being , so that the children will be able to survive in the competitive world ahead of them .
As we grow older , our body turns weak and so , we tend to face difficulties in conducting normal activities in daily life .
The declining performance of the body limits the ability of the aged to care for themselves .
But , we are now living in a world surrounded by all sorts of advance technology .
It has improved our quality of life in many ways , especially in the field of medical science .
High awareness for healthcare among elderly people allows them to seek professional help such as undergoing kneecap replacement surgery to ease the pain of arthritics .
Their children are also willing to finance the medical bill as there are government policies to cover the spending .
For instance , in Malaysia by paying your parents medical bill , you are able to claim up to RM1000 .
This is a government policy to encourage filial piety .
However , this leads to an implication that the upper class and middle class people who are likely to have easier access to  information will take advantage of this policy .
This , in turn will create a misguided impression that medical fees of the elderly are high , resulting in the debate between the government and policy makers whether to limit healthcare spending on the aged or not .
Thus , the welfare of those who are really in need is also neglected .
Some may argue that the measure of increasing the retirement age should be able to reduce the negative effects of the aging population .
It is true that by letting the elderly people carry on working can increase manpower in labor markets and simultaneously  increase their savings to support themselves during old age .
However , are employers willing to do so ?
Employers tend to hire the inexperienced young people in order to save money .
It is also a common mindset that young people have a higher level of work productivity in contrast to the elderly people .
In some cases , employers have the notion that in order to employ the aged , the setting of the workplace might have to undergo some changes to accommodate to the needs of the elderly .
In short , life today is not similar to that in the past , and challenges lies ahead waiting for us to overcome .
The effects of the aging population may be exaggerated , but we should not lack foresight and neglect them .
Therefore , government and policy makers have to put more effort to ease the aging process as the elderly are still experiencing inadequate protection .
Singapore's population is the second fastest ageing in the world after Japan .
In year 2000 , 7 .2 percent of the population was aged 65 and above .
By 2030 , the figure is expected to increase to 18 .4 percent for those aged 65 and above .
By 2050 , the figure will increase to 35 percent for those aged 60 years and above (Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports 2008 , February) .
Ageing population is a challenge for Singapore for the coming years .
Therefore public spending on the aged should not be limited and used to divert to other areas of the country's development .
The development of the country is important .
Money is needed in areas  such as transportation , research and development , infrastructure , investment and defense .
However , Singapore is currently a developed country .
In terms of quality of life , Singapore  tops in Asia and is No .
32 in the world (Mercer Human Resource Consulting Survey in 2008) .
Singapore also scored 22nd in monocle's list of top livable cities in 2008 and ranked top 5 in city infrastructure (Mercer's 2009 Quality of Living survey highlights 28 April 2009)  .
Singapore's Changi airport has accumulated 250 awards and is recognized as one of the best airports in the world .
Therefore the current problem Singapore is facing now is the aged population .
Money should be allocated for the ageing population .
Singapore is currently a developed country .
Currently the investment in the resort worlds in both the Marina Bay and Sentosa will bring in more income to Singapore .
35000 new jobs will be created and expected to bring in an estimated 1 .5 billion annual boost for GDP in the country (May 27 , 2006 Newspaper) .
Hence money is still needed for the country's development in order to maintain its world class standard  .
Although money is important for the growth of Singapore , the current problem of the ageing population must still be addressed .
Citizens are the most valuable asset of a country .
In order for  Singapore to prosper , money is necessary to solve the problem of ageing population .
In order to encourage the elderly people's self-reliance , the government introduced central provident fund in 1955 .
It is a compulsory saving plan for the work force .
Every month both the employer and the employee contribute to the account .
This is to ensure that individuals will be able to take care of themselves when they grow old .
The money can also be used to pay for medical cost incurred  .
Despite the introduction of the central provident fund , the aged population feel that it is insufficient for them to retire .
Having better medical facilities and better standard of living , people live longer now .
In 2008 , the average life expectancy of Singaporeans has increased to 80 from 61 in 1957 (Mon , Apr 14 2008 News Straits Times) .
Hence funds are needed to prepare for the ageing population who live longer now .
Money is needed to encourage the elderly to work longer and pursue lifelong learning .
For example incentives are given to companies like MacDonald who employ retired workers .
Trainings are given at subsidized rate for workers to upgrade themselves and to remain competitive in the workforce .
Children are encouraged to take care of their parents .
For example , housing grants are given to encourage children to stay close to their parents .
The government has increased the housing grants from $30000 to $40000 (HDB Website) .
New condominium units are built with two units on each level to encourage children to stay with their parents .
Even though the government encourages children to take care of their parents , there are still cases where parents sue their children for not taking care of them .
Singapore government has passed the maintenance of parents act to make children look after their parents .
In cases where the elderly do not have any children or do not have any savings left , money is also needed to cater for their daily expenses , housing and medical expenses .
Public spending should not be limited as the population in Singapore is facing an ageing population .
Eventually by 2050 , 35 percent of the population will have reached the age of 60 years and above .
Money are needed to spend on areas like medical centres , new infrastructure and homes for the elderly .
More medical centres is needed to cater for the ageing population which require more healthcare assistance .
For  buildings like shopping malls and HDB flats , the government and developers should spend more money on building elderly friendly infrastructure and upgrading  existing HDB flats to make it more elderly friendly .
Examples include lift upgrading , slopes for wheel chairs and old folk corners .
Despite the fact that ageing population is imposing more cost on the government , their well being must still be taken care of .
If not , when elections come , the government might lose their votes as 35 percent of the population will reach the age of 60 and above by 2050 .
This makes a big difference in the election .
In contrast , although money is needed for areas of the country's development , public spending should not be limited on the aged .
shouldthe policy of cutting government spending on the elderlytaking into accountseems thatdivert itshouldgovernmentsonfewera familyhas keptthose agedChinathe mostthe largestthe UnitedThere is not dispute that the average aghas beens climbing ucontinuously as it iaffectsle to prevent people from getting old , which is the most outstanding but only one part of the features of aging the agedlation .
It is more important to pay attention to other trends and characteristics of aging population in order to solve thi comprisesit in some other ways .
One of thno disputeactors that the aged may causes excessive burden on economic development is the less support to the fami .yIncreased life expectancy their adult children as a consequenceless birth rate and higher child bring-up fees .
For example , there has been a baby booming period between 1947 and 1949 in Japan but since 1949 the total fertilityate started to fall , from 4 .54 to 2 .04 per woman in less than 10 years and from 2 .14 to only 1 .29 nowadays .
The same kind of situation is also confronted by Singapore , china , Thailand , South Korean and other Asian countries .
On the other hand , the number of adult children who are willing to live with their parents fell instead of rising .
The proportion of Japanese elderly people living with their adult children fell from 80 percent in 1950 to 50 percent in 1990(Onawa and Rather 1997) , in south Korean from 78 percent in 1984 to 47 percent in 1994(Weinstein et al .1994) .
Thus it will be more essential for the government to emphasize the responsibility that adult children bear to support the family rather than directly give financial support to the aged , which will in turn lay more tax burdens on the working group .
In other words , making the adult children actively support their parents will be better than passively pay tax .
In some relatively politically stable regions like Singapore , it is good for the government to enact the laws for the adult children to provide family support .
asking them to passively pay higher taxIn addition to getting support from adult chiput it is identically important to give more employment opportunito the elderlyff the mandatory  (etirement ages for the elderllowerhich is also a good method tocare costsid productivity downtwaseople tend to live longer than before .

This opposite direction of number of aged and working group affects the economic productivity to a great ex (ent .
So the government's taSouth Koreae more policies concerning both the mandatory retirement age and employers' restriction .
For instance , hiring the elderly as part-time worker may be a good choice for both should bear and employers so as to enable the elderly to earn more as well as enhance productivity .
This is also a good way to let the aging populpopulation take , if nwordl , part of the public spending by themselves .
This method is basically to set uptoday'sto encouragefromcollectedits governmentproblemsa payin China , where the demographic structure is mainly made up of low-income working class ,the PhilippinesPhilippines ,Inpolicy .the governmentsthe agedthe shortgovernmentsplacingApart from the methods mentioned above , there are more and more effective methods to be come up with to handle aging population instead of direct public spending on the aged .
The elderly itackle the problem of aging populationociety that cannot be ignored and the best way to keep a sustainable economic development as well as give them a beautiful autumn is to set up a systematic methodology rather than focus onschemesingle policy .
One of the major concerns of Singapore is its increasing aging population .
Today the median age in Singapore is 36 years .
By the year 2050 , our median age would be 54 years (Lee , 2009) .The government has been taking the challenge of easing the aging process very seriously .
To a large extent , the government's policies have helped to ease the aging process particularly through economic policies , infrastructure and healthcare .
In the economic sector , the government has implemented the Central Provision Fund (CPF) to ensure that the elderly would be financially capable to support themselves when they retire .
The CPF savings are entirely invested in special government bonds which are risk free and have long term interest rate .CPF has been a major source of financial supplement for most of the retired elderly .
CPF ensures that all working Singaporeans have a saving that is set aside to support their needs when they retire .
However the government also realises that the CPF savings might not be sufficient for aging needs .
Hence , to help enhance the function of CPF , the government is adding an annuity scheme known as the CPF LIFE ( Lifelong Income For The Elderly) that will provide a secure stream of income for the elderly (Lee ,2009) .This is done when Singaporeans reach the age of 55 , part of their CPF savings will be transferred into an annuity which will provide a steady stream of income from the age of 65 for life .
CPF is a mandatory saving scheme and therefore it ensures that the elderly will have the financial means to support their aging process .
The government has also been enacting laws that require employers to offer re-employment to their workers until the age of 65 .This is a flexible approach because the workers do not have to get the same job or pay .
The government has incorporated this approach from Japan because it is a pragmatic step compared to just increasing the official retirement age .
By encouraging re- employment , the government is assisting the elderly to lead an active and productive life .
Life-long employability also helps the elderly to accumulate more wealth so that they can support themselves .
However most employers would prefer hiring younger working adults because they are more productive compared to the elderly .
To tackle this issue the government has introduced the Workfare Income Supplement which is a negative income tax and it is weighted in favour of older workers .
Workers above the age of 50 also pay lower CPF contribution to decrease the cost of hiring them .
These steps have increased the employment rate of older workers .
In addition to that , the government has various programs to retrain older workers and improve their skills (Lee , 2009) .
The healthcare sector has also contributed to helping to ease the aging process .
The national health care expenditure has been kept at 4% of Singapore's gross domestic profit (GDP) (Lee , 2009) .
Although healthcare expenditure will inevitably rise in the coming years , the government has introduced the 3Ms that will help the needy in their healthcare expenditure .
The 3Ms are MediSave , MediShield and MediFund .The introduction of these 3Ms has helped the elderly in financing their healthcare .
On top of the 3Ms , the government has also introduced Eldershield which is an insurance scheme that gives financial protection to those who need long-term care , especially during old age .
Eldershield policy holders can claim benefits at any age for the rest of their life(Ministry of Health) .
In any event where the elderly become severely disabled , they can get a monthly cash payout .
To ensure that every elderly gets medical attention , the government has built new hospitals such as Jurong National Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital to accommodate more patients .
The government is also building step-down care sectors which include more community hospitals , nursing homes and home care centres to provide better elderly care .
However these services are currently only provided by voluntary welfare organisations and they need more government support .
The government is aware of this situation and it has come up with a solution to overcome this problem by linking up acute-care hospitals with community ones .
This allows patients to recuperate at community hospitals and make room for more serious medical conditions to be treated in acute-care hospitals .
This is an effective solution because the role of caring for the elderly is divided as effectively as possible between the private and the government sectors .
To ensure better comfort for the elderly , the government has also been upgrading home care to serve the elderly better (Channel News Asia , 2008) .
The government has also upgraded infrastructure to help ease the aging process .
Upgraded infrastructure helps the mobilization of the elderly .
The Housing and Development Board has been building more studio apartments to accommodate senior citizens (Lee , 2009) .
New lifts have been installed in every floor of apartments and flats .
The bus system is also improved by making buses wheelchair accesible .The trains in Singapore are already wheelchair accessible .
The government has also gone beyond transportation and housing to help ease the aging process by providing neighbourhoods with decent public toilets and green spaces which enable the elderly to lead an active lifestyle .
In conclusion , most of the policies and steps taken by the government have helped ease the aging process to a large extent .
In the areas of healthcare and financial security the government has been constantly upgrading and implementing new strategies to help ease the aging process .
Hence the measures taken by the government are effective ones and they have helped the elderly age comfortably .
Ageing is an inevitable part of life and it is often not easy at all to deal with the difficulties that old age brings .
However , with the world noticing the shift in its demographics to a more aged society , things are becoming more accommodating for the elderly .
Indeed , developments like companies becoming more inclined to hire older workers , government policies giving the elderly more protection , and medical policies being designed to ensure the affordability of health care have helped make ageing much easier .
The rising trend of companies hiring a greater number of older workers is providing older folks greater financial stability , allowing them to have the spending power to live independently .
The old notion of the elderly helplessly dependent on their children or social workers for their everyday needs is , thus , fast becoming dated .
In Singapore , seventy-five percent of unionized companies have committed to rehiring older workers , and forty percent of these unionized companies already have in place formal re-hiring procedures in addition to ad-hoc arrangements that are commonly made (Lee , 2009) .
With these new job opportunities around , the elderly who previously often lose their livelihood to younger workers can be assured that finding an income is now easier for them so long as they are able to work .
The government has also introduced better initiatives to ensure the elderly are provided for .
Often , the issue is that the elderly are neglected by their adult children and left to survive on their own .
The government thus introduced the Maintenance of Parents Act to prevent adult children from abandoning their elderly parents (Khalik , 2009) .
Furthermore , housing policies which entice married children to stay near or with their parents have been introduced as incentives (Committee on Ageing Issues: Report on the Ageing Population) .
These policies are targeted at curbing this social issue that has become serious enough to be highlighted in Singapore's National Day Rally .
These two policies are some of the ways that the government is looking into to help the elderly have a better and easier life during their twilight years .
Current medical policies have been improved to better protect the elderly from situations where medical care may leave them with debts , which will adversely affect their financial condition .
In the United States , an 80 year old retired truck driver was forced to sell his house of 33 years to pay off a $15 000 medical bill which was not covered by his health insurance policy (Goldsmith , 2008 ) .
Such possible failure of medical policies has spurred efforts to better protect the old .
An example of these efforts is the Eldershield scheme created by the Singapore government in recent years .
The scheme ensures the elderly have the money to pay should they require long-term medical care (Ministry of Health .

Thus , health care policies are continually improved upon to ensure the elderly are having an easier time coping with the ever increasing cost of medical care .
The difficulties in ageing are well-documented and hence have always been a source of debate for any society .
In our society , the aged have been marginalized in the struggle of the survivor of the fittest as their contributive power to the society is reduced .
Yet , as a society matures , one can see how ingenious and novel methods have been developed and set into place to help bring the elderly from living on the margins of a society into being a part of the mainstream again .
The three developments and policies highlighted are examples of the efforts made to help ease the ageing process for the elderly by helping them keep themselves relevant to the society and their family .
Thus , what were once sore sticking points in the issue of ageing has been tackled largely by the methods described .
It is interesting to note , also , that in helping to ease the ageing process , the society has prepared itself to adapt to the prospect of an ageing population .
Ever since the "Silver Tsunami" swept our regions , there has been much debate with regards to public spending on the aged .
Some feel that giving our full support to the elderly is of the utmost importance while others suggest limiting expenditure on the aged , being conscious of  concerns from other sectors of the country such as economic growth and sustainability .
I agree with the latter; those concerns are very real , and if left unattended , can pose a serious threat to the country's development .
Though I feel that public spending on the aged should be limited , it should be done flexibly and contextually .
The seniors have in the past , contributed to our society as well and it would be our immediate moral obligation to support them .
Suffice to say , this must be done prudently lest we should neglect the well being of other sectors in the process .
In this essay , we will be addressing these dilemmas and attempt to propose several possibilities as well as solutions that come with the various alternatives .
Limiting public expenditure is something which  governments must consider seriously .
From a pragmatic standpoint , a majority of the elderly are unable to contribute to economic growth due to deteriorating health conditions which come naturally with aging .
Some common conditions such as rheumatism , failing eyesight and hearing , dementia , Parkinson's disease ,  may render them unfit for work .
Not only are the elderly hindering a country's economic growth , they are depleting it at an alarming rate as well .
Member of Parliament Paulin Tay-Straughan said that " . . .spiraling healthcare costs could potentially be a major strain on the Singapore government's resources .
If [individuals] don't have adequate coverage , there will be a tremendous strain on subsidized care which will drain revenues from the state .
"[1]Suffice to say , limiting public spending on the elderly must be considered in order to maintain a sustainable economy .
Another reason why public spending on the elderly should be limited is  that the funds could be diverted into other sectors of the country's development .
Experts predict a financial toll in the near future , stating , "East Asia may experience widespread capital shortages as funds are diverted from financing productive investments in Hong Kong and Singapore to financing pension deficits in Berlin and Washington .
"[2] By diverting the funds into sectors such as foreign investments , it would enable us to provide for the elderly even more sufficiently with the extra capital .
Even if we have enough capital for elderly spending , recent surges of new pandemics such as the H1N1 virus , call for more funding into the medical field .
Not to mention there are others like the needy who need financial aid as well .
However , limiting public spending on the seniors should be done flexibly and contextually .
Limiting public spending does not mean depriving them of support , but it means providing what's necessary .
Certain categories fall into the gaps in the system and are left dry and powerless , even without the basic needs .
An example could be seen in the following article which writes "Isn't the HDB's policies self-contradictory , when it's income ceiling policy 'forces' the lower-income to buy larger flats than they can afford . . . HDB's income eligibility requires a household earning more than $ 2 ,000 a month to buy a flat that is bigger than a two-room flat . . . a household earning just over $ 3 ,000 , is also not eligible to buy a three-room flat , and have to buy a four-room flat .
"[3] This example is one that stresses flexibility .
It doesn't necessarily mean that when one has some money , he/she doesn't need help .
Spending on the aged should also be contextualized accordingly in economic situations , such as the recent economic crisis where employers are extremely selective , making jobs all the more scarce for the elderly .
Clearly , it can be seen that though limiting public spending on the elderly might produce certain immediate difficulties , it will ease the process inevitably in the long run .
It is important that for us to maintain economic stability , we should keep our sights focused on a more macro scale .
However , the application of flexibility and context is most crucial as there are indeed too many factors and variables for the system to account for; thus , it is better that humans master the system instead of the other way around .
The issues of age challenge the whole of society and put it to the test ," says Simone de Beauvoir in The Coming of Age (1970) , clearly reflecting the impact of the rising aging population that is happening around the world .
In today's society , the elderly are often viewed as social and financial burdens .
Thus , the rise of the silver population poses various political , economic and social challenges globally .
Governments often rack their brains to come up with the best solutions in terms of policies and research and development .
The social policies that have been implemented in Singapore include the Baby Bonus Scheme to encourage bigger family size , raising the legal retirement age to lengthen work span , and the Parents' Maintenance Act to impose filial piety .
Although these policies seek to ease the aging process , they are starting to show signs of weakness when viewed from a long term perspective .
One of the policies introduced by the government in tackling the aging population is the Baby Bonus Scheme .
However , despite being implemented for several years , the scheme has yet to produce satisfying results .
This is because many young Singaporeans are now leading a different lifestyle and adopting different ideologies about the concept of marriage and family .
For example , some of them do not see the need of having babies and view having children as a potential source of problem to their ever-stressful life .
Also , many feel that the scheme is not attractive enough to offset the cost of having more babies .
With the relentless rising cost of living and competition , Singaporeans now have to work harder just to meet the ends .
Thus , many are put off by the idea of having more children due to the accompanying life-time commitment of raising a child .
Therefore , due to these worries , many couples are not responding to the scheme despite the continuous efforts made by the government .
To lengthen working lifespan , the government introduced policies to reduce elder dependency by raising eligibility age for public pensions and government incentives .
However , depending entirely on legislation will not bring about substantial improvements in boosting employment prospects for the "silver population" .
For example , the employment rate for workers aged 55-64 was only 57% in 2008 , a slow increase from 38% in 1991 .
For those aged 65-69 , the employment rate was merely 27 .5% .
Thus , even if the legal retirement age was raised , it has clearly produced limited results .
The main reason is that even if older workers want to work , the deciding factor still lies with the employers .
In fact , stipulating higher retirement age can have an adverse effect .
Employers now think twice before employing or retaining older workers due to the potential higher liability and costs such as retraining programs and insurance benefits .
As a result , employers tend to shut their doors to older workers .
In line with the above efforts to tackle the problem of the graying population , the government introduced the Parents' Maintenance Act in 1996 to impose on filial piety .
However , the government cannot simply legislate filial piety .
Law alone cannot be used to solve the problems that cause some children to abandon their parents .
In fact , the Act is likely to cause even more distress among children who are already overly burdened with the ever rising cost of living in Singapore .
Family ties may be further strained since the children are not taking care of their parents willingly .
Also , the government will be seen as shirking its responsibility towards the elderly citizens by pushing the load of parental care to their children .
Taking it from the parents' perspective , some of them may not even consider the act of being abandoned by their children  a shameful matter .
These parents may want to protect their family's name and want their children to take care of them out of gratitude instead of legal obligations .
Therefore , while it seems that the Act is based on well intentions , it is certainly not the solution to the root of the parents' maintenance problem .
Clearly , the rise of the aging population brings about complex and multi- faceted challenges to the whole of society .
The government should first understand and address the changing mindset and values of today's society towards problems created by the fast aging population before implementing the policies .
Merely depending on legislation will not help to improve the attitudes of the society towards the elderly significantly .
Instead , this will bring about further resentment and result in a strain of relationship between the young and the old .
In all , moving beyond the law to enhance the perceptions of the elderly is a more practical way to increase the ability and willingness of the society to coordinate with the government in tackling the "grey tsunami" .
With the growing population and various problems that the present government face today , the governments are finding it tedious to balance the budget to ensure that all areas of development are being met .
No country or state is able to provide unlimited funding to the providence of the aged .
Besides this , there are also other areas of the country which require more monetary spending to ensure the future of the country such as Education and Research and Development (R&D) .
However , public spending on the aged should not take a backseat .
There should be a sum of money which is set aside for the welfare of the aged .
After all , they were once a pillar of the country and helped to perpetuate growth of the country economically .
Public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas that are of equal , or even greater , importance .
A substantial amount is spent on the elderly annually , and this sum of money can be put to other uses .
Maintaining and sustaining a country is not just about looking after the aged , but also about developing growing sectors of our nation .
Although it is essential for the government to spend on the graying population , there are ways to minimize this spending , and this amount can then be used on other areas of the country's growth and development , such as maintaining our country's defense and improving the education system .
There are several ways to reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency , one of which is to emphasize the importance of filial piety among the younger generations of our society .
Abandoning our parents might not be illegal , but it is morally unacceptable .
Our parents are the ones who have brought us up since young , providing us with basic necessities , educating and grooming us to be a worthy person of society , and showering us with love and concern that all individuals need .
We should reciprocate their love and be responsible by looking after them when they need us the most .
What our society is weak in now is the culture of supporting our parents when they are old .
This moral value should be instilled in our people since young , and they will then understand the importance and accept the responsibility of looking after their aged parents .
There will not be an overnight improvement in our citizens' attitudes and behaviours towards taking care of the elderly in the society .
Therefore , there is a need to provide constant and adequate education to heighten awareness in the people regarding this issue .
Furthermore , lengthening the working lifespan of our citizens might be another viable solution in dealing with an aging population .
This is , however , hard to achieve in our present day society as employers , given a choice , tend to avoid hiring the elderly as they are thought to be less productive when compared to younger workers .
Therefore , there should be some government intervention with regards to employment of the elderly , as this will assist them in securing a place in the workforce .
Not only does it benefit the government as spending on the aged can be reduced , it also benefits them both economically and socially .
Longer working years will allow the elderly to accumulate more wealth for future use in times of need .
With this accumulated wealth , they will then be able to meet their basic needs and be less dependent on the government when they retire from the workforce .
Furthermore , working can help to decrease boredom in retirement , as time will then be spent engaging in productive activities at work , and not be whiled away doing nothing .
These benefits of longer working lifespan can be made possible if employers are willing to hire the aged , who can then be self-sufficient with minimum , or no , help from the government .
The benefits of limiting public spending on the elderly is seen when this amount of money can be channeled to other areas of our country's development .
One such area is defense , which is exceptionally important to an island country like ours .
We have to be prepared against terrorism and external attacks by other countries , at all times .
Apart from defense , the government needs to invest in our country's development as well , and this includes improvements in our education system .
This will then ensure that our future generations will learn more and benefit from it , and it is of great importance as they are the future pillars of our society , who will lead our country to greater heights in order to be a successful and progressive nation .
There are clearly many areas that the government has to spend on annually , and the graying population is one of it .
However , other areas should not be neglected , as our nation's growth and development are of vital importance as well .
Many ways are , indeed , present to help limit public spending on the aged .
The goal of limiting public spending on the aged will be made possible if the proposed measures are strongly enforced , and high cooperation among citizens of our society will help to deal with this issue too .
It is well-known that people's life expectancy is increasing , leading to the pressure of expenditures on the elderly who are considered to be weak and non-productive .
However , what we do not know or are still confused about is an effective way to both take care of the aged and enhance the development of other fields .
It is a matter of money usage .
There is a suggestion that  governments should limit  expenditures on the aged so that they will have money to spend on other areas to develop the countries .
To some extent , I agree with this statement but it should be clarified at some points .
The first point needed to be clarified is how limited  government funding on the elderly should be and what will happen if the expenditures are below an acceptable level .
With fast-aging population and the restricted national budgets which do not allow spending generously on the elderly , this limit should be maintained at an acceptable level which ensures that the basic needs of the aged such as food , clothing , housing , transportation and healthcare are met .
However , in some nations , especially developing countries , in order to meet the need of investing  in other areas to push the countries forward , the governments cut down the basic expenditures on the aged .
Is it a wise choice ?
Cutting down the fiscal costs on the aging population to support other areas does not mean that those areas will receive all the benefits .
Imagine a situation in which without sufficient support from the government , the aged become a burden to their families . .
In that case , if the fiscal costs on the aged are cut down to spend more on the young generation , it can lead to the result that the money aimed to support one target in a family -  the young - will be shared to partly meet the demands of both the elderly and the young .
In other words , the purposes of investing in other areas of development by using money saved from the fiscalcosts on the aged cannot be fully fulfilled .
In developing countries , decreasing the basic expenditures on the aged can lead to a worse situation .
The aged in these nations , especially in rural areas , do not merely need money to lead the rest of their lives , but also need money raise their children or grandchildren .
They share with their younger generations their limited monthly retirement pensions or allowances to cover all the costs of living , but usually , they would run out of money before the pensions/allowances of the next month come to their hands .
Living in poverty , the younger generations grow up with poor opportunities to accumulate wealth to support themselves , let alone supporting their next generations when they become old .
And sadly , the circle of poverty goes on .
One of the productive areas to invest in is economy[1] since economic development helps to raise the national budgets and thus raise the public expenditures on the elderly .
Money earned from investments in economy should be partly used to support the aged not only to lessen the burden on the families and to alleviate  poverty from generations to generations , but also to ease the elderly's lives .
The increasing size of the economy could be relatively limited , but spending more on the aged does allow the government to have more choices to take care of the aged in a better way .
In other words , what the government should do is not merely promoting  economic growth but also taking action to link each increasing level of economic growth with a correspondingly higher level of the quality of life for the elderly .
In conclusion , limiting  fiscal costs on the aged without thorough considerations could lead to unexpected results which directly affect the elderly themselves and their families , as well as indirectly impact on the society and the country's development .
In cutting down the spending on the aged ,  governments must ensure that the basic needs of the aged are still satisfied and the money saved from fiscal restraint should be efficiently invested to be partially plowed back into the elderly .
The gap between theory and practice could be hard to close .
However , the way of taking action will be easier if the plan is well prepared .
In 1997 , there was an estimated 217 ,400 elderly persons aged 65 years and above forming 7 .0% of the population ; the figure will increase to 798 ,700 ,forming 18 .4% of the population by the year 2030 .Currently , comprising 7% of the population , the elderly utilize 20% of public sector primary care and hospital services .
It has been estimated that there will be a four-fold increase in the utilization of health resources by 2030 , based on the increasing number of the elderly and  () Meanwhile spending on healthcare such as  is growing and it can continue indefinitely because of the continuous introduction of new technologies and treatments that are beneficial .
could be defined as scarcity , which means resources are limited in quantity and  iimplies that not all of society's goals can be pursued at the same time .
In brief the government has insufficient funds to fulfill all wants and needs of the aged population .
There are certain development areas of the country such as education , infrastructure , defense , investment and  poverty that still need to be taken care of .
Government budgets should only cater to the basic needs of the elderly .
Consequently a country cannot afford to spend too much on the elderly because of practical realities .
Government budgets should be diverted to other areas of a country's development since resources are limited .
Governments and policy makers have to decide  what should be supported by the public sector , and what should be left to individuals to 'buy' for themselves , depending on their own financial capacity .
In fact , governments should only focus on those elderly whoa re poor and needy , and who have been abandoned by their .
Education , infrastructure , defense and investment are the other areas that need to be looked after by governments .
For example ,  more public spending on education will raise more productive children so that a more affluent future generation can be produced and the size of tomorrow's economy can be increased .
Moreover   foreign investments will be discouraged if governments over-spend on an aging population and neglect developing other areas . 
Furthermore it does not help much in economic growth if governments provide too much welfare support for the elderly .
Firstly elderly people are less productive than young people and most of them are retired or unemployed .
They are unable to continue to put their effort in developing the country's economy and infrastructure  .
This/ These will also increase  government spending on the elderly .
The article "Doomsday Predications about Population Aging Are Exaggerated"  by Robert B .Friedland and Laura Summerpoints out that with little economic growth , society faces fewer choices on how to care for those who are least able to care for themselves .
On the other hand , with sufficient economic growth there would be more choices and fewer persons in need .
Therefore the government should set boundaries on public spending in this area before a country is able to achieve sufficient economic growth .
In addition , governments should put more effort into and invest on those areas that are productive .
This will help  the country's economic growth .
For example , Singapore's casino-resort project will bring many employment opportunities and it is estimated that there will be very high returns in the future for both Singapore as well as the investors of this project . .
Thus the income of citizens will rise and  lead to increased savings .
Citizens will have an easier life after their retirement .
This will reduce their reliance on others like the government and their families .
On the part of the government , they will be able to develop medical technology and provide more medical schemes to help the aged .
Furthermore , the rate of poverty will be lower .
People would be able to afford to look after their elderly .
Clearly any further expansion of financial schemes on the elderly will only impoverish future generations and limit future public spending .
Spending on elderly , especially healthcare , can continue indefinitely because of the continuous introduction of new technologies and treatments that are beneficial but expensive .
Governments and policy makers have to decide  what is essential and should be supported by the public sector .
In brief , leaders in governments must  and implement practical measures to cope with the problems of a fast aging population .
The government controls the spending of public funds , and usually allocates the funds according to the best interests of the country .
Public funds can be collected through implementing taxes on the citizens and  tariffs on incoming trade items from other countries .
These funds are then used to either solve a current problem in a country , for example , an ageing population where help is needed to ensure the livelihood of the older generationin order to ease the burden the current generation has on taking care of the oldold , or these funds could be used to improve the education , communication and transportation infrastructure of a country , thereby improving the standard of living for the nation .
In this case , I would think that more funds should be allocated to a country's development and less on the aged , as a country's development will help solve or ease the problem of an ageing population in many other ways than directly allocating funds to address this problem . .
Education plays a very important role in a nation's development , as it is the most basic platform for a society to learn and improve .
The government should allocate more funds to  building a higher education system , which will lead to more educated and productive future generations .
As the future generations will be more educated and productive , they will be able to contribute more to the economy and this , in turn , should get them a higher income .
A higher income will allow the younger generation to support themselves better and therefore provide for their own parents , so that the government can spend less on caring for the old .
Another outcome of better education standards is that both the younger and older generations will better understand what could happen to them when they grow old .
This means both the younger and older generations will be able to better plan for their old age and the problems that come with it , for example , deteriorating health .
To stay healthy , they can exercise more and have a good diet .
This makes lower health subsidies from the government possible as more people know how to stay healthy .
Other than concentrating on better education , the government can also build on better communication and transportation infrastructure which will then attract more investors and foreign talent to Singapore .
With an improvement in education standards , more students will pursue their studies in Singapore , creating a chance to convert these visiting students into local citizens  , which will in turn increase the tax base for the future .
And with a better communication and transportation infrastructure , Singapore will be a place where global companies will start investing and opening branches or offices .
This will then increase job opportunities for the people and also the country's income .
Both the above improvements will boost Singapore's income , allowing the government to use more money to address various national issues , be they economic development or social problems , such as an aging society .
While the idea of improving education to ease the aging problem in the future is workable , there may still be a problem of individuals who will not be able to  .
In a society , there will always be different people with different backgrounds , for example , the rich and educated versus the poor and illiterate .
But the illiterate will not stay illiterate always; if they put an effort to improve and are given a chance for good education , they can still develop into a group of productive Singaporeans .
This makes the 'unproductive Singaporeans' , who cannot take care of their elderly , a minority group of the whole society , therefore , subsidies for such families to take care of the elderly will still be minimal .
By allocating more funds to education and infrastructure , governments can ensure effective development in the country , thereby increasing the standard of living .
This will also lead to a society with more educated and self-sufficient families , where minimal subsidies are needed to help a minority of the population , thereby limiting spending on the problem of the aged or an aging population .
We all know that the elderly have devoted all their intelligence , knowledge and strength to our society  .
So should we abandon these people when they are not as strong and perspicacious as they were before ?
Basically , it is the moral responsibility of our society to do  its best to support the elderly even at the expense of other areas of the country's development .
There is no denying the fact that each country has a limited  budget , so it can not afford to spend too much on the elderly because it also has to spend on other areas of the country's development .
For example , there are also many other needy people like orphans , the disabled or unemployed that want to be subsidized by the government .
They are all feeble and vulnerable people .
It is very hard for them to earn enough money for themselves .
The fact is they cannot compete with others  .
Therefore , it would be a huge financial burden for their relatives to support them .
Unless the government spends more money to support them and create more job opportunities for them , they will be left to fend for themselves and  .
However , we should consider who should be given priority and who deserves a share of the national budget the most .
The elderly usually do not have enough strength to do manual labor whereas mental work requires perspicacity and concentration  , areas in which they cannot compete with  younger candidates .
For example , in Singapore , I have seen that almost all cleaners are the elderly .
Nevertheless , they do not look strong enough to do such manual work , but they still have to do it , to earn  their own living .
Obviously , old people have fewer chances to work for their own living compared with other needy people who still have physically healthyphysicallybodies .
What is more , the elderly should be respected and  for their contributions in the days of their youth .
What we have today is partially an inheritance from previous generations .
The elderly were once hard working not only in raising their children but also in devoting their strength and intelligence for a better society like the one we have today .
Now when they are old , they cannot continue to do productive work , so it is our society's responsibility to support them .
Although there is a limit to the national budget and the government has to balance spending in different areas for the country's development , subsidy for the elderly should not be cut .
If each person has a sense of responsibility towards increasing the size of today's economy and tax base , then it will not be a big problem for us to spend more money on the aged .
During the post World War 2 (1946 - 1964) era  , there was a significant increase in the fertility rate in all parts of the world .
For example , the fertility rate in the United States of America was at an all time high which was around the range of 3 .0 - 3 .5 ( ) .
In fact , the name "baby boomers" was derived from an increase in fertility rates globally after  World War 2 .
53 years later , the baby boomer generation is moving from the middle age to the senior yearsyears , and issues regarding the aging process have started popping up like mushrooms after the rain .
Singapore , one of the most developed countries in the South East Asian region , has not taken this issue lightly .
According to the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , the elderly (age 65 and above) population in Singapore is at 8 .6% (2008) and it is expected to grow to 18 .7% by the year  2030  ()  .
The research and development and social policies formed by the government are able to help ease the aging process of the aging population .
In order to cope with the increase of the aging population , the government has created various social policies and schemes to ease the aging process .
One of the significant schemes that the government has implemented is the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme .
The main purpose of the CPF scheme is to provide  financial security for the retired  .
Under the CPF scheme , there are many subsidiary schemes  such as Medisave , Medishield and Medifund .
These subsidiary schemes enable the aged to pay for their hospital and healthcare bills .
In addition ,  .
As the costs of living and healthcare have been increasing , these schemes are able to help reduce the financial burden of the aged .
Therefore , the CPF scheme created by the government has successfully ensured financial security for the aged so they would not need to search for employment to support their financial needs .
Other than the CPF scheme , a scheme to the aged named Eldershield was created to help  the aged who suffer from disabilities .
The Eldershield scheme works like an insurance scheme which  provides basic financial protection on a monthly basis for the aged .
The Housing Development Board has also created policies to cater for the aged such as "Granny Homes" and the Lease Buy Back Scheme .
"Granny Homes" are studio apartments equipped with elder-friendly features such as non-slip toilet tiles and grab poles (Housing Development Board [HDB] , Electronic References , 2009) .
"Granny Homes" is an economical choice for the aged when they live alone as the "Granny Homes" are small and easy to maintain compared to a normal HDB flat .
In addition to that , the aged would be living in a community of people in their age group , and this provides a good platform for the aged to socialize with their peers .
As for the Lease Buy Back Scheme , it provides an additional option for the low income elderly Singaporeans in  3 room or smaller flats to cash out part of the money locked up in their HDB flats for their daily expenses (HDB , Electronic References , 2009) .
As most elderly stay alone these days and are not supported by their families , this scheme would be useful for them especially when they do not have  stable financial security .
These two schemes created by the government would greatly relieve the burden of healthcare costs for the aged and so it would definitely benefit the aged .
In a nutshell , easing the aging process doesn't just stop here with our current findings in the medical as well as other sectors norwith policies created by the government for the aged .
We  should also play a part by taking care of our well-being in order not to be dependent on others for support .
At this moment in time , research and development still continues on to discover new findings and new medical inventions to help ease the aging process and also improve the quality of healthcare for the aged .
Governments are also looking into better ways and alternatives to provide the baby boomer generation a more secure environment with a lower financial burden , better health care and alsobetter employability of the aged .
Nowadays , nobody can deny that an aging population is becoming one of the most serious problems to developed countries , including Singapore .
Recent research studies have shown that the proportion of the country's residents aged 65 and above can reach the rate of 18 .7% in the next 20 years .
Population aging has become a cause of concern in the realm of finance to the government .
It seems inevitable that we must spend more on the aged .
But what are we getting for all that money ?
Should we limit  public spending on the aged so that the money can be diverted to  areas of the country's development ?
Answers to these questions are not easy to find .
However , in my opinion ,  public spending could be more productive if the government knows how to control the money spent on the aged and also how to invest in other areas of development .
Among several areas of public spending on the aged , such as medical subsidies , public infrastructure , pension schemes , and financial aids , healthcare must be considered the most important area .
As  healthcare costs are now getting more and more expensive ,  it becomes harder and harder for poor , old people to fulfill their payment for their medical bills .
Based on this situation , some claim that the government should automatically spend more  on the aged , who deserve to be helped .
However , the national budget will come under pressure when growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer young persons , which leads to the question  , "Can we really afford so much health care for an aging population , or are we heading toward a healthcare crisis in the near future ?"
Once again , the answer is not easy to find .
Nevertheless , the budget for healthcare is not infinite , so the government and policy makers must decide to which extent they willsubsidize the healthcare cost of an individual , and this would probably depend on his own financial capacity .
The government needs to know how to set limits on the healthcare budget for the elderly .
The second reason is that public spending is not the only solution to the problem of population aging .
Researchers and policy makers have made a lot of suggestions and developed a lot of strategies to help buffet the negative impact of an aging population on our society .
Some of these include encouraging later retirement ,  , encouraging the elderly and their families to take more responsibility for their health , etc .
Therefore , instead of spending too much money on the aged , the government can think about realizing some of these  policies , or or developing  policies to solve the problem .
Last but not least , Singapore must spend money on a large number of other essential areas of development , such as education , infrastructure , defense , investmentsand so on These areas of development are  the key  that a country needs in order to become a developed one .
Without a good education system , there will not be a well-educated intellectual generation for the country .
Without good infrastructure , there will not be sufficient facilities for the country  .
Without a good defense system , people will live in the danger of terrorism as well as of being invaded by enemy nations .
Therefore , these areas of development must be well invested in .
Moreover , when all of these areas are developed enough to fulfill  , the living standard of Singaporeans will increase .
Consequently , , the aged will receive more help and budget from the society , and they may even earn more money to support themselves too .
In conclusion , Singapore , as well as many European and North American countries , is facing the problem of an aging population .
If we do not put enough effort to solve the problem right now , it will be a problematic issue in the future .
As the problem is controversial and there are a lot of different opinions surrounding it , the government and the policy makers must know how to make the right decision to come up with the best solution for the country .
The most essential thing is to think out of the box .
We  need to consider  many factors that affect our decision , such as whether we have enough money to afford all the healthcare cost , or whether there are any other areas of the nation's development that really need our investment .
Therefore , setting limits on the public spending on the aged , I think , is a much better and wiser choice .
Demographic changes have recently caused many controversial issues .
Among these , the increasing number of aged people as well as the decrease in fertility rate as a new way of living is  a challenge that the world has to face in the next decade .
, especially in developed countries like Germany or Japan , where the aged population will make up a large proportion of the population soon .
, the elderly is receiving more and more support from the government , which is a strategy in social welfare development .
Ironically , these policies not only bring benefits for the old people but also partly have a negative impact upon the socioeconomic development of the country .
In other words , the public expenditures on the aged have created barriers which limit the improvement of other fields .
Therefore , this spending should be reconsidered carefully to avoid financial shortage in other areas of the country's development .
As part of the effort to enhance  social welfare , a lot of schemes have been adopted and operated in recent years for the sake of the elderly population .
Truthfully , these policies are significantly beneficial to senior citizens especially with respect to health , a problem induced by the physical aging process .
Some intermediate and long-term care facilities like community hospitals , services like home medical and home nursing services , and aid like public subsidies in Singapore are perhaps good examples of support from the government .
Some statistics have showed that the government expenditure on community development , youth and sports went up by about 57% from 2005 to 2008 while that on health rose dramatically by 128%(1) .
In reality , theschemes below certainly accounted for not a small percentage of the increased public spending .
This growth in number of projects put heavier pressure on the government budget , which consequently created an imbalance in theexpenditurefor different domains .
This spending , furthermore , is likely to increase more and more in the next few .
Also , it is not all the government's duties to take care of the elderly .
Firstly , at the personal level , the aged have to be responsible for themselves .
When individuals are still at the working age , they should provide in advance for their life after retirement .
Saving and investing more of their income , for instance , are some ways to prepare for their old age .
Secondly , at the social level , it is  the filial obligation of  children to take care of their parents when they grow old .
This will obviously help to reduce the expenditure by sharing  between the government and its citizens .
The most important reason why the government should limit spending on senior citizens is that it will constrain other sectors from taking advantage of the government budget .
Once the support for the elderly takes up too much of the budget , then other sectors of society cannot receive adequate financial assistance .
Take education for example .
Compared with the rise in expenditure for health , community development , youth and sports as mentioned below ,  government investment in  strategic sectors like education in Singapore between 2005 and 2008  decreased from 994 to 856 million dollars (nearly 14%)(2) .
In addition , there are other sectors such as industry ,  transportationand information technology which also play an important role in building a solid infrastructure for the nation's development and which thus require proper concern from officials .
However , with a limited budget , the government is not capable of covering all expenses .
To a certain extent , restriction on  is reasonable and necessary so that  can be used to expand many other crucial areas .
This will contribute more to the progress of the society than  .
In short , the government and policy makers should come to a reasonable decision on all projects .
In the face of a limited budget ,  public spending ,  should give priority to necessary schemes and identify which cost can be reduced in order to  .
Clearly , the government can cut down on excessive support for the elderly because there are many other ways  .
In this way , the money saved can be used to implement more urgent and practical policies that also contribute to the nation's strength and potential .
According to the United Nations , 1 in every 5 persons throughout the world would be aged 60 years or older by the year 2050 .
In the more developed regions , the number of persons aged over 60 would increase by 70% from 231 million in 2000 to395 million in 2050 .
These alarming statistics would bring about economic and societal problems to many developed countries .
One of problems is that the government might need to channel more revenue to meet the demands of the elderly group .
In the long run , this can lead to shrinkage in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country or even affect the other sectors of development .
To prevent such situations from happening , different governments of the developed nations have come up with policies to confront the challenges of an aging population .
However , these social policies that have been implemented are not effective in easing the aging process as they do not fully cater to the demands of their targeted group .
Firstly , the means-testing policy fails to protect every citizen that requires public funding in practical realities .
In the context of Singapore , the means-testing system carried out in nursing homes assesses the financial status of the entire family .
Under this system , if the family has a high income level , the government would provide lower subsidies to the patient .
However , this is not a fair assessment because there are elderly patients that have been abandoned by their children .
The elderly patient would not be able to afford the bills .
The flaws in the execution of the mean-testing system do not only occur in Singapore .
In Australia , even though the means-testing system is deemed as an important way to help the government to redistribute the money to those who are in need , it fails to protect all the elderly .
This is because some of them might find means testing humiliating as it forces people to declare themselves to be in poverty .
These examples go to show that the means-testing policy has not fully catered to the demands of its targeted group .
Secondly , population growth policies do not meet the demands of married couples .
In view of the graying population , many developed nations have come up with policies to encourage childbirth .
In the case of Japan , the government introduced its Tokyo Plus One Policy to attract married couples to give birth to more babies .
The policy included measures such as increasing the number of nurseries and making new changes in the child welfare law .
Despite the government's effort in promoting childbirth , the total fertility rate of Japan remains low .
In addition , there are many considerations that married couples have when it comes to childbirth .
One of these considerations for couples is the need to strike a balance between family and work life when a new member is added to their family .
These obstacles show that population growth policies are not effective in meeting the demands of married couples .
Lastly , the policy to raise the retirement age in developed nations does not serve as a long-term solution in meeting the needs of the elderly well .
In Singapore , the government intends to raise the retirement age of the working group to 62 so that the elderly can continue to support themselves financially .
However , it is undeniable that age discrimination is still evident in work places .
An employer would prefer to hire a young adult as compared to an elderly as the former can contribute to the company for a longer period of time .
Some might argue that even though the elderly cannot compete with the younger generation for jobs , the government does organize job fairs to help the elderly seek jobs .
However , although these job fairs provide more working opportunities for the elderly , the success of such job fairs is largely dependent on the receptiveness of the elderly's expectations of the scope of the new job .
Furthermore , there should be a maximum cap to the increment on retirement age as we also need to consider the physical capabilities of the elderly .
All these obstacles show that raising the retirement age does not address  the concerns of the elderly .
Therefore , it is clear that social policies do not always meet the needs of the groups they seek to cater to .
No matter how well a social policy is constructed , there are still loopholes that are often overlooked by policy-makers .
This shows that much more can be done to improve the different kinds of policies .
Furthermore , it is important to note that social policies should be flexible so that they can make suitable changes to meet the demands of the society at different points in time .
Once the demands are met , the route to easing an aging population would be much more smooth-sailing than it is being thought .
It is common to see a society aging with the elderly population rising rapidly in  recent years .
Although the society has a moral obligation to do all that it can to help the elderly , there are still limits to the budget the government can allocate to help the aged .
When there are limited resources , scarcity is unavoidable which leads to a situation where not everyone will benefit and there will be those who are in need who will be left out .
When policies are constrained by a budget  .
To minimize or eliminate the occurrence of this phenomenon there should not be a limit to government spending on the elderly .
One of the examples is the government plan to extend the working lifespan of the elderly .
However , this is not a practicable and long-term solution to the problem .
Firstly , to what limit should the government delay their retirement ?
A year or two or more ?
With every year that by , they face the limitations of their physical and mental strength .
loss in sight , hearing and mobilityas well as the development of are very common .
They also have to face the fact that they are unable to keep up with the workload they used to handle in their younger days even if they want to .
Although delaying retirement can help the elderly to accumulate some wealth , reality speaks differently when it comes to elderly people .
No matter how experienced or skilled an elderly person is , he or she will always be at a disadvantage  compared to those who are younger , more energetic and most importantly , more productive than them .
Therefore , spending on the elderly should not be limited in order to better them .
Besides that , what  the Singapore government did was introduce the Baby Bonus scheme to the public with the objective of encouraging the public to have more children .
This is important , as having more youths will increase the productivity of the country as well as spread the cost of development over a large population .
However , this scheme has not worked as well as predicted even though the government has put efforts into promoting it .
The scheme netted only a gain of 129 citizen births last year in 2008 compared to the number of births in 2003 .
Such a scheme is impractical even if it may work in the long run .
The reason is that not everyone is willing to have a baby just to get the benefit offered by the scheme .
Having a baby is a long-term responsibility and burden not many are willing and prepared to take .
Therefore , resources  should be diverted directly to help the elderly to be able to cope with their problems immediately .
If we spend less on the elderly , children will have the filial obligation to take care of the elderly .
This may sound good and interesting but with the current economic status , where is less economic growth , tougher choices need to be made to cope with the demand of the society .
Even if the economy improves , the expenses of the elderly will just keep on getting higher; it seems to only benefit the government and not the elderly .
Furthermore ,  will heavily burden those who have an elderly person at home and such stress leads many of them to abandon their elderly .
Besides that , there are still a segment of people that have no job , no savings nor even   no family that we often .
If expenditure on the aged is cut off , how would we expect them to be able to survive and it is supposedly the obligation of the government to provide shelter to these people .
As such , it is important for the government to spend more to help these people .
Although there are other areas such as education , infrastructure and defense that require our attention , it is also of equal importance for us to have the same concern for the elderly .
These people are the ones that have dedicated themselves to the development of the country in the past .
It is their right to enjoy the privileges provided by the government after their retirement .
As such , my point of view is that the spending on the aged should not be limited .
If the expenditure towards the elderly is limited , many will be left in a lurch and thus  among the elderly .
Old age is a reality that we all have to face one day .
The tremendous improvement in nutrition and medication has led to life expectancy in the developed world increasing significantly .
As the elderly population soars , the demographic changes that occur will cause increased public spending on the elderly in different fields such as medical care and public infrastructures .
Thus , many national budgets and economies will come under pressure as growing numbers of elderly people outnumber the number of younger people .
Despite all that , public spending on the elderly should not be limited as society has the moral obligation and  to assist them in all aspects .
The elderly have contributed much to the country's development so public expenditure on the elderly should not be limited .
It is undeniable that the elderly have made immense contributions to the country and their sacrifices create the relative social and economic comfort we enjoy now .
The elderly have become bright examples for the younger generation in various domains .
Many of them have made valuable contributions to the country in different fields such as politics , science and technology  , economics  and culture as well .
On top of that , most importantly , they have contributed to the nation by imparting their knowledge and experience to the younger generation .
For instance , over the years , the elderly have helped to build up the economy of Singapore by developing several policies and they have worked hard in securing and maintaining the stability of the country .
Although many may argue that public spending incurred to support the elderly should be limited , this will create an impact on the society and increase  .
The limitation in public spending on the elderly may cause family members and individuals to shoulder a bigger responsibility in taking care of the elderly .
In addition , some of those expenses on the elderly will end up getting shifted back to the public sector through less direct and more expensive means .
For example , the rising cost of healthcare  for the elderly has taken its toll on  and many can not afford it .
Thus , family members may need to fork out their own money to support their elderly parents .
Consequently , conflict and arguments among family members may occur in this matter .
Also , many other issues related to housing and transportation cannot be resolved .
Families and local communities will have to deal with those by restructuring welfare programmes .
Furthermore , the limitation in public expenditure on the elderly  will also affect the level of physical , mental and emotional well-being of an elderly person .
With the decrease in public spending on the elderly , many elderly people will come under pressure as they will have greater financial dependency on others .
Subsidies on health care and treatment at community hospitals and nursing homes for the elderly for instance will be cut off , hence leaving the elderly to fend for themselves .
All this pressure  could make them suffer from mental illness as their children may not look after them  .
For most of the elderly , family members are the major source of social and financial support .
Without that support , the elderly may start to spend time reflecting on their past , remembering disappointments and that stage of life may turn into a time of despair and loneliness , with only little positive meaning in life .
All this could eventually lead to suicide and depression among the elderly .
On the whole ,  government and society should support public spending for the elderly because the aged have in the past contributed to society and have made Singapore what it is today .
The elderly should benefit from the government , family and community care in all aspects to help them to ease their burden after what they have done for us over the years .
public spending on the elderly constitutes a safety net for them and all parties should work hand in hand to resolve  .
The aging population has of late become a subject for discussion because the growth of an aging population has brought about serious health issues and social problems in the developed nations .
National budgets will also come under pressure as a growing number of elderly are supported by relatively fewer younger people .
Thus , to deal with such challenges , research has been carried out anddevelopment as well as policies have been developed to help the elderly .
The development in the field of economics has surprisingly contributed to easing the aging population problem .
Researchers believe that the critical challenge of an aging society is not only about how to accommodate the older population , but  about how to ensure the productivity of future workers , regardless of age .
Thus ,  have been done by the government in encouraging the economic growth in our country in order to decrease the problems that may arise from the aging process .
To encourage the economic growth of our country , our government has worked hard to develop the tourism industry in our country .
Tourism in our country has successfully created a wide range of occupations for our citizens , such as tour guide , airline staff , drivers , hoteliers , caterers and interpreters .
The lower barrier to elder employment which has been set by the government has allowed employers to take in older workers to work in the jobs mentioned above .
Thus , more people have the opportunity to work .
The rate of unemployment will decrease .
People can work longer , accumulate more wealth and increase their savings .
At the same time , the poverty rate can be decreased .
People can also afford to look after their elderly .
After retirement , the elderly can also use the money that they have earned to support themselves without depending on their families .
By improving the business environment , our country has also undergone a dramatic climb in our economy .
This has created more business  for our local traders .
Thus , taxes which are collected have increased and the income of our country has also risen .
These taxes have been used in the development of medical technology to help  cure the incurable , such as heart attack , tuberculosis , cornea impairment and cataract .
There are also medical facilities and systems which have been lately introduced , such as laser therapy , dialysis machines and microsurgery .
With all these modern technologies , human life can be extended and people can live more healthily .
The elderly can be stronger and fewer of them will be suffering from medical conditions , such as stroke , diabetes , cancer and high blood pressure .
Employers who claim that the elderly are restricted in ability and mobility will also no longer have any excuse to reject elderly individuals who wish to work in their organization .
The government has worked hard to create opportunities for foreign investors to encourage foreign investment .
This has increased the foreign currency exchange and stopped the outflow of our local currency and hence strengthened the value of our money .
As a result , there has been a significant growth in our economy that has increased the income of our country .
The income that our country has earned is then being spent on the welfare of the elderly .
The government has used the money to build more community hospitals and nursing homes which are well-equipped with  elderly-friendly facilities .
They also provide a range of services to meet the needs of the elderly , such as  medical care , nursing care , physiotherapy , dietary services and dental care .
The elderly can be admitted into the community hospitals or nursing homes if they need daily skilled nursing care or assistance in the activities of daily living because they have no caregiver to look after them at home .
Society has fewer choices on how to care for those who are least able to care for themselves when there is only little economic growth .
On the other hand , there will be more choices and fewer people in need when there is  sufficient economic growth .
The growth of the economy can solve many problems which arise from an an aging population .
Abandoned and unmarried old people can stand on their own feet without relying on others .
Excuses such as high cost of living making it hard for working adults to pay for their elderly's living expenses will not exist too .
Obviously , efforts that the government put into developing the economy of our country have resulted in  successful growth and inevitably , this has contributed to easing and solving the problems of aging population .
Many developed countries are now facing the same crucial issue: an aging population .
Take Singapore as an example; she will be witnessing a drastic demographic shift in history , with the age population ratio predicted to change drastically from one in twelve residents being over the age of 65 in 2005 to one in five residents in 2030 (Community on Ageing Issues , 2006) .
Hence , there would be a need for governments to increase expenditure on the aged to accommodate  this burgeoning age group .
, the crux of the issue here lies in how much this spending on the aged should be capped at .
For instance , health care now accounts for 4 .5% of Singapore's gross national expenditure (Wijaya , 2009) .
If there is no limit set to this figure , it can continue indefinitely , perhaps up to a double-digit figure , and may even cut into the state budget for other areas of development .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that there would be adequate resources available for other areas of the country's development .
critics argue that by limiting the amount spent on the aged and diverting the resources to other areas of the country's development , the essential needs of the elderly would be neglected .
One such example is the healthcare needs of the elderly .
It would hardly be a surprise that healthcare costs for the elderly would continue to escalate in the decades ahead .
With the never-ending introduction of new medical technologies and the seriousness of prolonged illnesses associated with old age , medical treatments for the elderly would be increasingly expensive .
Furthermore limiting of  public spending on the aged would  shift more of these healthcare costs to the elderly themselves , causing the elderly to shoulder a heavier financial burden .
The elderly would therefore be at the suffering end .
While this may indeed happen , the situation can still be remedied .
Additional profits reaped from the investment in other areas of the country's development could in turn contribute to on the elderly significantly .
In fact , it is inevitable for the government to divert money to the other areas of development as an aging population affects these areas significantly .
One considerable implication of an aging population is its possible impact on the country's future macro-economic performance (Schuiz , Borowoki , & Crown , 1991) .
As the baby boomers ,  , begin to move out of the workforce , the country will face the problem of a shrinking workforce .
In Singapore , there are currently 8 .5 economically active persons to support one elderly person .
By 2030 , the labour-dependency ratio will drastically drop to only 3 .5 persons supporting one elderly person (Central Provident Fund [CPF] Board) .
This shrinking workforce may signal the advent of a less productive workforce and greater financial strain on the members of the workforce as they need to produce adequate amounts of output to support the burgeoning elderly population (Schuiz et al . , 1991) .
On top of that , a shrinking and less productive workforce could have an adverse impact on the country's economic growth .
Therefore , the government should divert more resources such as increased investments in human capital to improve , or at least sustain , the productivity of the workforce and the country's economic growth .
sufficient economic growth would bring prosperity to the country and in turn benefit the society as a whole .
The additional profits reaped from this investment may in turn be re-channeled to the public funds to help the needy ones , including the elderly .
Hence , the investments in other areas of the country's development would not be at the expense of the needs of the elderly; in actual fact , they could create a win-win situation .
In addition , limiting the public spending on the aged and diverting resources to other areas may not necessarily mean that the government is neglecting the needs of the elderly .
The government is still taking care of the aged in various aspects .
One aspect is the formulating of policies with the elderly in mind .
For instance , the Singapore government has passed the Maintenance of Parents Act to allow elderly parents to file lawsuits against their children for financial support (Khalik , 2009) .
This legislation would help to discourage adult children from shirking their responsibility of looking after their aged parents .
In addition , the government has long enforced individual savings through the mandatory CPF , compelling the population to save for their old age (Wijaya , 2009) .
This approach taken by the government would enable the individuals to accumulate wealth , and hence depend less on their family and the government financially in their twilight years .
these various aspects show that governments have taken a more well-rounded approach in taking care of the needs of the elderly; and that public spending on the aged is not and should not be used as a single depiction of how governments can express their concerns towards the elderly .
In a nutshell , limiting  public spending on the aged and diverting resources to other areas of the country's development do not necessarily mean that the government is neglecting the needs of the aged .
One should note that setting limits on  public spending on the aged  reduces the over-dependency of the aged on the government while diverting resources to other areas of development  allows the country to prosper and subsequently benefit the whole community , which includes the aged .
It is through this approachthat pressing issues such as the economic implications of an aging population can be resolved and at the same time , more revenue can be generated to help the needy  that includes the elderly as well .
Public spending is defined as the amount of funding the government channels into the society from the monies it collects from the society .
This fund is generated through various economic activities , usually in the form of taxation .
The debate often revolves round how the government utilizes this fund , which is contributed by the citizens .
The total amount collected from an economy tends to be more or less fixed in the short term .
Therefore , if one group of people gets more , the others would get lesser .
Thus , by limiting the spending on the aged , it would mean that other sectors of the society would get more than before .
This essay will discuss  the limit that should be imposed on the amount of funds that should be budgeted for  the aged that would constitute  a fair distribution of government resources .
This is due to the fact that the aged is not the only dependent group in society .
If there is a tendency to spend more than necessary on the aged , other sectors of the economy might find that they lack finances to function adequately .
Some might say that it is immoral to deprive the aged of the help they need .
They tend to support this argument by considering the contributions made by the aged during their hey-days and the level of their dependency in this season of their lives .
However , this school of thought focuses on only one aspect of the issues of society .
There is no doubt that some of the aged need help .
However , they are not the only dependent group .
A country is likely to also include the poor , the uneducated , the physically disabled , the intellectually underdeveloped , and many others who require constant monetary aid from the government .
Thus , it can almost be called an ill-informed decision when one claims that the government should take care of the aged without limits .
There is no doubt that we should ensure that the aged can age with dignity .
However , not only  the aged , but who are dependent on the government's help should also have the right to live with dignity  .
Thus , while the government educates the aged about their rights and campaigns about health maintenance methods , the other sectors of society in need of help should not be left out .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that other citizens of the country who are in need can also receive aid .
A second argument is that financial support for the aged is essential to maintain a certain level of standard of living for the aged .
It may be true that without  help from the government , some senior citizens would struggle just to survive .
However , if the state takes care of the aged unconditionally , it would be a policy impossible to maintain in the long run .
Unrestrained expenditure on the aged can be likened to an endless pit .
Without clear guidelines , the elderly could easily abuse the system .
This is especially true when the cost of visiting subsidized public hospitals falls below that of visiting general practitioners , where the costs are borne solely by the patients .
Not having a limitation based on the results of means testing would lead to a large number of people applying for grants even when they are not in dire need of such concessions .
In Singapore , the government puts in place many rules and regulations for citizens to gain access to public aid like the Public Assistance Scheme .
This is to make sure that those who eventually get the money are those who genuinely need financial assistance , not simply because they fall into the right age category (Stolberg and Zeleny , 2009) President Obama aims to modify America's health care policy to one that 'provides security and stability to those who have insurance and cover those who do not , all without adding to the federal deficit' .
The New York Times (2009) states that the health care system in the United States of America (USA) today is 'full of waste and abuse' .
This is due to the fact that the USA is a welfare state and provides pension for the retired .
This financial scheme has resulted in the USA being the country spending most on health care , leading to a great strain on the government budget (The New York Times , 2009 , 14 September) .
In light of this , we can be sure that this excessive amount of money is not well-spent .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited to prevent misuse of funds that could be better channeled back to the economy , where more government revenue would most likely be generated .
There are also others who argue that the aged should be entitled to unlimited funds as it is difficult to ensure that all the basic needs of the aged are met .
They would rather provide more so that all the aged are taken care of , rather than risk any one of them suffering due to insufficient aid .
However , this would likely benefit only a portion of the society and deprive the other sectors of the funds needed .
In the society today , there are certain industries , known as  public goods , which require government involvement to exist .
For example ,  .
Such facilities benefit everyone in the country and it is difficult to exclude anyone from enjoying them .
The wide spread of such a mentality would then result in the government having to provide these services .
Therefore , if public spending on the aged is not limited , there will be less funds channeled to projects such as the building of roads , the provision of street lights , the maintenance of the police force and cleaning of the streets .
With a restricted budget for these sectors , we may have to live with a lower quality of life and a less secured nation , which would also lower the living standards amongst the aged .
Thus , it is necessary to specify limits to public spending on the aged , so that sufficient funds can be channeled to provide other facilities for the nation as a whole .
In conclusion , caring for the elderly is only right and necessary .
However , it should be within limits so that other parts of society would not be deprived of the help that is necessary for current support and future development .
Everyone is dependent on government aid to varying degrees .
A good balance must be struck to ensure that as few people as possible are deprived of government support due to poor distribution of state monies .
This essay will discuss   current political research and development that help to ease the aging process in the context of Singapore .
The aging process , which involves  physical , psychological and social changes among human beings , often brings about the deterioration of physical and mental health and loneliness .
These will increase the nation's health expenses and pension fund .
To a large extent , the aging process has been alleviated by  current social policies and implementation that emphasise individual responsibility , familial commitment and residual model policies- often known as government intervention .
Government has placed policies that emphasise individual responsibility and which have been proven effective to ease the aging process .
Every working Singaporean with a minimal income of five hundred dollars will have to contribute to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) .
With this compulsory saving scheme , Singapore citizens will have to save up for three accounts , which are the Special Account , Medisave Account and Retirement Account (CPF , 2009) respectively serving different purposes .
These accounts are meant for medical expenses , investments , emergencies and retirement  to ensure that the citizens have sufficient money when they reach old age .
However , despite having these accounts , senior citizens may still face problems with paying their medical bills and daily expenses as these accounts are subjected to withdrawal limitations and high eligibility age barriers .
Therefore , it is vital that senior citizens have a healthy lifestyle and to be active in the workforce in order for them to be in good health and have the ability to self-provide .
The Singapore government has been actively educating  senior citizens about the importance of healthy living and  community activities and campaigns .
For instance , the Health Promotion Board has introduced healthy aging programs and formed  interest groups like Tai Chi and Karaoke Singing Clubs among the residents in the communities .
These activities promote physical and mental wellness for  senior citizens as well as enlarge their social circle by making friends  .
The Singapore government has devised plans and policies to develop a strong sense of familial commitment in order to ease the aging population burden of the state .
Evidently , these policies are deemed to work as statistics (Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports [MCYS] , 2005) have shown that the majority (76 .4%) of senior citizens live with their children (p . 10) and 44 .7% of  senior citizens depend on their chilchildren for financial support (p . 28) .
Policies include tax relief for taking care of elderly parents or grandparents taking care of grandchildren while both parents work , and public housing schemes like  grants to citizens to purchase flats in  areas where their parents live .
Indirectly , this will strengthen  family ties and allow the senior citizens to seek companionship with their children or grandchildren .
However , there are still cases whereby children refuse to support their parents though they are capable of doing so .
With the introduction of Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents (Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports [MCYS] , 2009) , parents who are over 60  and incapable of supporting themselves can file petitions  to seek financial support from their children .
Nevertheless , the pillars of the future are further instilled with the importance of moral values such as filial piety through moral civics lessons in schools to highlight the importance of familial commitment .
Lastly , Residual Model policies are in place to ease the aging process as they act as the last straw of the social safety net when the elderly lack self-reliance or have no familial support , for instance , the Public Assistance Scheme whereby senior citizens are given cash grants and free treatment at polyclinics and government or restructured hospitals .
Another example is the Medical Endowment Fund (Ministry of Health [MOH] , 2007) , which is known as Medifund and Medifund Silver , whereby the elderly are given provision for medical funds due to not having a Medisave or Medishield Account ,  not having accumulated enough in these accounts , or having no immediate family member to pay their hospital bills .
This enables every senior citizen to  to receive medical attention when needed .
An argument against these assistance schemes is that these will increase the dependency of  senior citizens on the government as they know that  they will be provided if they are unable to pay for their medical bills .
However , government stresses that these policies do not entitle all citizens to share the same benefits through mean testing , whereby the individuals are assessed according to their financial situation and bill size .
Affordability  is now dictated by the government and the patient who is considered not qualified for the fund will end up paying more .
This will in turn highlight the importance of self-reliance .
Although there are still flaws in the current policies , shortcomings of one policy can be overcome with other policies and developments .
To a large extent , current policies have helped to ease the aging process .
However , it is  important that all the policies are put together to achieve the optimal result  .
On the whole , the the Singapore government has not overlooked the underprivileged senior citizens by providing a safety net to ensure that their basic needs are met .
Therefore , in helping  the aging population  age gracefully , Singapore government has constantly emphasised  the importance of self reliance and shunning away from being a welfare state without undermining the familial commitment and work ethic of  senior citizens .
Aging with gracemeans  good health and lifestyles , financial stability and being in the company of family and friends .
The aging process is the process of becoming older .
More countries are facing  problems brought about by the aging process in the social as well as the economic aspects .
Over the years , the life expectancy of people increases due to factors such as better hygiene and improved healthcare .
Vaccination  prevented people from getting life-threatening diseases in the past , such as tuberculosis , which is no longer a big threat today .
Increased life expectancy coupled with decreasing birth rate as shown in some first world countries such as Japan , where the country's fertility rate was 1 .23 children per woman and 21% of the population 65 years old and older (Cardiosk , October 2008) , led to aging population .
Despite the perplexing issues arising in the process of aging , the government has put in much effort in developing policies and aiding in research to alleviate its negative impact on society .
With an aging population , less people are able to work and the development of the economy is likely to decline .
Faruqee and Men (2002) wrote that declining and aging population would cause the level of Global Domestic Product (GDP) to fall by twenty percent annually in the long run .
To increase the number of people in the workforce , countries such as Singapore encourage foreign talent to contribute to her economy .
The government also implemented "baby bonus" to encourage couples to procreate which would increase labour in the long run .
However , the Singapore government has increased the retirement age to 65 years old so that the elderly can continue to contribute to the economy .
Reuters (2007) reported that Singapore plans to raise the retirement age for citizens from 62 to 65 by year 2012 to account for the higher life expectancy of the population .
Despite increasing the retirement age to reduce the pressure on economic development , the children of the elderly might not be willing to let their parents continue working at such an old age .
Hence , Japan invented robots to replace the lack of manpower due to the aging population .
These robots can also play a role in taking care of the elderly in the ; for instance , the wheelchairs that operate using buttons can replace humans pushing them .
With technological advancement , pressure on economy can be eased .
The next problem that arises in the elderly is their reduced mobility .
The elderly are less flexible and their movement is limited especially when they are facing a stage in life when they are more susceptible to suffer from movement-restricting diseases like osteoporosis .
Bone density of people would reduce overtime as the body is unable to absorb calcium with old age .
On the other hand , improved healthcare has also cured or prevented some of these diseases from plaguing the elderly , allowing them to enjoy active lifestyles .
Statistics show that elderly still engage in exercises and the elderly who take part in tai chi are 47% less likely to fall down due to  increased balancing ability and confidence .
Moreover , this research also shows that exercises reduced hip fracture rate by 25% in postmenopausal women .
However , despite some elderly being more active than others , most elderly find it difficult to move about .
Therefore , the Housing Development Board (HDB) in Singapore has proposed to build lifts that stop at every storey in the Life Upgrading Programme .
In addition , more ramps and slopes are to be built to ensure the mobility of wheelchair-bound elderly and also the physically disabled .
Public transport is also becoming more wheelchair-friendly with similar upgrades over the years .
In conclusion , current research and policies implemented by the government has played a large role to ease the aging process .
The negative impact on society caused by the aging population cannot be underestimated nor ignored .
Everyone has to play a role in alleviating the effects of the aging process .
The government can only implement policies or introduce incentives to encourage individuals to ease the aging process .
It is up to the citizens to decide whether they want to take part in helping the economy and society in the long run .
Therefore , I strongly agree that much has been done by the government to help ease the aging process .
The rise of aging population has become a major issue in most parts of the world .
According to  United Nations statistics , by 2050 , one of every five people will be 60 years old and above and the total number of people who are 60 years old and above is projected to be around 2 billion .
It is a cause for concern , as  more elderly present in the society will affect our economic and social development significantly .
Therefore , in most parts of the world , governments are coming up with policies and sponsoring research to ease the aging proces .
The aging process can be eased by increasing birth rates , increasing workforce productivity and reducing the physical and psychological aspects of aging .
Currently , governments have helped to ease the aging process in terms of  economic  , social  technological developments .
Firstly , an aging population greatly threatens a country's economic development because with more elderly retiring ,  workforce productivity falls sharply .
Therefore , in most countries , governments have increased the retirement age in order to encourage the elderly to continue working to increase productivity .
In Finland , which has the most rapidly aging population in Europe , has successfully raised the retirement age from 60 .1 to 60 .7 in 2004 , together with a pension reform introduced in 2005 to ease pressure on the state pension system (Kunz , 2007) .
Another method to increase the workforce productivity is to invite foreign talents and immigrants to stay and work in order to counter the low birth rate of a country .
For instance , one of the main factors for Spain's rising birth rates was due to a huge influx of immigrants from Latin America and North Africa (Spain-Demographic Trends) .
However , these policies may not be effective because  locals view foreign workers as a threat and may cause social unrest .
For instance , in Australia , there is a rise of hate crimes against  immigrants .
Even so , employers should hire their employees based on their capability and not nationality in order to avoid such crimes and through this policy , it will increase a country's competiveness , which will increase the country's workforce productivity and boost its economy .
Therefore , by increasing the retirement age and recruiting immigrants , we have partly eased the economic aspect of aging process .
Secondly , by growing old , it is inevitable to gain low self-esteem due to people stereotyping the old as slow and weak .
Also , their children may not be able to take care of their emotional welfare because of their busy career , hence they may be prone to depression .
Hence , governments are now educating the public to volunteer their services to organizations and nursing homes in order to broaden the elderly social circle .
In addition , the government is trying to encourage companies to hire older workers by giving incentives  .
By doing so , the elderly will feel more socially accepted and there will be less cases of elderly dying alone in their house .
However , others may argue that these actions are not effective because educating the young does take a long time especially when  aging is a pressing problem at the moment .
It is true that the fruits of education take years to harvest .
However , according to statistics given , the national volunteerism rate in Singapore has risen from 15 .2 to 15 .5 in 2006 .
This does show that more people are concerned about the elderly .
It was an improvement , albeit a small one .
However , through education not only the youths will be more accepting of the elderly but also , in the future they will most likely not to practise ageism in the workplace and this thinking will be ingrained in the society thus generating positive outcomes .
Therefore , current policies and campaigns are effective in easing the social aspect of the aging process .
Moreover , with current technology advancement , we can tackle the physical barriers of aging problems such as low birth rate , increased productivity and reduced physical effects of aging , which may partly relate to elderly low self-esteem .
With current technology , infertile couples can have a baby through In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) .
In addition , in Japan , researchers and scientists have invented robots to replace older workers in order to increase the workforce .
With potent medicine , the aged are able to live longer and healthier .
Others may argue that the main cause of the aging problem is actually longer life span itself .
However , it does prove that current technological advancement is indeed effective in prolonging the population's life span .
With longer life span , people can continue to contribute to society by imparting their knowledge and skills to the next generation .
By doing so , the aged will be more appreciated by the public; it also does help to improve the country's economy with an increased workforce .
Therefore , having longer life span does help to ease the the aging process .
Hence , technological advancement does help to ease the economic , social and physical aspects of aging process .
In conclusion , it seems that governments from all over the world are prepared to counter  rising aging population problems .
Although certain measures are not effective immediately , we should continue to support them as it is worth the wathem .
Through these policies , the elderly will be more financially independent and well taken care of .
There is a saying that goes , "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime ."
Providing the aged with health services and benefits and inviting immigrants can only ease the aging process temporarily .
However ,  by changing people's mindset , people will be less discriminating against the aged and appreciate them more and are more willing to have more children .
Therefore , current research and policies have helped to ease  economic development , as well as the and psychological aspects of aging process .
Eventually every one of us will grow old , therefore the effectiveness of these policies greatly concerns us  .
We should support it .
Our world population is facing an aging problem .
Thirteen developed countries have a median age higher than 40 years in 2005 .
Leading these countries is Japan with a median age of 43 years (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs , 2007) .The aging population results in the increase of public spending on the aged .
Governments have adjusted  national budgets to increase public spending on the aged including expenditure on healthcare , housing , pensions and transportation to cater to the needs of the aged .
The United States spent $2 .1 trillion on health care in 2006 but increased to $2 .26 trillion in a year after which elders have spent far more than children and adults (The Office of the Artuary of US , n .d . ) .
As the aging problem is likely to get worse in the future , public spending on the aged will constitute a large proportion of the national budget .
Therefore , limiting public spending on the aged is needed as money can be diverted to other development areas .
This limitation establishes a bottom line for public spending to control the budget but this does not necessarily mean having a cut down .
By limiting public spending on the aged and diverting money to other areas of development , government can increase economic growth .
There is a large proportion of public spending on the aged in the national budget due to a fast aging population .
Government will have less money to divert to other development areas .
Money can be diverted into other areas which require more budget such as business .
In fact , there was a significant shrinking in the economy which was 3 .8 percent in 2008 compared to 4 .7 percent in 2007 (Mussa ,2008) .
By diverting more money into business domain , government gives incentives to companies in order to encourage them to explore and invest .
In the long run , it will stimulate the economy .
Besides , more working opportunities will be created .
It will help to solve the unemployment problem .
The real unemployment rate is 16 percent including persons who work less than they would like to and those who have dropped out of the labor pool instead of the official jobless rate which was 9 .4 percent in July 2009 (Channel News Asia ,2009) .
Thus , economic growth will be increased by limiting public spending on the aged and diverting money into the business domain .
Moreover , the elderly are not the only members of society so public spending on aged should be limited so that money can be spent on children .
Children are considered as the foundation of a country as they will grow up to be leaders in the future .
Therefore , government needs to pay more attention to children's welfare .
Children need good education  so that they can become well-versed and contribute to the country"s development .
In addition , public commitment to children has been threatened because of increased spending on the elderly .
According to an analysis done in the United States from 1980 to 2000 , the number of children living in poverty is almost three times  the number of elderly over the past twenty years (Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development , n . d .) .
Hence , diverting money to children should help to improve their quality of life .
Some critics argue that limiting  public spending on the aged will become a financial burden to low-income families .
Their low wages are only sufficient for household expenses and children"s school fees .
As prices are rising acutely , family members will face difficulties to support their elder parents .
However , low-income families can still obtain financial aid from government despite limitation to public spending on the aged .
Allowances and incentives are available for the needy .
Moreover ,  a tendency shows that elders themselves decide to have  longer working lives .
Although they already reach the retirement age , they still decide to continue working so they will be able to support themselves in their twilight years .
For example , Japanese usually continue working until 70 years old(OECD ,n .d .
) .They will continue to be financially secure , instead of starting to depend on their family .
In conclusion , limitation to public spending on the aged and diversion of money to other areas of development should be implemented .
Money diverted into the business domain will be able to stimulate economic growth .
In addition , children are at a disadvantage if too much money is spent on the elderly .
Despite limitation to public spending on the aged , the real needy will still be able to obtain financial aid .
The consequences resulting from an unlimited increase in public spending on the elderly will become a financial burden to a country in long run .
Singapore's life expectancy at birth for males is 78 .4; for females it is 83 .2 (SingStats , 2009) .
Total fertility rate per female is only 1 .28 .
These statistics explain why Singapore is no doubt one of the fastest aging populations in Asia .
The problems associated with the aging process can be categorized into five aspects , namely economic decline , mental agility , health , emotional and social problem .
Among all , economic and social policies  are widely discussed in  society .
Although it is impossible to increase the fertility rate in the short run , the problems of aging process are still alleviated by research and effective development and policies .
On the economic aspect , an aging population leads to shrinking workforce , low productivity and slow economic growth .
The annual inflation rate of Singapore has been increasing from 2 .1 to 6 .5 from 2007 to 2008 (SingStat , 2009) .
The old age dependency ratio last year was 11 .9 (SingStats , 2009) which shows that 11 .9 working persons would support one elderly .
Together with the problem of low fertility rate , government encourages Singaporeans to work longer to earn more for the future .
In order to encourage late retirement , the Singapore retirement age has been increased from 60 to 62 .
The the CPF contribution rate for employers has been increased by 1 .5 percentage points in 2007 in order for citizens to better prepare for the aging problem .
However , for older workers , CPF contribution by both employers and employees has also been reduced in order to help the workers remain competitive and increase their take-home salary (Channel NewsAsia , 2007) .
Research on how to cater for elderly needs on public facilities has also come into action .
There are ramps for people using wheelchairs; in most of the buildings , toilets and buses are specially designed to accommodate the elderly and the handicapped .
The Singapore social service sector has been taking care of the elderly with current housing , healthcare and job support policies .
HDB encourages children live in close proximity with their parents so that children can take care of parents during emergency .
Under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme in 2008 , single Singaporeans aged 35 and above are able to apply for higher CPF grant of $20 ,000 if they want to purchase HDB resale flats to live with their parents (Channel NewsAsia , 2008) .
Moreover , upgrading of housing lifts on every floor would make elderly life easier .
The Healthcare 3Ms , Medicare , MediShield and Medifund also provide subsidies for the elderly .
In order to benefit those who need help more , subsidy for hospitalization in public hospitals has been adjusted so that 60 percent of workers are able to enjoy full subsidy for type C and B2 wards whereas those have higher earning power will receive substantial subsidies for both C and B2 class wards (Khalik , 2008) .
NTUC , WDA and employers have worked on the Job Re-creation Programme (JRP) to recreate and redesign jobs targeting older workers and providing training opportunities for them to take up new job openings .
Besides , SPUR focuses on retraining for older workers whereas ADVANTAGE !
encourages businesses to employ older workers .
Opponents of this position will argue that healthcare cost is still the main problem for the aging population .
A Medisave account may not be sufficient for many Singaporeans once they need to pay the medical bills for their parents , spouses and children .
Although most of the Singaporeans  not only pay for their own medical bills , there are other subsidy schemes which may lessen their financial burden .
Eldershield is designed for elderly who need long-term care or cannot afford the expenses on severe disability .
The elderly will receive monthly cash payout ,  therefore their children's Medisave account can be used to pay for their own bill .
Other than that , the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly (IDAPE) and Primary Care Partnership (PCPS) are other subsidy schemes available .
To summarize , government encourages later retirement in order to reduce elderly dependency and implement social policies such as subsidy on housing medical fees .
At the same time , more and more facilities are designed to meet the needs of the elderly and the disabled .
Therefore , current research and policies are able to cater to most of the needs of Singaporeans to prepare for old age .
Also , individuaindividuals have to keep fit to reduce the probability of getting ill in order to avoid expensive medical bills during older age .
The world is still recovering from the aftermath of the recent market crash .
Many economies have dipped into recession , job losses are prevalent and many countries are experiencing social instability .
Fortunately , with the introduction of multimillion rescue packages , the situation seems to be hopeful .
Slowly and steadily , the world's economy will pick up again .
However , the world must address yet another dire issue:  an ageing population .
According to the United Nation's prediction , by 2050 , 22% of the world's population of 9 billion will be over 60 (The Economist , 2009) .
Such statistics are indeed worrying .
The world will experience slow growth , shrinking labour and rising public spending .
Such cost even micrifies the impact of the recent financial crisis .
As stated in the Economist , the current crisis makes up about 10% of the future ageing-related costs (The Economist , 2009) .
However , leaders of the world have stepped up measures to combat this unforgiving phenomenon .
Ongoing research and implementation are initiated to allow the world to accept such emergence comfortably .
Reducing elderly dependency is one way in which governments can tackle the worrying phenomenon of a greying population .
One possible strategy is to enhance the opportunity of elderly employment .
In the past , the elderly were often labelled as slow and inefficient .
However in recent times , such stereotypes have been shelved away as the younger generations learn to embrace the wealth of experience , the elderly share , thus increasing the likelihood for elder employment .
In Singapore , the ADVANTAGE !
Scheme (Ministry of Manpower , 2007) is an initiation to help employers financially in hiring and retaining older workers .
This will open up more opportunities for the elderly to support themselves without burdening the tax-payers .
It also increases the labour force and tax revenue .
Therefore the elderly should not be deprived of employment by providing more incentives for employers to attract such workers and help for those seeking employment opportunities .
As such , the exchange of experience and skills will only benefit the workforce and hence reduce the effects of a greying population .
Another problem which the older generation may face is social discrimination .
Mental and physical health will inevitably deteriorate as one ages .
Such liability will only discourage the older ones and thus create an invisible segregation between the strong and the weak .
Thankfully in Singapore , such issues have been ironed out and certain measures have been carefully implemented .
Under the Main Upgrading Project (MUP) , grab-bars in the bathroom and non-slip floor tiles have been installed in upgraded sold flats .
Recently , recreational facilities such as exercise corners and elder-care centres have also been built in the neighbourhood to provide social interaction opportunities among the community .
Also , the Housing Development Board (HDB) has introduced Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) to grant privileges to married children to live near or together with their parents .
These policies would greatly foster ties and improve communication between the young and old , in hope to eliminate the social discrimination and bolster the well being of the elderly .
On the contrary , as much as solutions are sought to reduce the effects of an ageing population , the rate of replacing the world's population is not desirable .
According to the Economist , the fertility rate in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development fell sharply from an average of 3 .2 children per female in 1960 to 1 .6 in 2009 , which is below the recommended replacement level of 2 .1 (The Economist , 2009) .
Women now are more career-proactive and hence delay marriages and family formations .
Additionally , the number of children in a family has been limited to two due to individual family's preference and financial ability .
However , there are many ways in which governments can compensate for the falling birth rate .
Longer paid maternity leave , more childcare leave and greater incentives for working mothers are some possible corrections to the problem .
In France , such policies were implemented and were rewarded with a near replacement fertility rate (The Economist , 2009) .
Although this may increase the government's expenditure , it is a necessary investment for a better future of the country .
For many decades , the world has been taking a lot of beating .
From the economic crisis in 1997 to uncontrolled viral spread such as H1N1 pandemic in 2008 , the world survived all these obstacles .
The repercussions of an ageing population are tirelessly being subdued by various helpful and effective solutions .
These are proved successful in certain countries but with a necessary cost .
Results may seem moderate and unprogressive .
Nonetheless , with much support in place , the future of the world may not be as bleak as before .
Aging is a difficult process as the elderly are more inclined to get sick because of a lower immune system so having to recuperate longer would be financially draining .
They also face difficulties in finding and retaining jobs .
Under the seniority based-wage system , it is more expensive to hire older workers; and  the perception that older workers are inefficient resulted in low employment rate among the elderly (Lee , 2009 , para .
6) .
However , policies on the aged in Singapore have significantly heled to reduce the problems they face .
In recent years , the Ministry of Manpower has been working closely with its tripartite partners to enhance the employability of  older workers (as cited in NTUC , 2007) .
One of the schemes that were developed was the 'Advantage !
Scheme' .
In this scheme , companies are given a grant up to $400 ,000 to encourage them to retain its mature workers .
Coming in 2012 , the government will enact the re-employment legislation to enable the elderly to work beyond the retirement age of 62 (as cited in Re-Employment of Older Workers Portal , 2008) .
This is preferred than increasing the retirement age because a higher retirement age might cause older workers to be less employable as they are no longer cost competitive which may result in them being laid off even before they are 62 (cited in MOM , 2008) .
With re-employment , employers can provide jobs to their mature workers and also offer them a different job position with different salary and terms .
Here , both employer and employees can negotiate the terms and companies can remain competitive by adjusting the wages and benefits according to the value of the job .
In terms of healthcare , the government has come out with a few financial assistance schemes to ensure that the citizens are able to afford healthcare and are prepared during their old age .
Other than the basic healthcare financing schemes like Medisave , Medishield and Medifund , the government has come out with another scheme called 'Elder Scheme' .
This is an insurance scheme where those eligible pay premiums and they can claim benefits at any age of their life and receive monthly cash payout up to 72 months .
This would help support them should one day they stop working (as cited in MOH , 2007) .
Other than financial schemes , the government also provides subsidies for patients who require intermediate and long term care .
The subsidies given could be as much as 75% of the total bills depending on the family income and it is extended to community hospitals (as cited in MOH , 2007) .
This is beneficial as sick elderly require long term care and they might choose to recuperate at community hospitals .
However , even with all of these policies and subsidies , there is no guarantee that the elderly are able to pay for all of their living expenses .
Even though they have worked for many years , they might have little or no savings because they might not know how to manage their money .
It is essential that they learn how to not only manage their wealth but also expand it so that when they choose to stop working , they would have enough money to pay for their necessities and have enough for any unexpected expenses .
To ensure that its citizen will be financially prepared when they reach their retirement age , the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF) has came out with a learning portal called 'Retirement Ready @ my cpf' to help citizens to plan for their retirement (as cited in CPF , 2009) .
Here they show a step-by-step process on how to achieve the desired retirement lifestyle a person wants .
They teach from how to do basic budgeting to doing investments .
This is one of many ways to ensure that Singapore citizens will live a better life when they get older .
Clearly the government and its related agencies have been working hard to help ease the aging process through many of its policies .
Through these , the elderly not only will be able to continue working; they also need not worry much about their health expenses .
These policies along with early retirement planning would help to ensure that the elderly will be economically independent and lead a better life .
Singapore is facing a shift in the distribution of the population towards older ages , where the median age of population  increase , as well as a decline in fertility rates , resulting in a rise in the number of elderly in Singapore .
Aging impacts a person's well being in many ways , with both psychological and physical changes , including chronic diseases associated with it .
The labour age composition has thus shifted towards the older workers , where implications towards the competitiveness of Singapore's economy will occur , especially if older workers do not make significant contributions to the productivity growth in the economy (Thangavelu , Yong , 2006) .
Hence , more support and care for the aged should be provided which in turn will pose a strain to the younger generation .
As of 2008 , '8 .4 economically active persons are supporting one elderly' (Singstats , 2008) and 'by 2030 , only 3 .5 persons will be supporting one elderly' (CPF , 2008) .
This has reflected the importance for individuals to have the ability to support themselves through their golden years .
In order to do so , Singapore has introduced policies that worked to ease the aging process .
Facing high cost of living , Singapore has moved up from the 13th position in 2008 to the 10th in 2009 , in the worldwide cost of living ranking (Mercer , 2009) , especially for the medical cost , where each household spends an increasing amount of expenditure in health care , with 3 .3% in 1998 to 5 .1% in 2003 (Singstats , 2007) , and is expected to further increase in the future  , with more aged citizens in Singapore .
Hence , Singapore has introduced policies to ease healthcare financing , such as Medisave , Medishield , Medifund , and Eldershield (MOH , 2007) .
Singaporeans have recognized the need to prepare for aging in terms of escalating medical costs , thus net withdrawal from Medisave scheme , including Eldershield , has dropped to 213 .6 million in 2009 , and 62 .5 million from the Medishield scheme (CPF , 2009) .
A drop in withdrawal of healthcare schemes has thus reflected that more Singaporeans have felt the need for such policies .
Singapore has not only faced an aging population resulting from low fertility rates , but also longer life expectancy for individuals .
With rising life expectancy , given only a 2 .5%  annual interest in the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , and with most funds in the CPF used to fund housing or tertiary education , the CPF figure left is no longer sufficient to last through retirement (OCBC , 2005) .
"The best way for people to adjust to longer life spans is to continue working for as long as they can" (PM Lee , 2009) , as working provides a source of income; more savings can thus be built up .
Increasing the retirement age is insufficient to encourage individuals to work longer , hence the Re-employment policy will be enacted in 2012 .
In order to ensure that older workers are not at a  disadvantage , Singapore established schemes such as smaller CPF contributions to the aged (CPF , 2009) , as well as the Advantage !
Scheme introduced in 2005 (MCYS , 2009) to lighten the cost of hiring the aged as well as to move away from the seniority-wage system and provide assistance in funding to re-employ mature workers .
And as of 2005 , 1 ,142 companies have benefited from this scheme .
In addition , retraining programmes were also introduced; an example would be 'Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR)' (MCYS , 2009) .
Critics of the approach on lowered CPF contribution rates for older workers have argued that it is unnecessary , as 63% of the respondents felt that "seniors are not weak and ill" and 87% felt that "senior citizens can play an active role in society" (C3A , 2008) .
However , based on the last two economic recessions , older workers faced greater risk in losing their jobs , with 2 .9% of unemployment for 50 years and above , compared to 5 .2% for 30 years and below , in 2008 (MOM , 2009) .
Therefore , to make the aged more employable , there is a need to move away from the seniority-wage system and reduce the CPF rates .
In conclusion , people are living longer resulting from better medical facilities .
With the policies introduced to help ease the aging process , Singaporeans will be able to keep themselves occupied before formal retirement , and to be able to build up their retirement nest and retire in comfort .
Through amelioration and subsidizing of healthcare and public facilities ,  the problem of aging population has been eased .
Over the last 5 years , Singapore government health expenditure for  citizens has increased from $1 .53 billion in year 2002 , to $1 .93 billion in year 2006 which is an average growth rate of 6% per annum (as cited in Ministry of Health , 2007) .
Through the increment on healthcare expenditure , we can see that the government is bringing in better technologies and focusing on  Singaporeans' health .
With advanced healthcare facilities , preventing or curing  diseases has been made possible .
One of the most common diseases associated with  old age is  Senile Dementia , where the patient encounters mental deterioration (loss of intellectual ability) .
Two major types of senile dementia are Alzheimer type and those due to vascular problems .
Studies show that of  people over 80 , 20% suffer from Alzheimer's disease (as cited in health-cares .net , 2005) .
Researchers have come up with several ways to improve and slow down the deterioration of elderly brain .
For instance ,  researchers have invented medications such as tacrine and donepezil which are used by patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (as cited in health-cares .net , 2005) .
Researchers not only focus on inventing new medications , they also hope to protect people against mental decline through aerobic exercises and getting a dose of the sun - vitamin D (as cited in health-cares .net , 2005) .
In Singapore , having one of the fastest aging populations in the world , with an estimated 23% of the population to be over 65-year-old by the year 2030 , there is a need for more hospitals to be built to meet the needs of the aging population (as cited in Singapore faces 'silver tsunami' , 2009) .
Hence , Jurong General Hospital which will open in five years and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital which will open next year will be linked to a community hospital next door .
This is to ensure that older people will have the right health care treatment at the right place and in return help them to cut costs (as cited in The Straits Times , 2009) .
It is understandable that older people often require more medical care , but they need not remain in the hospital for this care .
Thus , it would be much cheaper for them to get such care from a community hospital - hence the idea of "stepping down" the care is needed .
Public transportation systems must continue to expand in order to deal with an aging population .
In June 2006 , Singapore Bus Services (SBS) Transit launched Singapore's First Ever Wheelchair accessible buses - Service 21 (as cited in SBS transit , 2006) .
Similarly , another public transport operator Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) came up with its first wheelchair-friendly buses on June 2009 (as cited in Wheelchair-friendly bus , 2009) .
With these buses , the elderly and wheelchair bounded commuters could travel conveniently to hospitals and polyclinics for their medical appointments .
Even with government funding , not every Singaporean is able to luxuriate in the use of better healthcare and public facilities .
Even with government subsidies and paying  their CPF they might still find it difficult to handle hefty medical bills .
Hence , even a small family with a monthly income of $10 ,000 might also find it difficult to cope with a big hospital bill , if it has to support one or two elderly people with a chronic illness (as cited in The Straits Times , 2004) .
Hence , policies such as senior citizens' bonus  where lower-income elderly aged 55 and above with an annual income of $100 ,000 or less will receive $200 to $1000 over a period of 4 years (as cited in GST Offset Package , 2009) to lighten the burden of lower income families .
There is no need to worry as statistics shows that direct subsidies to patients have increased from $850 million in 2001 to $1 .6 billion in 2007 and it is projected to increase to $2 .2 billion in 2012 (as cited in Ministry of Health , 2009) .
In conclusion , amelioration and subsidizing of healthcare and public facilities has eased the problem of aging population .
Therefore , maintaining a healthy lifestyle , saving up for the future and contributing monthly to their CPF account assist citizens to prepare them for better retirement and lower their economic burden .
One in The Agingresidents in Singapore will be 65 and above by the year 2030 (Yap , 2009) .
Singapore society's aging process brings on numerous set of challenges for the government .
The effects of aging process in Singapore are as follows .
First , economic decline would occur as the size of the working force shrinks .
Second , decline in the citizen's health due to weaker immunity system and age related illness .
Third , social problems brought on by the living environment .
Fourth , emotional problems caused by the different mindsets of the young and old generations and connections to family and society .
Last , the decrease in mental agility affecting active aging .
Therefore , the government has embarked on reforming its older policies and implementing new ones to cater to and prepare for the trend of population aging in Singapore .
For the purpose of this essay , the focus would be on Singapore's policies to ease the aging process on economic and social problems .
When osetsworks , it helps one to stay mentally aware , physicthe agingenergetic , socially connected and fi:a7 (Yap , 2009) .
Next , the government has introduced The ADVANTAGE !
Scheme (Yap , 2009) .
It was set up to finance a company's effoy , keep or re-employ mature workers (Yap , 2009) .
Policies have not only been implemented in anticipation of the aging process but also in reaction to the external factors like the global recession .
In reaction to the economic downturn , Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) amounting to $600 million was started in November 2008 (Yap , 2009) .
This shows the government's quick response to situation changes while staying true to its aim of easing the aging process .
Critics might argue that the government iwillucing policies encouraging eeconomic and social problems because of the problem of agingworkers does not mean compaif onesn Siysgapore would follow suit .
Also , not all the workers would benefit from the policies mentioned above .
However , in evident of the above policies , Singapore was the only Asian country which won the AARP International Innovative Employer Award (Yap , 2009) .
The award is given to companies in countries for showing innovative Human Resouritsactices that deal with matters related to the workforce , age 50 and older (Yapy , 2009) .
Also by the end of 2008 , 700 unionised companies have already committed to re-employ close to 5 ,000 workers above the age of 62 (Yap , 2009) .
The statistics show that the reemployment is a useful tool and the government's policies have had a positive impact on the companies .
Furthermore , workers can refresh or upgrade their skills from more than 800 SPUR rses (Yap , 2009) .
This benefit is not limited only to employthe Sd workers but unemployed workers also can turn SPUR to sharpen their skills while they search for jobs .
Moving on , Singapore wants for its seniors , even the less mobile to have a safe and accessible environment .
As such , a Barrier Free Accessibility Masterplan was executed (Yap , 2009) .
The plan is for all our public housing estates to be barrier-free by 2011 (Yap , 2009) .
Also by 2as4 , eligibfrom HDB blocks would have lift access to all floors .
In the past , there was no exact emphasis on structure for all ages .
However , since July 2006 , HDB's new public housing projects are built are all people (Yap , 2009) .
For example , switches and sockets low enough to be accessiedle from a wheelchair and toilets being wide enough and having hand rails .
Moreder , our government is not only building barrier-free estates but also concentrating on public turn tosportation .
By 0 , pedestrian walkways , public roads , taxi and bus shelters and access to MRT stations woule barrier-free , using a $60 million programme started by the government (Yap , 2009) .
We can also observe that wheelchair-accessible buses are progressing gradually .
Thus , Singapore's environment and transportation services for its citizens are transforming in line with the changing needs of Singapore society .
withtoilets have been madeOur government's constant review of the policies , setting up ofe ,many specified committees to head particular goals in relation to changing times , and counter measures to external and internal factors have been impressive .
It has also gained recognition in local and abroad .
In conclusion , our current policies clearly have helped to ease the aging process in Singapore .
It has enabled our society to be better prepared for the aging trend in Singapore .
When Singapore's Ministry of Finance unveiled the government budget for 2009 , it was stated that an estimated total of S$66 million or 0 .15% of the total government expenditure will be spent on establishing various programs and upgrading facilities for the elderly (Singapore Budget 2009 , 2009) .
As the problem of aging population intensifies throughout the years , there will always be a debate on how much of  public spending should be allocated to the aged .
While it is important to provide funds for implementing policies to support the elderly , it is plausible for the government to work on areas which can aid both the country's development as well as provide support towards the aged .
Firstly , it is vital to develop the country's economy .
A sustained economic growth improves the level of business activities , ensures a low unemployment rate and increases government tax revenues .
More funds are thus available to finance additional projects for the needy including the aged .
Also , more people will become self-sufficient and therefore able to support themselves , even without government aid .
Hence , more funds can be directed to other economic development areas (Friedland and Summer , March 2005) .
Contrarily , with slower growth , more people will be unemployed and more money would have to be spent on unemployment benefits .
This will inevitably constrict  public spending on the aged due to a smaller pool of resources .
Critics may argue that even if the country is performing well economically , she may not be progressing socially if she fails to address the people's needs , especially the elderly's .
This is because the elderly have once contributed to the country's economy and their well-being should not be overlooked when they age and are unable to work .
Thus , it is justifiable that the society should give in return and support the old members of the workforce , on the account of their past contributions to the nation .
Furthermore , aging is a natural process and everyone will grow old one day .
When the time comes , it is man's instinct to hope that more efforts will be invested to help him .
Therefore , it is pertinent that the government does not overlook their needs .
However , it is essential to regulate the amount spent on assisting the aged .
Some fear that with government aid , some may in turn become over-reliant and fail to be self-sufficient .
Therefore , it would be better for the government to offer the basic infrastructure and introduce policies to help the aged gain independence while receiving necessary help .
For example , one feasible policy is to encourage companies to provide extra training for the older workers to stay in touch with advanced technology , thus increasing their working lifespan disregarding health factors .
Not only will the elderly become more financially able , they will also attain a sense of belonging in the society and purpose in their lives .
Concurrently , the government can invest in other sectors , such as the research and development sector , which will indirectly aid the aged .
For instance , public facilities , such as buses , are being upgraded and improved to facilitate easier movement for the elderly and handicapped .
Also , there is ongoing medical research on senile dementia and Parkinson's disease .
All these will improve the lives of the elderly significantly .
Aging is an ongoing process .
Everybody will grow old and is bound to experience the effects of it at one point in his or her life .
Although we cannot escape from it , we can certainly make the process a less painful one to go through .
Indeed , current research and development/policies have greatly contributed in easing the aging process .
Research and development (R&D) is essential to help improve the lives of an ageing population .
Only through research and development will we be able to gain knowledge on the issues circling them and come up with ways to overcome it , for example , the development of humanoid robots in Japan which promises to free us from physical labor and help us with our household chores such as folding laundry , doing the dishes , cooking , etc .
(Adams , 2004) .
This will therefore ease the burden of people from all these time-consuming chores .
In addition to this , there is also development on robots serving as companions .
A robotic companion could add a lot of fun and excitement to the life of a lonely retiree especially .
Another R&D policy that has played a role in easing the aging process includes buses that are elderly- and handicapped-friendly .
An example would be the new SBS Transit single-deck buses that are capable in accommodating two wheelchair-bound passengers at any one time .
These new buses are also "low floor" and  for the elderly and handicapped (SBS Transit , 2007) .
Thus , by coming up with new technologies , research and development do help in easing the aging process .
Apart from research and development , policies with regard to ageing population have also helped to ease the ageing process .
These policies help the elderly to age with grace and dignity .
For example , HDB has been actively implementing various policies and improvement programs in making the elderly feel more comfortable .
One such program is the Lift Upgrading Program where the lifts will now land on every floor as compared to the past where not all public housing was provided with  access to lifts .
This does not only benefit the elderly , but the disabled as well as families with young children as well (Housing and Development Board , 2001) .
In addition to this program , HDB has also come up with a policy which encourages children to live in close proximity to their parents .
This policy provides the children to buy resale flats with a housing subsidy of $40 ,000 higher-tier Family Grant under the CPF housing grant scheme .
For singles aged 35 years and above who wish to buy a resale flat , they will be provided with a housing subsidy of $20 ,000 higher-tier Singles Grant under the scheme (Housing and Development Board , 2009) .
These policies all have the common intention of promoting the value of an extended family staying together for mutual care and support which will in turn ease the aging process of the elderly .
Research and development/policies are not the only ways in easing the aging process though .
Palliative care is now getting the recognition it deserves together with professional training and more funding .
On top of relieving a patient's pain , palliative care also lightens the emotional burden of the patient's caregiver too .
In light of the increased awareness and growing importance of palliative care , demand for it has increased .
For example , there has been a rise in the number of patient referrals to Dover Park Hospice from 680 in 2006 to 750 in 2008 ("Lifting Spirits" , 2009 , p . 13) .
By becoming more affordable , it helps to ease the financial burden of the patient and his or her family .
Although palliative care does not prolong life , it helps the ill to live meaningfully by helping to manage their pain and discomfort .
To conclude , research and development/policies have no doubt managed to ease the aging process but on top of that , palliative care also has a role to play in relieving suffering and improving the quality of life of people facing serious illnesses .
Singapore is one of the fastest ageing countries in the world .
In the year 2000 , Singapore has 7 .2% of its population aged 65 and above .
By 2030 , the ageing population in Singapore is predicted to increase to 18 .4% of the total population (as cited in Koh , 2002) .
This is a pressing issue which may lead to an economic decline as the workforce is affected .
The current research and development as well as the policies drawn are effective in alleviating the ageing process such as decline in health , economic downturn and  emotional problems of the elderly .
In this rat-raced world , everything seems to be progressing rapidly , leading to a higher standard of living .
Better medical facilities allow people to live longer but at the same time increase their cost of living as well .
As people age , their health starts to deteriorate and their savings will also decrease as the years pass .
They will not be able to afford the high medical costs and thus are unable to get proper treatment for their illness .
In this aspect , some critics argue that development in the medical field does not help address the ageing process .
However , one of the policies in Singapore includes healthcare subsidy for the elderly .
The Singapore government will provide up to 75% subsidy for the elderly provided that they are either Singapore citizens or permanent residents ; this also depends on the income of the family (Ministry of Health: Subsidies for elderly , 2007) .
This aid enables medical treatment to be more affordable .
Hence , the policy is able to ease the ageing process through care for the deteriorating health of the elderly .
Current research in the medical field is conducted to find out the causes and cures for common illnesses among the elderly such as senile dementia and Parkinson's disease .
One example is the Dementia Research Centre located at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in the United Kingdom .
It is the lead centre for finding new drugs to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (Dementia Research Centre , Queen Square , London , UK- about the DRC , 2008) .
When such research is successful , it will benefit humanity and better  medical treatments in the world .
This will decrease the suffering of the elderly , making them less susceptible to diseases  , thus helping to abate the ageing process .
There are a few measures taken by the Singapore government to ease the ageing process .
One of the measures taken is to encourage the elderly to undergo training and upgrading of their skills .
This will enable them to enter the workforce again and increase their retirement age .
The 'ADVANTAGE !
Scheme' was implemented in 2005; some companies such as  retail and logistics have adopted it to help them recruit and retain workers aged 62 and above (Ministry of Manpower , 2007) .
This will increase the retirement age of the elderly and thus improve the economy and workforce in an aging population .
Another policy is the 'Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Grant Scheme' which is a subsidy given by the government to encourage children to live in close proximity with their parents .
They will receive a  grant if they live in the same town , or 2 kilometers apart from each other if they are to stay in different towns (Housing Development Board , 2009) .
When the children live near their parents , there is a higher probability of them visiting their parents often , hence making it easier for them to take care of their parents .
Moreover , the family is able to provide emotional support for the elderly .
Hence , these development plans and policies will help to ease the ageing process of the elderly .
In conclusion ,  research conducted to discover more about the illnesses of the elderly and the policies implemented which provide subsidies as well as schemes to aid the elderly , will help to ameliorate the ageing process .
An ageing population will still be a problem in the future .
Hence , such developments and policies are vital to ease the ageing process .
Family might be a better solution to abate the process , as it is the main emotional and financial support for the elderly .
An elderly is an irreplaceable and valuable  asset that acts like glue which holds families together .
These valuable assets are deemed to increase in numbers globally .
Having one of the fastest aging populations in Asia (Chan , 2001) , Singapore faces a huge challenge in developing infrastructures and public policies in terms of healthcare , housing , re- training , transportation and financial aid to accommodate this changing age structure .
Despite the large expenses in the various aspects for the aged , these implementations would also benefit the younger generations in due course .
Hence , the government and society would have to do everything that is possible to support and prepare for the inevitable increase in the aging population even at the expense of the country's development in other areas .
Currently , the main concern for Singapore is the overwhelming baby boomers that are progressing into the senior status .
Nevertheless , the government should prioritize its spending and not neglect this aging population .
Reports have shown that (Cire , 2009) in mid 2008 , an estimated 506 million population worldwide are above 65 years old .
However , this figure will reach 1 .3 billion by 2040 .
In the context of Singapore , the aged above 65-years old are projected to represent 23% of the population by 2030 and this would be the second highest percentage in Asia after Japan (Wijaya , 2009) .
The repercussions following the aging population would be social and economic concerns as the younger generations would have to struggle to support their families .
Moreover , with less working population , Singapore's economy would be greatly affected .
Therefore ,  society should be aware of its situation and address  this problem before it becomes a severe issue for the country .
Subsequently , public spending on the different policies and infrastructures would benefit  society and support the economy in the long run .
The different policies include financial aspects like the reinforcement of individual savings through the mandatory Central Provident Fund which helps the population save for old age (Central Provident Fund Board , 2009) .
This would ease the burden on the younger generations having to support the aged .
In relation to healthcare , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stated in his National Day Rally Speech (Channel News Asia , 2009)  the development of step-down care and the strengthening of 3Ms (Medisave , Medishield and Medifund) .
The step-down care involves the government's support to the voluntary welfare organizations (VWOs) and linking community hospitals , nursing homes , general practitioners and home care together to cater to the aging population .
These policies would eventually apply to all individuals as aging is part of the human cycle .
Furthermore , it was recently announced that the government will be spending millions to encourage more people to upgrade or learn new skills by building training centres and providing training programmes (Channel News Asia , 2009) .
The government will also introduce  legislation in re-employment by 2012 (Ministry of Manpower , 2008) whereby the older workers will be able to remain active in the workforce for a longer period and save more money for their retirement .
Thus , public spending in these three important aspects of finance , healthcare and employment would be beneficial to everyone .
Critics may argue that the aging ones will eventually pass on , hence  society should focus on the younger generations as they are the talent pool of the country .
To further groom and attract these young talents , spending in areas like improving educational systems (i .e .
scholarships , awards) , technology , research and development is vital , as in the end , these young talents would be the ones supporting the economy .
Despite the importance of grooming the younger generations , one must not forget the fact that the aged population was once the pioneers that first built the economy .
Hence , we have  a moral obligation to care for the aged and not forget the roots of how the country has come thus far .
This would also be considered 
All in all , it is important that the government addresses  the needs and issues of the aging population .
More public spending on the aged is critical as this expenditure on implementation of policies or infrastructures would be an advantage to all .
Finally , this would also ease the impact of an aging population on the economy and society to the minimum .
With a paradigm shift in many countries towards a greying population , many governments are confronted with the responsibility of implementing policies that assist the ageing process .
The elderly often face emotional , mental and physical problems and if these issues are not addressed , there will be economic and social implications for the country .
Different countries respond to this problem differently and the ease with which the elderly are living their lives is evidence of the creative policies that many governments have introduced to benefit them .
As with countries face the daunting task of ensuring that the needs of their elderly population are met , Singapore is not spared .
The government estimates that by the year 2030 , 23% of its population will be over the age of 65 (Wijaya , 2009) .
Among the various policies introduced to allow the elderly to have an easier time aging include housing , employability and healthcare which will help to ease their ageing process .
Enhancing the employability of elderly workers by improving skills and retraining elder workers ensures that they have the relevant skills to take on different jobs should the need arise .
The government has also encouraged employers to be more welcoming in employing the elderly .
One such example is the Tripartite Committee which introduced the ADVANTAGE !
scheme in 2005 (Minister Gan Kim Yong , Acting  ,Minister for Manpower , 2009) .
This scheme was introduced to support companies to recruit and retain older workers as well as to re-employ them beyond age of 62 .
This ensures that companies are willing to review their work process to cater to older workers .
By introducing such policies , the government ensures that the elderly do not have to be afraid that they might face difficulties at work with rising competition from the younger generations .
Singapore: The fact that the majority of the elderly is reliant on their children for financial support still remains .
In 2005 , it was 31 .9% among those aged 55 to 64 , 55 .8% for those aged 65 to 74 and 63 .7% for those aged 75 years and above .
Shockingly , the age-support ratio has declined from 10 .4 in 1998 to 8 .4 in 2008 , resulting in a situation in which the current caregiver generation has fewer or no siblings with whom to share the burden .
Furthermore , the percentage of elderly persons aged 65 and above has increased from 6 .8% in 1998 to 8 .7% in 2008 .
Thus , the government has to critically consider these worrying demographic changes and allocate a satisfactory portion of the national budget to lighten the burden of the caregiver generation .
The first approach to reduce elder dependency is to ease barriers to elder employment and encourage the elderly to work longer and retire later (Peterson , 2001) .
According to a national survey conducted in 2005 , more than half (65 .9%) of the elderly population aged 55 and above were economically inactive .
The main reasons included retirement and a drop in their fitness and agility levels .
It was reported that the government will be raising the current retirement age of 62 to 65 by 2012 and ultimately to 67 and has also made amendments to the Retirement Age Act which increases the employability of elderly workers .
By working longer and saving more , the elderly can build up their retirement nest egg much faster than before .
Secondly , couples are encouraged to settle down early and set up families , hence , expanding the economy's size and tax base .
Meanwhile , the cost burden of providing for the elderly can be spread over a larger future generation .
(Peterson , 2001) However , the first barrier of starting a family among Singaporeans is the immense costs associated .
The housing policy alone affects the young couples' choices .
During the process of house-hunting , the initial excitement to starting a family among couples might to fade .
Bigger families require bigger homes at steep prices which force couples to reconsider  the decision to have more children .
Is it possible for a couple to purchase a spacious and comfortable place at an affordable price for a family of five ?
To make matters worse , if the retirement costs and providing for aged parents are added into the equation , having children will be the last thing on the couples' minds .
Last but not least , the strategy of emphasizing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of grown children (Peterson , 2001) is not an easy feat .
It is heartening to read that almost fourth-fifths of the elderly (76 .4% in 2005) live with their children .
However , the children are not always the party at fault .
In fact , there are some parents who do not welcome the prospect of having unmarried children in their 30s living with them as they have the perception that living with more people under the same roof requires some sacrifice of personal space and freedom .
The truth lies in the fact that singles below the age of 35 are not eligible to purchase resale flats and are not able to move out of "Hotel Mama" , their parents' flat .
In any case , humans tend to be self-centred and less obliged to give of their time beyond personal pursuits .
In any event when the government cuts down or eliminates welfare benefits due to rising elderly-related expenditure , it ought to bear in mind the net effects of such actions (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
It is obvious that the daily lives of the families will be adversely affected and the living standards will deteriorate , particularly the low-income families .
Consequently , there will be a surge in family and social problems .
The children may isolate the fragile elderly , leading to higher suicide rates and psychological problems .
Bringing the issue closer to the government ,  by the citizens will plummet and they would rather render their support for opposition parties .
In essence , while the education and defence still remains as the government's priority , it does not simply mean that expenditure for elderly welfare can be diverted to other areas .
Nowadays , the ills of old age" is no longer a topic that "only poets and philosophers" would be interested  in .
"Governments and policy makers are now confronted with the unprecedented problem of a fast an aging population ," claims Peter G . Peterson , (2001 , p66) .
Although problems related to aging population have become increasingly severe , with more  priority , governments should limit its spending on the aging population .
This is because of three reasons: an increasing spending in dealing with problems with regard to aging population would probably affect other objectives with higher priority; the  cannot solve the "ills of old age" alone; and the cost of unlimited spending on aging population cannot justify the benefits in the long run .
Firstly , with a limited budget ,  .
While someone may argue that financial support to the elders offered by a government should be increased regardless of other objectives  Since the taxes is the main resource of governments' revenue , and the tax base can hardly be increased in the short run , overspending a/ the limited budget on retirement welfare for the time being means less investing in improving infrastructure , and developing advanced technology , which could greatly accelerate economic development in the long run .
In that case , governments would have less financial flexibility due to the relatively smaller scale of economy with less tax revenue generated by the limited scale of workforce .
In real life , the shrinking workforce caused by an an aging population has contributed to a significant decline in real GDP in some developed countries such as France and Germany .
This means that the capacity that these governments have to support aging population in the long run would eventually be weakened due to a lower budget .
Secondly , the answer to the problem with regard to an an aging population should be the cooperation between the elders themselves and the government , not simply by a given priority in terms of unlimited government spending .
For example , the government could help in training elders and engaging them with more jobs .
A new welfare law with higher retirement ages could also be passed so that the elders would have more time to accumulate wealth in preparing for the future .
By doing so , government spending on aging population could be effectively reduced .
With larger part of welfare supported by elders themselves , more elder citizens would have access to limited government budget .
With a relatively higher income and a broader base of beneficiaries from the government financial support , the average elder citizen should be able to enjoy a better living quality .
Meanwhile , governments could invest more money in economic development , which is the governments' first priority , and generate more revenue to support the aging population in the future though a larger scale of economy instead of an unlimited percentage increase in government spending .
Last but not least , with an increasing aging population , the cost of easing aging-society problems through larger government spending cannot justify the benefits in the long run .
A government's first priority should be the economic development and the overall improvement of the citizens' life quality .
These goals cannot be achieved with most of the budget transferred to take care of the elders in the short run .
Thus , governments should deal with objectives with first priority and limit the budget for aging population .
In conclusion , it is clear that the problems generated by an aging population cannot be ignored .
However , government should limit the spending on aging population and take care of the objectives with higher priority first .
This is because , due to the limited budget , in order to make the cost justify the benefit for the whole society in the long run , governments have to ensure a growing economy through continuously invest in infrastructure and advance technology with most of its budget .
The problem with regard to aging population would eventually be eased through more financial support generated from a larger scale of economy instead of increasing the percentage cost of the budget and participation of the elders themselves .
''It is well known that our society is aging .
Media stories and political rhetoric abound concerning the impending demographic challenges as the population aged 65 and older is anticipated to more than double by the year 2030 ,'' (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
An increase in the population of the aging group implies there will be more government spending on the  aged .
If the population of the aging group is still expanding , the national budget will soon be drained  by supporting the  aged group with welfare treatment .
The nation will be affected if this practice continues   .Therefore , the government should amend the policy by limiting public spending on the aged so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development which will benefit the nation .
In my opinion , limited public spending on the aged enables the government to divert the money to other areas for the country's development  .
Money could be diverted to develop agriculture , medical and healthcare services , welfare program and others .
For example , the money can be used to support research such as research on hybrid seeds plant .
This will promote economic growth and increase the national income as introduction of hybrid seeds plant can increase the productivity of the crops .
There are criticisms that the  government's spending more money on the country's development will set aside the welfare of aging group .
However , if the government spends more money on the aging group , the country's development will become stagnant and imbalanced as there is a lack of funds to run the country's development projects .
if t public spending is diverted to other areas for country's development , the nation including the  aged will both gain benefits from the country's development and economic growth .
Besides that , there are other groups of population which need more money than the elderly such as the orphans , the handicapped and others .
These groups of people have to struggle for their living resources and cost of living as they are vulnerable in the society .
Often , the handicapped can hardly make a stand in applying for a job if they are to compete with the others because of their physical weaknesses and lack of living skills .
public spending will come in handy to support their living .
Some may argue that the  aged need more money as they are unable to earn income to support their living .
However , the  aged are still be able to be involved in the work field by extending their working lives and accumulating wealth for their later years .
In  contrast , the handicapped can hardly get a job , not to mention that they can accumulate wealth through working .
Therefore public spending should be diverted to other areas to help the needy and unfortunate .
Furthermore , limited public spending on the elderly can encourage the grown-up children to take up their filial responsibility .
If the government reduces public spending on elders , those whose living cost depends on the public spending have to rely on their children for support .
In the past , the elders have worked hard to raise their children and provide the best for their children .
Hence , the grown children should appreciate their upbringing and take good care of them in return .
There may be opposing views which claims that the grown children do not have much money to support the elderly as they have their own families to support .
Nevertheless , the grown children can actually do some adjustments to their monthly expenditure by practicing cost saving to have sufficient money to support their own family and their elder's living cost .
This will increase the willingness of the grown children to take care of their parents and realize their obligation to their parents .
In a nutshell , government should change their mindset and policy in order to meet the modern challenges .
Policy maker should limit public spending on the aged and divert money to other country's development to maintain a balance development of the country .
Or else , the country development would be stagnant and the nation would not have to live in a comfortable life .
If the government helps the senior citizens with public spending by constraining the fiscal cost on other areas of country development , the government would actually put the country in a straggling condition .
Due to poor fertility rates and late marriages , the government is now confronted with the problem of an aging population .
This is a phenomenon with dire consequences , such as having to direct large amounts of money to take care of the elderly .
Examples include a need to build facilities that are elderly-friendly and heavy subsidizing  their medical fees due to their poor health and low income .
Although forking out a lump sum of money for medical fees is inevitable , the government should not neglect the economic growth of the country .
Thus funding for the elderly medical fees should be limited so as to divert funds to other areas which are more necessary for improvement .
We cannot deny the fact that what we have today is a result of the hard work of the elderly in their prime years .
It is only right that the government takes care of them , and spends vast amounts of money on them with no questions asked .
Critics of this approach have argued that if the government continues spending , more tax will be imposed on each working individual and elder dependency will rise .
It would be very stressful for them , having to keep up with both the pace of work and tax expenses .
Furthermore , there are key areas such as tourism , education and technology which will produce significant results if enough resources are channeled to them .
Other than the government spending  , there are other alternatives which can be implemented to remedy the situation .
Firstly , it is through stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow's grown children , however numerous or productive  , to support their own elderly parents through informal and familial channels .
(Peterson .P , 2001) .
This is a social responsibility for each working individual , and it is often easier to get people to be socially responsible than to increase their tax contributions .
The government should give incentives to children who live near their parents , such as cheaper housing , or give priority to them when allocating flats .
Secondly , it is by requiring people to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency .
They should be encouraged or compelled by law to save and invest more of their income earned while they are active in the work force .
(Paterson ,P . ,2001 2001) .
Minor monthly contributions made during their working years will definitely accumulate to a substantial pool of wealth for their retirement days .
Diverting funds to other more vital areas of improvements has its benefits too .
Firstly , there will be economic growth and country prosperity .
Singapore has strived hard to achieve the status as a tourism hub , and the revenue that could be generated from it alone should never be overlooked .
Therefore , if more funds are diverted to it instead of to the  elderly , there is no doubt that the country will experience tremendous economic growth and be prosperous .
Secondly , the future workforce of the country will be very productive .
A productive workforce is often defined as one which possesses the best qualifications , and education emphasis is the only way to go about it .
Thus , expanding the current budget on education will surely result in a larger and more affluent generation in the future .
Spending on the elderly is necessary , and it could be done on a ration basis .
We've discussed the far-reaching effects of diverting to other more vital areas of improvement and it outweighs any existing issues .
There are also other available alternatives which could be implemented to deal with the medical needs of the elderly , such as stressing filial obligations and introducing retirement schemes .
The limit , however , should be duly considered by the government in line with its current policies .
In a survey conducted by Manpower Incorporated , 40% of global leaders felt that introducing population was to be one of the most crucial problems in the future (AARP Multinational Survey of Opinion Leaders 2006 , March 2007) .
Thus it comes as no surprise that governments around the world have stepped up their efforts to alleviate the effects of global aging .
The social policies adopted have greatly introduced the older population into the workforce and the volunteering sector , thus keeping them actively involved in the community and easing the aging process to a large extent .
Firstly , governments have reduced the dangers of an ageing population by encouraging retirees to participate actively in volunteering (MCYS Media Release No .
03/2008) to increase their mental alertness and at the same time tap on their wisdom to aid the community .
However , critics argue that citizens are unaware of these volunteering opportunities .
Also , they contend that most would be unwilling to volunteer during their 'golden years' , thus wasting the government's efforts to increase volunteering opportunities for the elder population .
This claim is flawed as the government has been stepping up its efforts to increase awareness of elder volunteerism through public campaigns and functions .
Fairs have also been organised to encourage active ageing through volunteerism (MCYS Media Release No .
03/2008) .
As a result , there has been a rising number of senior volunteers over the years .
The Retired and Senior Volunteers Programme (RSVP) is an example of an avenue that provides opportunities for retirees to volunteer and use their skills to help others and also nurture new skills along the way .
To date , it has over 500 , 000 volunteers (Senior corps , electronic reference) , thus proving wrong the notion that people are unaware and uninterested to volunteer in their 'golden years' .
The high membership is testimony to the fact that volunteering will give the elderly spiritual fulfillment in their later years .
Secondly , governments in affected countries have introduced incentives to encourage companies to hire and retrain older workers , thus boosting the workforce and easing the aging process .
This will ensure that the huge older population can contribute effectively to the workforce .
Also , they will be able to accumulate more savings and not be over-reliant on the government for pension benefits .
This policy has been effective as surveys have proved that with the retraining and incentives to hire older workers put in place , employers have been increasingly open about hiring older workers .
According to a survey conducted by Manpower Incorporated in October 2006 , 48% and 43% of employers had strategies to hire and preserve older Singaporean workers respectively , whereas in Japan , 83% of employers had strategies to preserve older workers .
This proves that the governments' strategies to promote the hiring of older workers into the workforce have been effective .
According to  Singapore's Ministerial Committee on Ageing (MCA) , employment of Singapore citizens aged 55 to 64 increased from 53 .7% in 2006 to 56 .2% in 2007 (MCYS Media Release No .
03/2008) .
This shows that the retraining of skills have indeed helped older workers to become more productive leading to the increased willingness of employers to hire them .
Lastly , the Singapore government has been encouraging citizens to retire later to accumulate more savings .
As a result , Singaporean working males aged 60 to 64 increased from 49% in 1996 to 63% in 2006 , while the number of  females increased from 15% to 26% (Ministry of Manpower Press Release , 22/2/07) .
This proves that the government's promotion of a longer working life have effectively influenced the mindset and convinced the older population to contribute to the workforce for a longer period of time .
Fiscal cost that was previously used to distribute pension benefits to retirees could now be diverted to funding retraining programmes and monetary incentives to companies to hire and retrain older workers , thus further boosting the economy .
Facing an ageing population , the Singapore government had done research and development to improve the ageing process .
This is so that we will be able to harness the social possibilities , while at the same time , prepare to tackle challenges arising from the ageing population .
The ageing process brings to mind deteriorating health  which requires lots of medical attention .
To make matters worse , social problems such as disrespectfulness and the lack of filial piety among the younger generations arises .
This would lead to emotional problems , where an elderly feels like the "leftover of society" .
Gerard Ee , chairman of Council for Third Age said , we have to deal with housing , health , financial needs and accessibility before older people can be fully integrated into society .
Singapore has looked into the development of infrastructure to create a barrier free society for the elderly .
The main areas of concerns were the Housing Development Board (HDB) precincts and public transport island wide .
Firstly , the government  launched the Lift Upgrading Programme for the benefit of flat owners without direct access to lifts .
By doing so , elderly can then conveniently leave their HDB homes to access shops and services within the precinct (HDB , 2001) .
Next , new buses are now designed with low floors step-free and wheelchair accessible .
According to the Committee of Aging Issues (CAI) , a barrier free environment is important to allow senior citizens to live independently and move out into the community to participate actively in society (CAI , 2006) .
The newly designed buses complement the elder friendly Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) systems , making Singapore an accessible city for all .
Hence , today's elderly has unobstructed access from homes to public amenities , communal and recreational facilities .
In recognition of what the government has done , people have begun to ask if these improvements could really ease the ageing process .
Now elderly are given more access to the public , but the ultimate choice still lies with them .
What could be hindering the decision is their children's disapproval or even themselves .
This is the case as most people will agree that elderly are not able to take care of themselves outside .
We cannot deny the fact that they require more response time and have certain constraints in physical movements .
A little carelessness on the road could cause accidents , thus creating more burdens to their love ones .
Also , they are usually the victims of crime .
However , the government has been creating awareness on looking out for each other especially the elderly in society .
For example , from young , schools teach civic and moral education to educate us on how to take care of the elderly , to be patient with them , to respect them and even offer help to them .
Television programs such as Crime Watch also increases the knowledge of elderly to be wary of conmen and to prevent crime by not wearing excessive valuables .
The second area of research and development is on dementia .
Researchers found that people who retired later are able to avoid Alzheimer's disease longer than people who retired earlier (The Straits Times , 2009) .
The first way of tackling this issue is to raise the retirement age to 62 years old .
This not only keeps the elderly mind active , it also helps them to cope financially with rising medical costs and brings in self-satisfaction for being able to contribute to the society .
Secondly , CAI emphasizes  having strong family ties across generations to ensure that the family continues to be the first line of support .
This is essential to the elderly so they will not feel so helpless and unwanted .
Lastly , the Government has also encouraged activities and interactions by setting up elderly corners at void decks with facilities such as chess tables .
The aim is to prevent the elderly from shutting themselves out of the society , resulting in mind-robbing Alzheimer's disease .
In conclusion , the current research and development approaches adopted by the Singapore Government are helpful to a large extent in easing the ageing process .
With the development of infrastructure and medical field as mentioned above , these problems are better handled .
The elderly can now move around independently and conveniently , decreasing the burden on working adults .
The aging population has been an ongoing problem in  countries over the world .
It is not much of a difference in Singapore as the Strait Times (2009) stated that there has been an increase in the aging population to about 300 ,000 people who are over the age of 65 today and this figure is expected to increase to 900 ,000 by 2030 .
This shows that more attention is required for the aging population  to prepare it to embrace these elderly in the near future .
Hence , the public spending on the aged should not be limited and  be spent on other areas of the country's development as the money is needed for the healthcare and financial needs needsr the aged .
As one gets older , one is more vulnerable to illness which explains the need of spending on the healthcare industry .
In the CIA factbook (2009) , the life expectancy for Singapore is 81 .98 years , which is ranked fourth in the world .
This means that the aged would live longer and drain their family's and their own savings as the hospital fees are costly and thus more subsidies are required (Friedland & Summer , 2005 , p .g .17) .
Moreover , money is also needed to provide the prevention and screenings programmes for the elderly and to educate them about the benefits of having a healthy lifestyle and ways to stay healthy .
These screenings can also help to identify potential health problems that they might have and get them to seek treatment before it worsens and disrupts their daily activities .
Hence , spending on elderly healthcare is necessary as it helps to educate the elderly on the importance of a healthy lifestyle while reducing the burden on the elderly and their family for the costly healthcare services .
Moreover , there is a high chance that the elderly may use up their retirement savings on healthcare and daily necessities despite the implementation of Central Provident Fund (CPF) to lessen their burden .
Dr Ng (2007) stated that CPF members would also use up their CPF account in time due to the higher standard of living in the future .
In addition , based on Statistic Singapore (2008) , the old age support ratio has decreased from 11 .8 in 1990 to 8 .4 in 2008 .
This shows that there are fewer young working adults to support the elderly .
It also signifies that the elderly has to either prolong retirement or increase their saving in order to support themselves after retirement .
Therefore , retraining is needed for the elderly as through  retraining , they can upgrade their skills and adapt to the demanding working environment to save  for the future and contribute to the economy .
Hence , spending on pension and retraining for the elderly is essential and should not be limited as it aids them in being financially independent after retirement .
On the other hand , money is also needed in the other areas of development like education .
Education plays an important part in the country's development and growth as it helps in nurturing the young who are the country's future .
Thus , the expenditure on education is also important instead of focusing on the aging population .
Nevertheless , the Ministry of Finance (2009) had stated that they are planning to provide quality education by setting aside $4 .4 billion for basic education for the young and $3 .5 billion for the higher educational institutions like the polytechnics and universities .
This is in the hope of improving the education sector and nurture the young better for the future of Singapore .
Moreover , the Ministry of Education (2009) had also stated that the budget for education had increased by 5 .5% .
Hence , this shows that despite the increase in the spending for the aged , it does not mean that the other areas of development will be neglected as each development plays an important part in the growth of the country .
In conclusion , spending on the aged should not be limited due to costly healthcare expenses and limited retirement saving for the future .
These expenditures can help to improve the lifestyle of elderly and being healthy the elderly will be able to prolong their retirement which in turn helps in improving the economy .
Hence , not only the country but its people will also benefit from the economic growth .
27 .3% of Singapore's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is attributed to the manufacturing sector (Nah , March 2006) .
The manufacturing industry in Singapore is one of the important growth engines of the economy .
A large amount of money is diverted to the R&D (Research & Development) sector to give Singapore a competitive edge over its competitors .
But this has resulted in uproars from the people and they claim that more resources should be diverted into the welfare schemes for the aged instead .
So , who is defined as the aged ?
Currently there is no fixed age group where the aged is clearly defined .
Regardless of how the aged is defined , no human is able to survive without money in this current world .
Therefore in order for the aged to be better off , the Singapore economy has to be constantly growing and this can be achieved by diverting more resources into our R&D sector so the local products will be greatly differentiated and value added .
There is a common misconception that most welfare states end up being in debt and the people have a higher tendency to be over-reliant .
However there are no statistics to show that higher government expenditure on the social welfare leads to lower growth and lower productivity .
Well known welfare states such as Germany and Denmark do not necessarily do better or worse  economically than countries which have limited social expenditure such as Japan .
Denmark's welfare expenditure contributes to 37 .9% of the nation's GDP and the GDP per capita (PPPUS$) is $37 ,265 whereas Japan's welfare expenditure contributes to 16 .9% of the nation's GDP and its GDP per capita (PPPUS$) is $38 ,559 (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2001) .
From these statistics , we can conclude that it is also possible for Singapore to learn from these success stories and increase welfare expenditure while achieving economic growth at the same time .
Singapore is different from the welfare states in Europe such as Germany and Denmark .
Singapore is practicing the open market policy and thus is more susceptible to external factors .
A recent example would be when the United States's economy fell during the credit crisis , Singapore was badly impacted by the recession .
One of the major growth engines in the Singapore's economy is the manufacturing sector .
Unlike China which has abundance in labour , Singapore on the other hand has little natural resources and is unable to compete with China on a large scale .
(Singapore , a small country with limited resources can outperform others by) distinguishing our manufacturing goods by investing more money to invent cutting edge technology , to increase efficiency , to make our products unique and competitive in the market .
In order to finance the current schemes in Singapore , the economy has to be growing first so that it could support its schemes .
Currently Government Health Expenditure has been limited at 0 .9% from 2005 to 2007(Ministry of Health [MOH] , 2001) .
Since Government Health Expenditure is capped at a percentage of GDP regardless of boom or bust in the economy , therefore the amount of money diverted to Health Expenditure in a bullish economy is higher than when it is during a bearish economy .
As the saying goes "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime" This is especially true for the senior citizens whose skills are outdated in the current society but have an able body to earn an income for themselves .
Instead of diverting resources to finance the welfare schemes , the government should instead divert resources into retraining and integrating the senior citizens back into the work force .
Senior citizens possess a large amount of experience which is valuable to the younger generation now , thus they are more of an asset than a liability .
"For every working adult in Singapore , He/She has to support 8 .4 elderly residents aged 65 years and above (Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports [MCYS] 2008) .
Therefore to ease the burden on the younger generation who has to support the post baby boomers as they approach their retirement years , it would be a win-win situation if we integrate senior citizens back into the work force .
As countries differ both ideologically and geographically , there is no one solution that solves the current situation of an aging population .
Thus with different government's goals , the solution will be adjusted to suit the country .
But in Singapore's context , Singapore does not have any natural resources and (we) dependent on innovation and creativity to gain an advantage over its competitors .
In order to finance these welfare programs , we need to divert resources to other areas in order to have continuous growth in Singapore .
However government intervention alone is insufficient to finance the welfare schemes alone .
Thus it has included private charity organization such as National Council of Social Service (NCSS) to attend to the needs of the aged and the needy together with the help of the government .
Most importantly is the care and concern from the family which is vital to the well being of the elderly .
The BCA has acknowledged the aging problems in Singapore and released a series of Home improvement designs to cater to the needs of an aging population in Singapore .
Those designs include the manoeuvring space for wheel chair bound elderly , visuals and vibration door bells for elderly with hearing impairment and additional safety features like emergency bells in toilets .
All these features will enhance the life of the elderly as they can perform daily duties with ease .
These also allow the elderly to be independent as they no longer need to rely on others' help in their daily life .
Bus service provider SBS transit took the lead to introduce the elderly and handicap friendly buses in 2007 .
The low floor and zero stepped bus is an initiative by the SBS to ease the travelling journey for the elderly .
"This means that the elderly and other less mobile passengers will be able to board and alight easily .
This is especially important given Singapore's ageing population ."
(SBS Transit , 2007) .
It is an important innovation by  transport company , as it showcases its determination to improve the local transport facilities to facilitate the transportation for the ones with special needs .
Land Transport Authority (LTA) did their part by introducing the new elderly- friendly traffic system in March 2009 .
Making use of the new Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology , "Traffic lights will open their eyes to keep a look out for elderly pedestrians" (LTA , 2009) .
With the new technology , traffic lights will detect any/an elderly that's still crossing the roads and adjust the timing accordingly .
With this system in place , fewer traffic accidents involving slower moving elderly are expected , as it allows the elderly to finish crossing before the drivers are signalled to go .
Preliminary rounds of test involving 30 elderly pedestrians show that the new system is welcomed by the elderly .
Local technology company ALCOM recently came up with the elderly friendly GSM mobile phone during the COMEX 2009 .
The simple mobile phone captures the essential needs of the elderly in a simple package .
It has big key pads , easy call and hang up buttons , basic SMS functions and Phonebook memory .
It provides additional functions like quick dial buttons for them to gain quick access to those they contact very often .
The SOS button behind the phone will provide instant access to their family members in times of emergency .
The launch of this mobile phone has made communicating easier and inevitably eased the process of communication for elderly .
Despite numerous efforts to ease the process of ageing , government agencies seem to forget  the basic survival requirements for the elderly .
Most of the above technologies come with a price , and not having enough cash for the elderly is effectively cutting off all their access to the aids provided for them .
"By 2013 , those with less than the Minimum Sum of $120 ,000 and the Medisave Required Amount of $25 ,000 (currently $11 ,500) , will not be able to withdraw any CPF money" (Leong , 2007) .
With the increase of minimum sum to $120 ,000 in 2013 , many lower income workers will not meet the requirements as their CPF savings are used to finance their home loan and children's tertiary education .
Together with the increase of unemployment rates in Singapore , it presents a worrying trend of its citizens entering the retirement age of their life .
Understanding the needs of its citizens , Housing Development Board (HDB) introduced the "Lease Buyback Scheme" in March 2009 (HDB Info Web , 2009) .
The scheme aims to allow lower income families to cash out part of their money locked in the HDB flat and still be able to retain the flat for stay .
Current Research and Developments like the Home improvement designs from BCA , elderly - friendly buses from SBS transit , RFID traffic lights from LTA and GSM phones from ALCOM all hope to achieve the ultimate target of an easier life for the elderly .
Together with the government's policies to improve financial independence of the elderly , their life will definitely be greatly enhanced by the new innovations .
In this economy driven society , taking too much of the public's resources to support the elderly does not bode well for the future of the country .
Therefore , placing a cap on  public spending to support the aged should be implemented .
By limiting the resources used on the aged , other developments of the country can be better financed in order to drive the country forward .
The public spending used for the elderly such as healthcare , pension and welfare programs can be diverted into development sectors instead .
For example , the education for our youths , the nurturing of the country's youth is more important as these are the people who will eventually be the ones to carry the responsibility of maintaining the economic state of the country and to ensure a brighter future for her people .
A total budget of $8 ,701 million has been voted to MOE in FY2009 (Singapore Budget , 2009) , most of which goes into the subsidising of school fees for local students .
This ensures that Singapore youngsters get a chance at education regardless of their financial status .
By exposing every possible citizen to education , Singapore then , will she be able to continue in development .
Singapore being a resource scarce country , the only resource we can make use of is our people .
Therefore funds should go into the upbringing of the people who are able to drive the country forward in the future .
Another development sector to which Singapore directs most of its funds is to our defenses .
In the 2009 government budget , the defense sector alone accounted for 11 .4 billion Singapore dollars , which is equivalent to more than a quarter of the country's' spending (Singapore budget , 2009) .
With the recent increase in terrorism , it is important that such a huge amount goes into protecting the people of Singapore .
Some may argue that , as much as youths are our country's future , we cannot neglect the fact that these are the elders that have paved a path for the next generation to come .
Their contribution to the society should at least be recognized and to a certain extent rewarded  .
Some may argue that the incentives given by the government now are more than enough; however ,  the number of elderly people with no homes is still alarming till date .
If the government were doing enough , no elderly should be seen sleeping on chairs in parks .
They should  be instead living comfortably in their homes enjoying the fruits of their labor .
Thus limiting the funds in this sector would mean restrictions placed around how much can be done to help these people .
On the other hand , as mentioned , in this economy driven world , it would be impractical to focus our finances on the people who are no longer efficient in what they used to do .
The country will simply be burdened by placing more funds into rewarding or simply sustaining the elderly .
They should have had savings in either the form of cash or CPF to sustain them , alongside with subsides from the government to help loosen the dependency on others for help .
The rewarding of the elderly does not push the country forward , whereas it is the upbringing of our youth that will ensure a future for our country .
There is too much human factor involved when it comes to whether elders should get more funds to help them cope in their latter days , which should not be part of any equation when other development sectors can benefit instead .
In sum , the limitation of public spending on the elderly and diverting it to other developments would serve well in driving the country forward .
On one hand it is only moral that they are well taken care because of the fact that they are the ones who contributed to the society before a new generation took over , while on the other hand  allocating more public spending to them would hinder the growth of the country as a whole .
Trading the future for the past is simply not a practical choice .
Singapore has one of the fastest aging populations in the world , with people over 65 years old estimated by 2030 to make up 23% of the population , making Singapore the country with the second highest percentage of this age group in Asia just behind Japan (Asia Times , 2009) .
With the growing number of the aged in Singapore , the government should establish its bottom line for financing public healthcare for the elderly .
However , the government should also plan and allocate its expenditures on other areas appropriately in order to fuel the country's development .
A country cannot afford to spend too much on the elderly because of practical realities .
Some people think that the government has a moral obligation to do all that it can to support the elderly .
The high standard of living in many developed countries causes greater difficulties for working adults to support their parents' medical expenses and still take care of their children's needs .
In addition , rising medical cost makes it more imperative for the elderly to receive help in order to support their medical needs in the future .
However , this is not a practicable solution .
Other than the elderly , there are also other groups of people equally in need of the government support to help them .
People like the handicapped , intellectually disabled and single mothers also experience great difficulty in living in Singapore where cost of living is relatively high .
The government should spread out its public spending to the various groups of people in need instead of just focusing on the elderly .
The government's moral obligation should not be supporting the elderly only .
Technology is an important area of development that will benefit everyone in the country .
Increasing public spending on technology would lead to an increased activity in Research and Development (R&D) and new advancement in technology .
Certain new innovations brought about by the rise of R&D activities would in turn help the needy people improve their living standards .
Some examples are the invention of a robot that is able to do household chores and the modification of public buses that can accommodate the elderly and the handicapped .
Advancement in technology will also attract more investors and business opportunities to the country that will contribute to the country's economic growth .
Investing in technology would not just benefit the needy people but also the people as a whole in the country .
Military spending is crucial in maintaining an 'insurance policy' with no buffer zone against potential aggressors .
In 2009 , more than a quarter of the country's expenditure , or $11 .4 billion , had been directed to defence - an increase of 5 .6 per cent over the previous year's budget (Singapore Budget , 2009) .
This has shown the importance the government places on the Singapore defence .
Singapore sees terrorism as one of the biggest threats to its security and economy .
Attacks in recent years in the United States and neighbouring countries such as Indonesia have prompted it to increase its vigilance against similar risks .
With the threat of terrorism intensifying , Singapore should never let its guard down but invest more on its defence in order to be more vigilant .
Military spending should be  one of the top priorities of the government as it concerns the safety and security of everybody in Singapore .
In summation , it is important that the government continue to provide financial assistance for the elderly due to the increasing number of senior citizens .
However , this public spending should not be done at the expense of other expenditures that concern the country as a whole such as technology and defence .
Investing in technology and defence will eventually benefit everyone in Singapore including the elderly and other people in need in terms of better living condition and greater security .
Singapore government should continue to be cautious about how it allocates its expenditure such that it will bring the utmost profit to the country .
The 'greying of society' has become a serious issue for several developing and developed countries  today .
There are several aspects of this issue that prove to be a cause for concern and public spending is seen as one of the ways to curb the problems .
However , failure to efficiently plan public spending can have disastrous effects on the society and the nation at large especially in the current phase of global economic crisis .
For example , in Singapore , the economy has been projected to shrink by 6 .4 to 9 .6%  Therefore to ensure effective public spending , funds should be channelled to several other economic and social aspects of the country's development by limiting spending on the aged .
To begin with , the current global economic climate is not helping matters much .
Therefore , firstly , money should be diverted to the economic sector , for the  stimulation of the domestic economy .
For example , the $20 .5 billion resilience package announced by the government of Singapore is intended to save jobs by helping valuable companies survive the recession , prepare for the near future , increase the competitiveness of the country and prevent a further slump in the economy (The Online Citizen , 2009) .
assistance schemes such as the 'GST' offsets , rebates , service and conservancy charge rebates serve to act as a stimulus for the country in the hope that the people will spend more to keep the economy afloat .
In the face of such a situation , spending on the aged is of least priority .
The second way in which money can be diverted into the economy is through spending on infrastructure .
Banking , communication and transportation are just some examples of infrastructure that a country needs to invest in to stay ahead in the age of globalisation .
Such investments will provide stability to the country in the long-run as it increases the confidence of potential investors .
Investments in communication and transportation make the country more 'accessible' , hence promoting both local and overseas investments .
However , on the other hand , critics argue that the economic growth alone does not dictate a country's development .
They claim that spending on the aged is as important .
According to Peter G . Peterson (2001) , "demographic changes such as the increasing population of the aged will have a serious consequence on healthcare issues in developed countries" and he also goes on to advocate ways to spend on healthcare .
But if this spending can be alternatively channelled into other sectors of the country's development , such as infrastructure and domestic economy as mentioned above , the country will achieve long-term success and stability .
Hence , the demographics of a country alone does not determine its destiny .
Therefore , public spending should be spent on a country's economic development .
Another way in which money can be well spent on the country's development would be to spend on societal needs such as education and general healthcare .
As the saying goes , "knowledge is power" and rightly so .
Singapore was able to pull itself out of the rut from a third world country to a first world country in one generation due to its focus on well utilised human resource .
And the main contributor was education .
Public spending on education accounts for 19 .3% of the total budget and is second in terms of priority in spending only to defence (Singapore Budget , 2006) .
A well educated society will always be at an advantage and this will act as a catalyst for further growth in several other sectors in Singapore's economy .
Hence , a knowledge based economy will propel the nation into societal development .
The flipside to this issue is that , sectors such as healthcare play an important role in a country's societal development too .
Public spending on aged healthcare accounts for the bulk of the spending which is precisely why it should be limited .
Children of the aged should be given more responsibility for shouldering the financial needs of their parents rather than the government .
This allows money to be spent on more pertinent sectors such as education which has been a traditional source of growth for Singapore .
Hence , public spending on the economy and other aspects of society outweigh spending on the aged as money can be better utilized elsewhere for a country's development .
A failure in proper public spending would therefore cripple the country and its development .
The issue of a graying population was highlighted in Mehta and Wee (2004) , who reported that one out of four Singaporeans will be 60 years and above by 2030 .
(p .105) .
In other words , there will be a significant portion of the nation's populace being senior citizens in the near future .
To facilitate the aging process , the Singapore government has since build on existing policies as well as developed new ones that are pertinent to the current society .
First and foremost , as Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports has announced , a law was revised in 1996 for aged parents to seek maintenance from their children , who are capable of supporting them and yet unwilling to do so .
In this aspect , the government is entirely supportive of children fulfilling their filial obligations .
The law advocates that adult children  care for their aged parents instead of leaving them alone by themselves to integrate with the society and find their means of survival .
This was further supported by Peterson (2001) who has also brought up the concept of children's responsibility in maintaining elderly parents .
(p .6) .
Secondly , the Central Provident Fund (CPF) was cleverly devised as a social safety net for every Singaporean adult and his or her family members who are reliant on them .
Every month , a portion of the individual's income goes into the CPF .
The total sum will then be released to the individual on monthly basis once he or she is above 60 years old and is no longer working until the sum is exhausted .
This will then aid the retirement process .
In fact in Mehta and Wee (2004) , when a minimum amount of money is used to buy a life annuity from an official insurance company or bank , the retiree will obtain a flat monthly income for life even if he or she outlives the balance in the annuity account .
(p .96) .
A MediShield scheme is also part of CPF where money can be utilized for part of the hospital bills and costly medical expenses .
In spite of the CPF being in favour for retirees or to alleviate medical expenses incurred , not everyone in the Singapore population would stand to gain from it .
In the society , there is still a fraction who remain jobless or whose jobs do not provide a steady contribution to the CPF .
This means that upon retirement , there will be those who are not entitled to receive a fixed amount monthly or be subsidized partially for their healthcare expenditure .
As age increases , chronic illnesses inevitably rise alongside and the burden of medical cost may simply be too much for one to bear .
To make matters worse , treatment of illnesses goes beyond long hospital stays; it stretches on after discharge and includes the need for rehabilitation , medication and so on .
Unfortunately , amidst the other expenditures such as housing rentals and utilities bills , families usually opt to decline treatment or even ignore their chronically ill parents .
In fact , there are even cases where adult children abandon their parents in nursing homes to fend for themselves .
On the other side of the coin , as in Mehta and Wee (2004) , the PAP government has promised that no Singaporean will be deprived of basic hospital care even if he or she is incapable of paying for it .
(p .99) .
Thus , a MediFund scheme which is not part of CPF and is non-contributory was devised .
The fund comes from  the government budgetary surpluses .
Additionally , the government has also provided a sum of $30 million for National Council of Social Services (NCSS) and those under its umbrella to execute a range of social services .
These finances will definitely relieve the burdens shouldered by individuals without the CPF .
Social workers are also planted in the society who can direct families to appropriate helplines for instance , the rent and utilities assistance scheme (RUAS) whenever the need arises .
Therefore , in any area where individuals require assistance , be it medical affairs or retirement issues , there is always a policy or two which one can turn to for alleviation of one's current situation .
Indeed , the government has come up with numerous policies and measures to help smooth the process of aging .
A fast aging population is an issue that most countries including Singapore cannot avoid .
Several problems which relate to the issue include health , financial and welfare problems of the elderly have come under the concern of the government .
Solutions such as having different subsidy frameworks for community hospitals to help patients to cope with the expensive bills (Ministry of Health [MOH] , 2009) and monthly Transport allowance for the elderly who visit day-care centres (Lin , 2008) were implemented to ease the tension that fast aging has brought to the low-income elderly .
A decrease in the labour force due to retiring workers and the need to provide the elderly with a place to stay are the issues that the Singapore government is working on now .
Fast ageing in Singapore has certainly affected its labour market as the  retirement rate increases .
A research report done by the Ministry of Manpower Singapore in year 1999 showed that in year 2020 proportion of the elderly will be increased to 32% compared to 16% in 1998 (Ministry of Manpower [MOM] , 1999) .
This implies that there will be a labour shortage of experienced workers who are able to contribute to the labour force after they have retired .
For example , new workers who are hired to fill the vacancy of the retired workers often lack experience and knowledge .
As a result , the workers might not be able to complete the task due to their minimum knowledge and skills; therefore , , the functioning of the company will be affected (MOM , 1999) .
One of the solutions to minimize the impact of labour shortage could be to re-employ the retired workers and allow them to guide the new workers on the job as well as share their working experience that will benefit the new workers .
Providing shelter to the single or low-income elderly is one of the priorities in the housing estate development program .
Single or low-income elderly could choose to rent a flat from the Housing Development Board (HDB) or downgrade their current flat to a smaller one as this will allow the elderly to have extra cash for them to spend after their retirement .
HDB will also be building more compact and affordable 30-year lease studio apartments to cater to the demand for the elderly  aged 55 and above (Tan , 2009) .
Besides that , more HDB rental flats will also be upgraded with more Elderly-Friendly Facilities .
These include having lifts on every floor , installing features like support handbars in the toilets and along common corridors to assist in the mobility of the elderly and installing an alert alarm system in the house when the elderly residents need  any emergency help (Housing & Development Board [HDB] , 2005) .
No matter how many hardware facilities are installed to improve the living environment of the elderly , they still feel empty and lonely especially if they have no family .
According to a health related article published by Changi General Hospital , the elderly tend to be at a much higher risk of depression and suicide than the young as they are facing several changes in their life such as illnesses , loss of family members , life partners and friends as well as financial issues which include loss of income after retirement (Changi General Hospital [CG] , n .d .) .
Therefore , several voluntary programs have been implemented to serve as a helping hand to the elderly .
Programs include The Befriender Service , provided by Lions Befrienders who work closely with Central Singapore ComCare Local Networks (CLN) to ease the loneliness , isolation and boredom of the single elderly and the homebound and also provide services such as advice and assistance to the elderly (Central Singapore ComCare Local Networks , n .d .) .
Coping with fast ageing among Singaporeans is a slow and tough process which requires both the government and its citizens to work closely together .
Either encouraging retired workers to return to the work force or providing a decent shelter for the low income elderly will definitely send a positive message to the elderly that they are not being abandoned and they are still recognised by the society .
Programs such as visiting the elderly or providing assistance to the elderly will also increase their confidence to engage the society again .
In the near future , the tax burden on each  working adult will increase due to the  aging population .
It may not seem like a major issue in Singapore from the public's eyes , but it will not be so in the near future .
The old age dependency ratio will increase from one elder adult relying on 10 working adults in 2000 to 3 working adults in 2030 .
(Fu & Hughes , 2009 , p .g .124) . 
Singapore has a population of 4 .8 million and 8 .7% percent of them are aged .
The aged are part of the society; we should also take into consideration their needs (Singstat , 2008 , p .g .1) .
With limitations to  . . .(what ?
) , it will create more social problems and repercussions that result in higher costs that far exceed the amount of money that was transferred to other developments .
Due to the decrease in healthcare aid for elderly , lack of community hospitals and nursing homes , social problems will be generated .
The outcome would be homeless elderly turning into beggars and outbreak of diseases as healthcare becomes unaffordable for them to maintain and hygiene becomes an issue .
Investors and tourists would be deterred from entering Singapore as this does not reflect the branding of Singapore to be clean , green and having a stable economy .
The government might end up paying more for the aftermath just 
The spending on the aged should be treated as a social and economic development which prepares healthcare facilities for the society as a whole and boosts healthcare spending by the tourists .
Investing in healthcare facilities and medical insurance for the elderly will result in a high profile , risk free , user friendly , low cost and safe healthcare solution that does not just benefit the elderly but the society as a whole (Munshi , 2007 , p .g .1) .
In times of recession , the spending on the aged would have a direct relation to employment as there will be more labour required to take care of the elderly .
This employment can help to spur economic growth and help in recession .
Singapore is seen as a medical hub due to its excellent geographical location and provision of top notch healthcare services .
Thus , the spending in a way brings in medical tourism revenues for healthcare services and tourism for the medical travellers (Yin , 2009 , p .g .1) .
Treatments that take up to years may result in migration of the family of the sick; this eventually snowballs to a few million dollars of revenue for the tourism industry .
On the other hand , public spending on the aged should be limited and chanelled to the less well-off section of the society .
With consumer price index (CPI) for low income groups rising to 7 .5% in June 2008 and developments in globalization , vast income inequalities are created in Singapore (Singstat , 2008 , p .g .1) .
The Department of Statistics (2008) reported that 14 .8% of households here earned $2 ,000 or less a month in 2008 , which explains the need for more money to be pumped into the social safety net .
However , there are initiatives such as Comcare Fund , which assists the less privileged group in Singapore .
The Comcare Fund's budget is $63 .7 million in 2008 and this amount is estimated to be $168 million in this financial year (MCYS , 2008 , pg .1) .
MCYS would also adjust the budget according to situations such as setting aside $1million to help the needy cope with inflation (Majid , 2008 , p .g1) Hence , the Government has provided an effective social safety net that provides assistance yet at the same time promotes self-reliance among the needy .
It also portrays an image that the Government is concerned with other developments in Singapore other than the aged .
To sum up , the spending on the aged should not be limited as it spurs economic growth and prepares the healthcare industry to combat this pressing issue .
In the future , the effects of aging population would have a much greater impact on Singapore and all resources assigned to the developments should be prioritized based on expediency .
The policies and investments on the aged for today is the preparation by the Government to mould a better future for tomorrow .
Upgrading of housing by the HDB , particularly for the households with elderly residents , has helped to ease the aging process .
Facilities within the blocks were enhanced significantly to aid  the day-to-day movement of the elderly (Housing and Development Board , 2008) .
These include installing lifts at every floor as well as support hand rails in the toilets .
In order to allow the elderly to receive immediate help in times of emergency , alert alarm systems are fitted in every flat .
These changes have made the lives of the elderly more convenient leading to a greater sense of security instilled in them .
A Voluntary Welfare Organization  (VWO) , which is located below the block , will operate a Seniors Activity Centre to provide support services for the elderly living in the block (Housing and Development Board , 2008) .
It creates a cohesive community where the elderly can integrate themselves into the society through participating in various social activities .
Consequently , some of the social and emotional problems that the elderly faced have been resolved .
In addition , encouraging later retirement has proved to ease the ageing process .
Working reduces the elderly's reliance on their children as well as the society in terms of economic and social needs (Peterson , 2001) .
As work keeps them occupied , they do not feel the need for their children's companionship .
On top of that , working provides the elderly a source of income , enabling  them to remain financially independent , hence reducing the financial dependency on the children .
The Government has been cooperating with employers and unions as part of the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers to enact re-employment legislation by 1 January 2012 so that employees can continue to work beyond the current statutory retirement age of 62 , up to 65 (Adding Life to Years !
Happy , Healthy , Active Seniors , 2009) .
Even before this re-employment legislation has taken effect , more than 700 unionized companies have committed to re-employ around 5 ,000 workers above the age of 62 .
In fact , working not only allows the elderly to spend their time meaningfully; it  can also help to increase their self-esteem and find their own identity in the society (Adding Life to Years !
Happy , Healthy , Active Seniors , 2009) .
This helps them realize that they still have a foothold in the society as they can still contribute to the nation and economic growth , thereby helping them to lead an enriching and fulfilling life .
However , critics have argued that the elderly might not possess the essential skills that are relevant and required in the workforce today (Seah , 2007) .
This is because the society is constantly changing , hence the skills possessed by the older generation becomes obsolete and no longer applicable today .
Moreover , it has been argued that they may face difficulty coping with the fast-paced society and technologically advanced workforce of today (Seah , 2007) .
However , there are retraining programs available for the elderly to upgrade their skills in order to keep them updated and constructive in the workforce .
For an instance , a $600 million Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) was launched by the government in November 2008 to retrain and upgrade both the employed and unemployed to prepare them for the newer and better jobs .
(Adding Life to Years !
Happy , Healthy , Active Seniors , 2009) .
Allowing the older generation to stay longer in the workforce not only promotes economic growth of the country , but also keeps them physically active , mentally alert , resilient and socially connected to the society .
An aging population is an unavoidable issue today that needs to be addressed urgently .
It is therefore important to make sure that policies implemented are useful in helping to ease the aging process .
With the current policies such as upgrading of their residences' facilities and longer working lives , the aging process has been eased to a large extent .
According to Singapore Department of Statistics , the average life expectancy for a boy and a girl born in 2006 is 78 .0 years and 82 .8 years respectively .
As compared to 2003 , it shows an increase of 1 .4 years and 1 .2 years correspondingly (Singapore Department of Statistics , 2008) .
Increasing life expectancy has inevitably led to the growth of an aging population .
Aging is a complex and continuous process that begins with birth and ends with death .
Every person will experience the effect of aging process when they age .
In order to help ease the aging process , efforts have been made in the research developments and policies implementation to meet the physical and financial needs of each individual .
It is crucial to meet the physical needs of the people so as to ease their aging process .
As people become old , their physical health will deteriorate .
Moreover , their body immune system usually weakens .
Hence ,  to minimise the physical problems and vulnerabilities of the people .
One such effort is to make commuting more convenient for the aged and wheelchair-bound through the introduction of Wheelchair Accessible Buses .
With low-floor and steps-free design , these new transit buses have made boarding and alighting more manageable for the aged and disabled (Ministry for Community Development , Youth and Sports  , 2006) .
Furthermore , the Lift Upgrading Programme has also aided the elderly by having lifts landing on every floor (Channelnewsasia , 2009) .
These developments have created a living environment that is more barrier-free for our seniors and people with disabilities .
As such , they can fully participate in their everyday activities .
In addition , much has been done to provide the essential financial assistance for the elderly .
Their inability to pay for expensive medical treatments has revealed the need to provide healthcare support for them .
For example , Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong introduced a step-down care policy during the 2009 National Day speech .
This is to link up acute hospitals , such as Tan Tock Seng Hospital , with community hospitals , such as St Andrew's Community Hospital , to provide skilled and suitable healthcare especially for the aged (The straits Times , 2009) .
When patients are sick , they will go to acute hospitals for treatment and recuperate at the community hospital .
This way , proper healthcare at a reduced medical cost is made available for them .
Another example is the introduction of Medisave .
It is a national medical saving policy designed to help Singaporeans build up sufficient savings to meet their hospitalisation expenses .
(Central Provident Fund , 2009) .
Hence , healthcare needs can be met without increasing the financial burden faced by the people .
Meanwhile , critics have pointed out that the current policies and research improvements have only helped to minimise problems on a superficial level but have not fully met the emotional needs of the individuals when they grow old .
When one ages , he may be less optimistic and feel disconnected from the society .
Hence , emotional support is an important psychological factor in helping them to forget the negative aspects of their lives (Clark , 2005) .
However , we cannot deny the recent efforts that had been made to help to satisfy such needs .
For instance ,  has moved from seniority-based to performance-based wage structure .
Senior workers , with their rich working experience may be able to contribute greatly to the organisation and are encouraged to be re-hired .
This wage structure ensures employability and job security for the elderly workers and it prevents them from feeling detached from the society (National University of Singapore , 2009) .
In addition , under the Central Provident Fund's Housing Grant Scheme , the government provides a grant of $10 ,000 to $40 ,000 for families buying flats near their parents' residences (Committee on Aging Issues , 2006) .
This allows the elderly to be close to their children and some may even undertake the responsibilities of taking care of their grandchildren .
This helps them to feel valued and thereby , aids in the re-discovery of their identity as a senior citizen .
Over the years , an aging population has become an impediment at hand as many countries have been experiencing it , especially in Singapore where statistics have shown that 11 .3% of the population will be aged fifty-five years and above in 2015 (Hateley & Tan , 2003 , p . 10) .
The younger generation is more career-oriented , which has resulted in later marriages and also lower birthrates .
This burgeoning trend ultimately leads to an aging population and the Singapore government has come up with several policies and development in different fields such as enhancing and inventing elderly-related products to cater to the elderly needs .
In light of the many policies and development that have been devised by the Singapore government to address elderly concerns , the aging process will be eased as most of their problems have been addressed .
Some would argue that policies implemented by the Singapore government might not be fully utilized as some companies find it troublesome to comply with it to employ older workers due to several factors .
Critics have claimed that some companies refrain from hiring seniors to avoid spending more time , money and effort in retraining them (Tay , 2003 , p . 82) .
However , this is not a plausible reason to deter the companies from hiring the elderly as the government has improvised a scheme known as the ADVANTAGE fund to encourage more companies to shift towards automation that facilitate the older populace and to re-employ the elderly by giving out incentives and subsides for retraining programmes of the elderly (Lim , 2007) .
For example , Sheng Siong Supermarket , who hires senior workers , was able to buy machinery that helps to expedite the production process from one month to ten to fifteen days and increase their productivity by using the government subsides (Chia , 2009) .
Therefore , social policies , such as the ADVANTAGE scheme , are effective in helping the elderly to work in a less physically-demanding environment and stay productive .
It is mandatory for everyone in Singapore to have a Central Provident Fund (CPF) account .
This initiative by the government helps to ensure that all elderly will have a means of income that will provide for them through their golden years .
Recent adjustments made to the CPF on 3 September 2009 have played a significant role in reducing the working-age population's tax burden and also in increasing the elderly's CPF .
For instance , the interest rate of the CPF for savings in the Special , Medisave and Retirement Accounts (SMRA) will be maintained at 4% floor rate instead of the current 3 .40% for the next two years (Central Provident Fund Board [CPF] , 2009) .
This eases the economic aspect of an aging population as the elderly can benefit from a higher interest rate and therefore alleviate the  .
With an increasingly aging population , many innovative companies have invented several elderly-related products such as hearing aids and automatic wheelchairs to support their large demand for health-care products .
The government has also developed property such as studio apartments with barrier-free access for the elderly .
All these helped to lessen the elderly's problems of hearing , seeing or moving properly .
For example , two students from Temasek Polytechnic have developed a wheelchair that automatically engages the safety gear whenever it slides backwards .
This helps to ease the difficulty for those who are incapable of engaging the conventional brakes or holding on to the wheels manually (Temasek Polytechnic [TP] , 2009) .
Such innovations ease the problem that the physically restricted are encountering in the process of aging .
In conclusion , it is true that the current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process due to the proper and effective planning adopted by the Singapore government .
Issues such as the reluctance of companies to hire older workers are ameliorated due to the ADVANTAGE scheme whereby subsides encourage them to re-employ the aged .
The changes made to the interest rate of the CPF for savings in the SMRA will provide a social safety net for the elderly , while the increase in elderly- related products and studio apartments further eases the physical restrictions of an elderly .
However , these policies and development can help to ease the aging process only if people abandon their social stigma on the elderly populace .
It is extremely difficult for societies to find ways to care for the needy during economic downturns when funding becomes limited (Friedland & Summer , 2005 , p . 16) .
And in countries like Singapore and Japan , which face an aging population , the dilemma is even greater .
With more children not being able to or refusing to provide for their parents , the government definitely has to play a bigger role .
The country's finances will be exhausted as more elderly ask for financial help from the government to cover  their medical fees and basic needs .
However , this burden can be lessened if the elderly mindset is changed .
In order to change their mindset , the public spending on the aged should be limited in the future , and in turn the money used for other areas of the country's development like Education , Retraining and Healthcare .
In Singapore , it is true that government aid is important to the current generation of elderly , as the majority of them did not have or did not have enough CPF savings to last through their retirement .
The current generation of elderly is most probably the first batch to learn about the CPF in 1955 , and being a young scheme then , there is a high chance that they were unable to fully benefit from it .
The situation is even worse when the elderly are faced with illness .
Sick elderly who are single are not able to work to provide for themselves , thus leaving them with no income to pay for their high medical fees .
Moreover , even though married elderly have children , the high cost of living is also putting a challenge on the children's finances , which makes it hard for them to provide for their parents .
Therefore , the elderly have to rely on the government .
But all these shall change in 20 years time; the  elderly then shall be equipped with sufficient money in their CPF to provide for themselves .
In order to lessen the country's financial burden , the elderly have to change their mindset .
The time has changed and the elderly should too .
First , they should change their overly dependent mindset; they should not expect the government or their children to provide for them in their golden years .
The reason is that  the standard of living is rising and adult children find it difficult to provide for their parents , especially those stricken with illness .
Sociologists think that this is the cause of the growing trend for children to abandon their elderly parents in nursing homes (Popatlal , 2009 , para .
3-6) .
Next , the elderly should change their mindset that they are too old to work , when in actual fact working slows down the aging of their brains .
The government will not be able to provide much as the population continues to age , and there will not be as many people in the workforce as birth rates continue to drop .
if the elderly do not continue to work , it will put a huge strain on the country's finances .
how do we go about  changing the elderly's mindset ?
The answer is to invest more money inareas like Education , Retraining and Healthcare .
The best way to influence  a person's thinking is to do it while one is young , and the ideal of being independent can be taught during one's Education .
Furthermore ,  a higher education level  provides better job prospects , which in turn benefits individual financial prospect .
Education also equips one with better knowledge and planning skills , like the importance of health and financial planning for their golden years (Lim , 2009) .
As for Retraining , it enables both adults and elderly to improve their skills to continue working .
Lastly , Healthcare aspects like Community activities and Health awareness campaigns lead to a healthier lifestyle .
People of all ages can take lessons to maintain their health and make friends , which will provide them with a healthy mind and body .
In conclusion , the elderly have to change their mindset about being old and dependent .
The elderly should continue to work as they possess experience that should be passed on to the younger generation .
And to ensure the elderly to- be are prepared , it is important to inculcate them with a healthy mindset through promoting education , retraining and community activities .
Nothing beats aging with a healthy body and mind; the golden years should be spent enjoyably .
As Singapore has been faced with an aging population  since 1990s , there has been a shortage of skilled workers and a declining birth rate .
In order for Singapore to sustain its economic development and improve the quality of life of its people , it cannot afford to spend too much on the elderly .
In a globalizing world , Singapore must stay competitive in order to be successful .
This can be achieved by managing resources efficiently in areas such as investing in foreign talents and education which are vital to its future growth .
Some critics argued that senior citizens are assets to the society since most of them possess valuable skills , knowledge and work experience .
In addition , the government is supporting the elderly by increasing its health budget such as building new hospitals in old HDB towns (Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Jurong General Hospital) (Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong , national day rally speech) .
Other initiatives were also implemented such as the re-training effort for the elderly in theworkforce .
Increasing healthcare budget would be an initiative which might be seen as a necessity by the government .
However , there are other areas which are vital for consideration since they are important to Singapore's future development .
As Singapore is facing a decline in its birth rate and transiting into the knowledge based economy , attracting foreign talents could be vital to its growth .
Foreign talents would bring in specialized skills and valuable ideas to Singapore .
For example , in the area of research and development (R & D) Singapore needs to develop her own  talent pool and technologies to create new and better products; thus we need foreign talent like accomplished researchers who can lead us into the innovation of new products with their experience and knowledge .
As a result , this could increase business and job opportunities for citizens in Singapore .
In addition , with more foreign talents bringing in different cultures around the world , Singapore would be seen as a more cosmopolitan country .
As a whole , foreign talents can help Singapore gain a competitive edge in the globalizing world .
Educating the young in their early age is essential to the country's development and growth .
This would be so as education encourages critical and creative thinking since young .
This would be supported by current schools' curriculum where children are given problem based learning activities where they have to work on their research and ideas .
This in turn trains them to be able to think independently and innovatively which would be vital to the future workforce .
Therefore , investing in the education system would help Singapore in sustaining its growth in the globalizing world .
In conclusion , a country should tap into other areas of resources in order to stay competitive in a globalizing world .
At the same time , there should also be certain amount of public spending on the aged as the senior citizens are still part of the society and they should be taken care of as so that a country can progress and prosper .
Singapore has one of the world's most rapidly aging population and currently this situation has started to put pressure on our economic growth , with increasing emphasis on health care for the elderly .
From the World Health Statistics 2009 , approximately 3 .3% of Singapore's Gross Domestic Product is spent on healthcare in the year 2006 , and this figure is projected to increase even more in the future and is definitely directly related to the fast aging population .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited to prevent over reliance on the government and  more emphasis could be given to other sectors to promote economic growth .
It is true that most of the aged people in Singapore have contributed to the building and development of Singapore up to this stage and it is time for the nation to look after them .
However , the current healthcare structure may lead to an over dependence on the government for their own health .
With the current CPF structure where/ in which part of a Singaporean's monthly wage goes into Medisave and Medishield ,  an 'untouchable' fund that can only be used for hospital and most healthcare bills , Singaporeans may get complacent thinking that they have already saved enough for their medical bills in the future .
But if one is to be diagnosed with a chronic disease or incapacitating illness , the fund in his Medisave might not be enough for the hefty bill over time .
Therefore , instead of investing money in healthcare infrastructures like new hospitals and nursing homes , it would be wiser for the government to help Singaporeans plan out their retirement more strategically .
Other than extending their retirement age , the government might consider collaborating with the insurance companies and help Singaporeans to purchase a basic insurance with their CPF to facilitate illnesses associated with old age .
In this way , not only the reliance on the government will decrease , Singaporeans will be more protected and not be at the mercy of the others when disease strikes .
Therefore , by paying more attention to education and making sure that all if not most Singaporeans can get a proper education , it ensures that most people will be literate enough to get a proper paying job and thus increasing the working adult  to elderly ratio .
The increase  . . . the increase in the ratiowill will without doubt relieve the government of financing  the aged  .
On top of it , a case by case basis might be a more plausible way of giving healthcare subsidy rather than just applying healthcare subsidy to the general elderly as a whole .
This will really improve the allocations of funds to those who really need it from people who still can afford the healthcare in Singapore .
Even though healthcare expenditure is inevitable in any country , money does not solve all the problems and it is still very important to educate the people on the importance of retirement planning .
Therefore instead of channeling public funds into subsidized health care , the money should be put to better use in education or other aspects of the nation's development .    
With the issue of an ageing society escalating in many countries within these few years , governments have been showing an increased concern towards this unprecedented problem of an ageing population with extremely low reproduction rates .
Singapore is definitely not alone in handling this challenge , as in 2005 , both Germany and Japan saw for the first time; their death rates out-number their birth rates .
Currently , there are no clear explanations as to why the phenomenon of low fertility rates has increased in recent years .
Studies , however , suggested that it might be due to the rise in educated citizens and with that , they were taught the importance of family building and hence , would only plan to have a child when they are financially and emotionally ready for one .
This calls for some social policies to be put in place by the governments , to encourage citizens to be more willing to reproduce .
Social policies such as incentives being given out to encourage procreation and increasing the influx of immigrants would help to ease the ageing process to a great extent .
However , they might introduce some new problems and  these will be explored in-depth later .
Recognising the problem of a possible financial burden that might be incurred by families with a new child , the governments of developed nations are providing generous incentives with the birth of each new child , in the hope of encouraging their citizens to reproduce by helping to ease their financial burden .
In Singapore , we have the "Baby Bonus" scheme , which citizens will get to enjoy a cash gift of up to S$4 ,000 each for their first and second child and S$6000 each for their third and fourth child .
(cited from {https://www .babybonus .gov .sg/bbss/html/faq .html}[HYPERLINK: https://www .babybonus .gov .sg/bbss/html/faq .html]  , retrieved on September 10 , 2009) Similarly , the Australia's baby bonus pays their citizens with AUD$5 ,185 per eligible child in 13 fortnightly instalments , as of 1 July 2009 .
(cited from {http://www .fahcsia .gov .au/Guides_Acts/fag/faguide-1/faguide-1 .2/faguide-1 .2 .2 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://www .fahcsia .gov .au/Guides_Acts/fag/faguide-1/faguide-1 .2/faguide-1 .2 .2 .html]  , retrieved on September 10 , 2009) One may argue that this is just a narrow viewpoint .
Nowadays , people are bred on notions of free choice .
They do not like to be bribed into the government's "propaganda" of procreation .
Also , being more educated , they do not see the need for many children , as time and much money is needed to raise the child in the future .
However , this is definitely not true as firstly , it is the citizens' role to procreate , and not the government's .
Hence , it cannot be conveniently stated that such policy is"propaganda" by the government .
Furthermore , there is evidence of an increased replacement rate .
In Australia , its total fertility rates rose from 1 .76 in 2004 to 1 .82 in 2006 .
(as cited in {http://www .melbourneinstitute .com/news/news/media_releases/2009/final-WP-Baby%20Bonus .pdf}[HYPERLINK: http://www .melbourneinstitute .com/news/news/media_releases/2009/final-WP-Baby%20Bonus .pdf]  , retrieved on September 10 , 2009) As for Singapore , we will have to observe the situation carefully for the next few years to see if its policies will nudge it past the subreplacement zone .
Another social policy that governments seem to turn towards  is the encouragement of the inflow of immigrants into our society .
This is to ensure that the workforce will remain sufficient and efficient , as a shrinking society will only face the threats of declining economic vitality .
Singapore , for instance , welcome talented immigrants to 1"help us reach our goals" .
However , critics argued that though this social policy is feasible to ease the ageing process in Singapore , it does not take into account  the issue of increased competition for jobs in Singapore , due to the high influx of foreign talents .
This might mean that Singaporeans will have to compete for jobs with the foreigners , and might  lose their jobs to them .
In addition , it also does not take into account of the fact that attracting more immigrants might mean a threat to the culture and identity of a country .
For example , in Europe , 2it is estimated that a quarter of her inhabitants will be non-European in origin , character and beliefs , if she continues to depend on importing immigrants to ease her ageing problems .
This reasoning might be flawed as it is inevitable that the locals have to upgrade their skills to ensure high employability in the fast and highly competitive society .
Also , in this increasingly globalised society , it is even more imperative that one keeps one updated , so as not to be outdated , or they will risk losing their jobs to someone more capable , either a local or a foreigner .
It is a fact that we are experiencing an the aging population problem population problem throughout the world , especially in the developed countries such as Singapore .
Due to the fast advancement of medications , we have no article needed longer life spans compared to the past .
Thus , many countries are spending more effort and money on aging population problem .
However , there are many ways to help the elderly to take care of themselves and public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Elder dependency should be reduced by encouraging later retirement , longer working lives , and fewer barriers to elder employment (Peterson , 2001 , p .66) .
By increasing the eligibility age for public pensions , we are forced to retire at a later age and we will be able to accumulate more money as we grow older .
But in order to achieve that , employers should learn the importance and benefits of employing older employees .
Older employees have more working experiences and better knowledge than the younger ones and these are the crucial factors that will contribute to the company growth .
The Government should encourage its citizens to have more children so that that the cost burden of taking care of the elderly is spread over a larger and more affluent future generation (Peterson , 2001 , p .66) .
Some of the children feel that they are having financial problems and they are not capable of taking care of their parents' expenses .
However , their burdens can be reduced if they have other siblings to share the cost of their parents' expenses .
The Government is also increasing its incentives to parents with more children as a mean to increase fertility rate .
The fiscal cost of elder dependency can be further reduced by stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow's grown children to support their own elderly parents through informal and familiar channels (Peterson , 2001 , p .66) .
This is very important as having more children does not assure that the parents have higher chances of being taken care of taken care of by their children than the parents with fewer children .
Thus , it is necessary to educate the children at  an  early age on filial obligation .
Parents definitely play a critical role by showing a positive role model to their children .
For example , they can show more of their care and concern on their children needs rather than just focusing on their jobs .
Children will be grateful to their parents and increase their willingness to support their parents in future .
Lastly , the fiscal and economic cost of elder dependency can be reduced by requiring people to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency (Peterson , 2001 , p .66) .
This is like a form of long term saving plan where people are compelled by law to save a portion of their monthly income if they start to work .
The amounts that they have saved can only be withdrawn at a certain age and those savings will be a form of support for them when they reach older age and are not capable of working anymore .
This is especially useful for those people who do not have the habit of saving up .
Nevertheless , we also shouldn't completely ignore the aging population .
Although there are plans to reduce elder dependency , there will still be a small percentage of elders that are not capable of taking care themselves .
They may not be physically able to work and at the same time their children have abandoned the task of taking care of them .
In some of the worst situation , elders do not even have any children that they can depend on on .
As such , government can be more lenient to these groups of elders by providing financial care and giving them public pension benefits whenever possible .
Clearly , as many counties are experiencing aging population problems , the importance of solving this problem in the long term period is rather crucial .
The Government can offer many public pensions and financial help to the needy elders , but when will this end ?
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited and people should be educated from young on the ways to prevent aging population problems rather than to find a solution for it .
Public spending for the elderly , is it insufficient still ?Remove full stop .
In an expenditure overview of this year's budget 2009  , the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports has set aside $42 .1 million to fund the community and residential based care programmes for the elderly  , $15 .1 million for projects under the GO !
( golden opportunities) and Council for Third Age (C3A) , which advocates the elderly to lead healthier and more active lives .
Another $3 .2 million will be set aside to pilot the Wellness Programme to promote active and healthy ageing in the community .
12 constituencies will set up the Wellness Programme in this pilot phase(http://www .singaporebudget .gov .sg)  .Given the countless funds being channeled to them and given that most of the aged nowadays are capable of supporting themselves , the government expenditure on the elderly exceeds what they need .
Whereas the other sectors of the country's development such as education and healthcare , are still underdeveloped .
Therefore , the public spending on the aged should be limited and more funds should be invested in these areas in order to secure the future of the county and maintain its competitiveness in this fast-paced world .
People would argue that more money should be spent by the government on the elderly , given that the elderly are the more disadvantaged group of the society .
Moreover , the government spending is only beneficial towards the active and healthy elderly , with lesser concern towards those who are unwell and not permitted to work .
And as old age is often associated with deteriorating health , the elderly will have trouble coping with the high medical costs .
Based on a text entitles "Doomsday Predictions about Population are Exaggerated" , writers Robert B Friedland and Laura Summer stated that large and long-term healthcare expenses will become a burden to the elderly , especially those who have not been able to save when they were young(Friedland and Summer ,2005) .
This would give an even larger   larger burden to the working adults and taxes will definitely increase .
However , as we all know , the elderly only constitute a smaller part of the society , and the younger ones in the social group must be taken care of the same way or more so than the elderly since they are the determiners of the country's future .
More money should not be invested on the healthcare of the elderly who are unwell and not fit for work since they do not have any other means to spend on with that much money given by the government , except for their medical fees .
Instead , investing more money in education will increase the likeability of the younger people to secure better jobs , and enabling them to provide their elderly parents financial support , no matter in what condition their parents are in .
Based on the statistics obtained from a government statistical website , the  level of education attainment among resident non-students aged 25-39 , despite increasing rapidly in the past few years , is still low at 70 percent in 2008 (www .singstat .gov .sg)  .This means that the government must set aside more money in instilling awareness of the importance of education towards the young .
This can be done by organizing campaigns , and through media such as advertisements and short documentaries .
The Global Campaign for Education for example , has campaigned in many countries in order to instill awareness towards the importance of education .
Therefore , by succeeding in education and securing better jobs , the working adults will ease the burden of the government from having to invest a lot of money on the welfare of the elderly .
Healthcare for the elderly is important in order to enable them to lead better lives .
However , the well-being of the citizens in general is much more important .
As discussed earlier , the younger citizens are the jewels of the country that determines its future .
The country needs healthy and able citizens to ensure the country's progress .
Therefore , more of the government's investments should go to the younger citizens .
Moreover , these younger citizens are the ones who will be responsible for their elderly parents' health and well-being , therefore their health and well-being should be prioritized .Based on a study by theremove full-stop Commonwealth Fund which was released on Wednesday , in the Healthday News/Detroit Free Press reports , which includes 4 ,052 U .S . adults ages 19 or older between September 2003 and January 2004 , about 16 million U .S . residents care for sick or disabled family members , and approximately nine million of those caregivers have medical problems , according to the study .
Three out of five caregivers said they had trouble paying their medical bills (http://www .medicalnewstoday .com) .
This shows that in the course of taking care of their parents , the working adults do not take care of their own health , and what makes it worse is that they are financially in need , as evidenced by their incapability to settle their own healthcare bills .
Therefore as evidenced by these kinds of scenarios , the government should set aside more money on healthcare  ,especially for working adults who are taking care for their elderly parents , since caregivers of the ill and unhealthy should be healthy in the first place .
An ageing population can bring about many serious problems to a developed country .
Lower productivity of an older workforce can lead to a decline in economic growth .
Demand for health care services will increase as elders are prone to illnesses and take a long  time to recover .
Resources will be needed to upgrade the country's infrastructure to cater to the needs of the older population .
By 2030 , 20% of Singapore's population will be 65 years old and above full-stop should come after the in-text citation (MCYS , 2007) Despite the high number of seniors , the birth rate remains low at 1 .29 per female in 2007 .
(Statistic Singapore , 2007) Since the population is unlikely to be able to replace itself in the near future (The Business Times , 2007) , it is important to have policies that help to ease the ageing process by helping the elders to increase their retirement savings so as to lighten their dependency on the younger generation .
In February 2006 , the ministerial Committee on Ageing Issues proposed a polices such as the HDB's rules of housing nucleus families closer to their elders , the Parents' Maintenance act and higher retirement age , to protect the elders and ease old-age dependency .
However , these current government policies have not helped to ease the ageing process .
Most policies are ineffective or attract minimal attention , hence , most of the elderly are still not independent .
The Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) introduced by the HDB encourages married children and parents to live near one another .
Married children are given priority if they apply for a flat to stay near or together with their parents .
(MCYS , 2007) no need for 'by' encouraging adult children to stay with their parents can definitely benefit the elderly as the increased interaction can foster care for their parents .
However , even if the married children live with their parents , they may have no time to look after them .
With no need for article rising inflation , both married children have to work to support the increasing expenditureno need for plural form .
A dual career family means that the adult children spend less time at home and that the elder parents are often left alone in the day as their children go to work .
Hence , MCPS does not guarantee more care for the aged parents .
The Maintenance of Parents Act give parents above 60 years old who could not support themselves the legal means to claim maintenance from their children .
(Mathi , 1999) By compelling children to provide support for them , the elderly parents can be assured to retire comfortably with the financial support from their children .
The Act is proposed with the assumption that some children selfishly abandon their parents .
However , the Act overlooked the constraints of the adult children .
Young adult children , especially those who already started a family , find themselves sandwiched between providing care for their elderly parents and their children .
Health care for the elderly can cost up to thousands of dollarsand being  strained financially , adult children simply cannot afford it .
Therefore , the problems go beyond the issue of filial piety , government need to look at each case individually .
Retirement age will rise from 62 to 65 by 2012 to account for the higher life expectancy of its ageing population .
(Inquirer , 2009) The elderly who are healthier and able to work longer can therefore increase their retirement savings by retiring later .
Even so , more have to be done to change the mindsets of the employer .
Many employers often associate old-age with lower productivity .
Older workers find it difficult to compete with the younger applicants who are youthful and demand lesser pay .
Moreover , there is a certain group of elderly who have substantial education attainment such as the older single women .
(Friedland and Summer) This group of elderly will have lower income and more difficulties in finding jobs .
In such instances , the government needs to provide more financial help to this group of elderly who are more vulnerable .
In conclusion , the policies are not effective in helping the elders to ease their old-age dependency .
The government needs to see the real reasons contributing to the different problems faced by the elderly .
Besides introducing policies that help the elderly , people have to also change their attitude towards the aged to engage the elderly into the society and strive together to ease the ageing process .
The ramifications of the aging population have always been a challenge to many developed countries .
The immense social cost arising from ageing population can be attributed to mounting healthcare problem , diminishing of economic productivity and increasing accountability of younger generation towards the elderly .
In view of the accelerated growth of ageing population , the Singapore Government government has been revamping the related policies constantly to mitigate the problem .
With a carefully constructed policy , government agencies get to develop a holistic approach that meets the needs of the elderly .
The diminishing of economic productivity due to the aging population may have an abysmal effect on a country .
Peter G . Peterson has claimed that later retirement could be a sensible method to maintain one nation's productivity and reduce the dependency of elderly .
(Peter G . Peterson , 2001) Singapore's government has adopted this measure and raised the retirement age up to 62 to ensure elderly contribution to the society .
Moreover , such policy emphasizes the principle of self-reliance and reduces the burden and social cost of the community .
The existence of the older workforce not only increases the input of the economy but also enables the elderly to gain some form of steady income .
This will ameliorate the deteriorating effect on a nation's economy due to ageing progression .
However , this policy will remain fruitless without the collaboration between the elderly , employers and the state .
Employers tend to discriminate against elderly frequently as they are deemed to be vulnerable and unproductive .
In order to remove such prejudice , the government provides incentives by reducing the employer's contribution to elderly Central Provident Fund (CPF) .
Initially government will top up the remainder sum for the elderly so that the welfare of elderly will not be jeopardized .
Healthcare is another prevalent problem in a society where the number of elderly is increasing tremendously .
The elderly has a higher possibility of encountering a long-term management of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease .
Therefore it is essential for the government to keep healthcare cost at an affordable rate for this vulnerable group .
Singapore's government heavily subsidizes  medical service and grants some flexibility in the CPF system so that the elderly can utilize part of their saving in the CPF account for hospitalization expenses .
In addition , family responsibility is always is always stressed  stressed such that children are required to contribute to the Medisave account of their elderly member .
The transfer of funds from the Ordinary Account to parents' Retirement Account is also available .
Such policies spread over the cost of ageing progression to family and community and minimize minimize state fiscal fiscal provision .
Moreover , in order to make medical service easily accessible to the needy , polyclinic which is an affordable subsidized one-stop health centre , offer outpatient medical care and pharmacy services .
This facilitates the elderly who are bedridden and confined to wheelchairs .
Despite heavy subsidization on healthcare , the elderly who are destitute without family support may still find medical service prohibitive .
As such , Public Assistance and Medifund have been introduced to assuage this problem whereby rigorous diagnoses are  carried out out and relevant assistance will be given to the needy accordingly .
Lastly , the mental health of elderly is exceptionally vital to enhance their social functioning and to maximize their potential .
The sense of isolation and loneliness among homebound and single elderly might result in mental illness and social problems .
Family bonding and company are paramount in addressing such phenomenon .
Reinforcement of the ethic of filial pity can vicariously develop strong bonds between children and parents .
In line with this ideology , Singapore's government introduced Multi-Tier Family Housing Scheme and CPF Housing Grant to encourage married couple to buy a flat in the same town with their parents .
It is a housing subsidy and family comprising parents and married children staying together in the same household will be given priority for public housing apartment .
Consequently , this can prevent elderly abandonment by children and forms family cohesion among the community so that the aged will not be neglected .
Singapore's government believes that social service should involve the participation of all sectors of society including the community and non-profit organization .
Thus , several programmes have been set up under the joint MCYS-HDB project to improve the quality of life of the aged .
One of it would be the Senior Citizens' Club which helps to enhance family relationship and promote interaction among elderly .
Psychological needs of the elderly cannot be overlooked so that they can be socially integrated into the family and community .
In a nutshell , curbing the enigmas of the ageing population to a large extent , depend on the social policies of a state .
Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer caution government to carry out wise and forward-thinking planning and therefore the government should adopt pragmatism while formulating social policies related to the ageing population .
(Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005) Society should also shift their paradigm and not marginalize the  elderly  to maximize the social functioning of elderly .
One of the strategies from the text , "elder dependency should be reduced by making people work longer" (Peter G . Peterson) can be applied in the Singapore context whereby the retirement age has been raised from 60 to 62 in 1999 .
With longer working lives , people will be able to save more money for old age .
However , longer working lives may have implications on their health , which may lead to an increase in medical expenditure .
Nevertheless , this can be solved by the flexi-work hour program such that the elder group can work shorter hours and not ruin their health .
Moreover , based on a government survey conducted last July , more than 60 per cent of 25 ,000 unemployed older folk who planned to look for work preferred to work part time .
However , only 43 per cent of the employers are willing to offer flexible work to older workers , while 57 per cent are presumably against such arrangements .
Furthermore , figures from the Ministry of Manpower show that the proportion of employees on flexible work arrangements in 2008 was 9 .4 per cent from the public and private sectors .
Hence , I will suggest a development of new models of work which will be required as the workforce ages and employees search for greater flexibility in work organization .
This will encourage the elder group to return to the workforce and achieve a reduction of elder dependency on the government .
In Singapore , education has been a main concern and the government has implemented policies such as compulsory primary school education and subsidies for students from poor families .
Furthermore , in the 2009 Key Budget Initiatives , the government is enhancing school education by "providing better facilities for an all-round education in every school , enhancing both the size and quality of the teaching force and bringing in allied educators into schools to collaborate with teachers in providing better attention for every child ."
(Key Budget Initiatives) With a strong education system base , everyone has a chance to receive high level of education , which will secure them higher paying jobs in the future and also help to stimulate the country's economic growth .
As a result , "the cost burden can be spread over a larger and more affluent future generation" .
(Peter G . Peterson) Nevertheless , one can argue that with a low birth rate , the system established will not be fully utilized .
However , the education  system is important in a country's development for future generations , hence the government can only further revise the baby bonus policy in order to encourage families to have more children .
Another social problem will be elderly parents being abandoned at nursing homes or children living overseas and  no one looking after their parents in Singapore .
However , recent study has found that "seniors here are generally well cared for by their children" .
Moreover , "two in three respondents pay for their senior's medical bills and keep them company" .
(The Straits Times Article) On the other hand , there is also a setback such that there will be another generation of elderly who are not prepared for their own retirement , the reason being that  . . .
The reason being their income will be used to support elderly parents , to cover family expenses and provide for their children .
However , with the CPF scheme in place , there should be savings when they reach retirement age , but I will suggest that research has to be conducted to find out how much people will need to save for their retirement and whether the current CPF contribution rate is sufficient .
Moreover , compulsory insurance scheme can be introduced to ensure more savings .
The government is also "committing to a substantial expansion of the healthcare sector by investing $4 billion to restructure the heath care system to handle the aging population such as the development of community hospitals" .
(Key Budget Initiatives) Patients can then recuperate at these community hospitals which generate savings and increase efficiency on treatment of more acute cases .
In 1950 , there were 205 million persons aged 60 or over throughout the world .
Fifty years later , the number of persons aged of people aged 60 or over increased about three times to 606 million .
Over the first half of the current century , the global population 60 or over is projected to expand by more than three times to reach nearly 2 billion in 2050 .
Aging population includes  any person who is aged 60 and above .
Hence , there is a lot of concern with whether the government is going to spend more money to help the aging population or otherwise .
If the money spent is not planned properly , there may be disastrous consequences .
The aged can still contribute to our society economically and socially , hence there is a need to allocate more money for them .
The aged can still help to develop and push the economy to greater heights since they still have the capability to work .
Public policies are put in place to motivate them to work harder .
One example would be the Central Providence Fund (CPF) in Singapore .
It is a savings account that the working class will put a certain percentage of their monthly salaries into .
This money can be used for themselves or their descendants .
Awards and money incentives are also given to those who have performed outstandingly in their fields of work .
The government should spend more money to come up with new awards as a form of motivation .
They are also the ones who will do all the "dirty" work like collecting garbage and sweeping the floor .
No degree holder will want to exchange their air-conditioned room for standing under the hot scorching sun .
Others may argue that the aged work and learn slower compared to a working adult , however , we must also consider the difference in their salary and job scope .
They may be slower but they do not complain .
No matter how much they earn , be it a little or a lot , they still contribute to the economy .
The aged have a lot of invaluable experiences which cannot be brought in terms of money .
We can still learn a lot from them .
It helps us to plan better , not making the mistakes that they have made in the past , as in the case of World War 2 .
The British thought that the Japanese will not attack through the forest; as a result , we were caught by surprise when they actually came in through the forest .
It is these experiences and mistakes that we learnt from and thus improved ourselves .
The government should spend more money on them for talks and teachings so that they are able to share their experiences with younger generation .
They can also publish self-improvement books .
People may argue that actions speaks louder than words , since all the aged do is to talk , it it definitely sounds  easy .
Yet , it is through this life experiences that we are able to better plan and think of our future .
Hence , I believe that the government should spend more money to subsidize talks for   the elderly .
With aging , the physical and mental parts of the human body will start to deteriorate  .
As a result , there is a need for the government to spend more on elderly healthcare and rehabilitation centres .
Life expectancy across the world is increasing .
People are living longer and tend to fall sick more compared to the past .
What if they do not have enough money to see the doctor ?
Do we let them die on the streets ?
As the standard of living increases , a minor operation will cost at least a whopping $10 000 .
The medicine and the appointments to see the doctors are normally for a lifetime , which would mean more necessary costs .
Some of the elderly may not be eligible for the government policies because they do not fulfil certain requirements .
There are people who believe that the aged should fend for themselves .
However , if we take a closer look , we will see a vicious cycle where the problem will eventually fall back on the children and back to the economy since they will have a keep a portion of their salary for the medical bills .
In conclusion , the government must plan properly to allocate sufficient resources for the aged , yet not forgetting other aspects of the country .
As policies makers decide on how much resources to allocate , they must remember that these policies will be subjected to changes as everything else changes .
Hence , we must be flexible and focus on knowing which direction our country is heading in and plan adequate resources properly .
Nowadays , the aging population is one of the most worrying problems .
The percentage of people who are 65 years old and above in Singapore in 2008 is 8 .67% (1) .
For this reason , the government has been placing much emphasis on spending the budget for the aged .
However , in my opinion , the funding for the senior citizens should be cut back so that we could take full advantage of this amount of money to develop other fields to contribute to the country's growth .
First and foremost , the government ought to invest much time and energy in education .
As a matter of fact , due to the fact that people who are "well equipped" with knowledge get more opportunity to have higher salary and better social status , education ensures a happy hoary age (2) .
The ground for this fact is that because of their hard work during their younger years , they are able to put aside for their future .
Hence , they can cater for themselves without any financial aid from the outside world .
However , according to statistics , though small ,  about 2 .4% of people cannot find a job with an acceptable pay to prepare for their old age .
What is more , the government may open some training programs to offer jobs for those who are about to retire but are unemployed for the time being owing to their lack of education .
Singapore's government seems to make the most of this policy to make more and more people employed despite their shortage of education before .
Data shows that compared with 2007 , there are more than 11 .7 million people of this type having the ability to work on their own .
Moreover , science should be appreciated more .
With more esteem , new technology is possible to be invented to help ease the aged .
From that point , old age is not appalling anymore .
People are more likely to work longer , and it is not necessary for the government to help them .
For example , studies have proved that insomnia in the elderly can be   easily cured by non-drug therapies (3) .
This can be seen as a step forward to what we want to achieve .
Suppose that the science is properly concerned , no one knows whether it might create something which makes people ever young .
This thing , if happens , could be the most marvelous one that has ever happened in the world .
At that time , everybody , irrespective of age , is capable of increasing the productivity of their own country in particular and of the global village in general .
Then , aging population does not exist anymore , and this word would come out of the dictionary .
With the expansion of science , nothing seems hard to imagine and we have the right to hope such world would come into existence into existence .
Last but not least , opponents of this position would argue that senior citizens are also our own citizens , they need care from the government and the strategies above take many times to complete when the senior citizens cannot wait anymore .
However , based on what I have argued above , the government's concern to the aged still exist but should be limited to some extent to take care of the other's areas .
If the government continues to excessively worry about the senior citizens , it will be a good example to rely on the government .
They do not need to worry for their future during their early times because sooner or later they will be provided with help by the government .
This thing must be a disaster to a society .
Furthermore , to place more emphasis on other areas such as education , science , etc .
is considered to be a visionary step to see to our aging population of our near of far future .
And as far as I am concerned , to run a country , we need to take interest in long term more than short term .
In short , "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to the other areas of the country's development" .
Two areas that can be invested in more are education and science , which will make some differences in our aging population so that this problem would no longer be an awesome matter , but one of the proudest ones to be mentioned .
With the continued decline in fertility and the improvement in health in Singaporeans , Singapore faces a greying population (MCYS , 2005) .
In addition , the ageing phenomena are becoming more complex with rapidly changing social-economic-political and technological environments (Mehta , 2004) .
For example , Chow and Chan's study (as cited in Lee , & Mehta , 2004) states that as families become more modernised , the level of the family social support to the old will suffer deterioration .
Without new policies and further research and development in all fields of study , relating to the aged , they will face difficulties in living inheir current environment .
Despite the complex changes in the environment , there are theories on successful aging which could help us in our investigation on  the extent to which the current policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The following theories are role theory and social exchange theory .
The role theory suggests that people play specific roles in their families and communities throughout their life time .
social exchange theory suggests that the degree of interaction of elderly is determined by their ability to engage in social exchange .
We will focus on whether the current policies have made life easier for the elderly on the basis of these theories .
In Singapore , the existing policy on employing the elderly does not do enough to allow senior workers to continue playing their roles in working community .
Companies in Singapore tend to prefer employing younger employees , and when the company is undergoing restructuring , the older workers are usually the ones to be retrenched .
Despite the incentives given out by Singapore government to encourage companies to continue employing the elderly , companies still hesitate to keep them because of possible health problems .
Forcing them to accept less respected job , also mean lower income , to earn for a living as retirement age has increased .
This creates undue stress and negative psychological impact on the aged , at the same time a social stigma on them and also inadequate income .
A survey from MCYS (2005) shows that there is an increased in the proportion of those aged above 55 and above who found their income usually inadequate , 29 .9% of them credit it to low income .
Unlike Japan , the companies tend to treasure the experience of older workers and recognise their loyalty towards the company , allowing them to stay on to managerial position provided that they are competent .
The aged in Japan are very much respected as compared to those in Singapore , hence , aging with more dignity .
Taking a closer look , the success of the policy on employing the elderly is still inconclusive , as it takes years to change the perspective of a society .
At the very least , the elderly is still able to be part of the workforce .
To a large extent , most of the existing policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The HDB housing policy which encourages families to stay closer to their parents allows the elderly to continue their role in helping their children or even an additional role as a grandparent .
The HDB provides additional grants through CPF for families to purchase flats within a certain radius of their parents .
With the close proximity , family members can travel to and fro with ease , helping them in terms of household matters and even taking care of young children .
This allows bonding to increase between them and also increasing the self-worth of the elderly .
In terms of improving the ability of the elderly in engaging social exchange , mobility and places are the important aspect .
The government is creating a more disabled and elderly friendly environment by making improvements in housing estates and public areas .
For example , the transport authority aims to have lift facilities in every mass rapid and light rail transit stations .
In order to encourage active aging , the government is bringing activities closer to housing estates like the RC or CC .
These activities include not only physical activities , and also voluntary activities .
The government also set up the Council for Third Age to further promote active aging (MCYS , 2009) .
Presently , though , social policies are still solely drafted  by the government .
However , Singaporeans can be involved in improving these policies by providing feedbacks through government portals like Reach .
With such initiatives , policies are now more focused on improving the lives of Singaporean as a whole .
Additional healthcare facilities and services are to be provided in line with the aging process .
The escalating figure of aging population will certainly increase the numbers of patients afflicted to intricate diseases such as Ischaemic heart diseases .
With aging population , the likelihood of patients suffering from multiple organ failure will start to increase too .
Nonetheless , the number of hospitalizations due to such medical conditions may amplify as well .
In order to rectify the homeward bound predicament , not only more elder-friendly friendly facilities have to be constructed , but  critical care medical treatment and surgery is  required too .
However , this could prove  to be a major hitch as there is an emerging need for critical care programmes .
Various medical institutions should offer training and preparation to medical professional personnel to equip them with the necessity to counter the upcoming crisis .
The progression of aging could be also alleviated with new and hi- tech medical advancement .
Since the 2003 , Singapore General Hospital has performed numerous robotic surgeries ever since the robotic surgical system , known as Da Vinci Surgical was introduce .
This has significantly augmented the precision of intricate surgeries as well as trimmed down much of the risk faced by the patient during surgical operations .
With the marvel breakthrough of medical advancement , elderly members who are the ones that  health problems are better furnished with finer medication procedures .
However , technology and science cannot replace the need for healing relationships among the medical personnel and patients .
Dr Vivian Balakrishnan , Minister for States and National Development once says that while technology and science continue to alter medical procedures and techniques , health care at its core remains a high-touch profession .
Care is provided by people , not technology , buildings or drugs .
( Dr Vivian Blakrishnan , 2002) Through caring interactions , patients especially the old and needy members can be emotionally and psychologically motivated to fight against the associated sickness .
Thus , healthcare professionals are required to constantly enhance their ability to communicate and care , not just mainly rely on the development of technology and science .
In addition , with the robust production of supplementary healthcare products nowadays , the level of personal healthiness of the elderly can be much maintained .
Taking healthcare products such as natural vitamins and mineral salts is able to build up one's immunity system against viral and bacterial infections .
It is often said that prevention is better than cure .
These supplementary products not only can fortify one's immunity system , but also improve one's mind alertness and body vigor .
Elderly should be taking complementary healthcare products to strengthen their body against diseases as we well as retaining their mental alertness .
At this point one may wonder  whether the manufactured supplementary healthcare products are safe to be consumed as there are cases that the products are proven to be potentially health hazardous .
However , numerous measures have been imposed by authorities such as the Health Sciences Authority to insure that the merchandises are secured to be utilised .
Nonetheless , consumer themselves have to prudent when selecting the varieties of healthcare products .
In conclusion , progress of development in healthcare needs have to always be maintained at a high pace as the tempo of aging progression hastens .
More funds should be provided to increase more research and development in the pharmaceutical and medical sciences fields as well as importing more advance technologies .
This would largely aid in resolving the predicaments of declining personal health system that an aging population will encounter .
Peter G . Peterson concludes that global aging may still impose unsustainable fiscal and economic burden unless the developed countries confront the daunting problem of rising healtcare cost and how to set limits on healthcare .
(Peter G . Peterson , 2001) Yet , insufficient healthcare development spending may degenerate the health standards of the nation and so , in turn reduces productivity even more significantly .
Public spending should therefore be more focused on providing excellent healthcare facilities and services which would benefit and ease the growing health crisis amidst the aging population .
In the recent years , besides many issues such as wars in the Middle East , financial crisis , terrorism , a fast-aging population has become an unprecedented problem which many countries have encountered , especially the developed ones .
This demographic change has lead to several serious consequences which not only challenge the whole society but also the government and policy makers .
Such a problem like this cannot be solved overnight , but needs to have a suitable long-term plan .
Although there are still arguments surrounding old age issues ,  much has been done to ease the aging process , particularly medical advancement and efficient social policies .
To begin with , it is no doubt that when a person becomes older , he will experience health problems , physically and mentally .
Therefore , better healthcare is one of the most important priorities when finding out solutions to help the elderly .
Most developed countries offer the long-term care including nursing home , day cares , home health care and hospice care , and upgrade the facilities as well as infrastructure in the medical sector .
In the Singapore context ,  some hospitals will be built such as Jurong General Hospital opening  in 2015 ,  Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun  opening in 2010 .
Furthermore , on the understanding that elder people need a longer time to recover , the Ministry of Health has launched a new model to set up a link between mainstream hospitals with community ones where patients can receive relevant care after being discharged from the acute hospitals .
To illustrate this type of healthcare is Tan Tock Seng Hospital with Ren Ci Hospital as well as Changi General Hospital with St Andrew's Community Hospital .
Shortly , with the development in medical aspect , it could be fairly assured that elderly healthcare would be improved .
Secondly , from a social and financial standpoint , the government and policy makers have generated many possible ideas to deal with a graying population .
A question has been brought up in Straits Times lately "Who cares for these when they grow old ?" .
In fact , there are some older people having no child or are single , so it is more difficult for them in their old days .
To deal with this problem , conceived by the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , The Centre for Enabled Living is the first-top centre for persons needing care .
It is a centre to help the elderly not only with their daily life but also emotional life by providing many helpful services - for example Befriending , Neighbourhood Links and Senior Activity Centres , and so on .
Another solution to reduce elder dependency is The Central Provident Fund (CPF) system , a source of financial support to Singaporeans during retirement .
It is mandatory for every employee and employer to put some money of his income per month into CPF .
Besides , the government also encourages its citizens to work as long as possible and contribute to the CPF to have a good preparation and more financial security in old age .
On the other hand , some people still doubt whether or not the advancement or development has actually helped the aging population .
Although governments raise funds and increase budgets to support the elderly , healthcare costs is still high and some of the treatments which apply new technologies and methods are so expensive that money they save will run out after a few days .
Another point is that some of the policies can only be efficient and useful in developed nations .
Due to the shortage of budget , many other social problems such as poverty , starvation , inflation , etc .
developing or poor countries may not take many actions to help their older people .
Hence , there should be more effort to be done to solve these problems .
All things considered , it can be concluded that current development and policies have helped to ease the aging process in a certain degree .
Solving these problems is not an easy task and can not be achieved in the  short-run either However , with strong effort , many things can be done to help our elderly .
Public spending refers to expenditure by government .
A principal source of revenue or income to pay for public spending is taxation(Tiscali , 2009) .
Some of the other areas in the country's development that require public spending are like social services and benefits , education , infrastructure and development projects like transport , housing and employment (Anonymous , 2009) .
It is important for the government to spend in this area so that the country's economy and social condition will improve .
Many argue that limiting public spending on the elderly would only leave  their families to face with issues on education , housing , social services and transportation .
By cutting expenditure on welfare programs for the elderly , individuals and families are  responsible for a larger share of the cost incurred by the elderly . .
They would need to provide the cost for their own old age dependency , according to Robert B . and Laura S . in  .
Besides , such cost may even be greater than the original cost of running welfare programs for the elderly .
On the contrary , diverting public spending on the other areas of the country's development will expand its economic opportunities and improve its social  conditions .
Such financial and social problems would actually not be faced by the individuals and their .
When there is more expenditure on social services  , education , infrastructure and development  , there is a greater chance for the country to build a better economy . . And with economic growth , the country will become richer and the people will enjoy a higher standard of living .
In fact , public spending on higher education pays off , especially in times of economic crisis or downturn (Aisha , 2009)
For example , the society becomes more educated and affluent as more money is being pumped into the economy to ensure higher education for its people ; and the people will get higher income when they work .
In such a situation , the country becomes richer and there would not be a need to cut down on program benefits or raise taxes .
Therefore , economic growth would ensure the continuation of welfare programs for the elderly in the long run .
The burden on the people to pay for higher taxes in the future would be lessened as the economy serve to benefit the aged .
In addition , limiting public spending on the aged would mean that individuals have to provide the cost for their own old age dependency .
This is  beneficial for the country as people will learn to depend on themselves .
They would be able to able to work betterand attain higher income so as to help support education , housing , social services and rising cost of transportation for themselves .
It would be  useful  when there is an economic downturn and the government is not able to spend on the aged .
"An aging population will push up pension and healthcare costs , forcing major increases in public spending that could slow economic growth in rich and poor countries ."
(Fox , 2009) Clearly , as Singapore experiences the problem of ageing population , it is important to generate economic growth for the country to benefit the aged .
Higher expenditure on areas like infrastructure and education , allows the country to achieve greater economic growth which  in turn will solve the problems of aging population .
With better economic and social condition in the country , people would become richer and affluent .
This would then reduce the worries of individuals and their families about issues pertaining to education , housing , social services and transportation .
In today's society , ageing population is increasingly a problem that many countries such as Singapore , Sweden and Japan , are now facing .
An ageing population brings challenges and opportunities for people to explore .
There is a need to put in place government policies and programmes to meet the emerging needs of an ageing population .
Therefore , I agree to reduce public spending on the aged , so that more resources and funds will be allocated to other areas of development , such as the economy , education , technology and general healthcare within the country .
But , help  for the aged should not be neglected too .
People will learn to be self-reliant when the support given by the government is being limited .
For example , people need to make their own plans to fund for their own health care .
In the case of Singapore , the government implemented policies such as Medisave and Medishield , to "force" her citizens to set aside money and plan for their future finances . .
This will help ease the burden on the government as the people are able to afford their own medical fees through their own savings .
Another scheme that the Singapore government adopted is the Central Provident Fund (CPF) .
Peoplehave to save a part of their salary and could only withdraw and use the savings upon retirement .
Because of such schemes , the government has more resources to focus more on other developments of the country which are equally important to ensure competitiveness in this globalised world .
Therefore , limiting public spending on the aged will reduce the dependency of the aged on the government and ensure continuous developments in other areas of the country .
Even though family members are responsiblefor taking care of their elderly ,  many assume that the government would be responsible for it because of its vast resources .
Some took advantage of the situation and make use of the low-cost medical facilities , as can be seen in the long queues formed at the polyclinics in Singapore . .
This may lead to people who are in urgent need for medical consultation being delayed , which in turn , may cause serious consequences .
Financial help should be given to those who are really in  need , instead of allocating large amount of funds to all the elderly .
Many elderly are still able to work and support themselves , thus they don't need the help of the government .
According to the one article , PM Lee said that "the best way to keep health costs down is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle" (Channel News Asia 2009) .This implies that as long as the elderly keep themselves healthy , lesser burden will be placed on the government .
Therefore , part of the public spending on the aged can be diverted to developing other sectors of the country , so as to ensure that the public spending is well-allocated .
Even though there are schemes to make people save for their old age now , the older generation who have little or no education , are not able to comprehend what these schemes are about and what benefits they will get . .
Therefore they need the aid of the government to help them cope with their medical issues and their daily lives .
More elderly friendly facilities in the neighbourhood of the elderly should be built and good values such as giving up seats to the elderly should be taught to the public to help the elderly to cope  with their daily lives .
For example , in Singapore , there are priority seats for the elderly so that they do not have to stand for long hours .
If money were to be diverted to other area of developments ,  .
Therefore public spending is essential , and it  should not be limited to assisting the developments of other areas  and neglect the major problem of ageing population  .
However , many social problems caused by the elderly are mainly due to the lack of education .
More resources should be allocated to develop the country's education system so as to ensure the continuous supply of good labour and also to educate the public of the importance of self-reliance .
With more people receiving education , they will understand the importance of planning for their future and developing the culture of taking care of themselves and their elderly .
Therefore , funding for the aged should be limited , so as to provide more funds for the development of other areas , such as the education sector . .
In conclusion , for a country to be successful , it not only has to look after the welfare of the elderly , but also to ensure the continuous development of  the economic , the education and technological sectors .
These sectors will in turn ensure the vibrancy of the country , which will lead to long lasting growth .
It is not wise to allocate large public spending on the aged  .
But instead ,  , one may set the sights furtherand tackle the root of the problem , which is to educate the public  to plan for their future finances . .
This will help to develop the country as a whole , as it diversifies the country's development .
The question on whether national economies should be spent on the aged  has long been a controversial one .
Each person has his or her own opinions .
Some people say that the country's budget should focus on healthcare for the elders , as old , retired people find it hard to cope with their problems without any support from the governments .
However , others argue that the money should be used in other areas of the country's development .
Each opinion has its own merits .
In my own opinion , I agree with the latter , for the following reasons: firstly , , the national budget should be spent on the more essential areas of the country's development .
For example , more money should be spent on education than any other areas .
Education has an irrefutably important part of a country's development .
Investing in education , in my opinion , is the key to growth in any country .
With a strongly educated workforce , the national economy would dramatically strengthen .
There are many ways to invest in education .
One of them is to upgrade the facilities and the quality of teaching .
More money should be spent on re-constructing old buildings and building more needed ones (laboratories and libraries ) .
On the other hand , the governments should pay more attention to the quality of teachers  .
Inviting more good professors from overseas to  join our teaching staff may be helpful .
Secondly , the money of the country should also be used to improve health care .
More hospitals with better equipment should be built .
However , it is not just the facilities that need improvement , but also the treatment of patients . .
This has again proved the point that I have made before .
Better education results in better quality of labour .
In fact , this is also a way to solve the problem of the aging   , because the elderly are those who need the support of health care the most .
Last but not least , technological researches and new inventions are also what the government should pay attention to .
The development of technology and its effects has always been one of the most important factors that totally changed the way we have lived  .
More and more inventions are made in order to enhance the quality of our daily lives .
Such improvements indisputably made our lives more enjoyable and our work more effective .
These researches and inventions can cover  .
Technological improvements will improve the educational level of people , the quality of health care , the living standards , etc . . . To some extent , these strategies also indirectly assist the elderly .
Rather , what I try to point out is the elderly could stand to benefit even if the national budget is spent on other fields . .
The most prominent demographic trends in the world today would be the aging of population .
Demographic aging ,  simply means the shift in the age distribution (i .e . , age structure) of a population toward older ages .
An aging population has many social , economic and health implications for a country and this common occurrence is not just a short term issue ; but a long term problem caused by the falling of fertility rates and high mortality .
the aging  of a population has become  a natural process that is happening in most of the developing countries; and Singapore is not being spared too .
In fact , Singapore has one of the fastest aging populations in Asia and therefore , there is A need for the government to develop and implement new public policies to accommodate to this  emerging group of people in the near future .
a need for new public policies would mean a need for greater public spending on the aged .
This is  to cater to the needs of  this newly emerging group whose mean age is 65 years . , and it will would make up nearly one-fifth of our population by 2030 .
Although aging population is of a direct consequence to the drop in fertility rates , it is also the result of high life expectancy and mortality rates .
This has come about due to the improvement in medical technology , public health awareness and sanitation , which in turn showed that many Singaporeans are living in better conditions than they had before .
Currently , there are about 7% of Singapore's population that is over the age of 65; and statistics have shown that this figure would increase to 19% by the year 2030 .
With such a sizeable number of aged in a small country like Singapore , it will definitely have many socio-economic implications ; and thus the government should generate more public polices to care for this group of people in the years to come .
Because this group of people will generally make up a significant number in our population , the government should divert more funds to improve  its healthcare system and also upgrade its infrastructure and facilities to cater to an older population .
In fact , our  government is already preparing Singapore for a new paradigm   , as this can be seen from the funding of projects such as the building of Studio Apartments , which is specially built to cater to the needs of the aged .
These apartments have special facilities that look after the elderly , such as  lifts stopping at every floor and handgrips built around the flat so that it is more convenient and safer for the elderly .
Hence , public spending should not be limited .
In fact , we should  divert more funds to similar projects that will cater to the needs of an older population as they will after all make up a significant number in Singapore , and thus more focus should be placed on them .
In addition ,  more funds should be dedicated to improving the healthcare systems by building more nursing homes and  hospitals for the aged , as old age will usually be an age that is more prone to illnesses and diseases .
Therefore , we will need a large pool of specialised trained nurses and caretakers to look after them .
This can be done through the building of more nursing homes and the encouragement of more people to take up professions relating to this field  .
Therefore , aging population is an issue that we cannot afford to neglect and public policies should cater to this new demographic trend by focusing more on the increasing older population size .
Therefore , more funds should be dedicated to projects which will better prepare Singaporeans for an aging population .
However , although aging population is a serious issue that will affect the productivity and competitiveness of Singapore , we should also note that the aging of a population is happening not only in Singapore but around the world as well .
It is a natural consequence of economic development which extends life spans and lower birth rates .
Hence , government should not over focus on this issue and throw in excessive funds in this area as this will inhibit the growth of other sectors  .
This is because funds can be diverted to other areas of the country's development , such as   and building better infrastructure to support the country's development into a world class city .
Singapore is never a welfare state to begin with; the government has adopted a policy to ensure self-reliance , such as the introduction of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) which makes it compulsory for all Singapore citizens to save for future use .
Hence , it is impossible for our government to provide welfare and pension for everyone .
The Medisave Scheme under Central Provident Fund (CPF) was introduced to make it compulsory for all Singaporeans to set aside 6-8% of their salaries to deposit into their personal account that can be used to pay for hospital fees .
Members of the CPF must keep a minimum of $17 ,000 in their Medisave account to pay for medical expenses .
According to  , the average active member's balance in 1994 was S$73 816 , which  shows how efficient the CPF saving scheme is .
Therefore , with such policy in place , public spending on the aged is already limited in this sense .
Similarly , the government also promotes life long employability which can be seen from the extension of retirement age from 62 to 65 years old .
This is to ensure that the aged can accumulate more wealth before retiring when they are still able to work , thereby reducing the public spending of our government on the aged .
In addition to all these policies , filial piety and greater family support is also emphasized Children are encourage  to take care of their parents when they are old as this will ease the funding of the government for  the elderly .
Instead the government could just focus on the needy elderly who have no children to look after them .
Hence in conclusion , aging population is a natural occurrence due to low birth rates and higher life expectancy .
Therefore ,  the government should not reduce on their public spending on the aged , but should instead increase  .
However , over focusing on this situation may inhibit the growth of our economy as  precious funds can be diverted to other uses , especially  .
One should also recognise the fact that Singapore is not a welfare state in the first place , and the policies were shaped according to the policy of self-reliance  .
Thus in this context , it is possible to justify the point that public spending should not be limited , so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
As Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) decreases year after year , we are in increasing danger of having an ageing population in the very near future .
As of 2007 , Singapore's TFR is 1 .29 , which is well below the replacement level of 2 .1 .
The old-age support ratio has also decreased to 8 .5 (2007) from 17 .0 (1970) .
This trend suggests that Singapore is confronted with the problem of a rapidly fast aging population .
Singapore's TFR is getting lower and lower every year because more Singaporeans are settling down at a later age .
They are putting more focus on their careers first .
Couples are also giving birth to fewer babies , opting for smaller families to have a higher level of income .
As the aging population in Singapore increases , more and more money have to be allocated to the aging population .
I feel that public spending on the aged should be given more attention and more funds , as in the long-term , the aging population could potentially become a major problem .
Public spending could be focused more on giving incentives for couples to have bigger families .
As Singapore's TFR is very low , the government could do more to encourage couples to give birth .
The government could give higher monetary incentives for families who have more children .
Singapore has a high standard of living , and thus it is expensive to raise a child .
The government could divert more money to the "Baby Bonus Scheme" , though it seems the incentives are not enough at the moment for Singaporean families to want to have a bigger family .
If the incentives worked , there will be more youths in the future .
This will help to ease the financial burden of the elderly .
There would be more people supporting the old and the aged would be better taken care of .
If the TFR is higher , there would also be more people at work in the future , and contributing  to the economy and sustaining its high growth .
This would also mean that the government would not need to worry about spending more money to recruit people for national defense , as there would be enough young people to defend the country in the future .
This is one reason why money can be spent more on other areas for the country's development instead of  on the aged .
Public spending may help to encourage higher birth rates .
In the near future , it is inevitable that Singapore will have an aging population .
To tackle the problem , public spending should be given more to the aged .
The government could set up more schools to train the elderly new skills .
These new skills would allow more opportunities for the elderly to find jobs .
The government could also give more subsidies for the aged .
This will help ease their cost of living as many of them could be unemployed and unable to cope with the higher cost of living .
There should also be more public spending on elderly health care .
As the elderly are prone to more serious illnesses , some would not be able to pay their medical bills .
Smaller number of working people in society would mean that the elderly would be more dependent on fewer people , and these people would be heavily burdened .
The aging population would need more public spending as their dependents would be smaller and heavily burdened .
They would need more subsidies and monetary help to continue to lead a comfortable life .
The government could also spend more money on the health sector in general .
They should concentrate public spending on the health sector , on research and improvement of technology , to promote better and cheaper health care .
This would improve the lives of everyone in general and also help to give cheap and good health care for the elderly .
Public spending for the health care sector would benefit everyone and this could prove to be very effective .
To conclude , I feel that public spending on the aged is very important .
Singapore's population is increasingly becoming an aging population , and it  would be a problem that we cannot ignore .
Good long-term planning is essential to solve this problem of the aged and public spending on the aged is very crucial , and it cannot be neglected .
The government could also spend more money on giving incentives to encourage more families to have more children .
This would be good for the economy in the future , and would also result in more people supporting the elderly .
If this fails , public spending on the aged is the only option and more money should be diverted to it instead of the other areas .
"Over the past two decades , journalists and scholars have periodically commented on how rising public spending for older people is expected to threaten if not erode public commitments to other deserving groups ."
said Paul W . Newacheck (Health Affairs , 2004) .
Public spending is money expended from the government to pay for the country's expenses (Business Dictionary , 2009) .
The money can come from different sources , with the majority coming from taxation .
For instance , the tax policy in Singapore is drawn out based on the notion of guiding desirable behaviour towards different economic and social goals .
Therefore , public spending should emphasize not only the social , but also the economic development of the country .
However , there are many emerging concerns about the ageing society in many developed countries .
Limiting public spending for the aged may in turn bring about social problems , as well as other issues that concerned family responsibilities and dignity .
As the percentage of the aged increases , the percentage of people generating income in the country diminishes .
Without the government to shoulder part of the burden , most immediate families of the elderly will find it financially taxing on their part .
In worse cases , cash-strapped children will be unwilling to take care of them due to the high standards of living and healthcare costs increasing each year .
This problem falls back on society , as abandoned parents will be left to fend for themselves (Megawati Wijaya , 2009) .
A research in Singapore shows that the Geylang East Home for the Aged , a shelter for elderly abandoned by their family , said that its 37-bed home is always full .
In many cases , the families of these abandoned aged just passed their responsibility to another institution .
(Avia Collinder , 2008) Also , I feel that most elderly people have a strong sense of dignity and self worth , considering their lifelong achievements and efforts throughout the years (Nordenfelt L , 2003) .
These people are most probably not going to turn to government's aid even if their own families reject them .
Without the government's initiatives , the elderly people are going to go through a hard time coping in  society .
Nonetheless , it still can be argued that directing public spending to other areas of the country's development can indirectly offset these social problems .
By investing in other areas , we can empower these three groups of people: employers , families and the elderly .
Firstly , this amount of money can be used to help businesses and individuals struggling from the recent economic crisis .
For instance , the government implemented the Job Credit Scheme in Singapore .
This scheme was introduced to preserve jobs during the economic downturn .
Basically , participating employers will receive a cash grant based on the CPF contributions they have made for their existing employees(IRAS , 2009) .
It serves as a winning tool as the employers get to bring their businesses to a higher level , and  existing workers in turn retain their jobs .
In this way , these benefiters can fulfill their basic responsibilities better , such as in taking care of their own families with the higher purchasing power they have .
Secondly , education and learning are important factors contributing to a country's success .
With the society changing constantly , the monetary support which the government can provide is only temporary .
Often , people need to improve themselves to keep up with the demands and needs of their surrounding milieu .
For example , investing on current employees to advance their expertise in the workplace can land them with better promotion prospects and job security .
Equipping the younger generation with relevant skills can also allow them higher chances of securing better jobs of their preferences in the future .
Also , the government can educate these people about their responsibilities by emphasizing the role of the family in caring for the elderly (Megawati Wijaya , 2009) .
With better jobs and increases in income , they can help the families to cope with the high standards of living and spiraling healthcare costs for the aged .
As a result , social stability can be fulfilled while economic growth is being spurred .
Lastly , investments can be made on healthcare to empower the aged to take charge of their own health .
Research studies in New York showed that living a healthy lifestyle is very important to the elderly people in their journey of conquering new physical , emotional and mental challenges (Admin in Aging , 2008) .
The level of physical activity needed to be exerted for beneficial results is attainable by majority of the aged (Gerontology , 2002) .
The government can also hold "Healthy Lifestyle" campaigns to encourage the aged to engage more actively in activities , and promote healthy aging .
On top of that , the involvement of their immediate families in the process will be a bonus in helping them to cope with ageing .
With a blissful mind and a healthy body , these elderly will be less likely to seek emotional and social help from the government .
All in all , limiting public spending on the aged and directing the funds into other areas of development such as businesses , education and healthcare is more rewarding then just focusing on the needy groups .
Although the help is theoretically superficial , it is indirectly helping the society to deal with the ageing society more effectively as compared to  using  monetary support , which is a temporary solution .
This solution is made much easier when we understand the bigger picture .
If we do not pay attention to the long term effects the problem is going to cause , we will risk the possibility of allocating  limited resources for the wrong usage .
It is well-known that there are various areas of a country's development which demand substantial expenditure from public spending .
These areas are urban development , infrastructure projects , biomedical research , edbiz , and so on .
Abundant financial resources are alloted to each of the areas mentioned above , since the development of these areas are essential in national construction and economic growth  .
However , with the aging population increasing in number , more public spending , including pension and health provision ,  is expended on the aged .
More and more elderly people , especially some of those who cannot take care of themselves , empty nesters , other special groups , as well as their families , have a greater demand for pension services; and social services will be needed to provide for old-age pension .
(Wu Li Min , 2009) .
Therefore ,  public spending on the aged should not be limited so that it guarantees the welfare of the aged and protects their rights and benefits .
The aged might have devoted their youth and even their whole life to serving the society; and public spending on the aged is therefore necessary .
In fact , every one of us , regardless of doing mental or physical work , has made a significant contribution towards the development of society .
Hence , as long as a person has sacrificed for the social development of society ,  he should be looked after by the state when he is old , even if he could no longer contribute in his area of work . .
If the public spending on the aged is limited , the burden on the children or younger generation will be much heavier since they will have to bear with more expenses incurred by their parents .
It was claimed that families and individuals will face many issues if welfare programs are cut or restructured (Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005) .
A survey in China showed that "living and working pressure makes people powerless to take care of their parents"; and this kind of pressure has become  a great difficulty for young people now (Wang Jun , 2009) .
In today's society , many people of working age , with their own careers and families , have to withstand considerable economic pressure .
Once the elderly reach their old age , they are afflicted with a variety of ailments .
Expensive medical and health care cost  , in addition to the very high daily cost , have indeed caused  serious difficulties .
So ,  when the children have to bear the medical expenses and the cost of everyday lives of their parents , they tend to live beyond their income .
The gap between the rich and the poor in  present society is still apparent .
When  the government subsidies are reduced , retired people from high-income groups may still be comfortable with their finances , but the relatively poor people will face  difficulties in livelihood .
Higher income people tend to have more savings , and so they can enjoy a carefree retirement .
However , people from the low-wage sectors in general do not have much savings , since they are often faced with the problem of having  insufficient money to spend .
In their later years , if they encountered ungrateful children who are unwilling to take care of them ,  Many people today spend money on their own  families , the needs of their children , as well as the pursuit of material comfort   , instead of  spending money on their parents .
At this point , a notion of "Parental Support Law" has been suggested to force the children to be filial to their parents (Huang Yu Shan , 2002) .
However ,  .
If a legal act is required to force people  to support their parents , does it mean that our moral values have deteriorated  ?
Clearly ,  public spending on the aged should be continued to protect the rights and benefits of the aged .
The aged have dedicated so much to the development of a country and they should be thanked .
Reduced public spending will increase the burden of the children and furthermore , poor people will become poorer .
In fact , we all will grow old one day .
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics , the life expectancy of Singaporean has increased noticeably to 78 .0 for male and to 82 .8 for female (as cited from Press Release , Singapore Department of Statistics , 2008) .
Although that is good news  , it also leads to some unpleasant problems for Singapore , such as increasing the financial burden for elderly-care .
From my perspective , economic development is not only the key factor in easing the aging problem  , but also is the key solution to some serious problems caused by this process .
First of all ,  it is commonly believed that a well-funded life which arises from economic success will help people to  purchase sufficient food for their own consumption .
At the same time , there are more facilities  , such as pools for swimming , courts for playing tennis , indoor gyms for various kind of sports .
With  financial sufficiency , people can live an easy life and  .
For instance , living in air-conditioning buildings helps us  or using  robots reduces death rates in some high-risk jobs .
In the other words , as a result of economic development , we have been enjoying better and healthier lives .
Secondly , economic development also encourages the improvement of services  .
Among  them , the entertainment industry should be mentioned as the most obvious one .
, more and more entertainment parks , visual and virtual products ,  such as films and games come into our life .
For example , a typical citizen in a globalised city , such as Tokyo or London , can now enjoy his or her weekendtime in a hundred destinations for recreation and some of them are known worldwide .
Alternatively , they can stay at home and choose among tens of local and international TV channels to watch or they can surf the internet to visit millions of websites .
Indeed , it is no doubt that  .
What is more , a prosperous economy can also foster further technological invention , medical innovation as well as educational improvement , which all are considered to be important factors in alleviating the aging process .
Once government sufficiently finances medical research , more diseases can be cured or prevented more effectively .
In the same pattern , once the educational level is raised , people can be more aware of how to take care of themselves , as  well as to live long and healthily .
Lastly , the rapid development of a nation's economy not only makes the process of aging slow down but also partially solves its annoying consequences .
Among  its consequences , Peter G . Peterson in the article "A Gray World" raised his concern on the huge expenses for elderly caring services (Peter G . Peterson , 2001) .
In my opinion , economic factors should be the most important solution .
As discussed above , financial sufficiency can urge the improvement of the other factors .
Accordingly , people enjoy  better health and live longer  .
This enables them to stay at work for a longer time .
Since they are also healthy , they can contribute to society as long as they intend to .
In addition , financial factors are also incentives for life long working , as they can support their current lives and save more for the rest of their lives if they had decided to keep working .
There is a citation from Frank Field , British chairman of the all-party committee: "If you look at life expectancy in 1948 , when the state pension was introduced , and take that as a reasonable length of time to receive a pension , you would have a retirement age of 74 today ."
(British Broadcasting Corporation , 2002) .
Looking at this issue from another angle , some may argue that economic factor can  worsen the aging process and its consequences .
In fact , the development of the eonomy itself cannot wholly solve the problems , and one needs to examine more complex solutions in terms of  social , political and economical factors .
However , economic issue should be the first to be considered in any topic relating to the aging process .
In conclusion , today's developed countries have been increasingly confronted with the aging process and its consequences .
,  contribute to easing this process but economic factor  .
, a prosperous economy not only lengthens the of the general population  , but also allow people to live more healthily and lighten their social burden  on elderly care .
While the population is shifting towards a greying one , many would start to worry about the ease of aging in the current society , especially amidst a time of financial crisis and difficulty .
Current research and development such as medical advancement and barrier free housing estates are examples that have helped ease the aging process .
However , more emphasis should be placed on the development of social policy that will help to alleviate and address concerns such as the lack of financial support and social care , which affects the elderly more directly .
Meanwhile , there are already policies in place , such as the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , Lease Buy Back Scheme (LBS) and housing grants for married children staying near parents , which are all structured to aid the aged in terms of financial and healthcare issues .
The Central Provident Fund is a savings account for all workers in Singapore for them to set aside a sum of 33 percent of their wages for retirement purposes  .
This sum of money will serve as a source of income when one cannot work in the future due to old age .
On top of that , a subset of the CPF called the Medisave account , will serve as a backup sum to pay for any medical bills should the need arises .
Therefore , they would not have to strain their pockets to pay for their health care when they have already stopped working .
At this juncture , one may wonder how the Medisave account could be sufficient when medical fees these days are so steep .
Treatment for common illnesses , such as stroke would have already chalked up thousands  and things could be a lot more worse , should there be more than one illness to treat .
However , this could be solved by purchasing Medishield or third party healthcare insurance using the Medisave itself .
The insurance will serve to cover most of the medical expenses , if not all .
In the event that an individual is not being able to pay the minimum amount , they can apply for the Medifund , which is an endowment plan funded by the nation's economic growth , targeted to help those who still cannot afford to pay the bills despite already being heavily subsidised .
With these in place , the aged will be well taken care of and given a peace of mind in monetary ; and they could live in a more comfortable environment during old age .
For those elderly who have funds that are locked in the form of housing assets , there is a solution for them too .
Just recently , on March 2009 , the government introduced the Lease Buy Back Scheme (LBS) for elderly to sell off the tail end thirty years lease of their flats in return for a life-long monthly retirement income .
These elderly will stand to enjoy a supplement to their retirement income on top of what they will receive from CPF payout .
Depending on the age group , an amount ranging from $500 to $800 will be issued to them monthly after an upfront sum of $5000 .
Again , we can see how public policy has shaped to help the elderly to acquire a less financially taxing aging process .
Apart from being well taken care of in medical bills , the elderly needs to be looked after in their social well-being too . .
It is in the government's interest that these elderly do receive an appropriate amount of attention and care so that they will not be deprived of company at old age .
This is why the Housing Development Board (HDB) came up with a housing grant of forty thousand dollars to encourage the younger generations to live in flats close  their parents .
The policy will benefit not only the purchaser in terms of cost  , but it will also help to propagate the importance of filial piety in  society .
When  married children are housed near to their parents , they are more likely to visit them frequently due to convenience and simultaneously , the elderly will be taken care of physically as well .
Opponents of this scheme may argue that the opposite may take place instead .
Rather than having the married couple to look after their parents , it might be the couple  exploiting  their parents; such as living off them or   treating them as babysitters for their own children .
Nevertheless , this actually aligns with the government's aim: fostering mutual care between the young and elderly .
By housing them in close vicinity , it actually adds  purpose to the lives of the elderly as well .
"That's why fitness facilities , children's playground and elderly exercise equipment are put together" quoted Mr Mah BT (2008) in a housing speech .
All this contributes to making the aging process a more fruitful and meaningful one .
In the presence of these numerous social policies , many aspects of the aging process have been addressed by the government and this has served to mitigate some of the most common concerns among the elderly .
These policies have benefited the elderly and will continue to provide assistance to them in the future .
Therefore , it is evident that current research and policies have helped to ease the aging process and made retirement a less burdensome one .
The growth of the aging population is increasing at an alarming rate .
From research , in developed nations , people born in the twentieth century can live for 35 years longer than people who are born in the nineties .
The increase in aging population reflects the need for better healthcare and social services .
This is because as people aged , their health will deteriorate and this results in the increase of healthcare and social cost .
To ease this aging process , government and other industries initiated various efforts to reduce spending on healthcare and elderly dependency on the younger generation .
With continual advancement in the medical industry , current research and development in better healthcare services and facilities like building new community hospitals , providing long-term care services and developing electronic health record system (EHR) , can help ease the problems of healthcare cost and elderly dependency .
Therefore , I agree that current research and development in the field of medicine have eased the the aging process .
Firstly , the building of new community hospitals provide intermediate healthcare for the elderly who do not require consultation from the general hospitals .
With such developments , the elderly can save cost and receive appropriate healthcare treatments more conveniently .
However , convenience does not mean it is affordable .
Healthcare cost in Singapore is constantly rising with the advance in technology .
A single hospitalization can cost up to thousand of dollars .
If the elderly do not have enough savings  , they may depend  on the government or their children .
However , Singaporeans enjoy healthcare subsidies .
The amount of subsidies on hospitalization will be determined by means-testing .
This way , the government reduces the financial dependency of the elderly by providing help based on their financial needs .
In addition , there are also other financial subsidies available ,  like the Medisave , Medishield and Medifund to keep healthcare cost affordable for Singaporeans .
Secondly , Long-term care services like home care and rehabilitation can allow patients to recover in surroundings that are more comfortable and with their families around them . .
These Long-term care services involved two board categories: residential healthcare and community healthcare , which are managed by Voluntary Welfare Organizations (VWO) or by private operators .
These are cheaper support alternatives as compared to leaving elderly patients in hospitals .
In cases where the family cannot provide attention to or support for the needs of the elderly , they can seek for community healthcare services that are carried out at home or in a centre .
Such services can help to reduce the elderly's emotional dependency on their children too .
However , some volunteers for the elderly home care or rehabilitation centre may lack  profession skills , as compared to those provided  in hospitals .
The elderly may not be receiving the most appropriate medical help .
Fortunately , the government has already recognized the importance of such services to ease aging process .
In the 2009 budget speech , over $500 million will be spend in the next five years on training staff and improving this long-term care services for elderly Singaporeans .
Thirdly , the development of electronic health record system (EHR) helps to increase efficiency and accuracy of a medical diagnosis .
Many elderly with chronic illnesses may have complex medical backgrounds .
With this system , medical information of the elderly will be stored in the database and it is accessible to medical institutions island wide .
As a result , doctors and their staff can reduce the amount of  in gathering healthcare background information forthe elderly and reduce the amount of complicated paperwork .
There are arguments that the implications of this system would be excessive costs .
Just by setting up the system nation-wide , the government will be spending about SGD$200 million over the next two years .
However , based on research , the usage of the Electronic Health Record system can help to reduce duplication and error in medical prescription  , resulting in a cost reduction of  as much as USD$50 billion per year .
Therefore , we can conclude that  research and development can help to decrease healthcare spending and improve the quality of service efficiently .
Today , as our society is faced with the issue of ageing population , the needs for better healthcare and social services will increase .
Advancement in research and development within the medical industry has helped to ease the effects of aging population .
As a result , better healthcare services and facilities are created and they have effectively reduced healthcare cost and elderly dependency .
With the constant advancement in healthcare system , people can enjoy a longer life with better health without subjecting  the society to the adverse effects of aging .
To a large extent , I strongly agree that medical advancement has helped to ease the aging process .
In the Singapore's context ,  8% of the  population is over the age of 65 and by 2035 , it will increase to 20% .
Hence , medical advancement will prove to be beneficial for the aging population in Singapore .
However , I would like to stress that not the entire aging population can take advantage of  the medical advancement .
As such , a lot of aging population in Singapore will not be able to afford the high fees for advanced medical treatment that includes the use of advance technology in medicine and treatments .
This might also lead to  from part of the population who would choose not to seek any medical help due to  .
Nevertheless , this  problem has alerted the government to offer financial aids to the needy the aging population in Singapore .
The Singapore government has been actively promoting awareness of health care issues among the elderly population in general .
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has recently launched insurance financial plans for elder care .
The names of the insurance plans are called Eldershield and Eldershield Supplements (as cited from Central Provident Fund Board Ask Us , 2009) .
These programs will  provide helping hands for  aging population in Singapore .
This also  all the  aging population in Singapore to sign up these insurance plans  .
The reason for doing this is because the  needy elderly in Singapore will be covered by this insurance plan .
Thus , when they want to use this insurance plan for any emergency use , they can use it anytime .
Premiums for this insurance plan can also be paid from Medisave .
Thus , all the needy aging population in Singapore will be taken care of by the Singapore government .
Therefore , the families of the aging  group can also go to the respective hospitals to seek for financial aids  .
The Singapore government will providesubsidies for all the elderly when they seek for medical treatment .
Thus , with the solutions given by the Singapore government , they will help  the aging population to gain  .
In order to reduce this high medical advancement expenses , The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been reaching out to the senior citizens in Singapore by implementing mobile screening buses for the monthly health check (as cited from Health Promotion Board , 2009) .
Ministry of Health (MOH) has decided to make the efficient and accessible screening more affordable and convenient for all the needy elderly in Singapore .
All the needy elderly would just need to pay less than $10 for their blood test in ahealth check package comprising checks for diabetes and high cholesterol levels .
This also resulted that all the needy aging population in Singapore were given a chance to receive certain  in Singapore .
Not only that , all the residential committees (RC) and community centres in many neighbourhoods were promoting this meaningful and  health program to the needy aging population in Singapore  .
Thus , this will be beneficial to all the aging population in Singapore who could not afford any medical fees .
Last but not least , I strongly agree that medical advancement has eased  the aging process with the help of the Singapore government .
Thus , this also shows that  the aging population in Singapore is being well taken care of by the Singapore government .
With the budget given by the government , the aging population in Singapore will be given an equal entitlement to  medical advancement  to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
It is always a thorny issue when it comes to the allocation of the budget pie for the country's development .
Whether it is for educational , economical , societal or military advancement , it is of paramount importance that policy makers make suitable decisions in the best interests of the country and its people .
In my opinion , channeling too much government funds to taking care of the aged can have detrimental effects on the country's development .
Therefore , I am for the statement that public spending on the aged should be limited .
Uncontrolled government spending on healthcare or infrastructure for the aged could result in other groups of needy people not getting their share of the government's financial aid .
These include the handicapped , juvenile delinquents and low income families .
These less privileged groups of people are also members of the society who require our assistance .
Not attending to their needs may have serious impact on the society .
People from low income families struggling to make ends meet may be desperate and might resort to robbery and burglary to ease their financial burden .
Teenagers who engage in unlawful behaviours that defied established criminal codes or deviate from societal norms may continue with their misbehaviours , such as running away from school or home , or even committing petty crimes , if they failed to receive help from respective government bodies and the community .
These are complex social problems that might significantly impact other members of the society , and hence , the development of the country , if not handled appropriately .
Many may argue that the elderly are also equally , if not , more in need of the funds , especially since they were once economically  .
It is only right that their welfare is being taken care of now that they have lost the ability to take care of themselves .
In addition , some would argue that it is of the country's social obligation that this should be done .
But , like many countries , Singapore does not have a pension system for the retired  aged .
If the responsibility of taking care of the aged fell solely on the government , the huge increase in fiscal budget will not be an amount the existing workforce and taxpayers can meet .
Public funding is also required in the development of our education sector as Singapore continues to establish herself as an education hub .
In Singapore , the importance of education cannot be over emphasized .
Large amount of funds are pumped into the education sector so that the younger generation can receive the best education .
These could be in the form of better school sports and laboratory facilities , more funding for enrichment courses or even upgrading of school compound to accommodate more students .
In addition , funding could also imply subsidies for needy students .
Students under Finance Assistant Scheme (FAS) could be provided with school uniforms , school shoes and basic school materials .
Merit bursaries and scholarships can be awarded to students who excelled in their academic and exhibit positive traits and qualities in other aspects of their life .
Singapore also has a mandatory six years Primary Education for all Singaporean .
Financial aid will be needed to ensure that poor families , who cannot afford to send their children to school , could do so .
The ministry stands by the notion that no deserving student should be deprived of education .
As a former president of the United State of America once said , "Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education .
The human mind is our fundamental resource ."
It is clear that education is one of the key aspects for the progress of a nation .
Without sufficient funds from the government , these plans cannot be implemented to their fullest extent .
People often mention that Singapore has only human resource .
Not developing our resources' full potential through education will indeed impede our country's development .
If significant amount of funds is needed in the education sector , there is then a need to limit expenditure on the aged .
Many may then question: why target public spending on the aged ?
Why not cut down on other areas like urban renewal ?
Or even cut back on military spending ?
I believe it is a difficult question to answer directly because the essence of the argument lies in the fact that the government should always spend wisely , where necessary , within the national budget .
I am not arguing for the Government to cut down public spending on the aged so as to spend without consideration on defense or urban renewal .
To limit military spending might weaken the country's first line of defense .
Singapore , being an island represented by a little red dot on the world map requires strong military defense as a form of deterrence against our potential aggressors .
Without sufficient funds , the military loses its ability to procure better and more effective weapons and devices to train and equip soldiers .
This would prove detrimental for a country's survival , especially when a weak army force may attract potential invaders .
In light of these reasons , it would be justifiable if a bigger share of the budget pie is being given to the military .
Similarly in urban renewal , there is a need to refurbish the neighbourhood and upgrade the old estates .
It is difficult to draw the line as to who should be given how much of the government's budget .
But it is important to realize that , channeling funds into the education sector  may bring about more productive future generations who would in turn help to support the  aged in time to come .
In comparison , diverting funds to support the aged would appear to have no returns .
Diverting funds to other areas can be regarded as a better "investment" by policy makers and would aid in the country's development .
In conclusion , the government has to carry out careful planning on public spending .
Channeling excessive budget or limiting any one of the areas is not beneficial to the country's development .
The Government has to make critical decisions , reviewing their decisions regularly , so as to determine which aspects of the country's development should be the main focus at different periods of time .
In the long run , the government must seek to  for the older generation , at the same time less burdensome for the younger generation .
Perhaps government should introduce policies which could add value to the aged workers , in turn increasing their productivity .
The government should try to accommodate the aging issue while limiting public spending on the aged .
With their vast knowledge and rich experience from their many years of contributing to the society , the aged would definitely be an important resource the country could tap on .
In this highly modernized world , most democratic countries depend on their government for support in an array of areas , usually in the form of monetary support .
Such financial singular by the government is termed as public spending .
A principal source of income for public spending comes from taxation .
As widely known , taxation is very limited and thus public spending has to be circumscribed .
Hence the efficient allocation of funds on public spending is deemed important as  it is definitely not able to cover the amount of funds required by the entire society .
Hence , the question as to how much we should spend on an area compared to another emanates .
Public spending are funds that are used on the society and the aged certainly has a share of it as well .
Diverting much of the public spending to different areas of the country's development is certainly abominable as we would be leaving the defenseless aged to fend themselves against the numerous problems that surface while aging .
Hence , we should limit the spending on the elderly , but only to a small extent so as not to create another problem for the elderly which adds on to their already heavy burden .
In a pragmatic view , channeling large amounts of funds to the singular of the country such as research and development and education would in the long run benefit the country's economic growth .
However , it would be morally wrong to leave the elderly who are part of the society alone .
The elderly did contribute much to the country in their younger age and the society should be obliged to look after them when they are older and not cast them aside .
Furthermore , public spending is made for everyone in the society to enjoy and seek help from and we cannot limit the funds for the elderly just because they are not able to produce any returns after enjoying the funds .
Therefore we should not limit public spending to a large extent .
With changing values in the developed countries , people are giving birth to fewer children .
This change in mindset changes the percentage of young against the old .
As a result , the percentage of old is certainly rising rapidly .
With increasing amount of people turning into old age , the portion of the public spending on the aged should not be decreasing instead .
Nonetheless , the focus of a country is to grow and prosper and development in other areas are seemingly more important .
Therefore , the society has to maintain a high standard of living as a developed world and since the elderly form the bulk of the society; we should spend more to help improve their lives so as not to lower our overall standard of living .
Hence we should spend on other developments but not at the expense of forgoing that for the elderly .
Spending on education , research and development and urban renewals are long term projects and need a large amount of funding in order to succeed .
Much of the limited funds should be diverted to such projects which will be successful in the long run and generate profits .
In addition , this generated profit will make it easier to look after the old (incorrect in-text citation Spending on the elderly on the other hand is short term and does not generate much profit . .
However , living in a democratic society , the interest of the people should be taken care of as well  than blindly focusing on the growth of the country  .
Therefore , we should take into consideration  much more implications rather than economic growth of the country .
As such , public spending on the aged should not be forgone for the development of the country .
Society is made up of people and the interest of people is undoubtedly very important and on par with the country's development .
No one should be sacrificed and disadvantaged over another .
Similarly , public spending should not be diverted largely to the country's development and limited for the aged and a balance should be made .
Therefore , policy makers should take into consideration insert 'the' and delete 'of' different implications and not just be pragmatic in order to make sound allocation of the  .
The allocation should be divided equally in order to provide a fair distribution since both issues are equally important .
The significance of limiting public spending on the aged is the shift of financial burden to the individuals and their families .
When government spending on the aged is cut down , it leaves the individuals and their families to shoulder a larger portion of the costs involved .
The financial allocation for the different usages and needs in the family have to be reconsidered as a result .
Adults will face  the dilemma between providing for their aged parents or supporting their young children's education .
In most cases , the aged would be neglected or a few may even be abandoned in nursing homes .
incorrect in-text citation (Khalik , 2009) .
This gives rise to the social implications like the issue of filial piety that would have a negative impact on society .
The elderly made a commendable contribution to the society when they were younger and active in the workforce .
Being an active part of the workforce in their earlier days , the elderly had contributed to the country's economy in a way .
They had played their part in the economy by being  plural in the country and bringing investment to Singapore by being productive and efficient members of the workforce .
Furthermore , the elderly had undergone experiences that differed significantly from the younger generations .
The lessons , skills and knowledge learnt through these experiences could be important and useful to the younger generations in dealing with the present and future challenges .
Hence , the elderly made significant contributions to the country  , which provides a strong background for the government and society to provide for them .
Asian moral values involves helping and respecting the elders . .
The older population is seen to be knowledgeable with the ability to impart valuable lessons and experiences to the younger generation .
Furthermore , the elderly had worked in bringing up the younger generation .
Hence , in Asian culture , there is moral obligation to care and provide for the elderly .
While there is strong presence of moral obligation to care for the elderly , it cannot be denied that there are other groups of people who are similarly in need of government financial help .
For instance , the physically impaired population requires extensive medical needs which require government funding .
However , the elderly make up a large part of the population and is estimated to be on the rise as the years progress .
incorrect in-text citation (The Committee on Ageing Issues , 2004) .
Whereas , the physically impaired make up a relatively a small part of the population in comparison and is present in different clusters of people .
It would thus , be more feasible for the physically impaired to turn to communal help from charitable organisations than for the elderly to turn to these organisations for singular .
Hence , it would be a wiser choice for the government to provide for the elderly population as the huge population will require a significantly large amount of funding .
Allocation of the state's budget has to be justifiable .
With competing interests that necessitate public spending , public spending on the aged would most likely be restricted .
Our government needs to be pragmatic in its allocation of financial resources .
several areas of the country's developments such as expanding on economic capability through business investment , allocating financial resources on infrastructure and technology , and investing on human capital seem to be of  importance than providing to the financial needs of the aged .
In fact , a more prosperous economy should provide the economic means to support the public spending on the aged .
Thus , managing the economy should come first .
A pragmatic government would rather channel resources to other areas of country's singular .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should and will be limited .
Economic growth is the basis to substantiate the monetary and social welfare benefits for the aged people .
In most countries , a large fiscal budget is on the engines of economic growth .
In Singapore , the engines of growth are from the tourism sector and knowledge and research intensive industries .
In the tourism sector , the focus is on the two integrated resorts which are currently being developed .
It is critical for such investments to establish as it provides employment opportunities .
Increase in tourism arrivals and the attraction of high end consumers will result in generation of high tourism revenues and revenues from high end retail shops .
On the other hand , knowledge and capital intensive industries have started up quite recently in Singapore .
Fusionpolis , Biopolis and business hubs have been set up in various parts of Singapore .
With all these economic developments , our economy can be expanded and sustained .
A stronger economy leads to higher household income .
Consequently , a larger tax base should then sufficiently provide a larger portion of public finance for the aged .
History reminds us of the contributions by our forefathers .
It is thus the responsibility of the society to look after them .
In countries such as the United Kingdom Kingdom , welfare systems and pension schemes are in place .
In contrast , public spending for the aged is limited in Singapore .
We can increase public spending for the aged , but it will compromise financial resources allocated for the general population .
In fact , investment should be on nurturing of our people as they are contributors to the economy .
training , re-training and investing on quality education ,  nurture the people .
Educational institutions provide quality teaching while re-training centres impart new skills so that skills do not become obsolete .
More public finance on the aged will compromise the investments on human capital .
In addition , it only satisfies the social and moral obligations to the aged .
Being pragmatic , we should look towards creating a future for ourselves and the future generation .
In addition , the aged are not the only ones who require monetary support , other needy groups , such as the handicaps , also require monetary support to fund their healthcare needs .
Therefore , the emphasis is not just on the aged .
Nonetheless , the aged will also benefit monetarily when the economy prospers and tax payment is increased .
Most countries have embraced the wonders of technology .
Like the rest of the countries , Singapore has infused huge financial resources on investment for technological upgrades and infrastructural developments .
The installation of an islandwide wireless broadband service is one of the recent technological upgrades .
With this service provision , it enables everyone to stay connected .
Apart from the improvement in telecommunication , our transport network has recently been extended , with an addition of the Circle Line route , which will lead to an increase to the total number of MRT stations by 2020 .
An improved public transport system increases accessiblity and reduces travelling time for most people .
Although these projects have huge costs borne by the government , the benefits still outweigh the cost .
Society benefits as these developments can be accessed by the public .
In addition , both of these long term provisions will reap in profits .
In conclusion , aged people cannot rely on the government to take full responsibility for their needs since there are other priorities in the country's developments which will create job opportunities , greater economic revenues , convenience and efficiency .Though the government has a social responsibility to look after the aged , families should take up the bulk of responsibility for caring and providing essential needs .
With more competing interests for financial resources , public finance on the aged is of least  concern .
it will definitely put a strain on the economic budget and does not reap any return if public spending on the aged has no limits .
In many countries , there is a common phase , a baby-boomer period .
Now , another phase that most nations are facing is the ageing population .
Countries are aware that this issue is pervasive and it will have profound implications to the facets of the society if they are not responding fast to it .
However , the question is , how much of a focus should a country place in it when there are other important areas to look into as well ?
With the stiff competition amongst nations , public spending on the aged should be spent only if necessary , but more focus should be placed in other aspects like for example , education , tourism and security which are the key factors to a country's economy and thus the survival of it .
Funds placed in these aspects can help ease the ageing process in the long run , 
I believe that measures to ease ageing issues can be done at a low cost and can be at the same time .
There are several viable methodssuch as Strong emphasis of family support and creating an awareness  about taking responsibility  filial obligation , insurance , healthy lifestyleand financial planning and ensuring the aged have enough retirement fund .
There are more private sectors dealing in health and nutrition , financial consultants to help in the management of assets .
More support could be given to all these sectors from the government .
Information may not reach out to the uneducated .
Hence funds have to be allocated to help them .
These are necessary expenditure that is unavoidable .
Some argue , that the aged are also part of a communityand that  we should make sure we can provide more for them as well .
It is more ethical to do that and take up the responsibilities rather than finding them a social burden and  to make sure that there are enough" funds for them or even to neglect them  because of pragmatic reasons .
As much as all nations want this , for countries with limited resources , a choice has to be made based on practicality .
With more funding allocated to other development , more social issues can be resolved , allowing more potential economic growth .
It sounds unfair , but it is definitely a solution that a nation should employ .
It is inevitable .
With allocation of funds more to other development , it will ensure that we need not make such heartless and controversial decision in the future .
plural can encourage voluntary welfare organization to help the aged aged .
Responsibilities will be spread among larger groups .
Last of all , placing more funds to enhance and maintain the security and economy of a nation should be one of the top priorities .
Without this , a nation will face stronger challenges .
Helping the aged will then not even be possible .
It has been proven that countries with strong economy and security do pose a threat to others .
A good example are  the four giants .
in the context of a small country such as Singapore , besides taking a diplomatic approach , the country also has to make sure that her economy is strong enough for foreign companies to invest in .
This ensures her safety unlike countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan .
When more jobs are created , business prospers more and more could then be done to support the aged .
Although , this strategy may lessen the attractiveness for foreigners to choose the country for retirement due to less policies and emphasis on the aged , it definitely helps a country to a larger extent .
Countries without good economy have more social issues like corruption , crime rates etc .
Countries with poor security , military force , usually can't really negotiate terms . 
The aged should not be forgotten but spending on them needs to be limited and only if needed .
However , this will require the whole community's effort to make sure that cultivation of moral valuesand virtues are deeply rooted in them .
This is to ensure that the future batch of elderly are well-prepared for their own ageing process and not just wait for the government to take care of them .
Public spending on aged can then be reduced much more and more must be placed in other developments that can bring prosperity to the nation and minimize social issues .
With much credit to swift medical advancements , the average life span of a human being in America has shot up by 5 years in just a decade to 82 years today .
Such increase in longevity and the reduce in birth rates , will no doubt lead to an inevitable rise to the problems of aging , as there are fewer and fewer young people to support the rising number of elderly , both financially and/ socially .
Aging is a big issue , governments from all over the world are pushing forward policies and Research and Developments to stem its economical and social impacts on a country .
Aging is one process most people dread , especially for those without children .
In Singapore , our government has recently implemented a policyknown as Lift Improvement and Facilities Enhancement , which aims to improve the living conditions of single elderly or those who have been abandoned by their families .
Residential areas with high elderly density are set to undergo upgrading to provide more elderly-friendly-facilities .
Installation of lifts on every level and hand bars in the toilets , for instance , can help elderly overcome certain movement difficulties which they encounter in their daily lives .
The setting up of the senior citizens' corner can also act as a platform for interaction among the elderly , especially when travelling out of their house is made easier .
They would be more willing to engage in more social activities , thus becoming more receptive to happenings around them and learn to be more self reliant .
Also , the new alarm system and window grills can also ensure a higher level of security in their area .
This current policy of facility upgrades is very comprehensive as it ensures  convenience , security , entertainment and thus the social well-being of elderly .
One of our current policies to ease the aging process is by encouraging the inclusion of elderly in our workforce .
, allows the elderly to enter the workforce and maintain a spot in the society .
With the elderly working , they can gain an additional source of income for their family and increase the productivity of the society .
However , it is often argued that such policies could actually stifle competition between the current working group and the elderly .
Working adults , who are already putting too much focus on their career rather than on family planning , tend to postpone their child bearing plans even further .
In such a situation , there will be a surge in productivity initially , but we may expect a serious drop in the long run which aggravates the aging problem due to the shrinking population .
But in the case of elderly employment in Singapore , they tend to be given menial jobs , due to their physical and mental handicap as compared to younger workers .
these menial jobs  are unattractive to the career-driven adults in Singapore  are filled  up by these older workers .
According to the Ministry of Manpower , such jobs are usually occupied by people aged 65 and above and there is still a prevailing shortage of manpower .
Therefore , it would be desirable to have the elderly join the workforce as they could serve to aid in the economy with their spending power and even reduce their need for social welfare , which can be highly taxing to an economy .
The number one killer of elderly is heart failure .
For instance , in- text citation is required , 5% of all the people aged 65 and above suffers from heart failure .
Although some elderly who suffer gentle heart failure could still maintain a relatively normal life , those who suffer to a severe extent have their day-to-day activities affected .
They no longer have the ability to pursue a normal and perhaps happy life .
However with R&D in the area of heart-related diseases , has led to the developments of new drugs and treatments to control and reduce the effects of heart failures in their everyday life .
Hence our current R&Ds have no doubt helped elderly by increasing their quality of life .
All in all , aging is part of the natural life cycle of an organism .
Everyone has a role to play to solve the persisting aging problem in many developed societies .
Policies to upgrade housing in Singapore have improved the living conditions of the elderly , together with the setting up of the senior citizens' corners I am convinced that the elderly can now participate more actively in the society and live off with a higher social well being .
As for the improvements in current R&D , we can all anticipate more ground-breaking inventions to relief elderly of pains from illness .
Also , having the elderly joining  the workforce can increase the total productivity and reduce the burden piled on family members .
Nonetheless , I am convinced  that current research and developments policies do play an important role to help ease the arduous aging process .
In this ever competitive world , the idea of the weak being more susceptible to elimination and the strong emerging victorious is not unfounded .
Indeed , this concept is applicable to a real life context in our society - the old versus the young workers .
The society now has this notion that the old would eventually become obsolete , exhausted and unproductive .
However , the aged has come a long way before they hit the supposed end of their economic lifespan .
Without their contributions , the modern society might not even exist .
The state has a certain responsibility to provide for the old .
To simply cut back funds on the grounds that the elderly can no longer yield any economic profits is an irresponsible act .
The old are worthy of every resources spent on them as they are still important assets to the nation .
In Singapore , much emphasis has been placed on providing a holistic education .
Children are spoilt for choices when it comes to choosing their desired education route and with a fourth university in the planning , learning has never been easier .
Nevertheless , no matter how refined the education system is , it could never instil moral values in children which are critical in tackling the ageing problem .
The State only has a partial duty in alleviating the situation of the elderly; the rest would belong to their closest kin .
Changing norms and mindsets coupled with an increasingly high standard of living  , is driving children to abandon their parents .
With no one to rely on or any proper financial aid , the elderly would be unable to fend for themselves and perhaps left homeless .
This would result in a degrading of the society as the wandering aged would eventually resort to desperate measures such as begging , stealing and possibly dying on the streets .
For countries with a small population such as that of Singapore , there exists the need to recruit foreign talents to fuel the economy .
Reduced tax rates , solid infrastructure and business-tailored policies are some of strategies utilized by the local government .
However , this would not sustain the interest in foreigners if the country lacks an appealing living condition .
One way to retain these foreigners is to improve  the welfare system for the aged .
This is not a totally farfetched approach based on the previous case where Singapore established a comprehensive child care system that resulted in many expatriates moving their family over to work and dwell here .
We could similarly use an impeccable retirement scheme to entice them to settle down permanently .
By making Singapore a better place for old age , it could resolve the issue of a diminutive pool of human resources as well as boost the State's economy .
All in all , the elderly should not be viewed as incapable of providing any further services to the nation .
Rather than condemning their low productivity , we should incorporate the old into our community for they had garnered experiences which are of practical use to the young .
The state shares a part in supporting the elderly for these are the people who had  a hand in nation building and morphing the society which we live in now .
Spending on the old does not denote an economic dead end .
To the contrary , the old has the potential to open new doors and bring about more opportunities both within and into the country .
Taking care of the aged is now a global issue that no country can steer clear of .
Some people might think that we should take a pragmatic approach and ignore the needs of the elderly as they can no longer serve the society .
However , who can deny that our older generations have contributed immensely to our society ?
No one can also be sure that all the aged people can lead good lives without any federal help .
Therefore ,  whether it is due to moral obligation or for fulfilling one's responsibility , compromising public spending on other areas of the country's development for the aged is unavoidable .
It is true that by doing so , a country's development and productivity will suffer .
Nevertheless , I believe that as long as the government is able to obtain a balance in the areas of public spending , the country's development can still progress without limiting public spending on the aged .
It is only right for us to take care of the aged as they contributed a great deal to what we have now .
Without the hard work of the older generation , we would not have the fundamentals of our society .
We can only prosper with a strong foundation , which the elderly had given us .
As a result , when they become feeble and require assistance , we should lend them a helping hand .
Not to mention , it is also a moral value to take care of the elderly .
However , spending money on them could have disadvantaged other groups of needy people .
For instance , it could have deprived the children in low income families from education .
Therefore , there is a need to organize strong branches of organizations , like Community Development Councils (CDCs) , to decide who to help in extreme cases .
The government should also engage in long term solutions , like Research and Development , to save money .
This would ensure the welfare fund is being distributed evenly .
To add on , less spending on the aged could have caused social problems .
Cases of conflicts over money problems at home; elderly loitering in void decks and parks; lonely elderly found dead and only discovered after a few days  , are not unheard of .
Reducing funds on this growing age group could cause these problems as the attention paid towards them would then be cut .
Some mentioned that it should be the children's responsibility to take care of elderly and some of the problems are inevitable .
Nonetheless , government intervention can minimize the possibility of having these problems .
The Maintenance of Parents Act is one good example of government intervention where taking care of elderly is  .
Under CPF Hosing Grant , there is now an incentive to live near parents too .
Thus , there is more likelihood for the younger generation to take care of their parents .
If the government can put in enough funds for the elderly and handle the aging problem holistically , this would benefit the country in the long run .
Working class Singaporeans would be motivated to work hard as they know the government would contribute in taking care of them as they aged .
This could stimulate economic growth .
Foreign talents would also be attracted to migrate here when we establish a welfare state image .
There is a worry that the diversion of spending could also result in a country's slow growth and low productivity .
Nevertheless , countries with more limited expenditure do no better or worse economically than countries with high social expenditure .
Taking Denmark for example , it is a welfare state , but yet , it is one of the top countries in income ranking (OECD , full stop after in-text citation It is also important to implement measures that require people to rely on oneself rather than the government .
The aging process is not a pleasant process for humans to go through .
However , the Singapore government had come up with some policies to help make the aging process a more comfortable one .
This is especially important , considering that Singapore had got one of the fastest aging populations in Asia , according to reports by the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports (incorrect in-text citation) .
Some of the developments and policies are the construction of studio apartments specially for the elderly , the upgrading of the Housing Board (HDB) lifts which helps to improve the elders living area , increasing the retirement age to allow the elders to be more self-dependent and implementing more healthcare benefits and subsidies for the elder Singaporeans such as subsidies for community hospital stay .
All these developments and policies have contributed towards easing the aging process in Singapore .
One of the many important points to take note for an aging society is the fact that the elders' physical ability , such as walking and bathing , would tend to deteriorate over time .
Therefore attention needs to be paid , to ensure a safe environment for the elders to live in .
The Singapore government acknowledged this requirement by introducing the studio apartments and the HDB lift-upgrading projects .
In January 09 , HDB stated that they would be building more studio apartments for the elderly .
These studio apartments are equipped with elderly-friendly features such as non- slip toilet tiles , small grab poles , which are to upkeep delete this and replace with 'and' offered at an affordable price .
The upgrading of lifts in the older flatsdelete the highlighted and replace with 'where' the lifts stops at every floor of the HDB flats also helped to ensure barrier-free accessibility for the elders .
However , some problems cropped up for the lift-upgrading projects .
This was mainly . . . due to the fact that not every flat was suitable to undergo lift-upgrading project and money was needed from the elderly in order for the projects to take place .
To minimize these problems , subsidies were given out for the projects .
Overall , all these facilities would help to create a safer environment for the elders to live in .
In order to ease the aging process , the government introduced later retirement and incentives to companies that employed elderly .
These would decrease the elder dependency .
Elders who are working would be able to keep themselves updated with the current trends and developments through interaction with the younger generation .
The experience of the elders would also be passed on .
Longer working lives also meant that elders would continue to play an active role in contributing to the economy and society , thus making them have a sense of fulfilment .
Although increasing the retirement age would give rise to competition for the limited amount of jobs available and increase the unemployment rates , The positive impacts of raising the retirement age still outweigh its' negative impacts as nothing can replace the valuable experience that the elders would bring to the companies and the fact that they would also be able to earn more savings to look after themselves .
During the aging process , it is easier for the elders to fall sick as we can see from the statistics shown by the Hospital Admission Rates by Age and Sex in 2007 .
The government has thus planned healthcare subsidies and benefits for the elderly .
This is important as not every elderly is able to pay for the heavy medical bills .
These healthcare subsidies would help to offload a certain percentage of the community hospital's fees .
There is one problem with this policy in thats there are quite a few criteria that need to be fulfilled before an elderly could enjoy the healthcare subsidies and benefits .
However , these criteria were meant to sieve out the elders who truly needed help as compared to those who were actually able to afford their own medical bills .
The Singapore government has put in place many measures to help ease the aging process .
The construction of the studio apartment , lift-upgrading project , extension of the retirement age and the implementation of healthcare subsidies and medical benefits have all gone a long way to help ease the aging process .
All these developments and policies have helped to ensure that Singapore will be prepared in both the short run and long run against the problems of an aging population .
However as the aging population in Singapore becomes bigger in size , more research and development policies will need to be carried out to slow down the rapid growth of the aging population instead of easing the aging process .
One and a half decades ago , many countries had to support the aging population through ways like subsidies and public spending on health care services and facilities .
This has led to countries diverting some of the government revenues for the elderly .
As time passed , there is an increase in elderly in the society whereby 3 out of 10 people are elderly () .
The society finds it even more taxing to support the elderly in ways like subsidizing on healthcare or even facilities .
This leads to a continuous search for new research and developments/policies which can aid in today's aging population growth .
Emphasizing on the importance of filial obligation , encouraging greater productivity and improving in medical and science research are some of such examples .
Research generally targets the constellation of problems faced by the elderly , such as declining health - growing physically weak and feeble , emotional problems - living life in a shade of negativity , and social problems - feeling foreign and out of place in the society that they have once experienced .
However , the current research and development/policies unfortunately have provided more of a hindrance than an aid for the elderly .
Encouraging greater productivity among the non-elderly can increase the size of the economy and tax base .
This helps facilitate the public spending on the elderly .
For example ,  and attracting more foreign talents .
While these may seem to be plausible policies , they still cause the elderly to feel uneasy in the society .
Firstly , people would be pressured to accomplish more tasks in a given period which can lead to mental problems such as depression .
Elderly parents may end up looking after such working adults instead , imposing a heavier burden onto the elderly and government .
Furthermore , more elderly would be unemployed as they are unable to work as efficiently as the working-age adults which cause their social circle to shrink .
They will feel outcast by the society as they have the mentality that they are useless , and unable to contribute to the society .
There is an improvement delete highlighted and replace with 'in' medical and science research to cure illnesses which are usually associated with old age such as research on heart diseases and the invention of  artificial pancreas to replace any which fails with age .
However , these breakthroughs hardly ease the lives of the elderly .
Firstly , many low and middle income group elderly are unable to enjoy such medicines and healthcare treatments because such treatments tend to be long term care which can be very expensive for them to afford .
In addition , operations/ drugs have side effects which the elderly might not be able to recover from due to their failing health .
As a result , they might end up having more illnesses that can cause health to deteriorate .
Medical cost will be much higher than before .
Policies aimed at improving the employability of older workers may prove to be ineffective , thus creating economical problems apart from the existing social issues .
Retirement age of all Singaporeans was raised from 55 to 62 with effect from 1 January 1999 , as announced by the Ministry of Manpower .
Employers are also allowed to reduce the wages of employees beyond the age of 60 by up to ten percent .
Furthermore , the Central Provident Fund contribution by employers decreases with the age of the workers .
Some would argue that this policy would help older workers retain their job and get employment as the cost to employers is lowered .
However , employers may still not be willing to accept older workers due to their lower productivity .
As workers grow older , their health deteriorates and becomes less agile and thus less productive .
In the event where a company needs to lay off several staff , the older workers would usually be the ones retrenched as they would most likely draw the highest salaries .
Therefore , unemployment amongst elderly would be a common sight , increasing the number of financially dependent elderly .
The Government would have to tap into its budget to support the needy aged , resulting in a heavy burden on the working class .
Thus , these policies are ineffective without first changing the mindset of employers 
Another step taken by the government to help the aged is the provision of incentives for their children to live near them with the Housing Development Board (HDB) policy .
Children are given privileges when applying for a flat near their aged parents such as subsidized rates and priority during purchase .
Yet , along with the well intentions of the government's policy , negative effects may follow and the success of this policy will largely depend on the child's  filial piety  The lower cost of flats no doubt brings about advantages , especially making it more affordable for those from the lower income group .
With the close proximity , the physical needs of the elderly will be better provided for by their children .
The mental needs of the elderly can also be satisfied with the companionship from their family living just a few blocks of flats away .
Savings from the purchase of housing may also be used to supplement the financial needs of the elderly .
However , the policy is not perfect and the privileges enjoyed may also be abused by individuals .
For instance , elderly may be exploited by their children where the homes of these elderly are turned into  dumping grounds for kids .
These highly active grandchildren may become a burden on the aged physically .
Hence , it is dependent on the individuals' filial piety values that determine the success of the HDB policy .
Evidently , the policies aimed at easing the aging process of a country have various aspects to be fulfilled in order for it to be effective .
Governments have to look into the economical and societal impacts an aging population brings along .
Apart from that , they have to satisfy the three different needs; i .e .
the financial , social and emotional needs of the elderly .
If any one of these aspects is compromised , Singapore would risk losing her foothold in this competitive world .
With an expanding aging population , Singapore is faced with a situation where more resources need to be allocated for the well-being of the elderly .
This places an increased strain on the budget .
The issues concerning an aging population are far-reaching and there will be detrimental effects if these issues are simply ignored .
How much should a government spend on the elderly then ?
In the process of taking care of the aged , Singapore will have fewer funds to invest in the other areas that are pivotal to the country's development .
However , deciding on how much the government should contribute is a feat as a society has many needs .
It is the role of the government  to weigh which issues should be focused on in the short and long term .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited as the aging population is not one to be looked down upon , however , the other areas of development should not be neglected .
Scholars argue that it is more worthwhile to spend on other areas of development in a country such as defense , education , tourism and technology .
In Singapore , as well , emphasis is placed on these other areas .
For instance , in a recent Business Times article , it was mentioned that "government spending on Infocomm technology is set to rise 8%"delete full stop .
(2009 , February 19delete close bracket The Business insert clasoe bracket after Times .
Such development is indispensable for a country to survive in a rapidly advancing world .
If the government has to spend on the aged , fewer funds will be channeled into these areas , which is a cause for concern .
It may be a better decision to spend on the young as there are higher odds of return in this investment .
The young are more productive and equipped with updated skills .
The elderly are deemed to be less valuable to the society as they are weak and dependent on others .
An ageing population may cause a low productivity rate as seen by the Annual Growth in Labour Productivity figure; currently at: -7 .8% .
(2008 , {www .singstat .gov .sg}[HYPERLINK: http://www .singstat .gov .sg])
However , a purely pragmatic approach may not always be the best way to tackle the problem .
Singapore can tap on the aging population to assist in the growth of the country .
"Singapore , with its well-established reputation for clinical and medical excellence , is poised to tap on Asia's growing and aging population and entrench itself as a premier regional healthcare hub" inocrrect in text citation .
Although it may be costly to provide healthcare , pensions and other welfare programs , the country's social and economic aspects will deteriorate if an aging population is unattended to .
A country with sick elderly people will hinder the growth of investments as it shows a lack of planning on the government's part .
Singapore has realized this , hence , the efforts to cater to the aging population .
The government has assured that it would "pour in more resources into healthcare" incorrect intext citation The Healthcare system has be restructured to cater to the ageing population .
An aging population may prove costly to the society and economy if the country fails to prepare for the situation .
Public spending on the aged is therefore deemed necessary to avoid such a crisis .
Despite the drawbacks , an aging population is linked closely to the development of Singapore .
The issue is also set to worsen in the future considering the low birth rate .
Nevertheless with proper planning , Singapore is currently handling the situation very well without compromising on the other areas of development .
Furthermore , with an increasing emphasis on filial piety , the government is able to ensure that the aged are taken care of even as they concentrate on defence , education , tourism and even the needy who require aid and are all in all vital to the growth of Singapore as a nation .
Thomas Love Peacock (1786-1866) once said , "The waste of plenty is the resource of scarcity" .
This quotation implies to everyone , including the government to make a wise decision when allocating limited resources in order to reduce further , unnecessary wastage .
There is much concern about the government's decision to allot a huge sum of the national budget on the elderly as it is uncertain on whether the investment on the aged will attribute or be to the country's development .
The best alternative is therefore to make a more sizeable investment by limiting the spending on the aged and divert the budget to other areas of the country's development .
The present paradigm of care for the elderly is a partnership between the government , community and family .
However , children often forgo their responsibilities to care for their parents and often point the thrust to the government because they believe their parents had gotten everything from the government .
Besides , children tend to abuse their parents' privileges allotted by the government by maximizing the usage of those privileges even though it is unnecessary .
For an example , elderly with little ailment often seek the best treatment as they are provided with either free or subsidized treatments .
Thus , those with chronic ailments are unable to seek the proper treatment they are supposed to get .
If the public spending is limited , children will have to send their parents for the appropriate level of  treatment and this will reduce wastage and increase efficiency in quality of care at the same time .
Thus , judging from the explanation , it is convincing to limit the public spending on the elderly .
Government should divert the budget initially allocated for elderly to the Research and Development (R&D) sector instead .
Investment especially in enhancing the medical research will make everyone better off and also indirectly help the elderly in a way .
Since elderly are prone to chronic ailments such as renal disease or heart failure , medical research will be able to produce new drugs and more flexible treatments for them .
This will eventually increase the life span not only for the elderly , but also for the other generations .
Besides , investment in R&D will be able to develop new technologies and new sectors will be introduced to collaborate with the usage of the technologies .
More job opportunities will be provided and everyone will be able to live a higher standard of living .
Thus , diverting the budget from the elderly to R&D will provide mutual advantage for both the elderly and  economic development .
The Government should invest more in the current education of the youth instead of investing the budget in the elderly .
This is mainly because youth are more progressive towards economic development in comparison to the elderly .
Thus , the opportunity cost to invest in the education is lower than to invest on the elderly .
Besides , moral value especially to make the children beholden to their parents can be inculcated by introducing the appropriate modules in their education .
This will help the elderly indirectly as the children are trained to embrace the Eastern value to respect and take care of their parents .
Investment in education will also lead to development in the country as education serves as a platform for further development in all other sectors such as R&D and Health .
Thus , such investment will definitely pay off in the future economic growth .
In view of providing mutual advantage to both elderly and economic development , it is best for the government to revise  its budget allocation so that the right proportion of budget is divided wisely among the ministries in the country .
Elderly should not be granted a lump sum but instead the fund should be diverted to other areas which will lead to future economic growth .
This is because administrating the budget to the elderly is only a one-way benefit but if the budget is allocated to other areas such as Education and R&D , everyone including the elderly can enjoy the advantage .
What is therefore needed is both a wise policy planning and a closer look at how the allocation will influence our future and society as a whole .
Statistics have shown that by 2030 , 20% of the population will be aged 65 and above (AoA 2009) .
This has raised concerns about the issue of our ageing population and how we could allocate our limited resources efficiently .
During the recent years , the increasing competition between the old and other groups in  society for scarce resources has been on the political agenda of many countries  .
How much public spending should the aged receive is a widely debatable topic .
Public spending should be channeled into developing infrastructure that caters to the needs of the aged , subsidies to lighten the financial burden of the medical bills of the aged and also activities to help bridge the elderly and society .
Ideally , there should be no restrictions to how much resource is diverted to the elderly .
However , due to practical reasons , spending needs to be limited .
The changing demography of the population has led to many concerns regarding the large health expenses on the aged .
We tend to need more health care as we age , in addition to this , medical advancement has led to  rising health care cost , these have led to an increased pressure on the nation's budget .
The government cannot afford to bear the huge cost of public spending on the aged , as it would drain  government resources .
If we fail to limit  public spending on the aged , the pressure is likely to have an effect on public spending for other priorities , and also affect economic growth .
In conclusion , public spendings on the elderly should be limited due to the social problems which may arise from the lack of limited resources , the huge cost of the these public spending and the sustainability of the spendings .
We should not shortchange other groups of society and other developments of the nation , for the needs of the elderly .
Nonetheless , we must not fail to help the aged , but we could prioritize the expenditure such that other developments are not shortchanged in this process .
The community should do its part to help the elderly as well , after all the well being of the aged is our responsibility .
Charities such as the Community Chest can help to reach out to the elderly and hence lightening the financial load of the aged .
Individuals should fulfill their filial obligations and take care of their elderly parents or relatives .
Most countries , by now , should be aware about the rise  in the an ageing population and also the heavy expenditure it brings about .
Must a country totally channel its expenditure on this population and forget about the future savings for its younger generation ?
"Public  policies that encourage and facilitate education , basic research , and the application of promising technologies can enhance the well-being of current and future generation of older people"(Robert .B .Friedland and Laura Summer .2005) .
As a result , the writers are trying to show that public spending on the aged should be reduced .
Indeed , some countries , despite facing ageing population , do not make expenditure on the elderly as their first priority , for example Singapore .
Nevertheless , with the good economic growth it is facing , the issue on the aged is taken care of well .
This essay aims to discuss that channeling public expenditure on other factors of development of a country will not only boost the economy but indirectly benefit the elderly too .
Increasing public spending on the education sector will generate significant external benefits for society , especially the aged .
A person who has received an education not only benefits from having more knowledge and skills but has higher productivity and is able to command a relatively higher wage for his contribution in the economy .
As such ,  investing in a good education ,  will benefit a country in the long run .
For example , The Singapore government realized that quality of education was the key to creating a pool of Singaporeans who were well qualified and highly productive and as a result , it has lead to an economic boost .
As such , the government has placed great emphasis on developing our education sector to ensure that the country maintains its global and regional competitiveness .
Also , incentives should be provided to students who wish to proceed to a higher education level , specifically the tertiary level .
One of the reasons mentioned is "typical college graduates earn 73 percent more than a typical high school graduate , and those with advanced degrees earn two to three times as much as a high school graduate" (Baum and Payae , 2005 , p . 9) .
By earning greater wages , they would be able to prepare themselves for their 'golden age' .
However , it has remained a reality that by forcing people to increase their productivity  by having more knowledge and skills is indeed stressful for them .
Also , a boost in the economy , might lead to higher standard of living .
People today are becoming work-oriented and adding to the notion of higher standard of living , they tend to be "afraid" of getting married as they do not want to burden themselves with the expenditures they have to face when having a family .
As a result , it may lead to an increase in the aging population due to a low birthrate .
For example , in Germany , the birthrate has proved a decreasing trend from year 2000 to 2007 .
Still , in order to counter such concerns , the government has provided various incentives like the baby bonus scheme introduced in Singapore which is to promote marriage and also to provide incentives to boost the birthrate .
Also , Peterson (2001) has mentioned that raising more productive children , through good education , the cost burden is spread over a larger and more affluent future generation .
Thus , public spending on the education sector will indirectly benefit the elderly .
Next , public spending on the economic sectorand international trade , will make a country more affluent , hence benefiting the society especially the aged .
Due to globalization , most countries are now involved in international trade .
Free trade allows a wider range of goods and services and most importantly it is cost saving .
This would therefore , enhance the exports of a country .
Also , by having international trade it forces firms in a country to be more competitive (increase competition among firms) .
This leads to greater improvement in technology as firms would invest in the Research and Development (R&D) .
With trade , it forces a country to be a niche in a certain area , for example , The Singapore economy is a knowledge based one . .
Thus , it has a large pool of highly skilled and educated workforce .
As a result , Singapore has strong tripartite ties between research institutes , industry and universities facilitating a fluid exchange of ideas and competencies that assist the fast adoption of innovative creations .
Since Singapore is also technologically inclined , R&D commitments have been on the rise for the past few years .
Thus , adding to the country's GDP .
However , international trade causes countries to be interdependent .
This results in a 'domino effect' if one needs of the countries involved in  trade faces an economic downturn .
An example would be the current economic downturn faced by The United States .
The USA is one of the prominent countries involved in  international trade and as a result of its economic downturn it adversely affected countries like Singapore who practice an open economy .
Despite this , Singapore was not really badly overthrown by USA's economic deficit due to the government's strong policies in handling such a situation .
Indeed , Singapore's niche in R&D has resulted in the advancement in the healthcare sectorproviding better healthcare facilities .
Since the aged are usually the ones in need of healthcare facilities , they greatly benefit from it .
Hence , public expenditure to boost international trade has resulted in the investment of R&D which significantly benefitted the aged in terms of better healthcare services .
Lastly , public spending should be a channel to providing better infrastructure .
The government's objective is to provide a comfortable living condition for its citizen .
In Singapore , the creation of The Circle Line that would be fully operational by 2011 , has increased the accessibility of places in the country .
As a result , people can easily get to their specific destination in a short period of time .
However , with the increasing affluence and standard of living , the people are now able to purchase cars and thus , getting around would not be so much of a hassle .
Still , increasing car ownership in Singapore leads to congestion on the road during peak hours .
Also , with the wide income gap in Singapore , not everyone; lower income earners , could purchase a vehicle .
As a result , some might still choose public transportation over private transport .
Better infrastructure has also made the government improve its transportation system .
Therefore , most public transport these days is designed to benefit those with special needs and the elderly .
Also , with better infrastructure  , more investors are inclined to invest in the country resulting in a boost to the economy .
Hence , not only expenditure on the development of infrastructure indirectly improves  public transport but also boosts a country's economic development .
Therefore , indirectly , the elderly are able to benefit from it .
Clearly , by shifting public expenditures to other development of the country ,  not only boosts a country's development and makes living more comfortable within the country , it also indirectly benefits the elderly too .
Also , public spending in such areas provides long term objectives and goals .
Therefore , it is like killing two birds with one stone .
Aging populations are compelling governments to create or revise policies and development that may affect the life of its citizens At the same time , this sustainable shift in aging population poses challenges to policy makers .
Policy makers are faced with the challenges such as how changes in the ratio of working-age citizens to retirees affect the ability of the public to fund for the aged ?
In what ways can the health system adapt to the needs of the aged who have a higher probability of having chronic diseases ?
Lastly will the implementation of policies result in increase or decrease in public saving and investments ?
I do agree that the above challenges prove that the country is doing research and working on policies that can help to ease the aging process .
No doubt , countries  are working on policies that can help to ease the aging process .
However , for policy makers their main objective is to think of policies and developments which can help the country in expansion or to ensure that it will not hinder economic growth .
In order for a country's expansion , policy makers are working on developments that can provide a valuable "public product" such as education and infrastructure .
The development of the education sector will enable  further generations to be more educated and to possess a higher level of skills .
Next , development on the infrastructure will attract more foreign investors to set up companies in the country .
With development in both education and infrastructure , foreign investors will choose to set up their companies in a country with a pool of talents and with great infrastructure with this it can boost  the country's economy .
Nevertheless working policies and development to assist the aged can help with the The Country's expansion .
This can be achieve by  placing emphasis  in increasing and raising more productive children in  futurer generations as  "by raising more productive children so that the cost burden is spread over a larger and more affluent future generation" (Paterson , 2001) .
Raising and increasing productive children not only can , attract foreign investors to invest in a country with pool of talents and the burden of looking after the aged population is being spread out with prosperous further generations .
As such , a win- win situation can be achieved as we not only ease the aged population but also assist in country expansion .
Next , advancement in technological tools is required to ensure the sustainability of the health care system .
These technological tools are developed to make life of the aged easier , less stressful and even healthier for them to continue living independently .
For example , monitoring systems are currently researched to allow the aged to remain in their homes longer even if they are being treated with chronic diseases , rather than moving them into a nursing home which may incur more costs .
Lastly , research in life science areas has shown ways  prolonging human life and to prevent illness .
A recent research shows that lighter meals may prolong human life by having calories-restricted diets .
Calorie restricted diets can induce a slowdown of the aging process and  increases survival , resistance to diseases , prevents brain deterioration and lastly reduces muscle loss .
additional research states , that oxidative stress may not help prolong life as oxidative stress has links with aging , cancer and other disease .
Researchers have suggests minimum exposure to oxidative conditions actually offer protection from acute doses .
With  research and advancement in life sciences to prolong human life and prevention of illness can help to reduce the fiscal costs on heath care .
In conclusion , research , development and policies that help to ease the aging process is relatively important .
For instance , increasing and raising productive children not only can reduce the t burden  but also  attract foreign investors to invest in the country with a pool of talent .
Secondly , technology advancement will enable the aged to live independently even if they suffer with chronic diseases and their children can spend more time to focus on their work .
Lastly , research in life sciences to prolong life can help to reduce the fiscal costs on heath care and prevent illness .
Therefore , we must pay attention  on current research , development and policies to ease the aging process .
Governments usually face problems caused by an aging population .
Problems such as a shrinking workforce and an increased need in healthcare support have exerted pressure on government spending .
As the national budget is limited , decisions on the allocation of resources have to be made regularly to create a better livelihood for its people which include the young , the working adults and the aged .
Despite the important role played by a government in ensuring the well being of the aged , there should be a balance in maintaining its social presence to prevent the elderly from over relying upon them .
Moreover , in an Asian society like Singapore , it is also the moral obligation of children to perform filial piety towards their parents financially and emotionally .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Some people argue that welfare of the aged is the full responsibility of the government as they have contributed to the society for many years and it is a way of showing appreciation to them .
This can be achieved by providing the aged full medical support and adequate living allowances .
However , the limitless spending on them will hurt the country's development in areas which are of importance such as education , employment and communication infrastructures .
Moreover , if the government decides to retain its limit of spending on the aged , higher tax burden will eventually be imposed to increase revenue to fund these interventions .
Firstly , education sets the foundation for a country to progress economically as well as socially .
The government should increase expenditure in this area to maximize the potential of each individual  .
Free education can be implemented till they start working .
This will allow the population to contribute productively to the economy in future .
In addition , retirement programs should be emphasized and introduced to the people in their early working days .
Creating such awareness is crucial during this period as it prepares them mentally and financially to the challenges of aging .
Learning is also a lifelong process .
Peterson (2001) said that elder dependency could be reduced through longer working lives which require them to retrain and learn new skills .
In other words , Governments that spend  more on this area will not only find it beneficial to those who are presently  young but also for the future elderly  population .
However , it is futile to have a skilled and knowledgeable workforce without sufficient job opportunities and career advancements .
As a country develops into a knowledge based society , there will be a shift in the employment situation .
More people are less willing to provide labor work in manufacturing sectors with low career advancements .
As a result , job dissatisfaction of the people will lead to a rise in  unemployment .
Thus , creating the desired job opportunities often lies in the role  Governments play to rectify the deficit .
With the excess money diverted from spending on the aged , the government can promote foreign investments through incentives and tax reliefs to create employment for their people .
Alternatively , it can fund small-medium enterprises which encourage entrepreneurship as well as career advancements .
As the world becomes globalized the need to stay connected and informed with one another is necessary for a country to develop economically .
For example , in order to enable efficient trade globally , telecommunication networks have to be maintained and improved to reach out to other parts of the world .
Hence , government spending on infrastructure is important to boost the economy .
A decrease in the spending to fulfill the constant needs of an aging population will not be worthwhile t . Clearly , the trade off for limiting public spending on the aged is rewarding .
Education marks the beginning of the human capital investment which will benefit the country's economy in the long run .
At the same time , unemployment issues can be reduced by creating more relevant job opportunities through foreign investments and entrepreneurship .
In addition , communication infrastructure bridges the link between a country and the world to ensure trade efficiency .
Therefore , it is critical to spend more in these areas to develop the country's economy rather to adhere to the needs of the aging population and bear full financial support .
The dawn of the twenty-first century has not slowed down the technological progress that man has been pursuing for so many decades .
New products and innovations are produced by the day .
These advances in technology have , most importantly , eased the lives of our aged citizens .
With the world consisting of an ever expanding aged population , there has been a greater necessity for simple household appliances that can be used by the aged and the disabled .
In addition , social policies are constantly evolving and changing , with some newly implemented policies greatly easing the aging process of the elderly .
Researches in economics have also resulted in new policies , as will be discussed below .
The policy that resulted from economical research stated that the size of today's economy and tax base could be increased by encouraging the inflow of employable immigrants .
This fact is proving to be false .
For it must be kept in mind that these immigrants will also grow old and require pensions some day .
Furthermore , evidence shows that there is no relationship between immigration and economic growth whatsoever .
This , therefore , does not solve the problem of the present , but worsens future prospects too .
On another note , some social policies may not be beneficial in the long term .
For instance , the policy that advocates late retirement means that the working period of citizens is extended beyond the usual age of 55 and 60 .
Although it aims for the greater good , by providing the elderly with greater self sufficiency , it is more harmful in the long term because the most critical issue here is the health of the elderly  .
They are often unable to withstand high stress of the mind and the body that these work require and fall ill frequently .
The policy of passing laws that make it a must for children to look after their elderly parents is also much speculated over .
I feel that this is not the correct approach to the problem .
Taking care of one's parents is not a straightforward transaction , like paying one's taxes .
Instead it is one which also involves time and constant emotional attention .
This does not ease the problems of the aged or their children who are coping with the rising prices of goods and services and  who must care for their children  .
Hence , the banes of today's new policies .
However , it is unquestionable that technology has contributed on a massive scale in helping the aged .
The SANYO technical review reveals the existence of "systems that remind the elderly person to take their medicine; systems that detect when he/she is in the room , so that electricity costs can be minimised .
There are systems that will assist you in various day to day activities without the presence of another person including washing oneself , dressing up and using theoilet .
Another invention is a telephone that utilises voice speed control technology .
This technology allows the aged person to slow down the speed at which the person on the other side is speaking ."
This is especially useful for the older citizens , for one's senses become less acute with age , and they cannot comprehend what others are saying , at the rate at which they are speaking .
"The medical alert system is another good example .
This system is set up in the aged person's house and consists of a speaker that is able to know where you are in the house , and guides you simply by tracking the signals emanated by the wristlet you wear on your hand ."
In addition , it alerts the health authorities and your closest relatives in the occasion of an emergency .
It is particularly useful for those who are old and who live alone .
The possibilities of technology are endless .
In addition , I am an advocate of the social policy that deems it necessary for all citizens to put aside a small percentage of their monthly salary , during the working period of their lives .
For this seems to be a rather effective policy , with the value-added element of being able to lighten the economic burden supported by the government  .
It consequently does ease the aging process , for the elderly  need not be at the mercy of others to obtain full medical care and other comforts .
Another policy suggests that money be invested in the educational system , so that more productive children are raised , "resulting in a larger and more affluent future generation" (Peter Peterson , 2001) .
I feel that this is the key solution to easing the aging process , for a more productive younger generation means that all costs required to keep the aged healthy and comfortable can be borne by this efficient younger workforce .
Hence , the progress of the world in aspects of technology , economy and social policies have by far proven to be beneficial to the elderly  of today's society .
It has made their life after retirement one of relaxation , with comforts close at hand ,  .
It has made them more independent from others , and ceased to be seen as a burden in the eyes of their children and society .
Progress will always have its hindrances and flaws , but progress is always the correct path to success .

The trend of an ageing population is here to stay .
At present 7% of Singapore's population is over the age of 65; however , by 2030 this will increase to 19% (Inter-Ministerial Committee on Aging Report 1999) .This is especially so for developed countries where people are living longer and are less willing to give birth due to the high costs of living .
Therefore , as much as other problems , mainly those dealing with the economy , may seem to demand and need more immediate attention , the ageing population issue cannot be ignored and the spending on this area should not be reduced in order for a a majority of the population to benefit .
Some people may argue that elderly dependency should be reduced through various means  (Peterson , 2001) to make way for other developments in other areas , especially the economic sector .
In lieu with the current economic crisis , many have found themselves unemployed or retrenched and are finding it difficult to survive , particularly those who live on credit or have a household to provide for .
Even with various upgrading schemes such as the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) , it is still difficult for the economy to regain its vigour to the state before the economic crisis .
This is due to the lack of job opportunities and not because of the lack of proper skills among workers .
Therefore , more budget should be channeled to the economic sector to boost the country's economic situation .
Indeed , the above issue warrants a substantial amount of concern .
However , this does not affect majority of the population .
In addition , the people who belong to the working class are not the ones who are most vulnerable to the economic crisis .
The elderly are the more vulnerable group in this situation due to the fact that they are not capable of generating income to provide for themselves .
This is attributed to the fact that employers are constantly seeking people with higher productivity .
Besides , stressing on filial piety at this point in time is not going to be of any help since the working adults would probably be busy fending for themselves .
Hence , the government should not reduce public spending in this area to protect the vulnerability of the aged in terms of health care cost and enabling them to be self-sufficient through elder-friendly facilities in the housing districts .
Furthermore , there is also a need to continue to provide such support to the elderly for the government to retain support and instill a sense of belonging amongst the citizens to  prevent people from migrating .
There is an increasing trend of young people migrating to countries such as Australia and Canada due to lower stress levels and also the welfare benefits available for the aged .
At this rate , the country is going to lose a large pool of talented people since those who migrate overseas are usually more affluent and better educated .
As much as the policies being implemented currently are able to attract foreign talent to become citizens of Singapore , native Singaporeans still seem to be unsatisfied .
The current net migration rate stands at 5 .82 migrant(s)/1 ,000 population ) .
This means that there are more people entering than leaving the country .
Even so , this figure is attributed by the influx of foreign talent .
This implies that more and more Singaporeans are moving out of the country than before .
Thus , in order to keep her citizens in the country , welfare benefits have to be maintained or even increased such that people do not turn to foreign lands to enjoy their retirement .
In a nutshell , government  spending on elderly should not be reduced as it would potentially be unfavourable especially since the current aging trend involves the "baby boomers" , a substantial amount of people .
In fact , there should be an increase in such spending as the aging trend is set to increase in the future .
This is a crucial issue and not one that can be ignored .
To add on , the government has not been neglecting other sectors but instead , it is trying its best to make economic conditions more favourable for the country to prosper .
Hence , public spending for the elderly should not be reduced .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited although the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Tremendous demographic changes in aging will create many unprecedented problems .
An ageing population does not cause problems only in wealthy and developed countries such as the USA Japan and Singapore , but it is also faced by developing countries such as China and Thailand as well .
Therefore , solutions that will help to ease the aging process are much needed .
If the public spending on the solutions are limited , thus effects of these solutions will not be able to meet our expectations .
First of all , we must understand that a country is built by its people's hard work and effort .
The significant contributions of the aged towards a country's infrastructure , economics , and many other things should not be forgotten .
The younger generation should be grateful to their senior citizen's contribution because the prosperity of today's country is built by the older generation when they are young .
Although now the people who strive for our country are aging and could hardly contribute to the country , still , we should always remember their contributions and take good care of them when they need help .
Senior citizens should be regarded as an asset rather than a liability to a country .
Frequently , we will need to heed advice from them because they have more experience than us .
For example , Mr Lee Kuan Yew , the Minister Mentor of Singapore , who always gives advice to The Singaporean Government .
Hence , the welfare of the aged must be assured .
Public spending on the aged such as health care should not be limited .
In fact , the aged are more vulnerable to fall sick than young people as their immune systems are degenerating .
Peterson (2001) has mentioned that healthcare  once meant an occasional visit to the doctor , but it has today become a lifelong process .
Furthermore , their declining productivity has also lessened their income .
So governments should aid them .
For instance , The Government can subsidize their medical expense so that the aged can have lower rates on health care spending .
This will definitely benefit the aged because with the current increasing health care cost , the medical bills are always shocking .
As a result , the aged with low income are usually reluctant to see a doctor when they are not feeling well .
As a consequence , an illness may not be discovered at an early stage and will only be discovered when it becomes severe .
However , if the illness has became too severe , it might be life threatening and it will be much more expensive to cure it .
Next , public spending on pension should not be decreased .
As we all know , the senior citizen is one of the groups with the lowestt income .
More than that , some senior citizens are retired or unable to work .
Even if they work , their meager income is insufficient to support themselves , especially with the high inflation rates now .
It follows that we often hear that the aged are living in poverty .
Therefore , if they are in need of help , why not just help them ?
After all , they are the ones who brought our country to prosperity .
It is perfectly right that we ought to ensure their living quality in return .
On the contrary , the increase in public spending on the aged by the government will increase the fiscal budget .
This will inevitably increase the government's load .
Therefore , the spending in other essential areas such as infrastructure , financial , and education will have to be cut down .
The cut down of spending in these essential areas might hinder the growth of a country .
Considering these important factors , many people will eventually support that public spending on the aged should be limited .
However , in my opinion , every choice we make will incur some cost , which means something has to be given up in order to attain the objective we want .
So , I think with proper planning on the spending by the government , we should be able to meet the balance between public spending on the aged and other essential spending .
The country's budget is generated through taxpayers' contributions and returns on investments made .
At present , a substantial amount is spent on the elderly every year through direct and indirect ways , such as giving out subsidies or building elderly-friendly infrastructure .
This compromises spending that could be used  , namely on education , health care and creating economic growth .
Public spending on the aged , should thus be limited in a country , for the money can be used to further enhance societal growth as a whole , and not just focus solely on this particular age group .
Children are the future and the hope of our society , for they provide us with the enthusiasm and vigor towards new technological breakthroughs and societal betterment .
Through education , children open their eyes to more opportunities and logical reasoning .
Solutions ranging from micro everyday problems like constructing better roads to ease traffic to major predicaments like global warming and environment conservation can emerge with greater education for the future generations .
Providing subsidies for education  and scholarships encourage students to excel in their academic work .
Better understanding of the world and how it functions make the average citizen able to appreciate and take care of his environment more .
This , as a result , allows for easier implementation of policies which advocate the environment and society's welfare .
The country can stand to benefit , not only through better leadership , but responsible citizens in the society as well .
Health care should be one of the government's top priority as well .
As people get wealthier , their waistlines get bigger as well .
Obesity , high cholesterol levels and diabetes are diseases that increased in the last century due to greater wealth and easier access to unhealthy diets and lifestyles .
These health problems will inevitably affect the productivity of these workers , and the time and resources spent to remedy them are costly , both to the individual and the country .
Thus , it is more cost-effective and sensible that we should divert our budget towards prevention and treatment of patients .
Money can be spent on educational messages and guidelines on prevention of contracting diseases , coupled with subsidies for health care providers and medication .
Certainly , such spending will benefit the elderly , but it should not be exclusive to them , for there are other age groups who require assistance in this sector as well .
Economic growth is crucial to any country .
It ensures the majority of the population finds employment and inflation stays under control .
A country with a flourishing economy finds investors more willing to invest there and the people stand to enjoy the range and variety of material comforts that a thriving market economy is able to provide .
The government can attract foreign investment ventures and increase the competitive edge of firms by reducing tax and rent abatement .
The government can also create a more competitive labour force without compromising their wage level .
This can be done through upgrading the skills of our workforce .
For instance , the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) programme introduced in Singapore enhances its workforce's abilities to compete in the global market , Another option is to allocate part of the budget to Research and Development for local institutes to attract and develop the best talents .
This can be exemplified by the efforts the Singapore government had been making to finance the Agency for Science , Technology and Research (A*STAR) .
All these evidence show how money can be effectively diverted towards generating greater economic growth .
Proponents of substantial public spending on the aging population issue will argue that the problem will escalate due to a declining birth rate , resulting in a proportionately larger population of elderly in the world .
Thus , we should solve the problem we are facing now , rather than allocate resources to other areas .
However , is it not short-sighted if we are to solve only the problems we can see now , rather than investing in and conceiving possibilities to solve the problem fully ?
We definitely have to allocate resources towards this growing issue of a greying population , but we should limit the spending to only what is sufficiently necessary , and not to the extent that it restricts the society with a large financial burden .
Instead , we should allocate use of the resources towards betterment of the society , bringing up ideas and opportunities that can possibly solve this problem eventually .
Recent studies have  shown that Singapore is becoming one of the fastest aging populations in the world (Bryan , 2008) .
The elderly people are already amounting to a quarter of the population in Singapore .
Therefore , the rapidly aging population is a problem that the government needs to address .
There is a concern regarding the rising health and living costs which will become a risk to economic growth and social security .
What is then needed is that the public expenditure towards the needs of the aging population should be carefully looked into instead of diverting it to the country's development .
Firstly , slow population growth results in an increased  burden for children in having  to take care of their parents (Peterson , 2001) .
For example , when  families have an average of one child instead of two or three children , the single  child will have the task of taking care of his or her family in the future .
Elderly people always tend to depend a lot on their children and it results in a strain in family relationship .
The rising health care costs make it even tough for the child to cope with it and some are not willing to support their parents .
The elderly people will then need to support themselves which is impossible without the government's help .
Secondly , there is a scheme called the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , which is to make Singaporeans start saving when they are young , but it is not enough for them to survive with having CPF alone .
Although the government enforces individual saving through CPF , not every person will benefit from it .
Self-employed people do not have CPF as they are not working under an employer , so the employees and employers do not contribute part of the employees' salary to the CPF .
Many elderly people do not have much CPF left as they have used it to pay for their house or child's education .
This causes them to not have much savings when they grow old .
Thirdly , the aged have been  important to the society and country .
Without them , the country and people will not be so prosperous and developed as they are now .
They still contribute to the society by looking after their grandchildren while the parents are at work and our Minister Mentor , Mr Lee Kuan Yew , is one example of a person who contributes very much to the country's polities although he is over eighty years old .
They are still very  important and the government must help take care of them in a way and not to overlook them .
Lastly , the elderly tend to have different needs and behaviours to that of younger people .
Older people tend to work and save less and also require more health care .
In many countries , they depend on retirement pension to live through their remaining years .
Therefore , it is difficult to cut down on health or retirement benefits , as the aging population is becoming so serious .
Those people aged 70 and above have even weaker health than people aged 50 to 70 .
They need money to support their increased health care costs because they have already used up their savings .
As a result , they will place further demand on government funds .
At this point , one may wonder if the aging population is the most important issue to take note of .
However , the Country's development is also a matter that Singapore needs to be concerned about .
The country's trade , finance , transport , sports and education are key factors to drive a country's economy which cannot be neglected .
Having to maintain good trade relationships with  other countries such as having free tax and levy on imports and exports will help to grow the economy and benefit the people of Singapore .
Spending on education will help to nurture the people to have a good education from young and make Singapore a good place to seek education .
Development in sports such as hosting the Youth Olympic Games will be a great boost to the tourism sector as the Games is expected to generate a minimum of more than 150 ,000 visitors per night for Singapore (Patwant Singh , 2008) .
All of this will boost the county's economy .
Singapore is transforming into an aging society .
The challenge is to encourage healthy and productive life for the the ageing population and find ways for them to contribute more to the society so that they can play a valuable role in the country .
The government should not use aging population as a reason to limit public spending as they always encourage productive and healthy living for the elderly people .
They are still very important to the country and the government must play a part to take care of them .
Demography is shifting today .
People are having fewer children and living longer .
By 2050 , our median age would increase from 36 years to 56 .
Singapore would be among the demographically oldest countries in the world and there will be fewer working adults looking after more aged dependents .
The issue of an ageing population should be taken seriously , and more has to be put in place in addressing the issue .
As such , judging from Singapore's current demography , the an aging population will be a long term situation .
Despite the government's constant effort in introducing and crafting attractive policies and benefits to her people , the bid to boost child bearing still remains bleak .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as Education and Architecture , so as to focus on the long term situation .
First of all , money can be diverted to Singapore's education system so as to increase the productivity of the younger generation to acquire sufficient wealth for the future f (Peterson , 2001) .
It is essential to build on the development of the country's future - the younger generation - since the aged rely on the young and the young rely on the younger when old .
Clearly , a cycle is formed .
Raising the productivity of children via education can take place in the form of meeting the different needs and learning capabilities of them .
This includes reducing the ratio of the number of students to a single teacher , allowing the teacher to better focus his attention on the students .
Also , the government can direct more technological resources to schools so as to better equip the younger generation for a technological-edged world , improving their economical worth .
In addition , the government can instill filial obligation (Peterson , 2001) or family values and encourage early marriage by diverting money in crafting new programmes via the education system .
These ensure while the younger generation is able to contribute economically , they do not neglect the filial obligation towards the aged and at the same time raise the fertility level .
Economically , by raising the productivity of the children via diverting more money to the education system , it increases the younger generation's opportunity to increase their economic worth , and hence their future income .
Since the government's ability to provide social and welfare services for the aged is based on the tax revenue gained , diverting money to Singapore's education system would indirectly aid the aged and improve the aging population in the long run .
Secondly , money can be diverted to Singapore's architectural developments in terms of increasing the accessibility of physical facilities for the aged .
By improvising on Singapore's physical infrastructure , it not only benefits the current generation of the elderly , but also future generations in time to come .
This is considered a long term investment by the government .
One of the most significant improvisations is the lift upgrading programme .
New lifts are being installed in both new and old public housing blocks so that it now stops on every floor instead of the old system , which only stops on every third or fourth floor .
Other than the lift upgrading programme , the Singapore government can direct more money into enabling housing estates to be barrier-free .
The refurbishment is clearly beneficial as recently residents at Nee Soon South were rejoicing about the fully equipped barrier-free access they are enjoying at Khatib MRT station .
Before work on the two new ramps began , it was a chore for the estate's elderly folks to climb the stairs to get to the station .
Drawing from these two examples , money should be diverted to Singapore's architecture developments as it acts as a long term investment the government has towards the issue of aging population .
However some may argue that public spending should not be limited .
This is because it does not address the current and impending situation of the aging population , and at the same time the aged are the most vulnerable in the society .
Hence the government should do more to help , instead of cutting down on the resources .
The aged not only require financial support , because of their inability to sustain themselves , but they also require emotional and social support .
Many social agencies in Singapore run on the basis of government and public funding .
If the government is to cut back on its funding , social agencies will face difficulties in sustaining their operation , not to mention the support they are able to provide for the aged .
In contrast , I feel that in Singapore's context , limiting public spending and diverting money to the country's Education & Architecture in order to address the long term aging population issue is viable .
This is due to the policies that the Singapore's government has put in place , before the aging population surfaced .
The two most significant polices are , the Central Provident Fund (CPF) and home ownership .
CPF has required people to save up for their retirement , and hence old age , while home ownership has allowed at least a basic shelter and home sanitations for the aged .
Thus , the Singapore government has provided a safety-net in which the aged can fall back on while diverting money to other areas of development .
In conclusion , in Singapore , limiting public spending to divert money to other areas of the country's development is a feasible option to address the long term aging population issue .
This is largely due to the compulsory legislations that are enforced upon by the government .
At the same time , cutting back on public spending does not equate to cutting off public spending , with careful planning and considerations , there can still be efficient allocation of money in aiding the aged .
Diverting money to Education and Architectural development will prove to be beneficial for the aged and the generations to come .
Since the aging population will be a long-standing issue , it is time the government put in place long term measures .
Therefore , public spending should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
An ageing society is a primary concern for most parts of the world , especially the developed countries .
As such , policies that were introduced had much more emphasis on health and welfare benefits , where the aged are the key beneficiaries .
However , Friedland and Summer (2005) mentioned that "the critical challenge of an aging society is not so much how to accommodate the older population , but how to ensure the productivity of future workers , regardless of age ."
Although the government has the responsibility to care for the aged , they should direct their focus to training and educating the future workforce and generation .
Hence , public spending should not be limited on the aged .
Economic growth is vital to a country as with a good economy , it increases government revenue .
To achieve economic growth , productivity and knowledge of the workforce is important .
Therefore , the government can have funds for training and upgrading to improve workers' productivity and knowledge .
For instance , in Singapore , the government set up an Employment and Employability Institute () .
With the mission 'better jobs for life' , this institute is to provide help to the workforce .
They have training courses for the working population , regardless of age , to enhance their skills and improve productivity and competitiveness .
They also have a referral centre to help jobseekers .
This allows people to keep upgrading and maintain their competitiveness in the workforce , which is essential to the economy .
In addition , emphasis should be placed on educating the younger generation , as they will be the future workforce .
The government has to maintain a quality education and teach the right values when they are young .
The government should also ensure no one is deprived of a good education because of money issues .
In today's economy , students not only have to be knowledgeable , they have to learn to appreciate other cultures , languages to be able to compete internationally .
For this reason , student exchange programs in schools are increasing .
Similarly , the government should have subsidies to encourage the underprivileged students to sign up and allow them to gain insights to other cultures .
Every student should have an equal chance in receiving quality education and money should not be an issue to any student .
This is where the government should step in and eliminate any money issues .
However , public spending on the aged should not be limited as they had made contributions to the economy when they were of working age .
When they were working , they had to pay taxes .
These taxes contributed a significant amount  to the public funds .
This means that every individual contributed in a way and should be entitled to the benefits .
For example , a 70 year old man has been slogging his whole life working , contributing to the economy ,now , he is sick and requires medical treatment .
However , with little savings , he is unable to seek treatment .
This is where the government has to step in and help .
With rising medical costs , the government has to set aside a considerable amount for health and medical subsidies for the elderly as most of them would not be able to afford it .
The government should not ignore them as they certainly helped and contributed to the country during their early years .
A good economy will ensure the overall well-being of the society .
That is why the government should focus on economic growth primarily; taking care of the aged should be secondary .
One of the ways to improve the economy is to ensure the competitiveness of the workforce by having and encouraging people to upgrade their skills .
The other way is to have students receiving quality education  .
In conclusion , the government should have wise policy planning .
A significant amount of money should be diverted to other areas such as education and research for the country's development and a smaller amount for subsidies in medical and healthcare .
Public policies that encourage and facilitate education , basic research , and the application of promising technologies can enhance the well-being of current and future generations of older people (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
This is true as when public funds are directed into research , education and technology , it initiates economic growth .
With economic growth , it means increasing revenue for the country .
Subsequently , with the increased public funds due to a good economy , the government will have a larger budget for the aged .
Every year , governments seriously consider  the allocation of their limited public spending .
In Singapore's Financial Year 2009 , the expenditures allocated had been revised and redistributed .
They are social development (41 .5%) , security and external relations (34 .3%) , economic development (20 .4%) and government administration (4 .0%) (Ministry of Finance , 2009) .
One of the reasons why social development has the highest percentage is because governments are facing the problems of an aging population and are looking for ways to resolve them .
However , other than directly diverting the money on the aged , there are other ways to resolve these issues .
Majority of the public spending should be directed to areas that can assist in the country's developments such as the improving of the education system and creating of more job opportunities , so substantially , lesser public spending on the aged should be set aside .
However , some have argued that public spending should not be limited to the aged .
Some aging issues included economic reduction and workforce inefficiency (Peterson , 2001) .
With these rising issues , there is an urgent need to pump in more money for this group of needy people .
For instance , Singapore should consider subsidizing more of the costly medical bills for the aged .
When one gets old , one tends to have poorer health .
This results in the need to undergo several medical treatments .
Consequently , majority of the savings will be directed to the payment of their medical treatments .
This further strains their financial burden if they still have children who are depending on them .
Furthermore , the elderly tend to be less efficient than the younger working adults .
As a result , companies are not willing to offer a higher salary rate even if they manage to secure a job .
Hence , it is vital that the Government does its part by diverting more of its spending to help the aged .
Secondly , creating more job opportunities is another area whereby money should be diverted to .
In order to reduce the need for the aged to fully depend on the government , the government should encourage the aged to support themselves instead .
It is impossible to support them in the long- run as there are many other areas of concerns which the government needs to look into as well .
Hence , with the creation of more jobs , the government can assist the aged to secure a job and allow them to support themselves , on the condition that they are still  healthy  .
It also allows the younger generations to easily secure a job and support their aged parents independently .
All these promote social and economic developments of a country too .
Looking ahead , jobs creation is a more resourceful way in developing a country with its public spending .
With regards to all the points mentioned , it is concluded that public spending on the aged should be limited .
The idea of limiting the spending on the aged and diverting the money to the improving of the education system and creating of more job opportunities is to prevent the over-reliance of the aged on the government , eliminating the wrong perception of "I will still survive with this 'free' money from the government" .
Therefore , since the improvement of education system and creation of more jobs bring about more long-term benefits than having an unlimited public spending on the aged , money should be diverted to these areas as part of the country's developments which eventually , will impact the aged positively .
" To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process" on a large scale  , there are a number of countries that have a problem with the aging  , which is the faster the rate of elderly people increases , the more urgently the problem must be solved .
Therefore ,  governments are funding  a lot of realistic research and technology to  .
that should be considered such as the cost of facilities , equipment and finding sponsorship to make the development ,  that governments must be serious in extending the method of easing the aging process .
According to the Wikimedia statistics: "the median age of the population rose from 29 .0 in 1950 to 37 .3 in 2000 , and is forecast to rise to 45 .5 by 2050 .
The corresponding figures for the world as a whole are 23 .9 for 1950 , 26 .8 for 2000 , and 37 .8 for 2050 .
In Japan , one of the fastest ageing countries in the world , in 1950 there were 9 .3 people under 20 for every person over 65 .
By 2025 this ratio is forecast to be 0 .59 people under 20 for every person older than 65 " . . .It can be observed  that the dramatically increasing proportion of elderly people will have a tremendously wide impact on our society .
Firstly , The elderly seem to be burdensome for young generations for the young must share their budgets to take care in the elderly Secondly , an increase of the rate of elderly people can cause trouble in health care costs which means more funds used for maintaining a healthy life for the  portion of society no longer able to work .
Therefore , some solutions to solve this critical problem must be found . . Let take a look in Singapore's policies nowadays .
Under the  ,  Singapore's government has implemented some policies such as constructing  new infrastructures for the elderly and for the next generations also .
Besides ,  policy makers also plan to extend the financial security of the elderly through either raising the working age or prolonging  retirement bursaries .
Those policies are gradually easing the aging process for they create good conditions for the elderly  to have more opportunities to contribute their productive labour and to have more happiness for the rest of their life .
Furthermore , the improvements in the healthcare system is also lightening the aging burden .
More and more medical innovation has applied to extend life expectancy so that the working-age has been lengthened consequently .
As a result , the productivity of citizens has also increased rapidly which leads to the increase in national revenue .
Despite  the disagreement among economists about the cost of investing money in developing new technologies and drugs for maintaining good health for the elderly , the investment in health care is profitable and wise .
When  elderly workers have more choices to keep their healthy lives longer , they are eager to become potential consumers for medical care; therefore , the national budget will grow tremendously which relatively increases a big amount of GDP ( cited in the "Government will control media cost ?"
Article) .
So the fact that  governments put efforts into developing health care systems is logical and actually they have done well .
For example , according to a study  by economists Laurence Kotlikoff and Christian Hagist of the National Bureau of Economic Research : " the annualized rate of growth in government spending on health care was not only tops in the U .S . , at 6 .23 percent , but that the rate of growth here was the fastest relative to increases in gross domestic product among the 10 countries studied .
That's one reason why today the U .S . devotes about 16 percent of it domestic product to health care , compared to an average of less than 9 percent in other industrialized countries"  .
Hence , the USA spent money on nursing , building hospitals and strengthening clinical care for the elderly Likewise , in Singapore , the government spends S$110 million on paying basic Medishield premiums for two years for Singaporeans aged 61 to 69 so that 90% of the elderly can have health care benefits( cited in Asian metacare paper) .
In short , from the economical and social point of view , it can be concluded that the elderly have been taken care of better than in the past by the improvement of technological equipment , health care systems and the serious awareness of the issue by governments .
The elderly must be respected because they are a factorr in making  society  better-off in  economically .
As a result , governments should continue to put efforts into dealing with the aging  issue .
As a result of the growing aging population , public spending on the aged has increased in an attempt to minimize the negative impacts of a fast aging population .
Such a strategy translates into increasing pressure on national budgets and economies which could be used in other areas of the country's development .
Some have argued that public spending on the aged is redundant as the productivity and contribution of the aged to the nation is questionable .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be diverted to other areas of the country's development due to the potential fruitful returns from these investments .
However , the assumption that the aged are non productive is untrue due to the increasing emphasis on healthcare .
This has has allowed the aged to remain healthy , continue working and remain productive despite their age .
Therefore , public spending on the aged is crucial in ensuring the continued productivity of the aged which in turn benefits the country .
Firstly , the high medical and healthcare service fees can "substantially drain the resources of many elderly" (Friedland , & Summer , 2005 , p .17) .
Without healthcare benefits for the aged such as subsidized medical fees , most elderly are unlikely to afford the high medical expenses incurred .
Despite having insurance coverage , it is still possible that  medical bills are insufficiently covered .
As a result , the health of the elderly can deteriorate as they may not seek treatment due to the inability to pay the medical bills .
The economy in turn suffers due to the threats on the productivity of the aged .
Therefore , the government should not neglect  healthcare benefits for the aged as the consequence is undesirable .
Secondly , a fast aging population would mean that "growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer younger persons" (Peterson , 2001 , p . 7) .
This indicates a lack of resources , whether monetary or non monetary to support the large numbers of elderly .
Moreover , the younger generations will come under heavy pressure due to the disparity ratio support of the aged .
To lighten this pressure , public spending such as healthcare benefits can help lighten the financial burden faced by the younger generation .
Besides , it brings us back to the aspect of high medical expenditures which the younger generations are probably unable to afford as well .
An example would be an only son having to support his aging parents and elderly grandparents .
He is likely to face financial constraints due to  high medical expenditures .
To solve this problem , public spending on the aged can provide an alternative resource to support the aged which therefore lightens the burden of the younger generations .
In addition ,  additional healthcare resources can improve the health of the elderly hence , enhancing the productivity of the aged .
Thirdly , the shrinking ratio of younger generations in the future indicates the importance of elderly remaining productive to the economy .
Generally , it is assumed that the young should support the elderly .
The younger generation should remain in the workforce while the elderly tend to retire at a stipulated age .
However , this scenario may change in the future due to the lack of human resources in the job market .
To prevent the disruption of the labour market , the elderly are likely to remain in the work force in the near future .
Thus , an elderly friendly environment is essential to enhance the efficiency of the work force .
As the country ultimately benefits from the productivity of the aged , it is rational for the government to utilise public spending on the aged .
Therefore ,  public spending on the aged is as crucial as other areas of a country's development .
In conclusion , the assumption that public spending should be used in other areas of a country's development due to the lack of productivity of the aged is flawed .
Increasing awareness on healthcare has allowed the elderly to remain productive in the workforce which in turn benefits the country as a whole .
Therefore , public spending is essential due to the high healthcare services fees , the lack of resources to support the growing numbers of aged and the labour input of the aged in the society .
In essence , public spending on aged is rationalized and valid as the aged remain to be a valuable asset in the country . 
The aging process has indeed become a phenomenon in Singapore .
This is mainly due to a shift in the country's population .
The government has responded to this issue by establishing policies and programs to manage the aging process .
Most of the policies aim to reduce the problems associated with an aging population .
One crucial problem is the increase in government expenditure for the aging population which in turn strains the future working population .
Although some policies do facilitate in reducing the expenditure towards the elderly to a certain extent , it may still prove to be insufficient in easing the aging process .
One segment of policies that the government has implemented is to increase the overall fertility rate of Singapore .
These policies aim to produce a higher rate of productive children for the future workforce .
They will be the ones to support the large number of the future aging population .
However , the policies have proven to be ineffective (Wong & Yeoh , 2003) .
For example , the Baby Bonus Scheme which was introduced in April 1 , 2001 , was established to reduce the financial costs of raising children by providing cash grants .
The cash grants can be used to pay for child care , preschool and healthcare expenses .
The scheme caused an adverse effect as it only focused on the explicit costs .
The government failed to include the implicit costs of raising children .
Some of which include giving up one's career to take care of one'sr children .
Therefore , with the  , many prefer to establish their careers before having children .
The cost of raising children has also risen in the past years due to the need to enroll them in numerous programs .
Parents in this modern society want their children to be equipped with numerous  skills to prepare them for the future workforce .
Another policy implemented by the government involves providing for oneself through life-long savings .
This policy is implemented through the Central Provident Fund , CPF scheme .
The CPF scheme is a compulsory savings meant to meet one's basic living needs upon retirement .
Under the CPF scheme , the Medisave scheme is developed to lessen the impact of medical and hospitalization expenses .
However , the Medisave scheme has proven to be insufficient because medical expenses for the elderly are simply so high that people's Medisave savings can be used up within one week (Popatlal , 2009) .
Moreover , with longer life expectancy , the Medisave savings may not be adequate .
This problem becomes worse if the elderly do not have any children or children who choose to neglect their responsibilities to support their elder's healthcare finances .
Thus the National Housing policies were introduced to encourage filial responsibilities of the adult children .
However , it has been proven to be unsuccessful .
This may be due to the change in culture and values of the modern adult generation since they prefer to live further from their parents .
On the other hand , housing policies may have the opposite effect as some couples may misuse the policy by using the grant for their own benefit .
One example of a housing policy that has proven to be unsuccessful is the Multi-Tier Family Housing Scheme which encourages parents and married children to live together (Hill and Kwen , 1995) .
Nevertheless , some developments that the government has implemented do ease the aging process .
The current development of new community hospitals which link up with the main hospitals is an example of a measure that will ease the aging process .
Community hospitals are built to allow the elderly patients , usually with chronic illnesses , to recover with the assistance of a professional medical team but at a lower cost .
This will reduce medical expenses for the elderly .
In addition to that , community hospitals will free up beds in the main hospitals for acute illnesses .
Easing the aging process by establishing policies that solve explicit problems has proved to be inadequate .
These policies may be useful only as a short-term solution .
The government may need to consider the social changes and needs of the younger population to improve the aging process on a long-term basis .
This may include the impact of the rise in living expenses and the influences of  western culture .
Without considering these social changes , the aging process may increase government expenditure and the burden of the future workforce generation .
Public spending on the aged is favorable , but other areas of the country's development should not be compromised as the resources are limited .
Undoubtedly ,  spending on the aged is essential as they have contributed to our society greatly , but this should only be done to an extent and should not be the full responsibility of  government .
Moreover , the advances in technologyhave prolonged the life expectancy of every single human , making expenditure for old age soar to a great high due to  high medical costs .
According to  Friedland and Summer (2005) , if a nation spends more on the aged , besides slowing down the growth of the nation , it will also create more costly problems in future .
These problems include insufficient housing for  people , higher unemployment rates and insufficient budget for the future aged population  .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited to an acceptable level where it covers the neediest that are desperate for help ,  .
Most of the other portions of the public fund should be invested into the expansion of the nation to generate more funds for the aged when the investments ripen .
A country that is not expanding as fast as the population grows will  insufficient housing for its people .
Hence , the reduction in housing spending while spending more on the aged , may cost the government more  .
This is because the government may need to build and set up temporary accommodation for the homeless , where the manpower , materials and resources will cost more than the problems associated with  limited spending on the aged .
Furthermore ,  people will lose  loyalty and a sense of belonging to the country when there isn't even shelter above their heads .
This may cause mass emigration of the working age group which will bring down the nation's economy  and further aggravate the aging population problem .
Anotherr implication of overspending on the aged will be slowing down the growth of the economy which leads to unemployment as the market is unable to support the additional people .
This again will cost the government even more as now the government will need to support the increased number of people  in need .
Then , the government not only needs to help the aged but also the additional working age group .
Furthermore , the current working age group may not have anything to rely on when they grow old as the government did not invest enough in the market instead placing large amount of the funds on the current/present aged population .
The consequences might be a deficit in the government's spending which will be a burden for the next generation .
This is totally unfair as the former are reaping the fruits sowed by the latter .
Social issue such as the lack of filial piety will be the outcome if there are no limitations set on the spending for the aged .
This is because the working age group will choose not to take care of the aged as the government will be looking after them .
Thus , it pulls down their awareness of responsibility for looking after their own aged parents , while pushing the responsibility to the state .
This is an unfilial act .
Another social issue will be the aged taking the government help for granted and  depriving  aged people who are really in need such as  old single women and disabled people .
These two social issues will not happen if there is limitation on  public spending on the aged  .
In conclusion , public spending should be limited to an extent where no single needy person is deprived from  assistance .
The government should also diversify  funds to develop the economy , so when the economy grows ,  there will be more money for the government to support the aged who are unfortunate and vulnerable .
On the other hand ,  people will also have greater disposable income and be self-reliant , in order to support their aged parents .
Singapore has noticed the growing pressure of an aging population .
Our population pyramid (The Singapore Department of Statistics , 2008a) is one that is constrictive , with "fewer people in the younger age categories" (Richmond , n .d . , p .64) .
As reported by SDS (2008b) , we have a decreasing old age support ratio , with 17 residents aged 15 to 64 years old supporting one senior citizen aged 65 and above in 1970 , reduced to just 8 .4 in 2008 .
According to the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports (2009a) , in 20 years' time , "one in five residents in Singapore will be aged 65 and above" , which would make us "one of the fastest ageing populations in Asia" .
At this rate , sustaining our country's silver generation cannot just be the duty of the children , but as far as possible , a great work of cooperation , with the help of policies .
Instead of just 'feeding' , the government aims to get senior citizens to learn a new way of fishing emphasizing self-reliance  .
To oversee the progress of how the nation can ease the aging process , the Ministerial Committee on Ageing was set up to ensure "an inter-ministry approach to prepare for rapid population ageing" (MCYS , September 12 , 2009a) .
For starters , the elderly can approach their district's Community Development Council , which can help in job-matching , recommending government assistance schemes , applying for skills upgrading workshops and assisting in healthcare issues .
To encourage job security , they can receive the Chinese Development Assisting Council (CDAC) Skills Training Award when they successfully complete their skill upgrading courses (MCYS , 2009b) .
These initiatives are supported by the fact that it was reported four years ago , "63 .1 per cent of senior citizens aged 55 and above had their own source of income" (MCYS , 2006 , p .4) .
Another example is that many districts also hold regular free health screenings for the elderly .
While the country has to bear the initial costs , it helps seniors pick up telling signs of illnesses in order to be treated early .
In 2005 , "more than half (64 .2%) of senior citizens above the age of 55 went for regular health screening" (MCYS , 2006 , p .9) .
If the majority of our senior citizens are able to be  independent and pro-active , it helps to ease the dependency on our younger working population .
Even with the plethora of schemes , policies and aid , there will always be some who are unable to be  independent .
This  can be due to a range of reasons , such as disability , health , old age and even their mentality towards post-retirement work .
In many traditional families , it is a social expectation for children to support their elderly parents after retirement .
This obligatory gesture is seen as filial piety .
Based on the findings from 2005 , it was found that inevitably , "dependence on financial support from children increased with age of senior citizens" .
It was reported by MCYS that more than half of those aged 55 to 64 years old were given help by their children .
As expected , the percentage "increased to 77 .9% for those aged 75 and above" (MCYS , 2006 , p .9) .
At the same time , it could be the mindset of some senior citizens , who feel the government should be footing their bills , as a right for the country's elderly .
An aging population is a reality that cannot be postponed and it is happening now .
With the foresight of our country's leaders , sociologists and policy makers , Singapore has many solutions to help alleviate the problems and hopefully , will towards sustaining the country better .
However , policies and solutions can only work if they are tried and feedback is given to continuously improve them .
Everyone has a part to play , regardless if they are a working adult , a retiree , an elderly person or more importantly ,  just a citizen .
As the effects of an ageing population are usually associated with "impending" problematic issues such as the need for "publicly-financed health and welfare packages" (Friedland & Summer , 2005) , it is considerably detrimental to the economical progression of a country .
Furthermore , the process of ageing itself can be a traumatic affair .
To experience a changing state of the body , generally for the worse , an individual could undergo tremendous amounts of psychological stress .
Thus , besides the critical assessment of allocating and maximising the use of the country's resources , the government also have a part to play in ensuring that  people have a smooth transition into old age .
There have been many proposed strategies , policies and research that act to target people of all ages in alleviating the effects of a greying population .
However , , because such approaches tend to operate with the concept of initial loss and future substantial gain , the majority may be unwilling to accept such propositions .
As such , critics disagree with the statement that the current policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
Without inculcating social responsibility to both the aged and the young , these propositions may only lead to a paradoxical effect .
Indeed , some policies may serve its sole purpose in reducing the fiscal issue but not entirely easing ageing as a whole .
As purposed by Peterson (2001) , "requiring people to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency" is one solution which is evident .
This concept is very much like the Central Provident Fund (CPF) of Singapore , aiming to prepare the people through imposed sanctions on savings for retirement .
Although this method follows an "institutional-redistributive model" (Metha & Wee , 2004) that is beneficiary to all citizens of Singapore , it involves the compulsory allocation of a portion of the salary , which in a short-term perspective is unfavourable .
Goals like car ownership may be disrupted by such interventions since the supposedly 'extra income' is used to cover the individual for insurance and possible medical costs .
Through a holistic approach of both attitudes and actions towards such policy ,  .
have to align their ideology with that of the government to reap the equal benefits of such policies .
Another problem we have to address is people's compliance to the proposed strategies .
Peterson suggested "to increase the size of today's and the future's economy and tax base by encouraging greater productivity among the non-elderly" , the workforce and children (2001) .
He believes that through the upgrading of the people , they can contribute more to  society with their newly imparted skills .
In contrast , by creating policies to boost productivity of the workforce , the government would firstly have to set aside resources for upgrading and incentives , posing more potential of cutting welfare programs of the aged to fund the new regime .
Since the intended result is also not substantial , imposing these policies may then cause aggravation to the people as most may prefer  resources to be put into more beneficial and tangible uses like funding welfare programs .
people may not work more despite the fact that they became more qualified in multiple professions .
Thus , in order for such policies to ease the issue of a greying population , the paradigm of aiding the country must be observed by  society .
in the National Day's Rally 09' speech made by PM Lee , he  re-emphasised  the significance of social responsibility .
He mentioned that though Singapore is  new hospitals and strategies of saving cost in the recovery of the economical downturn , the community itself should be obliged to maintain a healthy lifestyle (2009) .
The aged have to acknowledge that community hospitals are recommended for rehabilitation while  general hospitals are meant for acute problems .
Families and communities should also supervise the wellness of  people through regular medical checks or even maintaining a healthy social network .
There are many existing initiatives that  society can implement in the absence of such policies to ease the ageing process .
In order for any development or strategies to work , it must incorporate the social responsibility of the people .
By campaigning pro-activeness as an integral part of  people's lives , it is certain  that  any policies implemented will be embraced by the majority's positive perceptions .
Thus , with societal and governmental support , the process of ageing will be eased not only through the dampening of fiscal consequences but also very importantly , through the willingness of  society in comprehending the greying issue .

Obviously , the notion of reimbursing the elderly with financial aid for their contributions to the country is naive .
There are plenty of methods that  can provide  aid the elderly .
Elder dependency should be reduced by encouraging later retirement (Peter Peterson , 2001) .
This is an example of alternatives that can be used to reduce  spending on the elderly .
So reducing  spending on the elderly for the sake of a country's development is a wise act .
While public spending on the aged is vital , it should not comprise  other aspects of a country's growth and development .
As mentioned by Friedland and Summer (2005) , "With little economic growth , society faces fewer choices on how to care for those who are least able to care for themselves .
On the other hand , with sufficient economic growth , there are more choices and fewer persons in need" .
This underlines the importance of economic development in the country to neutralize the implications of an aging population .
Thus , instead of spending excessively on the aged , resources of the country should be diverted to other areas like healthcare , education , and infrastructure , which will in turn benefit the country economically .
Despite the above  , it may be argued that as the elderly  contributed significantly to the country's development in their younger days , in view of their long term hard work , they should be entitled to more benefits than the rest of the population .
Governments should also set aside sufficient funds to assist them in coping with their old age life , be it in terms of financial or social assistance .
For instance , as people age , there is an increased need for more healthcare resources , hence leading to  inevitable spending in healthcare  .
However , for the elderly with low or no income , they may face difficulties and restrictions in seeking appropriate medical treatment due to financial problems .
It is therefore crucial for governments to extend assistance to the elderly in the form of medical subsidies , allowances , rebates and other kinds of financial aid to ensure that the needs of the elderly are met and protected .
In contrast to the above , although public spending on the aged is essential , there is also a need for investment of resources in the educational sector to provide better education for the younger generation .
As the common saying goes , "Children are the future pillar of the nation" .
They should be given every right to receive education under any circumstances .
Resources of the country should be diverted into this aspect to provide scholarships and bursaries for  needy children who are keen to further their studies and allow them to be exposed to better working opportunities in the future .
Not only that , an educated population will also mean a more productive workforce for the country , which will allow them to have an edge over others .
Moreover , as mentioned by Friedland and Summer (2005) , "Public policies that encourage and facilitate education , basic research , and the application of promising technologies can enhance the well-being of current and future generations of older people" .
This further suggests that with education , older people in the future will be more affluent and will have a lesser tendency to rely on the government for their well-being .
In turn , the government will not need to set aside huge resources for the aged , and will be able to divert these resources into other areas of the country's development .
To summarise , governments should also recognize the fact that unlimited spending on the aged will not be viable in the long run as individuals will only grow to be more reliant on the government to provide for them in their old age .
In short , a better suggestion will be for countries to place more emphasis on its economical development , as with economic growth , people are generally more affluent and hence will possess the financial capabilities of providing for themselves in old age .
Even though there will also be a minority who are less capable of doing that , they will only comprise of the few who require assistance from the government .
In today's context , ever changing societies frequently face a plethora of issues .
Likewise , most countries are currently tackling the main  issue of an increasing ageing population .
Since today's silver population of 65 years and above is 15 percent and is estimated to grow phenomenally to around 25 percent by the year 2030 (Centre for Strategic and International Studies 2009) ,  governments are deeply concerned with the implementation of fiscal and welfare policies that would directly impact the aged .
A component of fiscal policy , public spending , should be limited so that self-reliance can be inculcated into the aged through forced savings and so the economy can function better by shifting monetary input to facilitate trade and investments in infrastructure .
Contrary to limiting public spending , critics of human rights have been  advocating that state funding should not be minimized at the expense of growing the economy .
The mindset of respecting those who built the country from scratch resonates with feeling indebted to take care of them when they are old and providing them with the best of health-care .
Thus , in this instance , financing the elderly is an obligation in which public spending should not be cut back just because the aging population is growing at an alarming rate .
Moreover , to a large extent , the government should favour funding programmes and policies for the elderly so their interests are well looked after  .
Although it has always been the case that an appropriate amount of public spending is set aside for the aged ,  it is  of the utmost importance to instill a sense of self-reliance in them , which can be effective through education about saving for retirement throughout their working life .
This plan of accumulating savings by an individual is compelled by law in some countries and at the same time , while the savings can help to enhance one's responsibility for their own life , they can also provide people with financial security after retirement .
In this way , the aged would not be too dependent on family and the state for financial assistance .
Furthermore , when public spending is minimized through self-reliance on the part of individuals to save for their future , the money can instead be put to better use to help those who really need it .
Another point in case is that since the elderly can be self-sufficient to support themselves in old age , public spending in this area is thus limited , and may eventually result in a shift of state funds and capital to boost other sectors of the country's economy .
As such , there may be a huge concentration of growth in the area of trade because when more capital is used to invest in trade , it reaps substantial rewards in the form of revenue and higher growth and stability of the economy will ensue .
Besides  state funds and capital can be used to improve  the infrastructure of the country; e .g .
public transport systems , telecommunications sector , energy and water resource divisions  etc , so that the country may  advance and prosper with the advent of new technologies and infrastructure .
Therefore , when  economic growth is stable , this will lead to avenues of vast opportunities to further develop the country , and also result in fewer elderly in dire needs (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
As a whole , the notion of public spending can be viewed as akin to a coin which has two sides .
One aspect is that of favouring the elderly to the extent of fulfilling their needs to the best the state can provide because of their esteemed position as 'forefathers' of the country .
Whereas , the other aspect is seen as benefitting the whole community at large since such capital and funds are diverted to improve the economy .
Henceforth , the problems associated with an aging society is one such situation which cannot be dismissed lightly as having a definite solution , as often there are severe repercussions that occur with it .
Even in the face of success , it is important to periodically review the economic and social impact of housing and healthcare policies , as they will remain the key concerns in Singaporeans' lives .
Our public housing policies will have to adapt and respond to the changing needs and aspirations of Singaporeans .
With the rising standard of living , the housing needs in Singapore will change as well .
HDB will also have to do rigorous planning on its housing policies .
As Singapore has limited land  , it will have to think of ways to increase land usability and rejuvenate the old estates .
Pressures to spend on healthcare will also rise with an ageing population .
Public request for subsidies to cover the latest medical treatments , the improvement of service quality , and the reduction of fees for subsidized specialist consultants are becoming more common .
With such pressures , the need to prevent healthcare costs from escalating remains a key challenge .
Policy makers will have to ensure that the best feasible outcome is achieved .
"To a large extent , current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
I strongly agree with this statement .
Nowadays , a lot of researches have been carried out and many policies have been implemented in order to ease the aging process .
The three main policies that I will be discussing are filial obligation , later retirement and government subsidies .
Firstly , the main problem of the aging population is that the children do not want to take care of their parents when they are old , because they think that parents are troubles for them , since they are old and unable to contribute .
One of the methods to resolve this problem may be through legislation .
For example , the Singapore government has implemented the Maintenance of Parents Act since 1996 , and a Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents has been established .
Under this act , parents who are above the age of 60 and are unable to support themselves can claim maintenance from children .
Children who fail to do so may be fined up to $5000 or jailed up to 6 months .
According to the statistics made by a government organization , in the first 3 years after this act was implemented , 400 parents sought for aid under this act .
Some may argue that filial obligation should be voluntary and shall not enforced by law .
But , if the children still fail to support their elderly parents after much education , legislation will be a must in solving this problem .
If children are bound by such filial obligation , they will then take care of their own parents , and hence , the elderly dependency on government subsidies or the public may be reduced .
Secondly , some  senior citizens who do not have any children will have no support at all .
Thus , it is crucial that they have their own jobs , their own income , in order to support themselves .
As a result , later retirement is encouraged by governments from many countries .
After retirement , the elderly always stay at home and have fewer activities .
Eventually , they will become weaker , more forgetful , slower in reaction and less agile .
Not only that , the biggest problem is that they will have no income to support themselves .
Hence , later retirement will be a good option for them .
The reason is that , with a job , the aged can keep themselves busy and do more thinking in order to complete their work .
So , it keeps them healthy .
At the same time , they may have stable income to support themselves .
For example , the Singapore government has extended the retirement age of Singaporeans from 60 to 62 , and at the same time , provides them with trainings and courses , such as the Ling Kwang Home and Seniors@eCitizen , in order to meet the requirements of  employers .
Some may argue that later retirement is too much a burden for the elderly , but it is actually optional for them , depending on their own abilities and desires .
In short , later retirement can help the elderly to accumulate more wealth to support themselves , maintain health and find new purposes of life so that they are less dependent on  others .
Lastly , it is undeniable that , some of the elderly have no children , and they are unable to work , especially those who are too old or uneducated .
Hence , the government and the public will play an important role in order to curb this problem .
For example , the Singapore government has implemented many policies and provided a lot of subsidies to help the elderly .
One of the subsidies is Home Medical and Home Nursing Subsidy provided by the Ministry of Health (MOH) .
MOH targets to fund 50% of the elderly population requiring home care services .
With the subsidy , the elderly can stay in their own houses as they do not have to stay in hospitals .
As a result , the lonely elderly can also stay healthy in a community .
In a nutshell ,  various problems have arisen due to the aging population .
However , rather than to discriminate against and despise the elderly , we should put in more effort in trying to ease the aging process .
The three main methods in solving this problem will be filial obligation , later retirement and government subsidies .
Last but not least , every single person and organization should combine strength together to curb this problem , as quoted in the MOH Philosophy , "An elderly person should stay in community for as long as possible as institutionalization should only be a measure for the last resort ."
The ageing population in Singapore has been growing gradually since the mid 90s .
This increase is due to the larger number of babies born between the baby boomers' years of 1954 to 1964 , and the fall in birth rates subsequently .
Moreover the size of the ageing population is expected to increase more by the year 2030 (by 18 .7%) .
It is therefore  expected that the government spending should likewise increase .
The question is how much the increase should be and whether there should be a limit put in place .
These questions proved to be contentious and controversial and I will be further expanding these ideas through this paper .
Considering that a minority of the elderly population are stuck in the poverty cycle and continues to be weak and dependent on the government financially , we also should not however assume that all the elderly are unable to support themselves financially .
Statistics have shown that it is expected that the predominant of the elderly population by year 2030 will be more affluent since they are given better access to education and other opportunities .
Good health and material needs being granted , the elderly population would be expected to be capable of being responsible for their own financial needs .
In this case , there would not be a need to allocate limitless public spending to the aged .
Minister Mentor Lee mentioned about continued nation building and there being a need for more promotion of local entrepreneurship programmes and education .
He advocates that more of such programmes will help Singaporeans feel more "rooted" and possess a greater sense of belonging , since they will then have a 'stake' in this country .
Furthermore he also mentioned that our country needs to find new sectors such as the life science field to invest upon so as to keep the economy competitive .
When more money is being invested in these entrepreneurship programmes , there should be an increasing pool of business-savvy talents .
Our economy and the population should be expected to benefit from this increase .
The ageing population in Singapore , also known as the "silver industry" will provide a potentially lucrative market of labourers to attract foreign companies and business opportunities .
With the increase of local businesses involving the aged population , there would naturally be new products and services in leisure , retail , asset management , insurance and even healthcare catered to the needs of the elderly .
In other words , there will not be a need for a deliberate public welfare to take care of the needs of the aged population .
With reference to MM Lee's sentiments about venturing into new economic sectors , the money invested serves to seek growth .
However we must also consider whether to either sustain these new fields or deal with their  .
Let us take an example of the stem cell research centres at Jurong Science Park .
In attracting these foreign lucrative industries , the government built new roads and infrastructures to remain competitive globally .
Singaporeans are equipped with the necessary education and skills to become local sources of labourers for the stem cell research centres .
All these intangible costs would require a bigger share of public spending to sustain growth of the foreign industries investments in the long run .
It would be economically rational to place a limit on public spending on the aged population and subsequently channel the excesses to attract more economic investments for the country in the long run .
There are several other notions which are possible to argue in favour of extending a 'limitless' public spending on the aged .
The adequate welfare of the local population would definitely enhance the citizen's quality of life .
By providing limitless welfare to the aged would generally improve the living conditions of some of the less fortunate but that might potentially give room to 'free-riders' who would exploit the welfare system .
It is not a question to reduce or increase public spending upon the aged population , but it is about keeping a healthy balance in public spending efforts .
In conclusion , I believe that spending on the elderly should be limited because the elderly will be increasingly independent in the future , and because new economic challenges which require more government spending would arise .
The benefits of investing on education , new economic fields , and infrastructures would benefit the nation economically in the long run .
I would propose that public spending should be allocated based on the relative contributions each sector is able to make to the country's economic growth .
The key is about seeking a balance .
It is commonly agreed that our society is facing an inclination of growing old .
In Singapore , the proportion of residents aged 65 and above increased from 6 .8% of the resident population in 1998 to 8 .7% in 2008 .
The effect of this aging issue is often being over-emphasized .
In fact , the issue of aging population is normally seen in all developing and developed countries due to the explosion of technologies and enhancement in lifestyle .
It shall be handled with wise policy planning but not putting in as much country wealth to take care of the welfare of the elderly as possible .
In other words , public spending on the aged should be limited to a certain extent as the money can be distributed to other aspects of development .
As a country is moving forward , the aged population tends to be neglected in terms of welfare .
This is why the topic issue is raised , as a result of not forgetting the elderly who contributed much to all the improvements in their younger ages .
Yes , who are we without them ?
However , in conjunction with the positive feedback of modern technologies , the elderly in this era are enjoying a much more comfortable lifestyle compared to decades ago .
They are better educated , healthier and richer due to the economical and sociological changes .
In this case , they have stronger ability to take care of themselves independently .
We shall not be hauled back by the aging issue as the welfare for the elderly is actually better taken care of than before , but we should focus on just taking care of the group of elderly who is really weak .
Government spending is necessary for the welfare of the elderly but the bigger portion of it must be retained for other parts of national development .
On a larger scale , government policies should be made based on the advantage of all but not just the aged community .
Public policies are still needed to be drawn up taking into account of the problems the elderly meet , but not to an unlimited extent that goes for their good at all cost .
It's inevitable there will still be a group of aged people who cannot take care of their own welfare .
It's the responsibility of a caring government to take care of their needs .
As implemented in Singapore , filial obligation is drafted in law , which means that children are compulsory to take care of their parents' elder life .
"It would be agreed that children owe to their parents respect and kindness generally and assistance in case of infirmity or any special need . . ." (Henry Sidgwick 1907) .
For the layer of aged population who is still healthy but has lower income , they might have problems in accumulating wealth .
Extending the retirement age is a great way to let them choose whether to work longer or not .
Although government spending is to be cut down , the healthcare of the elderly should be provided at least for the poor .
Subsidized regular check up and medical fees must be offered to the senior citizens who are not able to pay up the amazingly high medical costs .
Money saved by cutting off unnecessary projects due to the exaggerated aging issue can be divided wisely into fields that can either promote the enhancement of the country or improve the life of all .
This covers government expenditure ranging from education , health , information and communication , environment , transport and many more .
For instance , education is the most important part to invest in , knowing that new generations will be the future work force and take over the power and leadership position .
In Singapore , 743 .4 million dollars was spent in 2007/08 to achieve a high literacy rate of 96% (among residents aged 15 years and over) .
Other than that , economy should be injected a greater amount of fund to ensure low redundancy rate and minimize the loss in economic crisis .
Other requirements that can be achieved include a green environment , an integrated transport system and excellent communication coverage .
In short , government expenditure should be spent on the welfare of elderly , especially those who are in need .
However , due to the high independence of senior citizens nowadays , it's not necessary to provide an all-range policy to all of the aged population as there're still many other aspects that should be taken care of .
This concludes that public spending on the aged population is fairly needed but to an extent that allows more improvement in other fields .
Old age has been always been associated with poor health and loneliness as people reach the final stage of their life .
The aging process is exacerbated when children abandon their parents as they feel that the old ones are a burden to them .
This is evident by anincreasing number of old people being sent to old folks home every year .
In the past , such cases were fewer as abandoning of parents was seen as a social stigma , an unfilial act .
Despite this , current research , development and policies have helped to ease the aging process to a great extent .
Unprecedented advances in technology resulted from extensive research and implementation of different creative policies have made the process of aging more pleasurable .
This could be in the form of less illness associated with old age and more activities available for older ones to participate in .
Firstly , in the medical arena , huge amounts of money have been poured in for research and development .
This is without waste , as many cures have been found .
Previously incurable diseases such as tubercolosis can be eradicated and this leads to an increase in life span and higher quality of life .
People in old age can receive better medical attention .
With a healthier body , the aged can enjoy their later years .
Secondly government policies  have impacted the lives of the aged positively .
One of them is the introduction of subsidies .
Old people tend to have little or no savings .
Hence to be entitled to subsidies greatly increases their welfare .
Furthermore more and more countries are compelled by the law to set aside a certain amount of money for their old age .
In Singapore , a certain portion of working population income is set aside in their Central Provident Fund(CPF) in which the money can only be taken out at age 55 or later .
With more savings the old ones can provide for themselves and have more to spend for themselves instead of relying on the small sums payout by the government .
Another government policy that  benefits the aged is the increment of the retirement age .
This is to encourage more people to work longer and reduce the dependency of old people on the government .
Other than the economic benefits , old people can involve themselves in their work and research has shown that working reduces the risk of getting illness associated with old age such as Alzheimer's disease .
Thirdly , developments in infrastructure have resulted in more community centres built .
There are many activities ongoing in these community centres which are open to anyone interested .
Old people are encouraged to participate in these activites as they not only allow them to fill their time with activities they are passionate about but also expose them to opportunities to mix with a variety of people .
Such activities could include singing competition , karaoke , dancing and mind games .
These activities make the aging process more fulfilling and engaging .
As countries get more developed , their citizens are more affluent and trends and cultures change .
More and more people are forsaking their parents in old folks' homes as they could afford to .
Old people in old folks' homes may have to deal with loneliness and the harsh fact that their own children whom they have brought up , have abandoned them .
The 'loss' of the company of their loved ones may be difficult for them to accept and they may end up not enjoying the rest of their life .
To conclude , advancement in technology , breakthroughs in medical research and various government policies have contributed to the aging process where the aged can have better , quality and pleasurable time completing their last stage of their life .
However  in certain cases  development has caused a weakness in the extended family .
'Aging' is a natural process of human life-cycle , whereby one grows older and gains his wisdom to the fullest before he departs from the Earth .
However , with the increase in this group of 'intellectual' people , our world is turning grayer than before .
According to Gavrilov and Heuveline (2003) , population aging is expected to be among the most prominent global demographic trends of the 21st century .
It is characterized by the decline of the fertility rates as well as the rise of life expectancies worldwide .
As such , this intensifying phenomenon creates a huge economic impact on numerous countries across the globe , presenting challenges on the allocation of fiscal budget to mitigate rising healthcare costs as well as costs in other related areas .
Therefore , given the budget constraint of each country , it is crucial for the government to maximize its resources effectively to have a well-balanced development of other areas .
With the growth of the aging population , public spending on healthcare costs will be exorbitant .
Each working individual will have to contribute more taxes due to the decline of economically-productive people .
Nevertheless , it is important for the government to implement feasible policies to assist the aging population .
Measures to ease the aging process include architecture upgrades and restructuring of healthcare system .
The first measure consists of building innovative features like small bumps on the ground to lead the visually-impaired .
In addition to escalators , lifts are constructed at train stations to allow the wheelchair-bound to traverse between different levels .
The latter consists of building more community hospitals for the elderly as well as extending the services of community hospitals to homes to save costs (Majid , 2009 , para .
3 and 11) .
However , the government should also ascertain the limit of healthcare finances based on an individual's capability .
On the other hand , cutting of elderly welfare finances may increase the financial burden of the family members .
Therefore , it is essential for the government to focus its resources on developing various areas , especially on those that are important to the sovereign interests like defense , education and economy .
A nation's military spending always takes up a substantial proportion of its fiscal budget due to the importance of having a strong defense force to defend itself against aggressors should diplomatic negotiations fail .
For example , the proliferation of nuclear weapons by North Korea has sparked off a regional arm's race , causing neighboring countries like South Korea to purchase more sophisticated weaponry from America .
In addition , since the '911' incident , the world has come to see the threat of terrorism as very real .
Terrorists are able to conduct their operations anywhere around the globe due to their extensive network of terror cells worldwide .
Given the rapid technological advancement today , conflicts between countries can also exist in 'virtual' form like hacking into sensitive websites to disrupt the country's economic activities .
Therefore , it is inevitable for countries to increase more of their military budget to upgrade their defensive capabilities against various sophisticated forms of external threats .
Education is the key to sustain economic livelihood .
A proper educational structure will nurture more knowledgeable and capable people in the future to run the country .
Educated people will also be more inclined to be independent and make financial planning for themselves during their economically-active years .
They will also have better quality of life when they grow older due to their healthy lifestyles .
Therefore , this would incur less healthcare costs as they remain fit and productive in their golden years .
A nation's economy is the main source of country's income as it is an indicator of a country's wealth .
People living in well-developed countries have high standards of living due to their affluence brought about by their stable economy .
As a result , they remain fit and robust despite the rise in their life expectancies .
This also means that less healthcare spending is required to sustain these affluent elderly people .
The lower-income group will also benefit from a well-developed economy as higher economic growth enables a government to provide more healthcare finances to support the elderly .
This would thus reduce the financial burden of this group of people based on their income ceilings .
Despite the volatility of the country's economy due to the global market , it is imperative for a government to implement feasible economic policies to facilitate trade and growth .
Therefore , having a sturdy economy will also incur less financial costs on elderly welfare .
In retrospect , countries around the world face challenges with an increasingly aging population .
Governments need to strike a delicate balance in allocating scarce resources to develop other crucial areas as they are indirectly related to healthcare costs incurred by the aged .
Likewise , they need to forecast future demographic trends and be flexible in changing and implementing new fiscal measures to deal with the graying population .
Aging is , no doubt , one of the most pressing issues that many developed countries are facing today .
Japan and Singapore have been battling an aging society for many years where the birth rates are at depressing levels and better healthcare facilities are available .
Because of this aging process , there is a need for research and development to come out with ideas to counteract it .
Thus , to a large extent , I agree that current research and development is the solution to this aging process .
The process can be eased through economical , social and architectural means .
Firstly , through economical means , elderly people are becoming increasingly part of the working community , working past the retirement age .
Singapore for example has a minimum retirement age of 62 years .
Elderly people can continuously upgrade themselves through job retraining to acquire relevant skills required for the job .
There are subsidies from the government to employers to send workers aged 40 and above to upgrade their skills .
An example is SDF course fee subsidy of up to 90% for workers aged above 40 with 'A' level and below qualifications .
However , critics may argue that employers may hire younger workers due to their lower wages and higher working efficiency as compared to  older workers .
This is not always the case as companies are less likely to waste time and effort to train the newcomers over a period and may not have the satisfied results at the end of the training .
Instead , they may want to retain the more experienced and skilled older workers to maintain a consistent working standard .
As for wages , people aged above 50 will contribute less to their CPF accounts and this includes the employer's CPF contribution .
This will in turn lighten the cost of employing older workers and the company would prefer to hire the more experienced older workers over the less experienced younger workers .
Thus , economically , elderly people will be able to work longer and be more independent by supporting themselves for their retirement .
Secondly , through social policies , there are more and more entertainment activities to keep the elderly  occupied .
To cope with elderly people's increasing loneliness , there are activities that can bond the elders together and engage them in fun-learning and enriching activities according to their interests .
For example , the Wellness Programme in Singapore provides companionship with the other seniors through activities like brisk walking , dancing , gardening or cycling .
However , not all elderly people are willing to participate in such events .
Although there are a lot of activities set up for elderly people , it is optimally up to them to decide whether or not to join the activities .
We cannot force but encourage them to take up the relevant activities that may interest them .
They should also make an effort to keep a healthy lifestyle .
For example , in China , it is common to see many elderly people practising Taiji in the morning in public parks and dancing along the streets at night .
It is thus important to maintain a healthy , yet entertaining lifestyle especially at an old age .
Last but not least , through architectural means , there are many infrastructures and facilities put in place for the convenience of the elderly .
For the safety of the elderly , ramps and slip resistant footpaths are being set up in residential estates .
An example would be at Macpherson Gardens in Singapore where such features are being put in place , creating an elderly-friendly estate .
The flats built in the past in Singapore were not accessible at every floor as the lifts were built in a way where they stopped only at specific levels .
Today , to improve the convenience of the residents , especially the elderly , upgrading works are being carried out at various locations , ensuring that lifts will stop at every level .
All these upgrading works are carried out to ensure that the place is made suitable for the elderly to live in .
Nowadays , our society is highly concerned about the impact of  aging process on our lives .
In order to be a valid candidate for an explanation of the aging process , the changes proposed by the theory must meet the following criteria: (1) they will commonly occur in all or most humans; (2) as an individual ages , these changes will become more pronounced; and (3) the changes will lead to cellular or organ dysfunction that ultimately causes failure of the organ or system (Steven N . Trautwein) .
Although the aging process has raised many problems in our lives , current science research and social policies have helped to solve these problems .
As the life cycle of human beings is  , human life expectancy is heavily dependent on the rate of aging .
However , a lot of money and efforts have been put in by governments ,  companies and scientists worldwide to do  research in aging in order to slow down the aging process and also help to resolve some health problems that are caused by aging .
For example , there are scientists who have created fruit flies that are able to  their normal life spans and thus have made old human cells behave like young cells again .
This research has made it possible to let us live for a longer time ,  leading to a healthier life in our old age .
As a result , degenerative diseases of old age such as arthritis , diabetes and hypertension can be treated and thus help in easing the aging process .
Centuries ago , human longevity was comparably shorter than human longevity today .
This is because  the invention of medicine has helped human beings to sustain a longer life .
As we know , human cells tend to become unable to regenerate when we reach our old age and this will lead to the failure of organs such as kidneys , livers and hearts .
The only way to cure these diseases is to undergo transplantation .
As the growing aging population has increased the need for organs , it is hard to get enough organs needed for the transplantation .
In this case , artificial organs can help to bridge the gap in time until a donor organ is available for transplantation and thus improve the survival of patients while they are waiting for transplantation .
Therefore , we should appreciate the hard work of scientists in the lab and medical center since it has improved  old age  in many aspects .
Other than the medical breakthroughs , social policies for the elderly are also playing important roles to ease the aging process .
For instance , there are social policies such as introducing advanced insurance schemes that encourages young people to start saving more to be financially secure in their old age .
Many countries have made individual retirement funds mandatory and hence successfully increased the number of individuals who are able to support themselves in their old age .
In addition , some social welfare programs , especially those which help to resolve the aging problems , including providing financial help to theneedy elderly , are under way .
These programs protect those underprivileged elderly from starving  or from being homeless .
At the same time , some charitable societies have organized many activities for the elderly to enjoy  whichprevent them from getting psychological illnesses such as depression that could make them feel they are worthless  .
These activities have provided a place for them to socialize with others , make friends , and get exercise as well .
Hence , these social policies have brought a happy , healthy , safe and comfortable life to the elderly .
In conclusion , our society should pay much attention to the aging problems and come up with solutions .
We are unable to reverse  time but on average we can live  a healthier lifestyle and for a compared with our ancestors since current research and policies are practical in solving some  aging problems .
Apart from that , there are also many studies in different fields such as architecture and psychology that are helpful to the elderly .
As  time passes , everybody will eventually become older and so we should prepare for it now .
For the first reason of my standpointan aging population that the root of the elder dependency problem can onthe worldbe solved if the couy invests in other specsigns arean aging populationdirectly Such signstuation .
By spending directly on the aged , the government is only trying to deal witcitizensonsequences and not the source of the problem .
On the other hand , if the country invests in other specific areas like education , the burden of responsibility in taking care the elderly will litesociologistst from the govo the younger generation .
This is due to the better inculcation and cultivation of morale values among the youth as a result of better educatithe majoritym , thus increasingrevolveibility in taking care of their immediate elderly family members .
A ca proposalould also focusnors spending on developing its financial economy , as the result of such action would be that the working population thusly better off to take care their immediate elderly family members , reducing the burden on government spending .
Secondlygue that the ideology of such approach in dealing with aging population is too long-term oriented .
As such , it is impractical and it lacks of ability to deal with the problem in the short run .
As the benefit of the approach can only be seen in the long run , financial worriesng the public funding amount immediately will result in shortage of funds to deal with current demand .
This will then result in audden vulnerable position , where many elder needy will not get the medthe medicald financial attention that they need .
In my limiting public spending on the aged .
By reducing the public funding , the government seeks to be more stringent in their subsidization criteria .
This will ensure that those who really need help will still get the attention needed , while those who can still afford trun after an approaches will receive lesser in contrast .
Instead of ignoring thare obligednd help , this approach simply re-evaluates the subsidizing criteria , enforcing the practice of self responsibilan account those who can and asking the public to play a fair share in taking carthemselvess or their immediate family members .

Tterm will eventually result in a smoothen path in securing the aging process , and lessen the burden of the nation's economy .
"To a large extent , current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
I agree with the statement .
In recent years , many Asian countries such as Japan , South Korea , Hong Kong and Singapore have been tackling  a long term issue - a burgeoning ageing population , which is a repercussion of rapid economic development , with high quality of health care but a relatively low fertility rate .
An aging population has caused an increase in public spending and decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) , owing to a decrease in the people who are highly productive .
In conjunction with this issue , The Council for Third Age (C3A) has been established in Singapore with the aim of promoting active aging .
In fact , the wellness of seniors is very vital .
Surveys show that many elderly individualsare prone to suicide because they can not bear the overwhelming effects of ill health and the feeling of loneliness .
Fortunately , plenty of research studies and policies have helped in easing the aging process .
Prime Minister of Singapore , Lee Hsien Loong , once said , "We are crafting new policies , improving our infrastructure and developing effective programs to enable older citizens to lead full and happy lives ."
An important policy the government has adopted is "Supporting Lifelong Employability" .
According to this strategy , legislation requires employers to offer re-employment to workers for another three years after their official retirement age , not necessarily in the same job or at the same pay .
In addition ,The government is going to retrain  older workers and enhance their skills so that they are ready to  .
For example , in July 2007 , C3M and local university Uni SIM offered courses to senior citizens so as to enable them to earn credits through courses to pursue a degree in future .
However , critics argue that the elderly are inefficient , conservative and out-dated .
They are a burden rather than an asset in the workplace .
Nonetheless , most  older workers are independent , mature and  .
They possess valuable experience to impart to the younger workers and they can the younger workers that are more productive and innovative , but who lack  experience .
This strategy enables senior citizens to stay engaged and contributing in the workforce , have more self-reliance in finance , boost the economic development of Singapore ,  , and thus slow down the aging process .
Furthermore , the introduction of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , a mandatory saving scheme , is also a policy carried out by the government to ease the aging process .
Under the CPF scheme , employees have to pay into their individual employee accounts during their working years and the savings can be drawn when a person retires to pay for his medical expenses or long- term care .
The policy is quite useful in grappling with the aging issue from the economic view point as it encourages financial planning by individuals during their economically active years and lowers  such as their burden hindering the younger generation's  .
The government can also reduce the privileges allocated to the elderly and the public spending can be used in a more prudent way in the development of the country in other areas .
Maybe from the younger generation's perspective , the policy doesn't make sense as it not only  every month , but it is  .
However , it is a worthwhile practice for citizens to plan for their income and expenditure and  their future .
In addition , the implementation of the "Wellness Program" and policies to create an age-friendly environment also helps in buffering the aging process .
The Wellness Program is a social program designed to encourage active and healthy lifestyles among senior citizens .
It comprises 3 parts- health screening , regular exercise programmes and social activities like brisk walking , dancing , cycling and so on .
Recently ,  realise that  housing estates and public transport   .There is also lift access to all floors of block of flats .
All these create a safe and accessible environment to the elderly .
In effect , the policies are because the welfare of the elderly is well taken care of and they will not be neglected by the community .
Despite the fact that this social policy requires a lot of money , it is crucial because senior citizens are part of our society and as responsible members of society , it is our duty to take care of their welfare when they are  unable to do so themselves .
In conclusion , the aging process is complicated and multifarious , and it affects every one of us .
We may not be able to prevent the aging process from happening but we can try to slow down the process as far as we can .
Current research and development indeed helps a lot in slowing down the process .
The aging problem is serious; it may slow down the economic growth in a country and create long-term stagnation .
Therefore , we must contribute to and support the policies available so as to achieve  on a societal level in the long term .
There have recently been some issues of the ageing population that  people feel strongly about .
Some think that policy makers should reduce the funds for the elderly , and spend more money on other areas of the country's developments .
some critics would argue and object to this  .
However ,  I agree with the first opinion .
Therefore , this essay will talk about the support for the first idea .
Firstly , the portion of public funds spent on ageing population issues should be reduced .
In this way , governments can make people  aware of the necessity of actively working to accumulate more money to support themselves in their retirement .
Moreover , children certainly should look after and take care of their old parents more thoughtfully than before because they would not want to see their parents  affected by the decrease in funds for elderly citizens .
Besides , we can see that the elderly nowadays look healthier and  than ever before .
This is due to the fact that our services for the population are now improvingday by day .
For instance , the quality of life has been made better as improvements in health care and sciences now make it possible for us to  .
Retirees probably do not need too much money; the main things they want at their age are to be satisfied , to live healthily with their family and to help their offspring to be more experienced .
Therefore , the decrease in funding for the elderly should not have a bad impact on the ageing population .
It is worth remembering that policy makers should also focus on other areas to develop their countries as well as reduce the pressure of the graying population .
For example , an effective solution to the ageing population is to increase the percentage in the governments' treasuries  such as the economy , science , transportation , education and some other areas .
The reason for this  is that those sectors play a significant role in the development of the nations .
Once the countries are strong enough , certainly the elderly will benefit .
To illustrate , spending money on economic research helps predict the trend of consumption and reduce the bad effects of unstable markets on the  nations' economies .
Moreover , improvements in science can not only help the people be but also decrease the size of hospitalisation and other medical bills .
Moreover , education is surely the most important area which governments must focus on as well .
The more effectively students are educated , the more productive and responsible the citizens we have .
With   , there is no doubt  that problems related to an no longer exists because authorities have great resources to deal with such problems .
Many critics  disagree with spending less money on the elderly because it contradicts traditional morals .
They say that because the number of households with elderly members is increasing as the people born in the baby boomer generation would be nearly 65 in 2012 .
Moreover , at present , there are still many people who can not take care of their parents and have to leave them in old folks' homes because they have their own family and they are still struggling to get by in this increasingly complex world .
However , in my view , placing a limit on  public spending for the elderly does not mean that we do not care about the ageing population .
Keeping our focus on the elderly is only a temporary solution .
How can we deal with this issue while we still lack support from other factors such as science and the economy ?
Governments should serve their elderly citizens over the long term instead of for the short term only .
Once they develop  strong economies and improvements in science , policy makers can not only focus on the graying population but also come up with the solutions to many other problems .
Overall , governments should change their focus on other factors of the country first before they  help the elderly .
Public spending , therefore , should be used to develop other important areas .
Once those main sectors are strong enough , the solution for the elderly can be implemented .
The increase inaging populations around the world is being hastened due to the long life expectancy and low fertility ratesin many countries .
Most countries have poured a great deal of resources into this increasing population .
However , if this trend of spending continues in the future  , it will be destructive to a country's financial structure .
Therefore , spending on the aged should be limited in order to transfer valuable resources to other sectors which also require the country's attention .
When we flip through the newspapers nowadays , we will usually read much news about countries being battered by the prevalent recession .
The countries in recession are trying by all means to revive their economy now .
According to the data calculated by the IMF (International Monetary Fund) to measure the impact of the financial crisis , the price of the financial crisis will indeed be high .
For instance , the G20 developed countries' GDP is expected to contract by 8% in 2008-09 .
Nonetheless , these costs incurred during the recession will only be about 10% of the spending related to elder care in the long-term  from now to 2050 .Due to the consequences brought by the financial crisis , it is critical for a country to divert more resources from  elderly-related spending to pumping up the dire economy .
The substantial cost of generous elderly care will not be fully supported if the countries' financial position is unstable .
Although many rich countries have accepted that it is time to reform their policies , the transformation is progressing very slowly due to the reluctance to introduce unpopular measures .
Such reluctance is affected by political factors like election .
Secondly , it is well accepted that a country should have  and appropriate development plans for gaining healthy growth .
The country should not focus too much of its effort on exploring the incentives for spending on  elderly care; instead , it should develop an adequate plan for the sectors which are equally important to the country's development .
For example , we can not neglect the significance of  education .
Education plays a critical role in helping a country grow from phase to phase .
The productivity and revenue of a country can be improved tremendously due to a well-established educational structure .
For instance , the federal government in Canada is promoting innovation  where its skills and learning agenda  "rests on the principle that in the knowledge economy , prosperity depends on innovation which , in turn , depends on the investments that we make in the creativity and talents of our people .
investing in innovation  will brew new knowledge for the economy which will in turn then create an environment with innovation excellence to protect and improve our quality of life .
In the long run , we are still maintaining our level of elderly care  a different way .
Moreover , a country which insists on providing maximum resources to the elderly care will face a dilemma when proposing a financial budget .
While elder care will inevitably account for a large portion of expenditure , the consequence of this improper budget is the financial burden of raising funds  , which will result  in a full load of debts and raising taxes .
The original intention of helping the elderly would then be tainted as the resulting situation would in fact cause suffering for more people .
On the contrary , the alternative to  helping the elderly lead a better life is not only limited to a large spending budget , but it is also achieved while the country boosts the economy through different incentives , like supporting the entrepreneurship of people by cutting taxes and giving allowances .
It creates an environment where people will have accumulated more wealth in the early stage of their life so they can support themselves in the later stage of their life .
In  reality , some elderly employees challenge the raising of the retirement age as this delays their eligibility for their pension .
It is a challenging task for the government to persuade people to agree over such an adjustment .
In a nutshell , the solid development of a country is built on a healthy  financial position and an unbiased development plan .
Having a superior elderly care system does not mean having  great success in governing a country .
On top of that , spending should not be narrowly limited to  elderly-related spending only , but resources should instead be evenly allocated over all the sectors instead of overlooking their importance .
During the baby boom in the 1960s ,  education system in Singapore was not very good .
Many people focused on working instead of studying , so the literacy rate was not high .
Aging problems did not arise until recently , when those who were born during the baby boom period are turning 50 to 60 years old .
This issue has led to a heated debate on whether we should limit the spending of public funds on the aged .
It is undeniable that spending on the aged is important; however , we should not neglect the more important areas like education and economy to make sure that the future generation does not suffer from the same problem again .
I believe that the education is one of the more important areas where public money should be spent on .
In fact , a good education is the only way out of the rat race , to a better and secure future .
Although Singapore literacy rate is relatively high as compared to the rest of the world , I still believe that should be donethrough , for example , increasing  mandatory schooling for Singaporeans until secondary school and providing more funding for students from poorer background .
Funding can be in the form of disbursing , subsidising school fees and developing more scholarship programs for the children of needy families .
These incentives will encourage children from  poorer families to study further .
With higher education , people will be able to earn more income and thus save more for the future , for instance , in the form of forced savings like the Central Provident Fund or life annuity schemes .
This will decrease the number of elderly persons that require funding from the government to get by in their old age .
More highly educated people also tend to plan ahead for their retirement .
They are more responsible and dependent on themselves .
Beyond that , Singapore should also spend more on educating citizens to lead a healthy lifestyle and work longer .
For example ,  encourages retrenched or older workers to upgrade themselves to increase their employability .
Education may be one of the ways to minimize the percentage of the elderly relying on government funding .
Another area that Singapore should also spend more money on is in developing the economy .
It is when the country's wealth can continue to grow that the economy is stable .
We should spend more money to attract talents from all over the world and transform Singapore into a world class financial and medical hub .
Coupled with better education , it will not be surprising that the disposable income of Singapore would also be increased .
This will improve the standard of living for Singaporeans and will eventually contribute to a better healthcare system in Singapore .
As Singaporeans become more well off ,  research for innovative products to tap on the sliver industry (market for the old people) will result .
Similarly  , the users of the innovative products will be in a better position , financially , to afford it .
With that , the sliver industry will become a lucrative market and more companies will be willing to invest time and money into developing innovative products for the elderly .
The government should also encourage companies to tap on these markets .
Recently , 5 companies have received a $500K grant from the government to develop elderly friendly products for the silver industry . 
Besides focusing all her resources on education and the economy , Singapore should also be spending some of her resources on the aged .
There is an immediate problem here and we cannot ignore that these 50- to 60-year-old elders as they have contributed to the success of Singapore in many ways .
Even if Singapore successfully brings Singapore education and economy to greater heights , there will still be people who fall through the cracks .
These people will need even more help in this highly competitive society .
Beyond that , solutions like nursing those elderly in other countries like Malaysia where expenses will be lower are not well received by the elderly themselves .
Therefore , we still need to spend on maintaining the welfare of these people .
In conclusion , by spending more on both the economy and education , we will be able to decrease the effects of the aging problem .
By investing in education and economy , Singaporeans will be able to generate more disposable income and hence , be less reliant on  government funding when they grow old .
Still , we should not forget to leave some for the aged as they have contributed in many ways to the country .
We should still be a responsible country which will take care of its citizens .
thereby tacklingthe less educatedaboutSecondly , we should encourage family bondimakesions with our elderly parents .
By spending on the development of public amenities like beaches , larger parks , family-oriented shopping malls , etc . , family can geducateter better relationship amongst them .
With better understanding , I believe the child of elderly parents will feel more obliged to compromise their tone'snd money to provide bette .
This will help instil ocern for them .in the youths .
aIndeed , parks also provide an avenue for the aged to keep fit and stay healthy , cutting down unnecessary healthcare costs arising when one grows old .
Thirdly , there should be an increase in fund on the healthcare sector .
One primary concern for providing healthcare for the aged is the cost .
Although some might argue that increasing the fund justthe government can encourage familiesoviding for the agrelationshipsng at thefamily membersgeI believe that with better understanding ,yindividualsiwiths for all .
By treating and preventing more spendoe before one gets old , detecting early symptoms of diseases , etc . , a person can be healthier especially when coupled by good social-policy planning by the government .
It is well known thathat arisesfrom age-related problemsuctive than any sickness the aged will have , having a fit mind is essential for having a fit body .
However , as recently mentioned in the mefunding forngapore will get a boost in fund for palliatin care .
The new initiative by the Health Ministry mentioned that the use of Medisave for hohealthcarepfundingative care will be liberalised .
This was done in view that the agepicture , one will see thatlanherish the quality  andather than the quantity of life , similar to the direction diseasescfrom arisingn providing comfort rather than cure .
The revised funding alll not only include in-patient hospicen of spending in this area , they must thread the issue with care as there are doubts over theso havinginability over the provision of this free service .
Interestingly , aid for the aged in their psycho-social needs is still lacking .
Nevertheless , with the extra pump in money given in these examples , better service will be provided for the aged .
Ason , it is noted that capping of public spending to the aged willfundingvide more cash flow to other sectors , which will in turn reduce meanse the problems faced now .
All three areas of education , healthcare and socialhas been doneare equally important whereby unnecessary funding to other sectors , like to the life .
Such care is similar welthator reduced .
As mentioned by Mr . Lim Boon Heng: "As the population of the agewill alsond the numbers grow , the sustainability of but also coverice is one we have to look carefully at .
Naturally , for those who can'tthe governmentord it , we should extend help funded by public generosity ."
There is only a cofin extent the government can increase its public spending on the agedforin particular home care .
Ultimately , prevention is still better than cure , we need to solve the problem from its root .
Friedland (2005) says that "policymakers must not only concern themselves with the rising expenditure related to programs to support a growing elderly population , but they must also consider the net impact of these expenditures have and changes that would occur if these programs did not exist" .
It is a well-known fact that the global society is growing old and old .
Because of this , it is important to make a policy that will be able to support the elderly in their late life .
However , it is still not the best thing to do .
It is quite a pity to limit  public spending on the elderly  However , if we limit  public spending on the aged , the money can be diverted and used to develop the country in other areas , such as economy and education , which may eventually lead to  more advantages for the country .
Nevertheless , if we limits  public spending on the elderly , the first one to suffer is the younger generation who have to take care of their parents .
They will have to spend more money for their parents while sometimes they may not even be able to fulfil their own needs .
Just imagine if the parents have  cancer and they have to go through a surgical operation which will cost the younger generation thousands of dollars .
This will bring more burden on the young .
Besides , there are also  parents who have  children working overseas or even have no children , which may eventually lead them to  leaning on no one except  government .
Therefore , if  government  limit  public spending on the aged , a lot of the young and elderly will suffer .
On the other hand , by diverting the money into some other areas , the government can gain some advantages in certain areas .
The first one is into the area of the economy .
By diverting the money to develop the economy , the government will be able to create more jobs so that it can reduce the unemployment rate as well as increase its Gross Domestic Product , which is the indicator of the economic health and standard of living in a country .
Besides this , Friedland (2005) suggests that "with sufficient economic growth there are more choices and fewer persons in need" .
Therefore , by diverting the money in the area of economy , we can prevent the elderly from  depending on the government help .
The second one is in the area of education .
Based on   statistics for the year 2008 in Singapore , 68 .2% of  residents who are 55 years and above have only graduated from secondary school .
It is one of the reasons why the elderly earn less money and therefore need the government help .
However , by diverting the money into the area  of education , we can provide the young with  education that will help them in their later life .
By providing them with good education , we can also prevent the same thing happening again .
Moreover , with a higher level of education , they will be able to learn how to invest well , which will eventually lead to higher earnings and which may also result in the increase in the Gross Domestic Product , which is good for their country .
In conclusion , even if the limitation on the public spending for the elderly will result in more burden for the young and elderly  ,  because of the long-term impact that it may have , such as more jobs , better education , and increase in Gross Domestic Product .
Moreover , it is better to try preventing things from happening rather than just try covering them up all the time .
Nowadays , the  has become a real concern not only for the government but also for the public .
The vast increase in the the aging population has led the economy to a lack of effective workers .
Furthermore , the elderly people , who are unable to continue earning and have little support from the young , seem to have many financial difficulties and have become a burden to  society .
Having said this , the aging problem is worth considering but the government should not spend too much money on it while the effectiveness of recent solutions for  the problem is still uncertain and the problem can be solved indirectly by the development of other areas of the country like theeconomy or education .
Some of the most well-known strategies for dealing with the aging population are extending the retiring age , lengthening  and encouraging financial planning during economically active year .
These strategies' point is that if people are given more opportunities to work , they may be able to save enough money for their retirement .
However ,  many real problemsarising from the reality that  make this strategy inappropriate .
Since the retirement age comes from much careful research on human health as well as ability to work , extending it irresponsibly may be harmful for the workers .
When more elderly people are employed , there will be less workplace for younger , more effective workers ; this is really a huge waste of human resources .
The second thing is that not everyone is able to make an effective financial plan during their economically active years .
It requires some basic financial knowledge which is difficult for the normal worker to know .
There are still many things to deal with before supporting these strategies .
In spite of focusing only on the aged , diverting money into the economycannot only bring benefits to the country but also help solve the aging problem .
If the government invests more money in theeconomy like reducing tax for  companies , allowing more foreign investments ,  , the concern for lack of effective labor among aging population  may be addressed .
In addition , agrowing economy provides  more sufficient funds to increase the pension and improve the welfare for elderly people  .
Furthermore , when the economy is developed , salaries of  workers will  increase such that they will have more savings when they retire .
Spending money for the economy seems to be a wise choice for the government .
Improving education is also a way to develop countries and a solution to the aging problem .
With more money invested in education , the schools  and universities will have more modern educational equipment , better teachers , and most importantly , reduce  tuition fees so that more people can study and have better education .
As a result , with higher education , people will have more chances of earning higher salaries , thus increasing their savings  for later needs .
When people are given some basic knowledge about managing money , they will be able to do financial planning , which will help them to use their money wisely and reduce waste Furthermore , elderly people with better education tend to have more active , healthier lives than  others and are not a burden to  society .
For example , since elderly people have some knowledge about nutrition , they will have the ability to choose healthy food like vegetables , beans , and fish instead of high-cholesterol food  like butter , sugar , and meat .
Good education is  necessary not only for  society but also for people who do not want to face financial difficulties when they retire .
In general , aging population is a global problem and needs to be solved as soon as possible but we have to consider the solutions carefully .
With the uncertainty of recent strategies for this problem , we should divert our money and effort into other areas which have more potential benefits .
By doing this correctly , we will be able to develop our countries in many aspects , including the aging issue .
The word aging has always been greatly feared by most in  society .
The reason for the fear is basically due to the fact that aging makes us fragile .
The moment  we become old , it implies that we are closer to the end of our lives .
We can hardly move as freely as the young , productivity is much lower and most of the time we are bedridden because of illnesses .
Life will be sheer torture instead of enjoyment .
The aging process , to me , means  progressive steps to become old , the transition to  illnesses , immobility and lack of money for retirement .
To prevent such situations from happening , research and development in science and medicine , innovative infrastructure projects and social policies have been constantly crafted  to reduce the effect of these problemsand make  life of elderly so much easier and more comfortable .
Hence , I agree to a large extentthat current research and development/policies have helped to ease the the aging process .
The aged are weak and vulnerable against various diseases .
As one's age increases , the body immune system deteriorates .
The ability to fight against germs and viruses becomes much less effective .
As a result , the older the people , the more they are susceptible to illnesses .
Any small disease can be much more fatal to the elderly .
However , as medical science and technology develops at a breakneck pace , many of the illnesses are no longer feared .
Doctors have better knowledge of the diseases .
With much improved equipment and tools , they are able to treat illnesses with much higher efficiency .
Through research and development , more effective medicines have been invented to cater to different types of problems .
Diseases , such as tuberculosis , which were deemed incurable in the past , can now be easily treated by the level of medical procedures .
Vaccinations are formulated to prevent us from even getting the diseases .
These breakthroughs  thus they can enjoy the  of their lives healthier , happier and with less suffering .
As medical procedures get very advanced , the cost of medical treatments is too heavy a price to bear .
However , if money is spent  from illness and ease pain and suffering , the lives among the elderly are still made more comfortable than before .
Hence , research and development in medical science has helped to ease aging process .
Other than health , decreased mobility has given elderly persons the most headaches .
As mobility decreases , daily major activities are greatly reduced too .
This significantly decreases the amount of entertainment an elderly person can enjoy .
In order to facilitate movement of older people , there are several developments in the infrastructure of the society .
For instance , in Singapore the elevators in  older HDB flats can only stop at certain levels .
Residents who live on other levels will have to climb staircases from their home to the lift .
However , under the new development , elevators in the newly built HDB flats can stop at all levels , thus making it easier for senior citizens to go up and down the flats . . Other than making the lift accessible to all levels , conscientious efforts have been done to further simplify the lives of the elderly .
Some elderly people can hardly walk up or down any stairs , thus ramps are paved outand hand railings are erected in parks to assist them walk around .
Owing to research and development in  social infrastructure , the elderly are allowed to pursue  leisure and entertainment .
As an aging population can be a big problem to many countries , several social policies are put in place to ensure the old have enough money after retirement .
In Singapore , for example , all working adults have to contribute about 14 .5% of their salary into a CPF account and their employers have to contribute 20% .
All the money deposited into the CPF account will be invested by the government and in return , offer a 3%  annual compound interest to CPF contributors .
By reaching the age of 55 , they are allowed to withdraw their CPF funds and use them for retirement .
They can use the money to go for holidays and pursue other interests .
The lifestyles of elderly people are maintained with the help of CPF schemes .
Therefore , the aging process is eased by current social policies .
The research and development of medical science , improvements in social infrastructure and social policies have helped in ensuring good health of the elderly , building facilities to create convenience for them and establishing CPF schemes to make sure the elderly have sufficient money for their retirement .
When problems related to health , mobility and finance are  solved , the elderly will be able to enjoy a much better improved lifestyle .
"To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
It is true to say that  with different improvements from different fields , we can face the challenges and solve the problems  arising from aging population .
If these problemsare not solved , the median age in many first-world countries will reach 51 by  .
During the aging process , the elderly will face financial problems and may be abandoned by their children .
Although this problem is unlikely to be solved in the short run , many ways have been carried out to ease the aging process , particularly in social policy and science research .
the Singapore government improves returns on CPF Savings to help the retirees .
Some  people claimclaim that it is everyone's responsibility to plan financially for old-age to reduce dependency on children However , for those who are physically disabled and suffering from illnesses , they do not have the ability to work and look after themselves .
Improving returns on CPF savings will ensure the savings can last for the lifetime of CPF members .
Older CPF members who volunteer to defer the draw-down of their savings to the age of 65 will receive a Voluntary Deferment Bonus .
This policy is used to encourage them to accumulate more wealth to support themselves during  old age .
The government is considering implementing a longevity insurance scheme that provides basic and affordable plans to ensure long-life income .
Hence ,  the effort of Singapore government to improve returns on CPF Savings has buffered the impact of the aging problem .
Besides Singapore , countries around the world also put in efforts to ease the aging process .
The silver jobs fair , established to find jobs for people aged 60 and over , is part of a government effort in South Korea to assist a rapidly growing population of older Koreans .
This jobs fair has mushroomed across South Korea in the past year .
In the past , it was a tradition that adult children should take primary responsibility for the good care of their aging parents .
However , the phenomenon we notice today is that the elderly are dismayed to find themselves dependent on children .
Children often expect their parents to contribute to household chores when they move in and do not expect to be made responsible for their parents' well-being . .
Therefore , most of them need to work  and master new technologies in order to earn their living after retirement .
Though some  that the elderly do not perform well in their work , this group of people can actually bring improvement to the sectors they are involved in through  their own experiences .
This silver jobs fair has helped many older and unprepared Koreans to enter the last stages of their lives more easily in a culture transformed by longer life .
Viewing from the healthcare perspective , researchers have also taken a big step toward discovering that human hearts can grow new cells .
This is a significant research to help to ease the aging process as we know heart diseases are common among the elderly .
There are some people who claim that this breakthrough is only in the realm of basic science research but it is a good start for future use .
It was previously thought that the human heart is unable to grow new cells after birth .
However , there is a study that can disprove it .
The scientists reported the evidence that new heart cells are made through one person's life .
This study could help doctors to design treatments for the damage caused by heart attacks , which was previously thought to be irreversible .
Now , it is possible to say that we can regenerate heart muscles after a heart attack .
Therefore , it is a new hope for the elderly who are suffering from heart diseases .
In conclusion , the aging problem is a concern all over the world .
The older population is growing at a considerably faster rate than the world's population .
It is a complex issue but not insurmountable .
It is important to understand the problems faced by the elderly before taking further actions so that leaders can implement practical measures to cope with this problem .
With the current policies and development in science study , aging process will be solved in the long run .
The challenge for the future is to ensure that people with different ages can continue to participate in society as citizens with full human rights .
Hence , I hope that the relationship between the generations can be nurtured and  children will take the responsibility for taking care of their parents .
To a large extent , current research , developments and policies have helped ease the aging processa A fast increasing  the aged population has been occurring all over the world .
As people age , their income drops but their medical expenses are actually increasing .
Hence , every research , development and policy that will help them to reduce their burden is important to them .
To a large extent , current research , developments and policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Medical expenses are most likely to be the burden of aged population .
As humans age , metabolism rates and immunity will start to drop , and limbs and body organs such as kidneys , livers , and hearts will start to fail due to long years of usage .
That is when all the medical expenses start to rise as a result of health problems .
To ensure that the aged population is able to pay large amount of medical expenses which could happen due to their old age ,  has set up a few policies to assist them .
For example , Medisave helps when they are younger to save money for their future medical expenses  .
It allows more people to be able buy  affordable insurance since its premium  can be deducted from their Medisave accounts , while Central Provident Funds allow people to be less worried about their silver age expenses , include medical expenses .
These policies have helped to ensure that people will be more able to pay for their future medical expenses .
Although some people might think that the government forces them to contribute part of their income to CPF  , they fail to realize that this  can be good as it prevents them from squandering it on other less important merchandise .
Therefore , when they age , they will not be very dependent on the government , which  thus  can divert  funds into other important development plans .
Other than the expenses ,  science and medical discovery is one of most important factors that will help ease the aging process .
Since the increase inawareness of balanced diet , people have been consuming less salt , sugar or high fat food ,  thus reducing the chances  suffering  from chronic diseases like hypertension , diabetes , or cardiovascular diseases .
Although statistics have shown that people have become more vulnerable to these kinds of diseases , their chance of survival has been increasing as medical technology becomes more advanced .
In addition , medicines  used to counter hypertensionand diabetes have been popular .
Thus , these enable hypertension and diabetis patients  to work and live normally after taking  medicine .
What will happen if older people need these medicines but these medicines are not affordable to them ?
The medisave and medishield they bought will help them pay for their expenses; although not fully  , it would still  significantly .
Architectural improvement has also linked aged people both with and without disability to be able to travel by themselves .
For instance , the SMRT company has installed lifts at every MRT station and provided bus services that are able to carry wheelchair users .
With these little extra efforts provided by the company , it would be more convenient for the aged people to ride MRT or public bus .
A decade ago , most Singapore HDB apartment lifts are not accessible on every floor , thus it was very inconvenient for older people as they still  to take the stairs which might have imposed more danger to them .
Seeing this problem , the government decided to upgrade the lift systems , so  most HDB apartment lifts are accessible on every floor now .
The cost of this architectural improvement required a large amount of funds , but what drove SMRT , SBS Transit and the government to spend  much money on these upgrades even though these may not have affected  profits  ?
It was because  may have seen  future benefits from these upgrades as the improvements would not only benefit aged or disabled people , but they would also reduce people's travel time thus increasing their productivity .
Hence , we  find that government policies have helped people to be more able to meet their medical expenses ,  science discovery has helped improved aged people's health conditions , and architectural improvement has made aged people's life easier .
Combining all points mentioned above , we can conclude that current research , developments and policies have not only been helping ease the aging process but also have brought a lot of other benefits as well .
By the year 2030 , one in five people in Singapore will have aged 65 and above .
If there is a limit to the budget meant for the elderly , the quality of life that the government provides for the elderly will be affected .
Lack of family support , unemployment due to low education level , and social and political impact on the country are some of the factors why public spending on the aged should not be limited .
It should instead be increased gradually over the years .
Traditionally , the family has been the main source of support for the elderly but over the years , due to the effects of massive migration of young adults and higher cost of living in Singapore , more elderly are being deprived of such support .
Many of the young adults are leaving Singapore because of the stifling atmosphere of the country and the political and intellectual lockstep enforced by the government .
Some are also attracted by  job offers overseas .
With these young adults leaving the country , the elderly are the ones who suffer because they are  left alone and most of the time , their children do not have the intention of coming back .
Tribunal cases of elderly demanding financial assistance from their children in Singapore have increased over the years .
Although the government is studying the best way to use the Maintenance of Parents Act to get such children to fulfill their filial duty , they should also set aside abigger budget each year  as a cushion in case the children themselves have difficulty financing their own families .
Most of the elderly do not have proper education that is needed in today's society in order to make ends meet .
With age catching up with time , their productivity decreases and eventually companies  hire new employees to replace them .
If the government were to limit  spending on them , they will face many potential problems such as unemployment or retrenchment , which will have a spillover effect on their children supporting them financially .
However , some companies do retain their older workers because of loyalty but if there is a crisis , they will still be the first ones to get laid off .
The government has done well in givingdoleouts to the elderly but this could only satisfy a percentage of the elderly population .
There are still many families who need the government's aid in order to meet their needs .
Our population is aging and by spending more on the aged , people can be assured that when they grow old , the government will be there to support them .
With this in mind , they will be spurred to work harder and contribute more to society .
On the other hand , if there is a limit on spending on the aged , people might tend towards individualism .
This will over time cause them to be more focused on their individual interests without taking the interests of society into consideration .
This will greatly affect Singapore since we are a multi racial society and working together towards a common goal is important for us .
Moreover , besides the social impact on the country , political impact will be another factor to take into consideration .
By not limiting the budget for the aged , the government can be assured of support from the elderly during a political election which may be critical for winning since Singapore is turning into an aging population .
According to Singapore statistics ,  the percentage of the elderly in Singapore is 8 .7% of the entire population and this number is increasing slowly every year .
It may not be the bulk of the population but it might be a significant percentage of votes .
Singapore has done well over the years in implementing projects helping the poor and consequently , it has gained the trust and support of the citizens .
It is therefore crucial to maintain or improve its image through  .
In summary , having a limit to the budget will  have long-term implications for the country's  and growth .
The government should gradually increase the budget for the elderly every year alongside its economic growth .
Instead of treating the elderly in society as a burden , the government should think of ways to harness their knowledge and experience  so that they can contribute back more to society .
In the recent years , along with the decline in birth rates , the proportion of the aged in our population has also increased .
This has led  to a major problem of our time , known as ageing population .
Governments around the world have been actively seeking measures to cope with the problem , one of which is to increase  public spending on the aged .
Even though public spending on the elderly is essential  in dealing  with an ageing population , it should be limited because of  underlying negative implications .
Instead , more  expenditure should go towards other forms of development .
Though some may agree that public spending on the aged largely aids  society in coping with the needs of an ageing population ,  it may also hinder the development of other sectors .
This is because , as the world becomes more globalised , what follows is the surge in the cost of living .
Services for the aged will become more expensive .
Hence , this implies that public spending on the elderly will have to increase simultaneously as well .
With greater expenditure on helping the aged , the country will have less funds for development in other areas such as infrastructure .
Therefore , with  inadequate input into these areas , the development of the latter will be neglected .
As such areas are the key pillars of a country's development , any slowdown in these areas will affect the country's regional competitiveness .
EU , for instance , has been dealing with an ageing population .
It has been predicted that the region's growth rate will be reduced by half in the near future as a result of over public spending on the aged .
[1] Hence , its impact on the economy is negative ,  .
Therefore , since expenditure on the aged puts the country's growth at risk , it should be limited .
Though many may claim that the bulk of the amount needed to support the aged should come from the government which has the greatest financial power to support them ,  this public spending should be limited .
The reason is , the government is not the only form of support for the aged .
The elderly's children are also another form of support .
If large expenditures were to be dedicated to helping the elderly , the children may   rely too heavily on the government to support their aged family members instead of both parties playing a part in sharing the burden of supporting them .
In Singapore , for instance , the government is not the sole party that is responsible for supporting the ageing population .
The government only contributes through  distribution of subsidies to help the aged while their children carry the responsibility of supporting them .
Therefore , to prevent overdependence on the government  , public spending should be limited and be diverted to other areas for better use .
Some may argue that limited public spending may not be ideal .
In the event that  government's expenditures on the aged is restricted while the number of elderly is surging , the needs of the elderly may not be completely attended to .
Such a circumstance will affect a country's development .
This is because since the aged's basic needs are not attended to , they have to work in order to fulfill them .
With the presence of the aged in the workforce , the latter will not be competitive .
Hence , since the workforce is the main sector that drives the economy , an ageing workforce which is inefficient will slow down economic growth and hinder the country's progress .
However , this usually assumes that there are no measures which prepare the people for old age .
Currently , many governments have implemented measures which enforce compulsory savings for old age , such as the Singapore government which implementa Medisave .
Hence , even though  public expenditure on the aged were to be limited , people still have  savings  which ,  when combined with the government aid , are more than sufficient to meet their needs .
Hence , limitation of public expenditure is still feasible and should be encouraged so that money can be diverted into other areas of the country's development .
In conclusion , it is inevitable for countries to deal with an ageing population .
However , apart from coping with the latter , countries must not neglect other parts of development which are crucial to these countries as well .
Therefore , it is advisable for public expenditure on the aged to be limited so that no other sectors are  sacrificed  .
The number of aging people ,  also known as the gray population , is increasing rapidly nowadays .
A growing gray population means more things to be sacrificedsacrificed-- one of them is public money that is spent to fund the aged ,  usually known as public spending for the aged .
In Indonesia , the budget does not specify whether the government can spend much money on them without any limitation .
However , the infrastructure of Indonesia is not well constructed yet .
We can see it from  evidence that is present , such as the currency of Indonesian rupiah which is very weak compared to other currencies .
Therefore , we can say that limitation on spending for the aged is a good idea since in Indonesia , there are still many areas that are not well developed yet , especially in the economic area .
Secondly , Indonesia's economic situation is still not up to par .
It is still very sensitive to any changes , whether it is from Indonesia itself or from the world .
There are many weaknesses in Indonesia's economy , such as the climate of investment which is still unstable .
We can infer that from big uncertainties in many obligations .
Besides that , there are many problems that make Indonesia's economy  not competitive .
They are laboring problems and other structural problems such as  corruption , which is still rampant .
Indonesia's government finds it hard to fight  corruption since it has been in Indonesians' mentality from a long time ago .
Nepotism is also a big problem in Indonesia and this is also very tough to fight .
In the banking sector , we also can see many weaknesses , e .g .
the lack of manpower , in which the Bank of Indonesia keeps fixing .
From the examples I have given , we can say that there are so many areas in Indonesia's economy that needs fixing 
Thirdly , limitation on public spending for the aged is not as bad as it seems .
For example , the government makes a policy which says that only 2% from the Nett National Product should be spent on older people .
If Nett National product of Indonesia is about 10 billion Rupiah per month , it means that 200 million Rupiah should be allocated to be spent on the aged .
Then , the government uses the rest of Nett National Product to improve Indonesia's economy .
After one year , due to economic improvement , Indonesia's Nett National Product rose to 20 billion per month .
Then Indonesia should allocate 400 million Rupiah to fund the elderly .
This example shows that spending on the aged will be raised together with the raising of Nett National Product which is earned from the improvement of the economic sector in Indonesia .
To sum up , the government of Indonesia should limit its spending on the aged and improve other areas of the country , especially the economic area .
In fact , limitation on it does not always mean a bad  effect .
We can use percentage system for the policy on it which means that the amount of spending for the aged will rise together with the improvement of the economic sector .
Now , the challenge for the government is to look for the best way to improve the economic situation in Indonesia .
As the proportion of the world's population in the older ages continues to increase , many observers are concerned that an ageing population will accelerate growth in health care spending as individuals tend to use more healthcare facilities when they age .
In the case of Australia , government spending on health rose by $6 .1 billion or $267 per person from 2003 to 2004 .
Increased health care spending results in a smaller ratio of the government's spending on other areas like infrastructure and defence leading to economic impacts .
I do not agree that public spending on the aged should be limited because spending money on the aged such as facilities and equipment is something that is definitely necessary for a society to be able to advance with no one left behind .
Rather than it being limited , public spending on the aged should be referred to as being controlled .
As long as needs are fulfilled , spending within a budget allows sufficient funds to be disturbed to other areas as well .
Public spending may not be appealing because there are no advantages and immediate benefits received from spending on the aged as compared to using these resources to invest in the economy , defence or infrastructure  .
Individuals do not see the benefit in investing in an aged population as they tend to associate it with having a high opportunity cost .
However , it may not be true because the repercussion of not spending on the aged will be even greater in the long run .
If we were to deprive our aged population of the basic amenities and equipment , what kind of image of the country does it portray to its foreign investors and even its own countrymen ?
The image and morality of the society will be adversely affected as a whole; foreign investors might lose confidence in the country as they have the impression that the country is uncompassionate and unfeeling .
Her own  countrymen might feel that they are not able to depend on the government for help and support in their golden age .
Hence , this may lead to the possibility of an outflow of her people .
This is especially important to a country where the most valuable resource is its people , like Singapore .
Therefore the government should not limit public spending on the aged as these effects are long-term and permanent to a country's development .
To some individuals , the aged are outdated and relatively less productive as compared to the younger generation because they are not as well aware of the latest technological advancements nor as agile as the young .
Individuals do not see the value in retaining these older workers in the workforce .
On the other hand , far from the common thinking of these individuals , this aged population encompasses wisdom and experience which is useful in guiding the young as future leaders .
In the case of Singapore , her government is cognizant that these elder workers are assets .
With effect from 1 January 1999 , the minimum retirement age has been raised from 60 to 62 years .
In addition , the government encourages active participation of the aged in the workforce by offering free training to these workers .
This implemented policy highlights the importance of spending on the aged to ensure that they continue to contribute to the society and lead a meaningful life .
This will promote active ageing  .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited because the impacts caused by the limited spending will lead to long run negative impacts on the country's economy .
By 2040 , the number of over-65s will top 1 .3 billion people and account for some 14% of the world's population .
Therefore ,  encouraging the older workforce to go for retrainingretraining will increase the productivity of these workers and hence their employability .
This will reduce the burden on the government as the government is no longer required to look after the basic necessities of the aged if they were able to be independent and self-reliant in meeting the needs of their daily lives .
Public spending on the aged should be limited for the overall sustainable growth in a country's development such as in the areas of national economy , education and defence .
In recent years , reforms to curb public spending on the aged have become a cornerstone on many national governments' policies .
As governments have limited budget , they cannot afford to spend limitlessly on the aged .
National governments are urgently seeking the best options to such challenges and one of the few options on the table is to restrict public spending on the aged .
While critics acknowledge the huge budget deficit is caused by the ballooning public spending on healthcare and activities for the aged among many nations , they are against the idea of containing public spending on the aged .
For many years , opponents to such plans believed that the European style of welfare states were the perfect models , where healthcare should be accessible to everyone and that care should be delivered to the aged without them having to pay for it .
They argue that the aged needs the best possible care in their sunset years .
Citizens of such welfare states were envied by many of their peers in other countries .
This system worked its magic for the past decade where the global workforce population to the aged ratio was approximately 9 working adults to 1 aged .
Stanford Center on Longevity (2008) .
But , the global upward trend in growing elderly population and a shrinking younger workforce coupled with low birthrates has turned against such a model .
There is a growing concern to rein in public spending on the aged as its continual increase can become a threat to a nation's economy which in turn can affect its survival .
Furthermore , excessive spending on the aged can hinder a country's growth , which demands equal attention .
Firstly , advocates of limiting public spending on the aged argue that optimal and prudent spending is the solution so that it is able to sustain the current and future aged .
For instance , the United States ihas currently the largest spending on healthcare as per percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (California Healthcare Foundation ,2008) .
Yet , there is little evidence  that the American system is superior .
The extravagant public spending on the aged does not justify its cause .
The average US life expectancy ranks 27th at 77 years .
In comparison , many nations are achieving higher life expectancy rates with significantly lower public spending .
Furthermore , the growing public spending for the aged has further taken its toil on the slow recovery of the US economy as it continues to grow the budget deficit .
If the public spending on the aged is not brought under control , the government will have to raise taxes to sustain its coffers which can irk its citizens and result in exodus of businesses if labor costs increase .
Secondly , for a country to prosper , it has to invest on its youths through education , which will boost literacy .
Therefore , the role that education plays in the economic development of a country is unquestionable .
Illiteracy often limits the economical growth of a nation where knowledge intensive industries are  highly valued .
Education will nurture the best brains which will in turn power the economy and bring wealth to the nation .
So , for the country's very survival , it cannot afford to neglect education .
Thus , spending on the aged has to be controlled for the benefits of future generations .
Thirdly , national defence is vital for a country's security and ability to defend itself against potential aggressors .
Defence will ensure the stability of economic growth in a country to deter internal and external threats .
In terms of internal threats , defence spending can boost a country's resources in time to deal with natural disasters while external threats can be in the  form of the need to protect the freedom of the country .
This makes defence spending equally important in the context of eeconomic progress .
In conclusion , public spending for the aged must be capped .
The government's coffer is not a ceaseless goldmine and if public spending for the aged is not brought under control , it will eventually run out , which in turn will affect future generations when they become the aged .
There has always been  on-going research , development or policies to help the easing of the process of aging .
How exactly do we define "easing of the aging process" ?
In the simplest terms , it refers to helping the elderly to age with convenience , to age with ease , and to age with grace .
Personally , I agree to a large extent that current research , development or policies in the architecture , economics and medical fields have help to ease the aging process .
There are three reasons which will be elaborated in the following paragraphs .
Firstly ,  mobility for the elderly has been improved .
In Singapore , the Building & Construction Authority (BCA) has been implementing a "Barrier- Free" blueprint known as the Code on Barrier-Free Accessibility in Buildings 1990 (Building and Construction Authority , 2006) .
This code contains restrictions and regulations which engineers and architects have to comply with make the built environment accessible-friendly for the elderly .
For example , the authority ensures the installation of lifts at every storey of Housing Development Board (HDB) flats and Mass Rapid Transportation (MRT) stations , as well as  ramps at all entrances of buildings .
However , people pointed out that the plan is not fully-developed and there are still several shortcomings .
They had commented on one shortcoming that there are still a large number of buildings which are still not fully-accessible .
With regard to this , the BCA has already stepped introduced the plan by applying another 5-year plan , known as the Barrier-Free Accessibility (BFA) Upgrading Program (2007-2011) to make sure that all buildings will be equipped with barrier-free improvements .
Furthermore , BCA has also set-up a $40 million Accessibility Fund for private buildings to be transformed into barrier-free buildings .
Therefore , one cannot possibly comment that privatized buildings are not accessible-friendly for the elderly .
In addition , lifts and ramps are currently being built at  older MRT stations such as Queenstown MRT station to help the elderly to travel from ground level to ticket gantries more easily .
With all these concurrent efforts by BCA , mobility has improved vastly for the elderly .
As such , they can age with more convenience and hence improving their connectivity with others .
Secondly , the Singapore government has employed initiatives to help elderly to extend their working lives .
This is to achieve reduced financial and emotional dependency on the younger generation by the elderly .
This is especially important for any aging population just like Singapore .
The news articles have also been reportedly quoting that the government hopes to reduce the impacts of an aging population by extending working lives .
As such , they came up with initiatives like Skills Program for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) , for the elderly who wish to work longer .
This program will enable the elderly to upscale their skills so that they can be retained in employment by their employers (Singapore Workforce Development Agency , 2009) .
Another initiative is the Lifelong Income For the Elderly under the Central Provident Funds Scheme (CFP LIFE) , whereby there is a fixed amount of income for an elderly who is aged 65 years  and above .
This will then ensure financial protection for the elderly when they reach the age (Prime Minister's  Office , 2009) .
However , people often question the effectiveness of these initiatives .
They may have doubts whether the fund is enough to enable a high percentage of elderly to work longer or can the companies cope with re-employment of older workers ?
With regard to this , the Prime Minister of Singapore , Mr . Lee Hsien Loong , had has reassured the public that the government will continue to revise the initiatives to make sure that the elderly can work longer with ease .
With regard to the ability of the companies to cope with re-employment of older workers , the government has introduced another program know as the ADVANTAGE !
SchemeScheme , which offers grants up to $400 ,000 to companies who are interested to re- employ older workers (NTUC NeXus , 2006) .
This is to help them to deal with changes in areas such as wage restructuring and the cost to re-train the older workers .
As such , with these initiatives , the public should  rest assured that the minimum of initiatives will be carried out to guarantee that the elderly can extend their working lives with least problems .
In this way , they can then work to occupy themselves and age with ease that they can at least contribute to the economy .
Thirdly , there are constant medical innovations to slow down the aging process; such as Botox injections , placenta injections , and skin-lifting .
These medical procedures are being shaped by the media that they can help the elderly (especially women) of  dealing with the physical changes in their body .
This will appeal to people who do not like the signs of aging  to be displayed on their body .
Thus , there are increasing numbers of people who are resorting to these procedures as they rebut that they can age with more grace by doing so .
On the other hand , people criticized  the negative impacts of in such procedures and the attitude of people who engaged such procedures .
They emphasize  the side effects such as the addiction to Botox injections and they often think otherwise of the attitude of this group of elderly .
However , as a matter of fact , any medical procedures will carry a certain number of risks .
Therefore it is up to the weighing of risk the individual wants to take .
It should be left to the individuals to decide whether they want to take such risks This is actually up to how the individual want to age and their way to deal with the process of aging .
If they feel that they can age with grace and happiness by engaging such procedures , they can do so by all means .
This is as long as they have fully considered the negative impacts of such procedures and agreed to accept them without condition .
As an outsider , we should keep an objective outlook on this issue and  not impede them from what they deem is the best for themselves .
We should only focus on the stand that these medical innovations do help those who want to age in the way  they define themselves  .
In conclusion , current research and development have indeed helped the elderly in their aging process in the ways as mentioned above .
Despite the fact that we do not know the exact measurements of how well these developments have helped the elderly , it is clear these developments are done to make sure our aging population can be well taken care of .
Furthermore , the most important thing here is that we can help everyone to age with ease , grace and happiness so that there will be less aging issues to be addressed .
I agree that to a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Over the past decade , improvements in the fields of technology and medicine have greatly aided in the aging process .
Further emphasis by governments with regard to public architecture has also made aging easier .
This could not have been timelier .
A study done by the United Nations in 2000 states that by 2010 , all developed countries would have an increase in percentage of senior citizens as a whole .
Advancement in technology has made aging much more pleasurable and enjoyable than before .
This can be attributed to greater awareness by technological companies of  the needs of an elderly individual , thus attributing greater emphasis to this field of research .
A noteworthy example is Accenture Technology Labs .
All the while , Accenture has been into business research and development .
In recent years however , it has branched out into a video analysis application scans streams from in-home cameras and detects when someone has fallen and automatically notifies kin and emergency services if necessary .
Another good example will be the electronic wheelchair .
Due to the weakening of their legs , many elderly faces mobility issues .
Previously , a person in a wheelchair would require another for assistance .
This made the user of the wheelchair extremely reliant on an able bodied person .
An electronic wheelchair was not an option as it was too cumbersome and prohibitively expensive .
Furthermore , the battery had very short lifespan and would require constant recharging , which further compounded problems associated with such wheelchairs .
However , over the past decade , improvements in the electronic wheelchair have made it significantly lighter and the battery is able to last longer .
With more companies manufacturing such wheelchairs , the cost of a wheelchair has declined sharply , thus making it more affordable .
Evidently , the aging process has been made easier by technological developments .
As the field of medicine rapidly progresses , many illnesses and ailments previously difficult to treattreat have now been reduced to mere inconveniences .
The field of medicine can be broken down into two broad categories: drugs and treatment .
In the category of drugs , improvement and discovery of new drugs allow greater management of age-related problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes .
According to the Lancet , a renowned medical journal , new drugs in the market allow patients to control their blood pressure or sugar level without the need for so much dietary restrictions .
On the treatment front , improvements in  pin-hole surgery have greatly minimized the trauma to the patient , leading to shorted recovery time .
An example would be surgery to repair the cartilage in the patient's knee , which gets worn out due to wear and tear .
According to MIOT hospital , the current pin-hole surgery requires no cutting , thus no bleeding and no need for anesthesia .
The patient can practically be up and running the day after .
With such leaps in the field of medicine , health problems associated with aging no longer are such  big issues as before , allowing people to have greater quality of life in their twilight years .
An often overlooked aspect when it comes to aging is the crucial role the government plays in it .
Social policies , especially with regard to the country's architecture , implemented by the government will have significant effects on the respective country's aging population .
More often than not , the construction and maintenance of common walkways fall under the prerogative of the local government .
Hence , in the developed European nations and Singapore alike , the authorities do build walkways which do not have sharp edges which make it difficult for wheelchair users to mount .
Rather , they taper the ends of the walkways into slopes with a non-slip coating on them .
This is an example of how social policies with regard to architecture can make life easier for the elderly .
In Singapore , the government has commissioned the building of elderly-friendly public housing .
The flats are equipped with non-slip flooring and many handle bars strategically placed to aid movement within the house , and many other additions which an elderly citizen may require .
To sum it up , social policies that influence architectural designs do play an important role in easing the aging process .
In a nutshell , development and improvement in the field of technology , medicine and architecture have helped to ease the aging process .
Expenditure on health , education , infrastructure , industrial and social amenities are examples of government public spending .
Today , the government emphasizes more on the aged and spends a large sum of money to assist them .
Quoted from the NHS Community Care Statistics in year 2009 , 1221000 older people are receiving some local authority supported care services which use  5 .9 billion .
This amount of money can be use for further development .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be reduced so that more spending can be diverted to other sector of the country's development .
The government should increase education spending in order to nurture people to create a brighter future for  society .
Dr Bill Harrison stated that education is the key to a better future for our children .
Children who are well-educated will have more opportunity  to contribute  society .
Besides that , professionals should be given more incentives to further their studies .
The government should raise the salary for professionals as a way to motivate them .
Having a higher-education qualification can aid the government in education matters such as teaching .
Channel New Asia reported that two thousand more preschool teachers are needed in the next three years to meet the growing needs of the childcare industry in Singapore .
Moreover , reconsidering  the education cost can initially give the poor some opportunity to have education in rural areas .
Thus ,  this will definitely benefit to the society .
According to Wikipedia , statistic shows that 19 .6% from the resident non-students aged 15 years and above had no qualification in education in the year 2000 .
Furthermore , infrastructure development requires a higher percentage of spending compared to spending on the aged because infrastructure plays an important role in ameliorating the standard of living of a country .
Transportation is very important in Singapore because almost all will need to travel .
Singapore transportation consists  of Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) , Singapore Changi Airport and others .
The government should spend more on transportation by providing more facilities for the disabled and poor .
Other than that , improvement in waste management is required as pollution is a big issue till today .
More recycle bins or "Saving the Earth" events should be carried out by the government .
Furthermore , renewable energy usage such as solar energy , wind energy and water energy should be used more frequently in order to reduce the usage of nonrenewable resources .
For example , wind power generation has a significant share in total electricity generation in Denmark (around 20%) , Spain (around 11%) and Germany (around 7%) .
Hence , the government should pay more attention to saving natural resources .
Another significant area is  industrialization .
Industrialization can be a core concern of a country as it is the second largest sector in most countries .
Industrial agriculture requires a lot of funds to improve their harvesting and planting .
Wikipedia claims that intensive farming is an{agricultural}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Agricultural]production system characterized by the high{inputs}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Input]of{capital}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Capital_(economics)] ,labor , or heavy usage of technologies such as{pesticides}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Pesticides]and pesticides{fertilizers}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Fertilizers]relative to land area .
Agriculture requires high spending to enhance their skills .
Moreover , the manufacturing industry also needs attention from the government since manufacturing is satisfying the citizens .
Manufacturing factories create many products and sells them to  consumers according to their demand in the market .
In addition , the construction industry is momentous as it will determine how a country will be developed .
As we can see today , there is construction everywhere in Singapore and this proves that Singapore is advancing at a quick pace .
Singapore's building and construction industry account for about 4% ofgross domestic product and S$27 and S$32 billion construction demand estimated for the sector in 2008 , according to John Keung , CEO of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) of Singapore .
Each and every sector of a country is undeniably important to make the country a better place .
However , each sector should have priority depending on its level of importance .
The government should think wisely and choose the sector which has more privileges .
In conclusion , government must pay more attention to other important sectors because every sector plays an important role for the sake of the country .
Therefore , The government should not focus too much of their spending on the aged .
It is the government's responsibility to take care of the people's welfare and support them financially .
Hence , it is only right that there are funds allocated to helping the aged .
Many countries have allocated part of the country's annual budget to helping the older generation .
For example , in Singapore , the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , often works closely with voluntary welfare organisations to provide community-based programmes and residential care for the aged .
This includes elderly homes and activity centres .
However , public spending on the aged should be limited as the people should be self-reliant .
Compulsory savings implemented in certain countries such as Britain , Australia and Singapore help ensure that the people have enough savings to meet their retirement needs .
Britain  introduced a compulsory pension scheme in 2006 where the employees have to contribute 4 percent of their monthly pay while their employers have to contribute 3 percent .
Australia's compulsory superannuation system also prepares the people for their old age .
These saving schemes in different countries would help ensure that the people have a minimum amount of savings after they have retired .
Hence they would most likely be more self-sufficient and public spending on the aged should be limited .
Sufficient government funding on the aged ensures that the elderly are well taken care of and they have a proper environment to live in .
An article from The Straits Times in 2007 states that the age group above 65 has a "higher rate of being homeless and poor" as well as "desperately sick" .
It is only socially and morally ethical that we take care of this more vulnerable group of people .
The government should hence allocate enough funds to ensure that all the elderly in the country have a place to stay and proper medical treatment should be made available to them regardless of whether they are able to pay .
However , while this solution reduces the problem of poor and homeless old people , it gives rise to other social problems .
Children of the aged may shirk responsibility and abandon their parents , thinking that the government would take care of their parents .
From a recent article from The Straits Times , some "Singaporeans were using the recession as an excuse to avoid paying their parents' nursing home bills" , even though some looked like they could very well afford it( Reference needed) In addition , 67 parents sued their children under the Maintenance of Parents Act last year .
If the government continues to fund the old aged , children may think that the government would support their parents financially even if they do not .
This would eventually lead to more children abandoning their elderly parents .
More resources can be diverted to education instead .
Children should be inculcated with moral values from young and taught the virtue of filial piety .
This would prevent them from abandoning their parents when they grow up .
Public spending should be emphasised , especially in countries with a large proportion of elderly .
Countries facing an an ageing population include Singapore , Japan and Italy .
Governments should therefore set aside more funds to support the aged and provide more facilities for them .
The Japanese government has established several facilities to meet the needs of the ageing population .
Facilities include nursing homes , residential care facilities and healthcare services .
Government expenditure on these facilities would help prepare the country for the ageing population .
This is however , only a short-term solution to the problem of ageing population .
Government spending on the aged should be limited and funds should be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Education is an important area that requires public spending .
More productive children can be raised such that financial burden can be distributed over a greater and more affluent future generation .
Public spending on the aged should be limited such that funds can be allocated to other sectors of the country's development , especially education .
By educating the younger generation , we would be able to reduce public spending on the old aged on a long-term basis .
When talking about the most striking features of aging we cannot forget the progress of science and its effects on almost every aspect of human life .
There are many pros and cons about this issue .
Some people say that the development of science brings negative effects to human health , especially to the old .
However , I do not agree with this idea .
In my opinion , the contribution of current research and technology is very important in easing the aging process .
For some people , science brings  more harm than good .
They usually argue that technology development creates pressure and a more stressful life .
The rapid tempo of modern life also results in wide spread nervous disorders .
Additionally , the environment becomes more and more polluted just because of the increasing industrial concentration .
The use of pesticides and many other chemical substances make all products unsafe to use .
Moreover , our machine civilization is also responsible for numerous accidents and serious injuries for many people , which cause a lot of difficulties in their old age .
The human aging process has accelerated in  recent years .
Nevertheless , I strongly oppose this argument .
From my point of view , science and technology give us a tremendous promotion in reducing the aging process rate .
With advancements in healthcare service and medicine , along with a better understanding of the aging process , life expectancy for humans has kept increasing .
The unceasing experiments and research have led to numerous discoveries which explain  the reasons for  aging  as well as the ways of slowing down this process and the key factors to keep the gray hair away .
For example , a healthy diet with enough vitamins , minerals and other necessary nutrition , together with regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle will help humans live longer and maintain their prime of youth .
Moreover , the appearance of many technology appliances like computers , machines and transportation means also increase productivity and lessen workload , which create more time to relax and enjoy  life .
With this physical and psychological health , people have a tendency to lengthen their life span .
Moreover , when people get old , science also plays an important role to ease their old age .
Old age always comes up with many unpleasant problems and diseases , both  physical and mental  .
But now , with the assistances of science , we are no longer worried about this issue .
In most of cases , scientists discovered medicine and the cure as soon as they discovered the causes of certain diseases .
In addition to that , the work of medical scientists also reduced pain to a great extent .
In the past , operations were performed on individuals in a very crude manner .
Today , however , many surgical operations can be done with a small incision and without any pain by application of endoscopic technology .
Furthermore , the support of many convenient devices also provides the old a better preparation to face  old age .
As we can see ,  wheelchairs , audiphones , glasses . . . have contributed a lot towards assisting the old people in their life .
Together with these , the installation of lifts , user friendly machines and free barrier transportation systems everywhere are also the key for senior residents' access toa better life .
Moreover , the electrical devices in our daily life these days such as computers , televisions , washing machines . . . also make life more convenient , pleasant and comfortable for the aged .
They not only save their manual labour but more importantly , make friends and are entertained From all of these above arguments , we can conclude that government can use science and technology as an effective way to ease the aging process .
This is a good solution to cope with the increasing aging population , one of the current difficult global problems .
It not only helps slow down the aging process but also facilitates acceptance of old age .
Again , , we must thank  science for giving us a better life .
Public spending on the aged is the expenditure by the government covering  health , infrastructure and projects aimed at improving the lives of the elderly .
A large amount of the expenditure used is contributed by government taxation on the working citizens .
The other areas of a country's development include investing in education , military , economy and infrastructure .
Funding for the aged is necessary as there is a growing trend in the ageing population but more importantly resources should be allocated away from just the aged itself to other aspects of the country's development  that will indirectly aid the ageing population .
Furthermore , the money that is spent on the aged ultimately comes from the pocket of the working population .
Hence , more time and effort should be placed on the other areas of the country's development which will in turn reduce the negative effects of an ageing population .
Firstly , expenditure should be placed more on the economy itself because with economic growth , the working population will be more self-sustainable and be able to support themselves when they retire .
The fact that more elderly persons will be supported by fewer younger persons now and the problem will get more severe in the near future , it is important that emphasis be placed on improving the productivity of current working population and making sure that they have the ability to earn enough for their old age .
Increasing the productivity of the working population can come in the form of subsidised training schemes .
Such courses should be put in place to encourage the working population to upgrade themselves by attending such courses .
In Singapore , courses such as professional IT  By increasing employability in the society , the workforce will be larger and will be able to support themselves and the elderly better .
Thirdly , we must note that public spending on the aged turns out to be the healthy and the working population who are forking out the money .
If the working population were to pay entirely for the healthcare of the aged , then individuals will not take responsibility to keep themselves self-sufficient and healthy during their old age .
This would not be a fair arrangement .
The individual must be made to be accountable for his or her own health and not rely totally on the public spending by the government .
However , we must note that certain public spending on the aged cannot be compromised and must be put in place by the government in order for the aged to stay healthy and not be a burden to the society .
Instead of spending money on treating the illnesses of the elderly , money should be allocated to promote healthy lifestyle in the elderly .
For example , lessons in gymnasia and fitness centres can be conducted specially for the aged to encourage them to exercise and keep a healthy lifestyle .
In Singapore , we have the Wellness Programme to encourage healthy living through medical check-ups , regular exercise and social networking .
In the matter of medical care , the government should also take responsibility to ensure that doctors remain professionally competent , and that hospitals and polyclinics have the best available facilities .
In addition , the costs for medical care should be subsidised as some treatments can really be expensive and most of the people will not be able to afford them .
Therefore public spending on healthcare and activities to promote healthy lifestyle are still necessary .
Singapore is facing a fast growth of aging population .
Without immediate actions from both the government and the society , it might create problems for the country and the  elderly  themselves in the future .
Singapore's economy might be in danger due to lack of productivity , and the elderly might find difficulty in coping with the aging process .
Realizing this impending danger , the government has been taking some new directions in economic and social policies .To a large extent , current research and policies have helped to ease aging process .
In economy  , the government has helped older workers to be economically productive by encouraging employers to hire , re-hire , and retain more mature workers .
The older workers themselves are encouraged to grow and develop their skills to meet the companies' standards .
The government also lengthened the retirement age to be 65 years-old instead of 62 years-old .
All procedures of this program are arranged under the new law , Re-employment law , which will come  effect in January 2012 .
It is hoped that the longer the workers work , the more money they can save for their life after retirement .However , some people think that the policy is ineffective .
The Re-employment Law will take into effect in 2012 .
Meanwhile there is an urgent need to protect older workers nowadays since many employers still have the mindset that mature workers have outlived their productivity .
As a result , many older workers are not guarranted to secure their job after 62 years-old at this moment .
Realizing this challenge , the government has encouraged companies which are willing to apply the new policy before 2012 by giving grants to companies and preparing the older worker to be more productive by giving workshops and courses .
In social policy , the government has tried to improve the awareness among the young generation  to care more about the elderly .
The Ministry of Community Development , Youth , and Sports held a Young- Old Forum in Singapore Polytechnics recently .
In this forum , the young generation is expected to spend more time and be more understanding towards the elderly .The government also encouraged the elderly to lead a healhty lifesyle , such as not smoking , consuming a healthy diet , and exercising regularly .
A healthy body  is important because when the eldery are healthy , they will not feel useless or abandoned .
In addition , the governement has also increased its subsidies for day care , nursing home , and hospital to give the elderly a better quality of servies .
Nontheless , some people are concerned about the government's spending on providing various the  subsidies  for the elderly .
Since everything provided by the government is considered as a right of people , the more subsidies for the elderly , the more demand will be created .
Hence , there is a worry that the government will neglect the subsidies to other important sectors , such as education and defence .However , People should not worry about this because increasing subsidies for the elderly can increase the new opportunity for the young generation .
There will be more people hired in hospital , daycare , and nursing home .
It will also stimulate the young generation  to create new products to ease the aging process .
In other words , it creates new business opportunity .
The more business in the country , the richer the country since its economy will grow .
Therefore , the government can increase its tax base and the other fields , such as eduacation and defence , will not be neglected .
Needless to say , the current research and policies are not perfect yet .
However , to a large extent , they have helped the elderly to ease the aging process .
The existence of the new policies for helping the elderly in many fields , such as economy , social , and technology , shows that both the government and society care about the elderly .
This will benefit both the country and the elderly .
In the long run , Singapore  can still keep its global competitiveness level even though it has a big portion of aging population .
The golden generation itself will be happier since they will not feel  useless or abandoned .
By the year 2050 , the projected median age of many first-world countries will reach 51 if the current situation of low fertility rates does not improve (Peterson 2001) .
With that situation on hand , many policies makers and governments are debating on the amount of public spending that should be allocated for the aged .
In my opinion , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the the country's  development .
The governments should stress the importance of filial piety to deal with the current situation and plan well ahead to pave the path for the future generations in order to minimize the impact of aging population which can be done by investing in certain areas in the country's development .
Children of the aged should be responsible for their own parents .
It is only reasonable and sensible for the children to take care of their parents as they are the ones that painstakingly brought them up , providing them with education and nurturing them into adults .
Unlike in the Asian countries , this culture is not very prominent in the western countries .
The  governments should encourage its citizens to take up the responsibility that is looking after their aged parents .
Doing so will not only lighten the burden on government agencies to use excessive amount of public spending on the aged , but the awareness of the importance of filial piety will be increased as well .
Reduced public spending and filial piety campaigns will have an effect that 'forces' the children to take up the responsibility for the parents .
By investing the money on areas such as healthcare and education , the future aging population will be better prepared .
The logical explanation of this claim is that when a person receives higher education , chances that he will be able to earn a much more substantial income as compared to those who are deprived from education is relatively higher .
What we could conclude from this is that he will be able to save more for his retirement and thus the need to depend on others such as government agencies or family members will be reduced .
Besides that , investing in the areas of healthcare will suggest that in the near future to come , the aged population will be healthier and thus less prone to illnesses that are associated with aging .
This is important as the problem faced by most of the aged population is the incapability  to cope with the high medical costs when illnesses such as strokes or heart diseases strike .
Therefore , instead of just focusing on solving the current situation by pumping excessive amount of money into the aged population , the governments should use the money that is saved from limiting the amount of public spending on the aged to prepare the current generation of adults for their future retirements .
Even though public spending on the aged population should be limited , assistance should be made readily available to those who are under privileged .
The respective governments must take into consideration that within the aged population there are people who are childless , single or even deserted by their own children .
These are the people that will really need help from the government agencies .
If the public spending were to be over constrained , it deprives  those who are genuinely in need of help from getting sufficient assistance .
This will only add on to the social implications , such as senior citizens going around begging for money , which most countries are already facing .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged population should be limited but not to such a large extent that it will deprive those who are really in need of assistance from getting aids .
Also , filial piety should be heavily emphasized by the government bodies concurrently with the implementation of limiting the budget on aged population .
The implications that come with changes tend to be too much for most governments to handle; yet  only through changes will the possibilities of a better future  emerge .
Therefore , with great foresight and careful planning , the governments could better prepare themselves for the up surging numbers of aging population by implementing the right policies and investing in the areas of country's development that will benefit both the aged population and the general society .
Aging issues have gained substantial attention from the public recently .
Along with it , we have also observed a huge increase in public spending for elderly housing , healthcare and retirement welfare .
Every policymaker needs to consider the effects of their proposed policies on this issue thoroughly before implementing .
Based on the possible future benefit brought by various policy options , it is reasonable for us to limit the financial budget for the aged and channel it to other economic perspectives despite the pressing calls for increasing public pensions for the elderly .
Some people argue that limiting public pensions for the aged will bring detrimental effects to their life .
I acknowledge the importance of essential healthcare , housing and retirement living expenses being subsidised by public pensions .
However , limiting public pension does not equal to removing it .
The key concept here is effective management of limited resources to achieve maximum benefit for the aged .
Increase in public spending may not solve the problems thoroughly unless we utilise the funds in appropriate ways .
We still have room to improve  our current welfare system .
If we can modify our system to be more efficient and effective without much increase in the governments' financial budget , we are able to make room for better use of public funds in other important aspects to aid our economic development .
This will in turn bring back more funds for the aged in the future .
As mentioned above , the country's development will determine its future financial capacity to solve various social problems including aging .
Funds pumped into elderly welfare will be exhausted with minor future economic benefits for the entire country .
In contrast , if we channel our funds to other economic activities such as developing infrastructure and tax incentives for entrepreneurships , we are likely to have a good yield for our future economy .
Most developed nations have their population rapidly aging .
Definitely , there will be an increase in public spending on the aged .
However , we should not place our focus in financing the aged .
Instead , the society is able to afford this growing the aging  population only when we can ensure that the growth rate  of our economy is able to match that of aging population .
Thus , economic development is a critical indicator of our capability to deal with the  aging problem  in the future .
Moreover , an aging population also presses heavily on our current working structure and environment .
We must deal with problems such as labour force shortage and low productivity to ensure the sustainable development of our economy before we could proceed to handle the costly expenses such as the healthcare , housing and retirement benefits of the aged .
Governments have wasted significant amount of public pensions on the aged due to inaccurate estimations and inefficient use of funds .
Firstly , they failed to recognise the fact that the daily living expenses of the elderly would be less than that of an  ordinary working person and established the retirement benefits system according to the average personal monthly spending of the working force .
A slight deviation of a few hundred dollars for each individual will sum up to a huge amount for the entire state .
Secondly , most countries do not target the needy people effectively .
Taking an example , the Retirement Insurance Benefits are issued according to the amount of social security payroll taxes paid into the Social Security Trust Fund in the USA .
With less contribution to the fund in their early working days , they will obtain less after they retire .
However , the low income group is the neediest group for retirement benefits and yet the least contributing group to the social security payroll taxes at the same time .
This retirement scheme further worsens the income inequality problem .
It is recommended that governments could conduct various assessments to distribute public pensions to those who really need it .
For example , Australia has implemented means-testing scheme for the Age pension .
The means tests begin to reduce the pension at fixed levels of income and/or wealth and the pension declines linearly to zero as income and/or wealth increases .1
In conclusion , for the future of the country , public spending on the aged should be carefully examined , and more focus should be placed on economic development instead .
We also need to note that it is important not just to cut the budget but also come out with a detailed alternative plan to support the aged .
Careful management of current expenses along  with an expanding economy  will be our only feasible cure to aging problems .
Based on an online report by Reuters , there will be 1 .3 billion senior citizens around the world by the year 2040 .This inevitable growing aged population will only increase problems such as healthcare costs , which could result in slower economic growth for countries .
Therefore , in order to prevent a scenario where a country's economy is not able to sustain this foreseeable problem , it must be agreed to a certain extent that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
By doing so , there are two main benefits which can help minimize the strain on the country's economy .
Firstly , with money being diverted to other areas , the country's overall economy can be boosted .
It is essential that the aged problem should be seen in the long term perspective where the country's economy is continuously strong enough to cope .
With strategic planning and close monitoring , these areas can both offer the necessary economic growth and also minimize aged related problems being posed .
An example of such an area is biotechnology where it takes advantage of the constant improvement in technology to research and create new products with the use of biological process to improve the quality of living .
Countries like Singapore , recognizing its potential , allowed stem cell research laboratories to be opened despite its controversy in moral values and religion .
An online article by New York Times suggested the reason Singapore did so was that it hopes in return , such laboratories will diversify its economy and add on to its research-intensive sector that will improve economic growth .
These laboratories also manufacture their products locally which can be distributed and used to improve the overall country's health at a low cost .
Diverting money to such areas proves to provide benefits in both contribution to the economy and aiding in the health where the aged ones are concerned .
Secondly , by limiting the public spending on the aged , the healthcare system with regards to the aged problem will thus have to be changed .
This  can be viewed as a benefit as the system will be changed to minimize the effect on the country's economy and the risk of a failed healthcare system .
To illustrate further , the aging population is growing and it is not feasible for countries to simply continue public spending and varying the amount as needed .
In other words , if a country were to continue with their current system and not consider the foreseeable problem , too much focus and money will be used in an attempt to resolve the aged problem .
By the time it is realized , it could be too late .
Countries are already recognizing this problem; an example would be the recent dispute in US healthcare system , where the democrats are attempting to cut down on the healthcare system in view of the current recovering and future economy , bearing in mind that the aged population is increasing .
Thus , it is essential that countries start reviewing and  new changes where necessary  .For instance , one step Singapore has taken is restructuring her healthcare system where elderly patients are treated inan acute hospital  followed by recuperation in a community hospital .
Hence , a change in the healthcare system will result in cost effectiveness as the aging population increases and efficiency in treatments .
In addition there will be a minimization of a risk of failing healthcare system as there is enough time to make changes and gradually adapt to them .
However , there is a risk involved in limiting spending on the aged .
Many citizens especially the elderly of a country will feel that the country is not concerned for their current and future health , therefore losing confidence in the government .
An example used again would be the recent attempt on restructuring the US healthcare system .
Although the  democrats are still at its proposal stage , the elderly are already starting to express their concerns for their current needs , together with younger citizens worried over their future healthcare .
In conclusion , the aging population is increasing and with it comes slower economic growth for countries .
It is crucial that countries come up with solutions that attempt to deal with this in a long term manner .
Many citizens especially the elderly will be upset over the limited support for the aged .
However , it is also time for these citizens to change their short term perceptions and start evaluating the possible long term problems if such measures are not taken .
Therefore , with good strategic planning by the country and the understanding of its citizens , limiting spending on the aged and diverting money to other areas of the country's development , is feasible .
Yes , I do agree that the current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The current architecture improvement and research and development on technological products for the elderly have helped them to overcome the difficulty they face when their physical health deteriorates , thus , providing them an easier life at old age .
However , there is still an increase in the number of elderly suicide cases despite much psychological help from social groups such as The Singapore Action Group for Elderly and many others .
This is supported by the news report in The Sunday Times on 12 August 2008 which stated an increase in the number of suicide cases of elderly aged 65 and above from 69 cases in 2006 to 87 cases in 2008 .
From the statistics above , it has shown that the current research and development or policies may not be successful in helping the elderly to cope with the aging process such as becoming physically disabled or feeling less worthy  in the society due to loss of working ability .
Hence , the elderly become depressed over the problems they face in the aging process which leads them to commit sucide .
Although there is an increase in the number of elderly committing suicide , it is only a small number of elderly committing suicide in Singapore which represents less than a percent of the total aging population .
The increase of number of suicide cases may also be simply due to the increase in population size .
In general , the current research and development or policies may have helped almost all the elderly to cope with the problems in aging process .
Therefore , the number of elderly suicide cases is not significant .
Currently , there have been many upgrading projects carried out in the older estates where the population  consists of mainly elderly .
In these upgrading projects , there are lifts upgrading to make the lift stop at every floor of the block and paths made even with gentle slopes around the estate .
These improvements in the infrasuture of the older estates make the estates more accessible for the elderly .
This is because in the aging process of the elderly , physical health deterioration is one of the problems they face .
They usually have diffculty travelling around their estate as many of them may have problems climbing stairs and walking on uneven roads .
Some of the elderly  are also wheel chair bound which adds on to the diffculty to travel .
Thus , with the lifts upgade and even paths , they can take  the lifts just outside their doors and move around the estate with no constraint due to unaccessible paths .
This help to solve the problem they face during their aging process , allowing them to travel and socialise without being bound by physical restriction .
As the aging population continues to grow , there are many business opportunities in the aging population market .
Many have entered  the elderly products market to supply goods and services that suit the growing numbers of elderly .
This encourages more people to research and develop technological products that suit the aging population .
Hence , there are many technological products that are user friendly to the elderly in the market now such as the iNo mobile .
It is a very  simple-to-use cell phone with large key pads and SOS button .
These functions help those elderly whose eyesight has usually failed and are not  able to catch up with the techological advancement to be able to use a cell phone .
The SOS button also allows the elderly  who are usually more vulnerable to ask for help when they are in danger .
This shows that the current research and development has helped to overcome some of the problems the againg population may face in the aging process like failing eyesight and lack of technological knowledge , thus , easing their aging process and allowing them to lead a normal life .
The elderly in Singapore are enjoying a better quality of life under the current research and development or policies for them .
The current research and development in technological products and architectural improvement have helped the elderly to cope with the diffculties they may face at old age .
Thus , this eases their aging process through providing them a more comfortable and easier life compared to the past when there was no such research and development or policies available .
A new paradigm shift and various strategies are required to enable the elderly to be more physically independent since much could be done to forestall some of the negative impact of a fast aging population .
According to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) , in the last two decades , the rate of disability among older people has been reduced dramatically .
Progressive research and development have eased the aging population to a great extent by reducing the rate of physical illness and disabilities among them .
Practically , with the recent invention of electric wheelchair , disabled elderly can manoeuvre and are more physically independent .
Electric wheelchairs are extremely useful especially to those elderly who suffer from upper body weakness that prevents them from using a manual wheelchair .
This equipment encourages the golden generation who spend most of their time on the bed or chair to move around with the controls provided eventually brightening up their lives .
Regardless , electric wheelchairs are too expensive for most elderly to afford even though it helps them a lot in terms of independence .
Besides , entrusting an elderly who is not well-versed with technology with such contraptions might be dangerous should accidents happen .
Even so , Medicare has been giving assistance to elderly who need wheelchairs as long as the elderly provides a written prescription from the doctor stating the need for having such wheelchair .
According to the Oxford University Press University Press (2007) most elderly feel satisfied with the use of wheelchairs and even use it for shopping , visiting parks and socialising which proves that it is safe .
Apart from that , the British government policies on human equality , age discrimination and employment have helped the aged improve their lives drastically .
Most elderly face discrimination in employment and training opportunities to develop themselves and earn a living .
With the equality policy being implemented , elderly have the opportunity to be treated fairly especially by the employers .
Thus , they are able to accumulate more wealth and reduce their dependency on their children's monthly support .
Britain even implemented the policy on community service such as better transport link in order to provide the elderly with independent lives .
On the other hand , most employers unwilling to hire the older people as they are not as productive as the younger generation and might cause more liabilities to the company if they claim a large sum of money on their medical purposes .
Furthermore , a better transportation link means more money needs to be allocated by the government to this sector .
Well , improvement on the transportation not only helps the elderly , it also encourages the public to use the public transport which reduces pollution as well as traffic jams and older people are wiser in the sense that they are more experienced compared  to the na ve and impatient younger generation .
It is also not necessary that elderly will claim more money on medical since chronic diseases attack humans without the age barrier .
In the progress of developing mortality in old age , Natural Institute of Aging has done a lot of research to reduce the disabilities and burden suffered by the elderly through studies on the alteration of genes and hormones .
Information from the fields of biochemistry , genetics and physiology has been applied in research to repair tissues and replace injured cells by using stem cells .
Researchers have been furiously expanding their understanding on these pathology changes and identifying the parts of the brain to improve human memory abilities .
At the same time , scientists explore methods to replace dysfunctional cells and develop a protective brain cell into the brain to prevent Alzheimer .
However , these researches do not guarantee that the hormones they produce are useful and it costs a large sum of money to maintain such experiments .
Furthermore , not many people can afford to undergo such gene alter operations .
In spite of that , the government has allocated a large sum of money towards research in the annual budget to encourage new findings on hormones and genetics which could protect aging people in the future .
Subsidies are provided to the elderly to help them with their necessities which indirectly gives them the opportunity to undergo genetic and hormones exchanges .
In conclusion , research and development is the best method to help the elderly survive several conditions that compromise the quality of their health and independence .
Thus , to a large extent , current research and development as well as policies have helped to reduce the effects of aging process in many aspects .
Nowadays , balancing public spending is a big concern to most of governments since they need to carefully evaluate the most suitable spending areas for short and long-term plans .
Failure to make decisions in government budget will affect whole countries' systems including their economy . . . , education , or environment , etc .
This essay argues that public spending on the aged , one of the most major categories  that have recently invested in , should be limited for developing other countries' important areas , promoting their sustainable growths , and forming people's responsibilities .
First of all , large spending on the aged results in an imbalance of governments' expenditure .
According to World Midyear Population by Age and Sex of US Census Bureau , the population aged above 60 will rise from 20 .38% in 2009 to 21 .97% in 2020 , which means more governments' are spending on pensions and healthcare .
When the aged public spending has increased to a considerable proportion ,  governments will find it difficult to keep pace with the advances in technologies , commerce , and education , etc .
For instance , a recent Singapore government list in 2008 shows that pensions have been accounted for $912 billion that has been equal to 17 .8% in total expense .
And the largest category is health care with $925 billion , which was nearly spent on an elder assistance such as home nursing , medical treatment , and long-term care , etc .
In contrast , education , welfare , and environment , which are essential for countries' development , have only ranked as 3rd , 4th , and 8th categories respectively .
In the same way , Australia has spent nearly 10% on healthcare while USA has spent about 15% .
As suggested , "if the government does nothing it will experience a rise in the structural budget deficit .
This has many problemsno full-stop" (Pettinger , 2007) .
One of the challenges is the increase in the national debt and annual interest payments .
For example , Italy has already borrowed over 100% of GDP , resulting in a high % of GDP goes on servicing the debt , which will only increase over time .
Secondly , what I want to emphasize is that the governments should only limit the public expense , which does not mean that they totally abandon the aged .
There are still activities carried out to help the elderly such as providing free travel on public transportation in cities or subsidizing old people's homes , etc .
Opponents of this position argue that the elderly should be paid attention with more and more subsidies because they are the predecessors with a lot of commitment to societies .
However , limiting expenditure on the elder enables countries to invest more in another aspects like economy , education , environment or infrastructure .
Then the countries will be stronger and stronger , supporting the aged with large amount of money .
We agree with Chan (2009) , who concluded: " . . ." .
All in all , every country has to formulate and implement the long-term public spending strategy , which mainly depends on different countries' economic , social and education backgrounds .
And restricting the cost on the aged in order to advance other necessary areas is a difficult decision for them .
Nevertheless , it is a critical and ultimate path to their full development .
"Aging" , the fact that human life expectancy is extending longer and longer whilst the fertility rate is reducing gradually , "is a continuous , complex , and dynamic process that begins with birth and ends with death ."
Aging populations imply there are pressures  on fewer young workers in the workforce who have to support increasing old populations .
Obviously , aging population refers to one of the most difficult challenges that policy makers worldwide are facing currently - how to fund  the elderly in the society .
Although there arecontradictory opinions related to this topic , more and more people agree  that public spending on the aged should be limited based on arguments that other areas such as education need more public financial resources , other social security welfare systems have proven to achieve reasonable successes and old people still can possess independent lifestyles .
Detractors usually dispute that old generations should be given rights to claim for public spending provided the contribution they have devoted to the public development .
However , many studies have shown the opposite  A study undertaken in Spain (2000) claimed that the rising allocation from limited public budget to  the elderly is expected to threaten commitments to other deserving groups , especially children .
To add more warning signals , a study done in the U .S . (2004) indicated that the "spending gap between children and elders increased by twenty percent despite the fact the U .S . poverty rates among children have consistently exceeded those for the elderly , and that in absolute numbers , three times as many children live in poverty , compared to elders" .
It is no doubt that future prosperity is likely to be negatively affected because of the  lack of investment in education , nutrition and other aspects for young generations .
In addition , the young workforce is doubly worse off through the pre-determined obligation to support the old generations using their own earnings .
As a result , the national aggregate surplus is offset by the public expenditures on the elderly , which leads to the overall effect of reducing potential growth rate and burdening developments .
In other words , the final result would have harmful impacts on overall social welfare rather than contributions as being claimed .
In order to avoid the risky consequences of fully-funded social security system foregoing , some countries opt to go with another manner , including Pay-as-you-go system .
Singapore government is among one of the authorities implementing the system via their Central Provident Fund (CPF) Scheme .
CPF requires employees to save for their retirement years whilst they are still working .
Social responsibility stands in the fact that employers also contribute to their employees' saving accounts at the rate of 14 .5% .
However , detractors usually argue that the effect of inflation rate increases costs of living steadily over the time; as a result , old generations who retired in the 80s or 90s are likely to suffer in the current situation where prices are highly inflated .
Therefore , a co-residence model which appears to be a complement factor helps to reduce stresses on public funds .
It works with the logic of letting children take care of their own parents , which is considerably effective under Asian cultures and contexts .
Thus , there is no denying the fact that the good performance in Singapore  is a convincing illustration for limiting public expenses on the elderly and investing in other fields such as education and research .
Adding more strength to ideas of restricting funds for the old generations , many people point out that the word "old" does not link to disability , institutionalization .
Recent researches have shown that only four or five percent of our older friends or relatives are institutionalized at any one time .
In other words , the majority of old populations can live independently .
Moreover , they are capable of obtaining a healthy lifestyle via doing exercises and maintaining proper nutrition plans .
For examples , in 2008 , the Stanford University Medical center team found that elderly joggers are less likely to be killed by diseases like cancer , neurological diseases and infections .
It is to re-confirm that regular exercises provide the elderly with mobile and independent lives , stronger hearts and fewer healthcares required .
Ultimately , it is important to consider specific needs of the elderly rather than distributing funds in general without careful allocation .
By doing that , the remaining public fund would be used more efficiently and effectively in other investment and reinforcement activities and the country would benefit subsequently .
According the US Census Bureau , the number of people 65 and older hit about 506 million as a midyear 2008 , and this will be double to 1 .3 billion by 2040 .
Clearly , aging process will become more and more difficult to deal with and there is an urgent need to tackle this issue .
Solutions should be discussed internationally to gain sharing benefits .
However , specific adjustments need to be made to specific countries Besides , notwithstanding the agreement upon restrictions on public expenditures on old populations , governments still have to provide necessary supports .
Meanwhile , there must be a reasonable investment on younger generations and a push in national income over the time to balance different benefits of various human groups in the society .
In Singapore today , our median age is 36 years and life expectancy is 80 years .
The median age has significantly increased from 24 years since 1980 , and predicted to reach 54 years within the next 40 years , similar to that of Japan and Italy now .
(Singapore Department of Statistics , 1999 , Lee , 2009) There will be increased burden on the working adult population to provide for the aged dependents , be it healthcare or finances .
This is made worse with the shrinking workforce that we are now experiencing .
However , current research and developments , and polices have effectively help eased the aging process .
This is done through technological advances in medical care , policies to encourage financial independency among the elderly , and adopting a foreign talent policy .
Secondly , policies to encourage financial independency among the elderly , for instance CPF (Central Provident Fund) , Medishield and the extended retirement age from 60 to 62 years in 1999 .
(Ministry of Manpower , 2006) By increasing the retirement age , it creates a motivating effect on people to work till at later age , so as to enjoy benefits like pensions and government incentives after retirement .
They would also be able to obtain more wealth which they could use to support themselves in old age .
This helps lessen the government's burden to provide for the elderly , and the effects of a shrinking workforce brought by aging population .
Companies would also be able to benefit more from the experience and expertise of their more elder employees .
In addition , elderly workers tend to have lower turnover rates for employment , which is beneficial to the company .
For example Wal-mart , the world's largest public corporation by revenue , actively hires elderly workers for her operations -- close to 20% of Wal- mart's workforce is at least 55 years old .
(Walter , 2006) One may argue that this in a sense forces later retirement , especially for people with insufficient savings to depend on without a job .
However it also emphasizes a greater need to be financially independent and helps create more elderly involvement in the society which contributes to the economy .
Thirdly , foreign talent policy , of which the government embraces , also plays an important role in easing the aging process .
Foreign talents help increase the workforce in the economy , which helps to solve the problem of shrinking workforce brought about by aging population .
Effective use of their expertise also helps create a more productive economy and generate more economic income which could be diverted to helping the elderly population .
More importantly , they create greater diversity and especially vibrancy in the country , of which lack of it is evidently seen in some countries in Europe due to a decreasing proportion of youths brought about by aging population .
A recent study also indicated a 170 percentage increase in Singapore's non-resident workforce over the last decade , from 248 ,000 in 1990 to 670 ,000 in 2006 .
(Yeoh , 2007) One of the most common arguments against the policy would be that the increased competitiveness of employment which results in loss of jobs for the local population , even with the implementation of foreign employment quota ratios by the government .
However , from a different viewpoint , the increased competition results in greater competitiveness of our firms not only within Singapore's economy but globally as well .
This policy would also be vital for Singapore to sustain strong economic growth and competitiveness in the global market in the future .
According to Administration of Aging (AoA) in America , the figure of the older population which refers to persons 65 years or older is 37 .3 million in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) and this statistics is anticipated to grow more than double by the year 2030 .Concern about aged has surfaced with such dramatic force and recognition by so many nations .
Aging populations present considerable challenges to serious fiscal consequences for welfare states .
It is important that the publicly-financed health and welfare packages on the older people who tend to be the principal beneficiaries are implemented effectively .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to divert the money to other areas of the country's development .
Limiting the public spending on the aged may impose a financial burden on the future generations simultaneously as the main resource for financial support of elderly is family .
Children of the aged have to undertake the higher proportion of expenses especially in the aspect of medical .
on the other hand , Peterson (2001) had suggested that societies with weak extended families high elder poverty and quick-rising of long term care costs should learn from Japan where most elderly people still live with their adult children .
Filial obligation and willingness of grown children to take care of their aged parents are needed indeed .
However , adults nowadays are stressed enough when facing the competitive dynamic world and high living expenses .
S . Banthin  , Cunningham and M . Bernard(2008) said that "financial burdens of health care have increased to the point at which private insurance is no longer able to provide financial protection for an increasing number of families ."
Elderly would suffer more financial hardship if limit the public spending on them especially for those who are single , less educated , less savings or neglected by their own children .
Homelessness , hunger and higher proportion of unmet health care needs could happen on them .
The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has introduced with their "State of Aging and Health in America"(Year 2007) report with the statistics "88% of those over 65 years of age have at least one chronic health condition" .
It is quite a shocking statistics for elderly diseases .
Aged people may be unable to seek  medical assistance when they suffer from sickness such as heart attack , high blood pressure and etc .
They need to work in order to support themselves .
The elderly who collect old newspaper and soft drink cans along the street can be seen frequently .
Peterson (2001) suggests that  people should be encouraged to plan for their  old age  by saving and investing part of their income earned in their young working life .
For example , Singapore's main retirement's scheme , the Central Provident Fund system , is one of the way of funded retirement saving .
However , high living and medical expenses could make them have not enough funds to support themselves in their old age .
In addition , some of the elderly may spend all their savings for their children education but in vain because they are neglected by their children .
It could be unethical that developing the country in other areas but neglecting the aged .
Elderly has contributed themselves to the society in the past few decades .
It would be considered irresponsible to eliminate their contribution to the society while they are active in the work force .
In the other hand , there are many more important areas to develop in an country include investment , education , basic infrastructure , political issues and so on .
Aged are not the main workforces in furthering the country development .
Peterson (2001) argued than an aging population could bring negative impact to a country include shrinking workforce , long-term stagnation and decline in real GDP .
However , a country should be established based on moral ethics .
The aged should not deprive from public spending due to a lack of social and economic power .
Since most of the young will be old someday , today's children will in time receive the benefits granted to today's elderly , as long as current commitments remain in place .
aging issues are complex and inevitable but not insurmountable .
Flexibility in implementing policies should be maintained when facing unpredictable challenges in the future .
As Friedland and Summer (2005) said , "Reducing the share of public support is merely leaves the individuals and their families responsible for larger proportion and some of the costs are shifting back to the public sector through other means .
"Therefore , wise policy planning in diverting the public spending to all areas of the country's development is more effective instead of limiting the public spending on the aged .
The populations of many countries are rapidly ageing as a result of declining fertility and increasing longevity .
The group of 60 years or over is expected almost to triple , increasing from 673 million in 2005 and 2 billion by 2050 and the share of the elderly is also predicted to rise from 64 percent to nearly 80 percent in 2050 especially in developing countries (Reilly 2007) .
As the aging problems are getting serious nowadays , it should not be  neglected by the society but to face the problem that the elderly may suffer financial hardships in their golden age after they have retired .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to help the elderly to overcome the difficulties by providing various financial supports .
The elderly will face financial hardship and an excess of stress in their lives if they have no sufficient money to survive in high price era .
Financial hardship will affect the elderly living condition such as housing condition and food security as the elderly reported that their apartments were always cold in winter and they suffered malnutrition and insufficient food due to financial difficulties .
On the other hand a huge amount of stress which may cause high blood pressure , heart disease and cancer will affect both their emotional and physical health and reduces their ability to live to the full .
However , critics of this point out that most of the elderly may not face any real financial hardship as they should have CPF savings which is sufficient for their old age needs .
In fact , it is very hard to be ensured that the money saved by the elderly for the future needs will definitely be sufficient as there are lot of large unexpected expenditure such as medical fees .
Besides that , if the public spending on the aged is limited it may drastically increase the burden of future generations as they have to undertake so many responsibilities with  limited income .
The burden of responsibility of taking care of their aged parents , taking care of their children , rising cost of living and at the same time worrying about job security makes the future generations live so stressful every day in life in competitive society .
Although stress is so common and has become a part of modern life , but when their lives are full of frustrations and demands , both their body and mind pay the price .
Another argument against this statement is there is not a single doubt in society that filial piety is a value which future generations are taken for granted to uphold and they should undertake their responsibilities to take care of their old parents by financial support .
In contrast , no one would escape from the basic responsibility of taking care of their beloved family if health and financial state permit and public spending play an important role here in order to solve the problem effectively .
The elderly participate and contribute themselves in social development using their professional knowledge , skill , and experience in the types of work which they can engage in within their capacity when they were young .
The elderly have made a valuable contribution to society as they have supported economic activities as consumers , have acted actively as volunteer , have provided financial help for their children and grandchildren .
In the other words , they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness and also receive practical support in the form of money when they face difficulties in their old age but not a burden to society .
For example in Europe , Europeans strongly acknowledge the contribution of the elderly to society and the vast majority of Europeans have a generally positive image of older people and only 14% of them consider the elderly as a burden to society (Brussels , 2009) .
At this point , one may wonder it is true that the elderly contribute all the enthusiasm and time in society when they are working , but they have already received salaries as their rewards and they are supposed to plan and for their old age lives instead of depending on public support .
However , their spirit of creating a better world for future generations cannot be measured by money and unfortunately if they suffer financial hardship we should help them genuinely as they are our pioneers of  the country's  development .
Aging population  has become the topic for a lot of discussion .
"As early as 1979 , the Institute for Research on Public Policy issued a report which spoke of population aging as an increasingly difficult political problem and a continuing drain upon public resource ."
(Edgar , 1997 , page 4) .
Thus , the old are now commonly assumed as "a burden to society" .
This essay also wants to argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted in other areas of the country's development because there are strategies that government can supplement to reduce that burden , and the money invested to other areas could be a big support to society .
First of all , do  the aged as a real "social problem" ?
It is clear that the concepts considering the aged as "social problem" are frequently based on "people's attitudes , perceptions , and assumptions than on actual facts" .
(Egdar , 1997 , page 10) .
The aged will not be viewed as a "social problem" once it is believed that most of the aged are independent  .
However , as in the recession period , old people have difficulty in supporting  their own living expenses , which results in social spending for the aged .
Thus , people often claim that age dependency has become an actual crisis of the society , and government has taken action  to decrease their social welfare expenditure during period of fiscal constraint .
According to "A graying world" (Peterson , 2001 , para 3 .
) , there are basic strategies , which policy makers and governments can consider implementing to lessen the burdens of older generations to the younger .
These strategies prove that instead of spending much money on supporting the aged , the government can seek for another alternatives to reduce the burden .
The most considerable strategy is that stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow's grown children to support their own elderly parents through informal and family channelno full-stop (Peterson , 2001 , para .
full-stop after the parenthesis Originating  from Asian cultures , family obligation is the most precious thing , which characterizes the parents-children relationship .
Parents have brought their children up , and in return the children will have the responsibilities to take care of parents when they get old .
It continues for the next generation , who are their little kids .
It is the culture of family-oriented and gratitude for their parents' giving birth and a settled position to them .
Filial responsibilities might be understood in many ways , such as obligation to help elderly parents , or to keep in close contact with them , or to live near them , etc .
Societies in which the extended family is weak and high long-term care costs such as the United States should learn from Asian countries , where most elderly people still live with their adult children .
Diverting money to other areas of the country's development does not mean government will take less responsibility to this social problem .
In contrast , it should be thought as one way to help reduce the burden of aging population .
By investing to other areas such as technology , economics , service , health care , etc .
society can developed dramatically , which is in return , contributing back to lessen the burdensome of the country's development .
Hence , elder dependency could be reduced when the elder can support themselves for their own daily expense .
For instance , in Singapore , young working people who are dynamic , active , creative can take a role as main contributors to the country's budget , while the elder can work in food court or any service jobs .
That is a good classification of  labour in the society that take good advantage of the scarce labor force .
Moreover , by doing so , the elderly can earn for their living , have a savings for future need on health care , and have less dependency on their younger generation .
In conclusion , this essay shows a favorable view of social spending on the aged should be limited , and money can be diverted to other areas of the development of the country .
Although it is a controversial issue to talk about aging population and its burden to the society , this essay indicates alternatives the government can do besides spending too much on the aged to adapt to the challenge for the future , which is "to ensure that people everywhere will be enabled to age with security and dignity and continue to participate in their societies as citizens with full rights" .
(Population Division - United Nations , 2001 , Conclusion page 34)
Countries with a fast aging population now are confronted with problems like a shrinking productivity and a heavy financial burden to support the welfare program for the elderly .
Fortunately , the good news is that to a large extent , current research and development (R&D) , and government policies have taken action to help ease the aging process .
Before going into further investigation , it is important to bear this in mind that aging process is not as simple as longevity , but associated with one's ability to contribute to the society and participate in various social activities .
To narrow down the topic , this essay is mainly to test current R&D , as well as government policies in China dealing with the aging process .
Opponents may say current clinical R&D causes an increase in longevity , which substantially raises the average age of the population .
This is true , but as mentioned , aging process does not simply mean longevity .
Clinical R&D continuously introduce people to healthier living styles , bring in more efficacious , safer and cheaper medical treatments , which allows people to look young and stay healthy so that they are still able to work actively in middle or even old age .
Furthermore , Chinese government pursues the policy of fundamental medical insurance system for urban residents .
The system gives out subsidies to refund people's medical expenditure , aiming to improve health standard .
According to official statistics , the prevalence rate of the elderly people above the age of 65 has steadily decline from 60 .2% in 1994 to 48 .4% in 2009 .
Thanks to the clinical R&D and government policies , more and more elderly are able to keep healthy , so that they can continuously contribute to the society and also participate in social activities .
In this manner , the aging process is eased .
Most people agree that the 21st century is a period when everything changes in an unprecedented high-speed .
Along with the development of technology , it's often questioned that the knowledge an elderly has is out-of-date , and may no longer be suitable in today's workplace .
To cope with it , the  government has made and implemented several policies like building  colleges of continuing education for the aged .
More and more skill competitions are conducted , aiming to motivating the elderly to reacquire new knowledge , as well as reforming social attitudes towards the elderly .
Recognizing the needs from continuing education , current educational R&D in China have designed and published special textbooks and guidelines to facilitate continuing education of the elderly .
Furthermore , some elderly advisory committees have been established in schools , communities , corporate , and government .
The various advisory committees stand out as a platform for the elderly to share their rich experience , which sometimes is quite precious to the young generation .
To sum up , the working barrier of the elderly has been lower and they have found different ways to enrich their lives and contribute to society .
One child policy is often a debatable topic .
It's widely acknowledged that aging population is mainly due to the low fertility rate .
Hence some criticize the one-child policy intensify the aging process in China .
However , some unique characteristics of Chinese society should be taken in to consideration .
China has the largest population in the world .
The census of the population in 2008 shown the fertility rate was positive 5 .2 , or 8 million per year .
In other words , the population kept growing in a large number , which was different with those countries with low or even negative fertility rates like Australia , and some other European countries .
By controlling the size of population , one child policy indirectly shifts the governmental funds from the young to the elderly , so that the government has more flexible budget to help the elderly .
In this manner , the one-child policy helps to ease the aging process as well .
As societies continue to develop , the problem of aging seems to be inevitable .
Issues such as high elderly dependency ratio , shrinking workforce and increasing healthcare problems , which resulted from an aging population , are apparent in many countries  .
In response to the aging process , policy makers have introduced sophisticated policies to ease the situation .
However , they are also aware that devising a policy to eliminate this trend is close to impossible in the short run as the two main sources of the aging problem--- higher live expectancy and lower birth rate (United Nation , 2002)--- are unable to be affected by any policy .
Fortunately , much can be done as current research and development/policies have shown hope of easing the aging process by dealing with the consequences directly , instead  of the sources .
One of the problems arising from an aging population is the increase in the elderly dependency ratio .
The growth of elderly dependency ratio signifies a state where an escalating numbers of beneficiaries of health and pension funds are sustained by a relatively smaller number of contributors (United Nation , 2002) .
By  requiring citizens to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency , policy makers were able to ease the above mentioned situation .
Some  countries such as Australia , Britain , Chile and Singapore have gained much through encouraging their citizens and establishing means of law to convince citizens to save and invest a portion of their income earned , while they are still in the workforce (Peterson , 2001) .
Unfortunately , a fraction of citizens still feels that the government should not intervene with the way they spend or save their income .
After all they believe that they have every right to the money they earned .
However they need to understand that compulsory saving and investment are comparatively safer and more reliable than other market options .
Furthermore , not many individuals have the discipline to maintain a healthy bank balance given the materialistic world of today .
Thus , compulsory saving can help guarantee a sizable amount of saving for their future and is a practical and effective way to ensure old age dependency is being kept to the minimum .
A shrinking workforce is another problem arising from an aging population .
The human resources of many developed countries are predicted to shrink as a hefty portion of the workforce is edging towards retirement .
The resulting situation is an increased amount of stress falling onto the shoulders of the remaining working adults as they struggled to provide for their older counterpart .
In an attempt to ease the shrinking workforce , governments are attempting to utilize all available resources to the fullest .
For example , retirement age is often being raise to encourage elder workers to retire later and to accumulate more wealth to support themselves when they eventually retire (Peterson , 2001) .
The solution inevitably invited criticism as many found themselves being victims of ageism , a situation where younger workers are preferred over retaining or hiring the older ones .
However , the situation is improving for some countries such as Singapore .
Over the years more and more elderly are being retained or employed as a result of increased median of education among the elderly and higher live expectancy (Singapore Department of Statistics , 2009) .
This gives much hope to the elderly  as they are still employable and the problem of dependency on the shrinking workforce can be lessened .
Another major issue caused by the aging population is the increasing healthcare problem associated with the elderly .
Governments all around the world has to make provision for improved healthcare as the live expectancies of their citizens and medical technologies are improving by the years .
Adding on to the misery , the cost associated with healthcare is also growing with the combined effect of a rising standard of living and the high cost of advanced medical development .
Fortunately , policies are introduced to minimize such unavoidable cost associated with aging .
For example in Singapore , a compulsory saving program is put in place to allow elderly to save in advance during their working years and set aside money for healthcare in the future (Singapore Ministry of Health , 2007) .
Such a policy can give security to the elderly if they find themselves trapped in the high cost of healthcare .
Aging population is a social problem that cannot be solved over a short span of time .
It is a world-wide phenomenon that has no quick-fix solution  and it is quite clear that every country will eventually reach the same stage as societies continue to develop .
Clearly , many problems associating with aging still persist and will be apparent in developing societies .
But with the help of current research and developmentand policies  , many socio economical problems can be avoided or minimized .
"The speed of aging is crucial to understand because it is during the period of the fastest change when adjustments will be the most difficult ," said Warren Sanderson (2008) , Professor and Co-Chairman of the Department of Economics , Stony Brook University .
In fact , leaders and policymakers ,  particularly from the developed countries have proactively implemented a series of researches and policies in an effort to confront this unprecedented phenomenon .
In this context , current development has gradually helped to ease the aging process .
Aging-related problem is no longer an imminent issue that concerns a particular region but is  disquieted and discussed in every country all over the world .
For instance , Germany is currently facing an acute problem of aging in Europe and this prompted the government to generate flexible jobs for the elderly and discourage early retirement by cutting the pension entitlement by 3 .6 percent for each year spent in retirement before the age of 65 .
In a nutshell , current development on policy reforms and researches has been carried out simultaneously over the past decades to help cope with both societal and physical impact of the aging issue .
Healthcare issue has to be taken into consideration because the elderly are prone to suffer from  chronic diseases as they grow older .
As a result , government has begun providing adequate medical incentives and healthcare insurance coverage to cater for the elderly .
Furthermore , advances in healthcare quality can be attributed to new medical technologies and diagnostic tools .
For example , since the mid 90's , the common usage of wire mesh stents for treatment of artery blockages are partly  .
However , spending more on new medical devices does not always equate to better health conditions .
In addition , increased spending on new medical technologies may restrict society's ability to expand healthcare coverage to more elderly people .
Nonetheless , if the spending on healthcare is limited , the burden will fall increasingly on low-income individuals as well as their families .
Yet , policy makers and healthcare systems must seek a moderate measurement and use the best information available to evaluate cost-effectiveness and assess the economic returns of new treatments .
It is imperative for public and private sectors to optimize health status by offering preventive healthcare services across the population within a given level of outlay .
The elderly are encouraged to work longer and contribute to the growth of economy , thereby reducing elder dependency of fiscal cost .
Later retirement not only secures a better pension entitlement for the future , but also provide a direct mean of allowing people to  supplement their income in later life; and thus helping them to maintain their standard of living during retirement .
Singapore , for example , has an official retirement age of 62 , but employers are now required to offer re-employment for an additional three years .
Therefore , providing opportunities for prolonged working age can essentially alleviate labor shortages and help bolster personal retirement savings .
However , older workers are usually less productive than imported foreign talents  , though employers may compromise on a small portion of existing aged employees .
If employers have the flexibility to hire older employees on a part-time basis ,  , they will be much less reluctant to hire and retain older workers .
Alternatively , the government should encourage employment of the elderly by offering privileges and incentives to private sectors .
On top of that , policies that create economic security for the elderly and remove barriers faced by them should always be a priority in  .
Governments and policymakers have largely undertaken to build a basic , nationwide infrastructure  which  .
Current development in communities has created convenience to meet the needs of the elderly , such as barrier-free facilities , security systems , housing , transportation , and so on .
These physical community's assets help to provide elderly a good quality of life and  in the long run .
, governments aim to get all the elderly in communities fully engaged in social activities and involved  in lifelong learning .
Yet , some elderly are still facing the problem of being left out or discriminated because of their old age .
Societies are responsible for upholding values such as filial piety  , to encourage people to look after their elderly parents . .
In  other words , it is the responsibility of the public to protect elderly rights .
In order to ease the current predicament , governments have to emphasize on the distribution of their budgets or  reallocate funds to reduce the cost of public spending .
This will compel agencies to change the way they service , especially to the elderly .
On the other hand , it is plausible to reward families for having children and encourage more young people to work .
The drastic rise in numbers among the elderly will force policymakers and governments to anticipate the resultant demand for healthcare and a host of related infrastructural needs .
The future elderly will be more professional and better educated than the current cohorts in many countries .
It means that they are likely to be more effective and decisive in possessing their gains and evaluating on costly or sophisticated services .
Thus , decision-makers must carry on fashioning programs to further ease the aging process  without getting them locked into policies and approaches that may not be suitable for the changing composition of tomorrow's elderly .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Nowadays almost every developed country is concerned about the issue of a growing aging population because this issue is a barrier for a country's development .
Aging population is the result of an increase in the life expectancy rate over several centuries and the trend continues to increase because of advancements in medication .
According to the report of United Nations Population Division: "Worldwide , there are currently more than 600million people over age 60 .
By the year 2050 , this number will increase to almost 2billion , which would be roughly 20percent of the world population at that time .
And By 2050 , there will be more people over age 60 than there will be under age 15; that is a dramatic change" .
However , from mid-1971 to mid-2006 , those aged under 16 fell from 26% to 19% .
This is the result of effective family planning programs throughout these decades .
There is  a decrease in the ratio of working people to those over age 65 .
Therefore , governments are reviewing their budget plans and developing policies in order to overcome with these crucial challenges .
But this does not mean that to overcome these challenges , excessive spending should be done by the government .
As it takes years for the country to overcome  this problem ,  spending on the aged should be limited .
So , there should be limited public spending on the aged group so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country , which will give better returns in near future .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas ,  such as education , which is far more important than the aging issue in today's world .
Government should be more focused on education than  spending on the aged as spending more on education will probably increase the living standard and the  of a country .
Indeed no country can move forward without  education .
Due to the aging population , there is a shrinking workforce; and so the government should spend more on education , so that it will increase the productivity of the workforce .
So , governments should review their budgets according to the amount spent on education .
Spending on education will give better returns to a country in near future because education is a major factor for the country's economic growth , whereas  spending on the aged is just the opposite .
Spending on the aged is inversely proportional to economic growth .
For a country , spending in education is seen as injecting money into an economy , whereas spending on the aged is considered as  introducing a leakage into the economy .
So for the country's development , there should be more injections than  leakages .
In a country , money should be diverted on other areas like defenseand  infrastructure ; and thus , public spending on the aged should be limited in order to get better returns  .
A country's opportunity cost for spending in defense and infrastructure is probably more  than the spending on the aged  because spending in infrastructure generates revenue for a country , such as attracting foreign investments and tourism .
Spending  on defense gives a sense of security to a nation , whereas spending on the aged is just an expenditure for a country; and for a country to pay its expenditures it should have sufficient amount of revenues .
Spending on  infrastructure and defense will enhance the country's economic growth  , the living standards of the people and the overall the image of a country .
Though spending on the aged  could also improves the living standard and the image of a country , it would  be less effective , as compared to the spending in infrastructure and defense .
It is less effective because the benefits do not exceed the cost .
Therefore spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be spend to other areas of the country's development .
Since  the past several decades ,  there has been an increase in the life expectancy rate .
This has probably caused the aging problem , and so there should be  sufficient increase in the spending on the aged .
This will eventually improve the living standard of the aged  and thus  contribute to the country's development .
There should be an increase in  public spending on the aged because of consistent increase in  inflation rate throughout the past several years .
should not be limited or fixed but should be proportionate to the increase in  inflation and life expectancy rate .
On the other hand , the increase in public spending may cause dependency , which means that the aged  will then totally rely on the workforce and the government for their needs and thus would be exploiting the economy rather than contributing to it .
Overall ,  it depends on the country's situation and the budget to determine whether it should limit its spending on aged  .
For a country to develop , it has to overcome with these crucial challenges of aging population , and therefore an appropriate strategy would be needed .
This could be  to spend more on education and infrastructure which will generate sufficient revenue in the future and then it can be spent on the aged .
There should be limiting spending on the aged so by that the aged population will work to fulfill their needs .
This  will strengthen the workforce of the country , and  so by limited spending on the aged one will be able to contribute to the country's development .
R&D and  ;  .
Beattie  states that there are already policies in place for people to support themselves in their old age , such as the pension systems , provident funds , social insurance and saving schemes .
Due to unpredictable economic growths ,  policy purchasers yearn for better benefits  .
This is evident in the context of Asia .
According to Ghilarducci  and the Employee Benefits Research Institute , people are stressed by the changing economic growth and anxious  .
In Singapore , the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF Board) is a saving scheme that covers  working Singaporeans with a list of welfare benefits and offers a sense of security for their old age .
Also , the CPF Board reminds Singaporeans to save and stretch every dollar whenever possible so as to  have  comfortable lives after retirement in the future .
From the highlights of Channel NewsAsia [2009] , there are many countries with a  .
Some of these countries include Japan and Singapore , with the rate of the elderly population increasing rapidly and surpassing the younger population in the near future .
In view of this demographic , countries like Japan and Singapore have been establishing ways to curb the aging population .
In Japan , the government has  a policy of offering incentives to families with small children so as to increase birth rates and build up a new family .
In Singapore , there is the reemployment legislation in 2012 where employers are advised to retain the elderly as the demand for their skills are needed .
In the meantime , Singaporeans are told to save early with the easy access of financial schemes and saving programs offered .
In addition , the technological invention segment has played a part in easing the aging process .
As Schoeni , Freedman and Martin  suggests , the R&D segment has been expanding rapidly .
With the the advancement of medical technologies , illnesses such as cardiovascular and cataract diseases have lesser occurrence .
Medical technologies are still advancing and treatments are being catered to a wide array of medical fields .
Some of which include the knee and joint replacements , treatments for arthritis and rheumatism , and vision impairment , diabetic and stem cell research .
However , the presence of R&D does come with a hefty price tag .
Medical expenses are costly and patients , especially , the elderly need to seek for welfare assistance when necessary .
Sadly , for the elderly who do not seek medical attention , they either suffer bitterly or are possibly cared for by organizations like Peace Connect Neighborhood Link in Singapore .
Countries like the United States and Singapore are insured with Medicare and Medishield respectively .
We are insured despite  the high medical expenses  of new inventions in the medical fields .
, an advance health security cycle as we reach our retirement age  .
Moreover , with the growing number of well-educated people around , there is a high probability that people will purchase private insurance to care for their own well-being .
Manpower is essential in every organization .
From Malul  findings , the elderly are counted as part of the workforce   .
However , with technology so advanced these days , the elderly in the workface may be faced with hiccups as they are not well skilled in certain aspects of the technology .
This is when the training and re-training of employees is crucial .
Furthermore , organizations offering subsidies to the elderly workforce helps to minimize unemployment rates and high turnovers .
At the same time , this allows the elderly to stay active for a longer period of time in the workforce .
specified that  .
Majority of these elderly are  baby boomers who yearned to extend their duration in the workforce .
By lowering the retirement age , an organization could seek for cheaper employment in a less developed country  .
However , it may face a high turnover rate as the younger generations do not  stay long in  jobs  , unlike the elderly .
Therefore , to have a mixture of young and old workers , a firm could have  , while training the younger generation of workers in advanced skills that are necessary for an organization to excel  .
This will enable the organization to be more efficient . .
, the policies that each country provides and the current R&D have assisted and benefited the aging process in today's society .
Since early days and especially in Asia , longevity has always been believed as a blessing .

Sectors such as economy need immediate attention with its current situation and education which may need improvement with these fast revolving technologies .

D . Harman (1981) defines the aging process as  progressive changes in terms of the social , psychological and physical  over time  .
These changes are linked with increasing vulnerability to death or disease . . Today , most  Asian countries like Japan and Singapore are experiencing "population aging" , as defined to be an increase in the number of oldsters in the society (Wikipedia) .
This essay refers "oldsters" as people who are 55 years old and above .
The aging population has many problems such as over-dependency on the younger generation ,  as well as the increase in  national budget on health care .
Besides that , Teo et al (2004) suggested that another problem is  gerontological issues , such as the responses of society towards them .
These problems are significantly critical and they attract the attention of governments and policy makers .
Therefore ,  current developments , researches and policies are implemented to ease the aging process , and  they are highly effective .
Increasing the retirement age that has been implemented by the Singapore government helps in easing the ageing process .
By increasing the age , the oldsters who are below the retirement age of 62 , are able to enjoy  under the retirement age act .
It is stated in the act that says "employee who is unfairly dismissed can sue the employer under the common law and write to Ministry of Manpower (MOM) within a month to reinstate his job ."
(EnterpriseOne , 2006) Most importantly , the oldsters are able to earn their own monthly living expenses , which will reduce the burden on their children .
In addition ,  encourages the oldsters to be more active and to contribute to the society .
Some oldsters are  experienced in their fields of work  .
Thus , they contribute to  society by staying at their work place to teach the younger generations their skills .
However , the jobs offered to the oldsters are very limited and they are not able to take up any jobs due to their low educational level and lack of capabilities .
Due to the government's policy of bringing in foreign talents , the job vacancies for the elderly are limited as the foreigners may have occupied most of them .
The Singapore government has made contribution of salary to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) as a regulation  compelled by law , and this helps in easing the aging process .
The contribution rate is 20 percent and 14 .5 percent of the employee salary from the employee and employer respectively .
This contribution will therefore be credited into 3 accounts , namely ordinary account , special account and Medisave account .
The contribution rate from employee and employer reduces as the age of employee increases while the crediting to Medisave account increases (CPF , 1955) .
The rates are increased because the elderly are more prone to illnesses .
This scheme allows the oldsters to be more independent as they have their own savings , particularly savings for their medical bills , and helps in reducing the national budget on healthcare .
It helps the elderly ,  and also  encourages the youngsters to plan financially for their old age .
This eases the aging process very effectively .
However , it is only effective when the individual starts working at a younger age . .
The Workfare scheme has been implemented recently to cater to the aging process , especially for the elderly who are less educated and this results in their low income status .
It is also known as the Workfare Income Suppplement Scheme (CPF , 1955) .
This scheme is specially implemented for middle and old age people .
This scheme encourages the elderly to work even though their pay is low .
In addition , it promotes the concept of active lifestyle for the elderly by involving them in the workforce .
This scheme might solve the gerontological issue .
If the oldsters are working , the youngsters would not view them as useless people as they are contributing to the society as well as economically to the country .
On the other hand , this scheme is not  in easing the aging process because the net payout (cash) is low .
Since it is a complement to the CPF contribution scheme , there is an obligation to contribute about 71 percent of the total workfare payout to CPF (CPF , 1955) .
Particularly , this scheme is only applicable to those who have worked for 3 months and above .
in addition , the payout is only carried out once in every 6 months .
Hence , the net payout is relatively useless due to the high living expenses in Singapore .
In conclusion , the Singapore government has implemented policies and development that are relatively effective in easing the aging process .
However , there are still some areas that required their attention such as the 2 sub-groups , namely the older single womenand the elderly who have never saved during their younger days .
In terms of all the policies and developments mentioned above , especially  the workfare scheme , the government should increase the net payout amount (cash) and reduce the percentage contributing to the CPF .
As for the increasing retirement age , the government should encourage more voluntary organizations  For the CPF contribution , the government might set up a regulation that requires individuals who reach a certain age to start working and contributing to their CPF .
This policy might come in handy in future .
In many developed countries , the aging population is rising and Singapore is no exception .
The first batch of baby boomers (babies who are born between 1947 and 1964) will reach the age of 65 in the year 2012 (Committee of Aging , 2006) .
By 2030 , the number of elderly will reach 18 .7% ,  which means for every 5 residents , there will be a senior among them (Singapore Department of Statistics , 2005) .
Thus , the government has come out with policies and has invested in research and development to help ease the aging process .
Policies like raising the retirement age and baby bonus scheme are introduced .
Health care system has been improved through research and development to create a better living environment for the elderly .
As Singapore's living standard is getting higher and higher as the years go by , there is a need for people to save more money for their old age .
Thus , by increasing the retirement age , people are able to work longer and in return , they are able to accumulate more wealth , which  will enable them to be more independent financially .
In addition ,  elderly people who have acquired the essential skills , knowledge and experience in their respective work fields will be able to continue workingand  impart their skills to the new working generation  .
The elderly will be able to share their valuable experience with them so that they will not follow the mistake that the seniors have made during their working lives .
However , some people feel that by increasing the retirement age , there will be lesser job opportunities for the younger generation .
This is not true as countries like Japan and the US are now encouraging elderly entrepreneurs and that will eventually create more jobs for them .
The aging of Singapore population is also due to the fertility decline in the beginning of 1970s when  government had come out with policies to discourage people from having more children .
This campaign proved to be so successful that resulted in a 0% growth in population by 1986 .
However , the government soon realized that the Singapore population was not reproducing itself and so it reversed its population planning policy by introducing the "Baby Scheme" to encourage a higher birth rate .
Under the "Baby Scheme" , couples will be given  cash gifts for their firstchild and up to their fourth child .
For the second till the fourth child who are born after 17 August 2008 , a Child Development Account (CDA) will be opened for the family to enjoy the government contributions  .
The government will match the savings of every child dollar-for-dollar , up to the age of six years old .
This serves to help couples to lighten their financial burden for raising their children .
As the financial cost of raising children is one of the important factor for couple to decide whether they want to have children  , birth rate may increase if the financial cost was reduced . .
If the fertility rate continues to drop , there will  not be enough young people to replace the older generation .
This will lead to the shrinking of workforce , which  will affect the economic growth of Singapore .
In the recent years , Singapore health care institutions have tried to improve their existing methods and introduce innovative applications into the healthcare system .
There are technologies to enable the elderly to look younger .
This will enhance their self esteem   , and thus they will be able to participate more actively in social activities and they will not feel left out .
In addition , a better health care system will allow the people to stay healthier and prevent some major illnesses such as stroke and heart attack .
The elderly need not worry too much about their health .
But , what they have to do as a personal responsibility is to go for regular check-ups and have a healthy diet .
In conclusion , a fast aging population is a critical issue in Singapore .
It has to be tackled through a holistic approach which needs the involvement of the government , community agencies and private sectors .
Many policies have been implemented and research and development have been improved in the last several  , though more remained  to be done .
With all the efforts put in by the public , the government and the people , Singapore will continue to strive for the status of being a  .
"Our society must make it right and possible for old people not to fear the young or be deserted by them , for the test of a civilization is the way that it cares for its helpless members ."
(Buck , 1999) .
In Singapore , the focus on ageing issues is not new .
Since the 1980s , the government has taken an active role in caring for its helpless members (Ministry of Communication Development , Youth and Sports [MYCS] , 2001) .
Policies were introduced , implementedand refined with the goal of minimizing the impact of  problems associated with an ageing population .
How effective are these policies ?
This essay argues that by and large , the government's recent efforts in research and intervention have not been  useful  in alleviating the problems of old age in Singapore .
Firstly ,  current government policies are not easing the ageing process because they are limited to a specified group of the aged population .
The current policies in place are definitely planned to benefit a large portion of the target group .
However , it must be recognized that these polices have their limitations and they have left out a significant portion of the aged in the lurch .
For example , the Central Provident Fund Scheme (CPF) .
is only applicable and beneficial to the sector of people who had , or are having employment (Ministry of Manpower [MOM] , 2007) .
The CPF scheme is broken down into three portions , namely the Ordinary account , the Special account and the Medisave account (MOM , 2007) .
Thus , people who do not have any employment will not have any money  for their retirement and healthcare .
Also , the Parents Maintenance Act is only relevant to the elderly who have children (Attorney-General's Chamber of Singapore [ACG] , 1996) .
As a result , those without children will  fall outside this umbrella  .
On the other hand , critics might argue that policies are never able to shield the entire spectrum of its target audience .
However , it must be noted that new policies must then be formulated to benefit those who are less fortunate .
For example , the government could topup the Medisave accounts of the less fortunate elder Singaporeans when there are budgetary surpluses to ensure that seniors have the capacity to afford healthcare services (MYCS , 2001)
In addition  , the current government policies are ineffective in  the ageing process .
Some of the policies that are implemented are simply not effective because they are not fully exploited by the elderly population in Singapore .
For example , the government has increased the retirement age to 63 years old (MOM , 2007) .
This move is ineffective because it does not ensure that the elderly will work till they reached the retirement age .
Also , some elderly is unable to maximize their work years due to medical problems or  choice .
In Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's speech on the 8 January 2009 , he cited that only six out of ten men are still working by the age of 62(Prime Minister's Office [PMO] , 2009) .
Thus , the policy has  minimal effect and does not address the root problem .
In addition , the Government's plan to ensure that all public spaces in housing estates such as parks and sporting venues have facilities that cater to the whole family including seniors (MYCS , 2001) , is not practical because it has not considered the fact that the average elderly in Singapore is either not interested in sports or are unable to play sports due to chronic ailments (Suriah , Chong , Yeoh , 2008) .
Nevertheless , opponents might argue that the plans are effective as long as the government can reach out and educate the elders on the available policies .
However , 67% of the elderly in Singapore is illiterate and is only proficient in non-Mandarin dialects (Suriah , Chong , Yeoh , 2008) .
Hence , the government must first attempt to inform the elderly in Singapore about the available avenues and encourage them to reap the benefits of the current policies , so as to maximize the effectiveness of its policies .
Finally , the current policies have not helped to ease the ageing process because they are not holistic .
The government has not developed sufficient programmes to cater to the psychological needs of the aged .
In some recent efforts , the government pumped in $88 million to build a mentally resilient society of which its results that can only be realized in five years (Ministry of Health [MOH] , 2007) .
In comparison , the average American considers the notion of "old" to be effective only when they reach the age of 65 years old .
However , in Singapore , the word "old" is tossed around freely in conversations of people aged above 60 , who are also known as the senior citizens of Singapore .
The reason why the Americans classify "oldness" to be above 65 years old is due to the fact that they strongly believe that they still can contribute to society after retirement and thus they continue to embark on meaningful roles .
On the other side of the coin , opponents will argue that the government cannot be responsible for every aspect of the issue .
However , we should recognize that the Singapore Government has a strong influence on its people and thus should create leverage on this strength .
Hence , the Singapore Government should invest more in programmes to cater to the mental aspect of the elderly so that the elderly can proceed to commit themselves to important and useful roles in society after retirement .
In conclusion , the current government policies are confined , ineffectual and incomprehensive .
Since the problems that tagged along with an ageing population is imminent , much more should have been done by the Singapore Government to wrestle with the difficulties associated with the ageing process .
If more effective policies are formulated and implemented , they will indirectly lower the burden imposed on the younger population and society as a whole .
Only then , Singapore will be a successful "civilization" .
In 2009 , the median age of Singaporeans was 36 years .
By 2050 , the same figure is expected to increase to 54 years (Lee , 2009) , as a result of lower birth fertility and higher life expectancies .
The predicament of an aging population plagues not only Singapore , but also different countries , ranging from the richer and developed nations , such as Japan and Italy , to the relatively poorer and developing nations like China ( , 2009) , especially as a result of the one-child policy .
While the issues of an aging population are relevant and dynamic , it must be noted that countries at different stages of development will place emphasis on different developmental goals and adapt policies that caters to the needs of the nation .
This paper , henceforth , aims to discuss the impact of resources allocation in the context of developed nations , countries with stable economic basis and decent standards in the various aspects pertaining to a nation's progress , such as infrastructures and amenities .
Therefore , there is no heavy emphasis on developing the economic , educational and political systems .
Some may point to the fact that providing for the aged drains a nation of its resources and reduces resources for future generations , but the whole idea is fundamentally flawed .
As a fellow human being , compassion for others necessitates to care for them .
As the younger generation , ethics bound to provide for them .
As a country progressing towards a gracious society and thus development , rationality leads towards addressing these aging issues .
With that said , it is important to address the need of an aging population and not be overly concerned with the fiscal costs of an aging population .
(Friedland and Summer , 2005)
Furthermore , the younger generation has to fulfil a moral obligation towards the older generation , and capping public spending limits their abilities to do so .
It is important to sufficiently provide for the older generation , for they were the ones who toiled and contributed to shape the progress of the nation today .
Therefore , it is only ethical that their efforts are reciprocated .
One exemplary example is the samsui women .
They were the ones who had toiled in the sun to build the infrastructure during Singapore's early developing days .
They are older single women who are uneducated and were not able to save , that the government should especially provide help for .
(Friedland and Summer , 2005) It would be simply inhumane to cast them aside and overlook the fact that they have been vital in the developmental process .
Moreover , inadequate policies will lead to political and social instabilities for moral and ethical issues so , by not setting a limit on public spending on the aged , it indirectly helps to sustain and even improve  the social cohesiveness and development in this aspect .
Limiting public spending will instead create unintended costs , such as unhappiness amongst people .
Otherwise , like Friedland & Summer (2005) mentioned , cutting back on public spending on welfare programmes has an impact on local families and communities .
The world's population is continually growing , not just in term of size but also in the sense that it is growing older .
( , 2008) .
Therefore , there is a rising importance to deal with the issues related to the aging population .
In evaluating the policies to undertake , it is necessary to consider the net impact of using public funds to deal with aging population , as well as the consequences if the issues relating to aging population are not adequately dealt with .
Public spending on the aged should therefore not be limited as investing time and resources to solving aging population eliminates any unnecessary social costs and contributes to the development of the society as a whole , promoting cohesiveness and progress towards a gracious society .
Nowadays aging of population has become a global problem , especially in developed countries .
In terms of the Population Division of the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs , the number of population over 60 years is expected to triple in 2050 and at the same time , the rate of the elderly in developing countries is predicted to increase from 64 percent to almost 80 percent in 2050 (Reilly , 2007) .
To ease the aging process , many countries' public spending will rise steadily as a share of GDP , leaving these countries in a  great financial burden (Joumard , 2004) .
In this case , only focusing on public spending does not seem to be the best way to solve the aging problem .
Instead , the government should limit the public spending on the aged so that more money can be invested to other areas of the country's development .
Expanding the economy is a more effective strategy to ease the aging process compared to simply giving out public pension to the elderly .
For those countries with aging process , the biggest problem they have to face is the number of labors who  (A Touch of Gray , 2002) .
And at the same time , World Bank economists estimated that for developed countries , public pension , which is only one term of the public spending on the aging problem , will increase from 9 percent of GDP in 1990 to 16 percent in 2040 (Shaw , 2002) .
Consequently , the government may not be able to provide enough pension and health care to help improve the old citizens' life as a result of lack of finance .
In this case , countries should invest more on the economy development or other areas to increase the financial ability so that old people can benefit more from the economic growth .
Without restriction on  public spending on the elderly , the usage of the money may lose its effectiveness and may lead to further labor shortage , worsening the dilemma of aging process .
Now  encourages the United Kingdom to simplify the pension system and they argue that nowadays the pension system in UK may have negative effects on incentives for people to work and save () .
This problem not only happens in the UK .
People tend to lose motivation to work or save once they have enough pension to spend .
For example , it is reported that many older workers in US withdraw from the labor market before they reach the State pension age () .
Moreover , too much pension may even lead to pension abuse which will make the public spending ineffective .
Despite  the above two reasons , some people still argue that the public should help the elderly as much as possible since they have once contributed to the society .
But the problem is limiting  the public spending does not mean cutting off the spending .
This limitation is based on the fact that enough public spending has been put in to guarantee the basic life standard for the elderly , such as age pension and health care .
Under such circumstances , the government should make a more effective spending scheme to solve the aging problem rather than not have any plan or restriction .
To sum up , it is necessary for the government to limit the spending on the elderly so that the economy of the country can be developed more quickly and the effectiveness of the public pensions can be increased .
Limitation does not equal to cutting off but will lead to further development and better solutions for the aging problem .
The whole world is facing the aging population problem that is the result of rising in life expectancy together with decline in fertility .
Every country has its own strategies to deal with the problem but none of them has a radical solution .
Public spending on the aged should be limited and the government should use the money to invest in the young and other areas of the countries' development .
There are many fields that need money such as educationand  .
In the long run the young generation should support the aged instead of the government .
Firstly , spending too much money on the aged will not bring much return profit .
In an aging population , the elderly count for a high percent in the workforce , so increase in the budget for them seems to be rational but in the long term , it will make the aging process more serious .
Most elderly stopped working or will stop working in the next few years , so bumping money into them is just a short-term investment .
Moreover , the elderly usually demand higher salary in exchange for their experience but they cannot work as hard as when they were young , whereas the young lack experience and find difficulty in seeking jobs .
According to Gastroenterologic Surgery: Encyclopedia of Surgery , the elderly account for approximately 60% of health care expenditures .
However , with the continuous development of technologies and treatments , the government will not be able to pay in full the health care cost for the aged .
Public spending on the elderly should be limited and individuals should pay for their health care cost within their capacities; so young people will strive to save for their own lives , which will improve the economics and reduce the elderly dependency on the government .
Spending money on the aged should be limited and children should carry the burden of looking after their parents .
The aged have to work and save for their lives instead of waiting for the government .
This will utilize their contribution .
Most elderly face mental problems when they retire , because they receive money from their saving plan or government and simply do not know what to do , they tend to use up all the money after several years .
Another problem is that most elderly in developed countries live alone; they do not want to ask for money from the children , which means that they will not receive sufficient financial and mental support from their children .
The Government should stress the important role of filial obligation because it not only reduces the burden of elder dependency but also gives the elderly indirectly benefit through investing in their children .
Moreover , this will create cycles .
Parents support their children and vice versa , which is better than giving out money to help the aged and at the same time giving out money to develop the young .
We should limit the spending money on the aged to develop other areas such as education .
Education is the basis to the development of a country .
With advanced education , we can develop new technologies for higher productivity and lower cost , which helps the young generation fill the gap of low workforce caused by the aging population and take up the burden of caring for the aged .
The government should also invest in the infrastructures , which has the long-term effect on the development of the economics; but we should use money wisely and not bump blindly into new projects .
The young generation is the key point to stop the aging process .
Some countries such as Germanyand Netherland have successfully given a rise to birth rate .
They offer financial aid and tuition grant for every child , so that parents are relieved the burden of raising children .
Admitting immigrants is also a strategy that many countries such as Singapore are applying to attract talented people; which costs far less in comparison to training high quality workers .
There are many areas in the economy that need capital other than the aged .
Aging population is a global problem .
Public spending on the aged should be limited .
The aged may suffer but we cannot spend all  the money on the elderly , especially when it will not bring  long-term benefits .
There are many areas in the economy that need capital other than the aged such as education , infrastructure and so on .
It is time for the elderly to take care of themselves more , which could be accomplished by the support of their children .
"Population aging is likely to become a dominant feature of social change around the world .
This poses a number of serious challenges that range from the social security of the elderly to increasing needs for health care , changing consumer behavior , and possibly changes in productivity ," says Wolfgang Lutz , leader of the World Population Program of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASAM .
Allen , 2006 .
In this modern world where decisions are made based on most available technology and rational choices , the negative impact of aging process has been eased and negated .
There are many current researches done to help the issue of aging process , be it in the field of economics , medicine , social policy and much more .
For example , there are many drug companies or hospitals that are now better equipped to help overcome old aged problems such as arthritis , dementia and many other illnesses .
Yet , there are those who believe that sometimes research to develop new and better medicine sometimes adds on to the burden of the aging process .
The Prime Minister of Singapore , Mr . Lee H .L .
() said in a rally , "We see medical science advancing; we see new technologies , new drugs , new procedures .
People can live longer , but it costs more ."
When companies develop new medicine and healthcare products , they would tend to price it more expensive to recoup as much money as fast as possible .
Large proportions of the elderly are unemployed and they may not be able to cope  with the rising medical costs .
Also , the elderly are more susceptible to illnesses and are usually required to take more drugs .
Hence , having so many new drugs and medicine  could confuse  them or  these drugs have not been properly tested out yet .
These result in health issues for the elderly .
Still , having advanced research and expertise in the field of medicine has led to increased lifespan of people .
The elderly are more heartened to know that many problems they face can be solved , such as having blood pressure drugs that is able to decrease the risk of strokes and heart problems .
In a research done by the Imperial College London() , "The results showed that within a year of treatment , there was a 21% reduction in death rates and a 64% drop in heart failure , 39% drop in stroke deaths and 34% reduction in cardiovascular events ."
A lead researcher C . Bulpitt() said , "Our results clearly show that many patients aged 80 and over could benefit greatly from treatment ."
Hence it can be seen that the current research and development of medicine is indeed very beneficial but it is necessary that we best solve the issues arising from having better medicine and medical facilities , which brings us to the next point , government and social policy .
Governments usually have great sway over the general population of their respective countries .
Hence policies  can bring about a lot of good or a lot of problems .
In the case of the aging population , there are many policies up to date , such as pension system in the USA , CPF schemes in Singapore , various employment schemes , medical schemes and more .
However , for the government to be able to affect so many policies such as providing free healthcare or pensions , funds are required .
In the USA , lawmakers led by Senator { are talking about slapping a $495 tax on some of those covered by the medical plan to help pay for extending coverage to some of the 46 million Americans who lack itR .J .
Donmoyer , 2009) .
Most of these funds come in the form of taxation as seen , which places heavier burden on the working population .
Furthermore , polices such as pension may give rise to dependency and complacency .
It is often heard that some elderly abuse the pension by gambling or turn to other vices since the money is free .
As stated in an essay in honor of J .C . Weldon , "the total utility may not be maximized because the old 'spend larger and larger sums on smaller and smaller enjoyments' or impose 'posthumous restraint on bequeathed wealth which will make it less useful to the living'(  1990) .
However , this portion of people is generally small and furthermore , by providing pensions and healthcare benefits , it gives the aged a sense of security and they are hence better taken care of .
By providing and having more policies that have focus groups helping the elderly would also solve the problem of the aged being neglected , such as encouraging and supporting voluntary welfare organizations through 'Many Helping Hands' Approach in Singapore .
In Singapore , Prime Minister Lee H .L .
() says , "Our social security system is based primarily on individual savings and self-reliance .
Our policy is to help each person to build up his assets and savings , so that he or she will be ready for old age ."
There are also many countries that encourage individual responsibility such as Japan .
A fine example of being self reliant would be the CPF scheme in Singapore , whereby a portion of one's salary is made as a compulsory saving .
Hence , once people retire , they would be able to draw on this savings and hence are ensured that they will have a form of stable income even when they are unemployed .
There would thus be few problems of starving and dying elderly or homeless elderly , as they would have money to back them up .
There are also many active lifestyle movements that encourage the elderly to keep fit and keep in touch with the latest technologies in the world .
The elderly would hence feel more in touch with society and likewise , the younger generation would not look upon the elderly as a burden .
Such various government polices provides the aged with economic solutions , social solutions , healthcare solutions to the problems that they may face  hence easing the growing problems faced by an aging population .
Also , there is more focus on the importance of family ties and bonds .
"Strong family ties are the cornerstone of social cohesion .
Strong family ties bind families together and families shape individuals - their character , their instincts , and their values .
Strong families help build a connected community which is integral in nation building ."
(Children are encouraged to take care of their parents when they are old through various publicity and schemes , such as the case in Singapore , whereby people are given housing grants for choosing to stay near their parents and also providing tax relief for individuals taking care of their parents .
It is also by law in Singapore that children have to support their parents if the parents could not support themselves financially .
Such schemes and laws would protect the elderly from mistreatment from their family members .
Family members in return are more inclined to care for the aged themselves .
The elderly would hence feel happier and joyful and not feel left out and demoralized , easing the problems that they face .
However , since this only applies to the elderly with families , the general public and governments will still need to set up voluntary organizations to interact with the aged in homes or community centers .
In conclusion , through the various available health polices , government policies , social policies and technological advancements , the elderly now are able to lead a better more comfortable and  fulfilling life .
Despite the systems and policies being imperfect , it has definitely brought about benefits to both the aged and general public as a whole .
Yet , by further improving current technology and policies , the aging problem might eventually be resolved .
Ageing process in humans refers to a multidimensional process of physical , psychological , and social change  , 2009) .
Due to this process , countries with aging population are facing problems like economic growth and inadequate protection for the elderly .
Japan and Europe are two examples that have done well in tackling this issue .
In the years to come , more and more countries will be facing problems  from aging process .
Hence solutions are very  .
Thisessay will evaluate  the current measures undertaken  by various countries .
Firstly , elderly employment is a policy that was implement by some countries .
Steen Langebaek , president of AGE , an organization which aims to promote the interest of older people across Europe , believes that older people should be encouraged to study and work beyond retirement , whether through part-time work or on a voluntary basis ( , 2002) .
It means the elderly are welcome to continue serving in the workforce provided they are willing themselves .
This may eventually benefit both the individual and the company; elderly receive additional income from their work , whereas companies gain from the work produced by the experienced elderly .
Hence older people are an enormous neglected resource that should not be forgotten , they should play an active role in society .
In European countries , work organization and social security arrangement are flexible in providing options for combined work with retirement .
The combination of the two factors created more vacancy and elderly who volunteer to work .
Therefore , this measure had been very successful , especially in the Netherlands with 49% of elderly either working full or part time ( , 2008) .
Also , Silver job fairs , established to find jobs for people 60 and older , have mushroomed across South Korea in the past year as part of the government'sgovernment's effort to assist a rapidly growing population of older Koreans adrift in a changing society ( , 2009) .
From the above examples in different continents , it is inevitable to conclude that elderly employment is one of the policies that has been well adopted by various governments .
Secondly , science and technology have eased aging in various ways .
Japan had started to develop robots meant for the elderly .
"With Japan's aging population , we need robots that can alleviate the burden of human tasks ," says Toshihiko Morita , director of Fujitsu's Autonomous System Laboratory ( , 2006) .
This "mental commitment robot" is designed to provide comfort and companionship to elderly who are lonely or shut in .
With the introduction of robots , elderly have a better protection as well as reliance .
It is especially true for the single elderly who do not have any children to take care of them at home .
In addition , drugs have also been developed to slow aging .
Currently , the drug that helps to reduce aging is being tested and will be released into the market soon .
"It may be the ultimate free lunch on how to reap all the advantages of a calorically restricted diet , including freedom from disease and an extended healthy life span , without eating one fewer calorie .
Just take a drug that tricks the body into thinking it's on such a diet ."
( , 2009) .
This useful drug will ultimately increase life span , hence increasing the productivity of the workforce as people could retire at an older age because of this drug .
Thirdly , governments from various countries have provided retirement pension , medical scheme and policies to cure the aging population .
Singapore has implemented the retirement pension known as the  Central Provident Fund that allow elderly to fund for their retirement right from the start of their working life .
This policy has been effective as the compulsory contribution to the fund will be allocated to both medical account and general account , which does not only ensure stability but also healthcare stability .
The government could also save the budget on state pension at the same time .
In addition , the Housing Development Board of Singapore has introduced studio apartments that are catered for the elderly .
The forty square meter apartments include facilities like lifts on every floor , hand railings and alarm systems that are specially designed for the elderly .
The government has also promised to build more studio apartments in the upcoming projects .
( 2006) .
Overall , the governments have done well  to ease the aging process to a large extent with the above policies .
In conclusion , countries have used various means to ensure a better aging process for the elderly .
This will be further improved as the country is developing in other aspects like technology , education and economy .
However more attention should also be paid as the speed of aging population may exceed the speed of solving curbing aging policies .
Excessive government expenditure on the aged will impede the economic growth of China .
China's public expenditure for public health is rising at a high pace .
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (2006) , the spending for public health has been increasing at about 10% annually from 2000 to 2006 .
This is faster than the economic growth rate of China , which is about 8% (NBSC , 2009) .
A large portion of the public health expenditure actually goes to the aged .
The expenditure on elderly people is slowing down the economic growth .
Furthermore , the negative impacts of these policies will be more significant in China as its economic base is not so strong compared to developed countries such as the U .S and Japan .
Those who oppose cutting government expenditure on elderly argue that limited spending will cause social instability as many families with low income will suffer when the elderly generation needs medical support .
However , economic growth affects the nation's long-term well-being .
The money should be used more wisely .
For instance , Japan's economy situation shows us the consequences of abusing of the government budget on public health spending .
Japan is well known for its ageing problems with 22 .1% of the populations above 65 ( , 2008) .
The Japanese government has to spend a lot on the public health .
As a result , Japan has experienced a slow economic growth over the last 20 years .
Therefore , for China , being a country which is much less developed than Japan , to limit the spending on the aged will be a  wiser decision .
It will be burdensome to China's next generation , especially the tax payers , if the expenditures on medical and welfare programs are not held in check .
The extra burden of the medical and welfare programs expenses falls on the next generation .
The tax payers have to finance the medical expenses of their own parents and at the same time , pay for other elderly people's medical bills .
The negative impacts will be even worse in China due to its one-child policy since the 1970s .
In the near future , a couple has to support four parents .
If the government raises tax to finance the expenses on the aged , the younger generation would even face difficulties making a living .
Some sociologists argue that if the expenditure on public health is to be limited , the younger generation has to pay more .
The expenditure just shifts from public expenditure to private expenditure .
While it may sound true , someone in the society has to sacrifice in order to solve the current ageing problem .
If we continue increasing this expenditure and ignore the negative impact it has on the economy , Japan's present will be China's future .
Thus , it is reasonable for the Chinese government to limit the spending on the aged in order to improve the long-term well being of its citizens .
Last but not least , China's public spending should be limited because there are other sectors of  China's economy which need the money more imperatively .
China is still a developing country today and more of the government's budget should go to the sectors which are able to generate more wealth .
In 2008 , the total expenditure for public wealth in China was RMB 984 billion , which is about 3 .3% of the total GDP ( 2008) .
A portion of the money should be diverted into the sectors which are more important in the long run such as education and  According to the National Bureau of Statistics , the expenditure of the government on education last year was RMB 901 billion and on  was even lowerat RMB 213 billion ( , 2008) .
China has to be fully industrialized first before spending its money on the old .
Otherwise the problem will be accumulated .
Hence , a restriction of the expenditure on the elderly people should be implemented .
Growing old is now easier as compared to the last decade with more developments and policies put in place by the government .
Previously , the aging was a tough process having to deal with the many problems faced .
However , with the introduction of policies pertaining to three major problems faced by the elderly , namely economic , inadequate living conditions for the elderly and health issues , the changes have become easier to manage .
The elderly should be encouraged to return to the work force and adopt a later retirement age .
By doing so , it can partially relieve the society of the increasing financial burden of an aging population .
However , for this initiative to work , they have to first address the issue of their skills obsolescence .
Nowadays , with the rapid change in technology , the current skills sets that the elderly possess are mostly obsolete .
Hence , skills upgrade and training programs like those offered by Workforce Development Agency should reach out to more elderly and make it easier for them to upgrade themselves to reduce their barriers to entry into the workforce .
When the elderly returning to the workforce they will be able to accumulate more wealth and save more so that they will be able to be self sufficient when they are older .
Besides , returning to the workforce means that they will continue to contribute taxes , thus helping to reduce the burden on the society .
As they continue to work , they will maintain their Central Provident Fund (CPF) account which acts as a social security savings plan for them in the future .
The CPF account prevents the elderly from depleting their savings and allows them to be financially independent even when they finally stop working .
Therefore , it is essential to provide skills upgrading programs for the elderly and by doing so it will reduce their barriers to enter the workforce  and reduce the impact of aging on the economy .
The government is aware of the challenges faced by the aging population due to inadequate facilities and living conditions and has influenced the changes in the environment so as to make life easier for the elderly .
This is evident in the way the new Housing Development Board flats are built , especially the one room flats that are meant for the elderly .
For example , they are customized to contain various elderly friendly features such as the alarm system that automatically requests for help through a pull of a lever in case of an emergency .
Besides , features such as the building of lifts leading to every storey and the residence corners for the elderly to interact are also implemented .
In addition , to the housing conditions , ease of transport usage have also been give focus and have tremendously improved .
With the public transport system such as buses and trains installed with more seats dedicated to the elderly and customised for the ease of boarding and alighting especially for the wheel chair bounded .
Furthermore , road signs are displayed in 4 major languages to resolve the problem that there are some old folks who are unable to understand other language besides their mother tongue .
Although this much have been done to improve the living conditions of the elderly , the full benefits cannot be reaped if the plans are not widespread enough .
For example , not all apartment flats are equipped with a lift that serves every storey and not all buses are designed for the ease of boarding for the elderly .
Therefore , despite the fact that the changes are indeed useful , there is still a major pitfall here which is if the implementation is not island-wide , the full benefits cannot be realised .
The improving medical care and subsidies help the aging population cope with health problems which are inherent in old age .
According to the Ministry of Health , government subsidies for the elderly are provided based on the assessment of the patient's total family income and can go up to 75% of the total fees .
With this subsidy ,  more elderly will be able to  medical care as compared to before .
Furthermore , with the constantly improving technology in the medical field , many medical procedures have been simplified from surgery that requires hospitalisation to an outpatient procedure .
To quote an example , just 10 years ago , cataract surgery required a hospital stay of several days .
Now , the surgery can sometimes be done in less than 30 minutes as an outpatient basis .
With the improvement , not only the cost of hospitalisation is eliminated , many previously complicated surgeries have also become simplified as a result .
Nevertheless , these measures are only methods which make it more affordable and easier to seek treatment but it does not solve the problem .
The elderly have to be convinced to adopt a healthy and balanced lifestyle .
Therefore , besides providing subsidies , they have to be more proactive in reaching out to the elderly who are not likely to seek out information on staying healthy .
With the measures such as better economic situation for the elderly by encouraging later retirement , improving the housing and transport conditions and better health care for the elderly have tremendously changed the way aging takes place .
While it is inevitable to avoid the aging process , with such measures in place , it will make  growing old much easier than before .
With the overly successful "Stop at Two" campaign to curb the overpopulation in the 1960's , Singapore has since faced an ageing population as birth rate dipped tremendously .
Coupled with high-quality healthcare , life expectancy has also increased .
These result in a decline of the proportion of economically productive people .
In 2008 , Singapore was reportedly one of the Asian economies to be worst hit by an ageing population (UBS , 2008) .
Our long-term economic growth is estimated to be cut by 3 percent , while support for the elderly could cost the country more than 7 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP) .
With such a bleak outlook of our economy , our nation should be spending more wisely .
by entrusting the responsibility of taking care of the elders to everyone in  society , public spending on the elderly could and should then be limited .
Firstly , grown children should take care of their elderly parents .
By stressing on filial obligations and their duty to the aged , we can reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency .
However , the higher cost of living today makes such obligations quite impossible .
With a high average inflation rate of 5 .83% globally (Goldman Sachs , 2008) , it is very difficult for grown children to support both their family and their parents .
Even so , it should not be an excuse as it actually does not take much to support the aged financially .
Young adults need to make an effort to save .
Especially in Asian societies , such as Singapore , older people are traditionally supported by their own families .
So , the grown children should continue with such tradition .
Nonetheless , in view of this dying tradition , the Maintenance of Parents Act is in place to tackle such issues .
Parents above sixty , who cannot support themselves , can approach the tribunal for an order to claim maintenance from their children , delegating responsibility to the children .
Hence , with children supporting their parents , the government could save on the extra national budget .
Secondly , there are policies made to help the aged remain self reliant after retirement such as the mandatory saving scheme known as Central Provident Fund (CPF) .
Nonetheless , the policies may not benefit all the aged .
For example , the CPF is not beneficial to the self employed unless they made an effort to deposit money into their CPF account .
Hence , the government has made several , not just one , policies .
For example , the lack of land in Singapore makes housing a valuable asset for Singaporeans .
To ensure all Singaporeans own their homes , the government gives generous subsidies for public housing .
As the nation prospers , these homes will appreciate in value , and Singaporeans may draw on this egg nest when they are old .
With such policies , the aged are ensured that they would have enough assets to remain self reliant and not be dependent on the government .
Hence , the government will then be able to divert spending towards  national growth .
Lastly , an ageing population places pressure on the entire nation and everyone should play a part to take care of the aged .
Retirement age is to be pushed back to 65 by 2012 .
The best way to be all right in old age is to have enough savings by working longer (PM Lee Hsien Loong , 2009) .
Hence , companies can contribute by employing them .
Nonetheless , many elders lack skills .
Yet , they are more expensive to employ .
However , it must not be overlooked that these elders are experienced and could contribute in a different way .
Employers could also offer other kinds of employment , it does not necessarily have to be the same job or pay as of their previous employment .
The government has also several programs to retrain older workers and upgrade their skills , ultimately , increasing their employability .
With jobs , the elders could then be self reliant .
Hence , spending on the aged population could then be limited .
The elderly population needs a huge amount of money for healthcare expenses .
Many elderly has deteriorated health with common illnesses like diabetes , eye cataracts , boneelder friendlyems , and heart problems .
These problems need continuous attention and therefore incur repetitive and expensive expenditures .
There is also a neto build elderly friendly environment like railings , lifts that goes to every floor of the buildings , and slopes .
In addition , there will be a need to have domestic helpers or day-care-centers to take care of the elderly when there is nobody else to look after them .
These can incur huge government expenses which can slow down the economy .
The elderly should be educated about the aging population , because the economy may be sevehaveydeterioratingif they are no longer able to support themselves financially .
Being financially responsible , the elderly should save up as much money as possible while they were young so that they can pay for their daily expenses .
In this manner , the working populatioenvironments more funds left over to stimulate economic growth , or even pay for trampswn retirement .
There will be an adverse impact on the economy if government spending on the aged is not limited .
Due to the a largeof raising taxes to provide for the elderly , local consumptions of goods may reduce significantly and foreign investors will consider relocating their investments .
If consumption of goods reduces significantly , there will be low credit flow in the economy , which will result in sluggish economic growth .
Also , when foreign investors relocate their investments , jobs will also be relocated to other geographic places , this result in fewer jobs for the population .
Even though limiting expenses on the aging population may sound irresponsible , doing this can be a way to help to cope with the problem .
Limiting expenses on the aging population will mean that the government will have more funds to utilize to attract foreign investors to the country .
They can also utilize these funds to improve public facilities to attract tourism; tourism is one of the economic activities that can generate extra income to the country .
People will also become more affluent to spend and stimulate the economic growwill result a result of economic growth , the government will be more able to pay for the retired elderly .
This will then become a snowballing effect causing further improvements in the economy .
besides  global warming  , an aging population is  another phenomenon that  is of concern to the world today , one that has no definite solution This aging phenomenon is most evident in developed countries like Japan , Germany and Singapore where fertility rates are low .
The growing number of the elderly  around the world has certainly created a huge iimpact which in turn has caused changes to the structure of current society .
Faced with this situation , governments and policy makers around the world have been providing solutions such as the introduction of economic policies , social policies , and architectural designs which benefit both the elderly and  society .
One of the main solutions to be offered is the economic policy that eases the financial situation of the elderly .
Some countries provide incentives to the elderly for their daily and long term needs .
One of the evident examples would be the health care subsidy which has been carried out by many developed countries such as Singapore , Japan , and the U .S . Others may object that too much is being spent on the elderly and this will hinder the growth of the country which is fundamentally more essential .
However , this argument may not be valid because the elderly are considered as an integral part of a country and cannot be totally excluded .
With the right economic plan and policies , the elderly can effectively contribute back to the growth of the country .
As mentioned by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee  , "aging should be redefined as an opportunity rather than burden to the society" .
Life-long employability would be one possible answer to this problem , as the elderly can be less dependent on state funding and , at the same time , contribute back to the growth of the country .
Furthermore , other than contributing to the country , the elderly parents are also an important part of the family as they possess invaluable knowledge and experience which can guide the younger generation .
(The Journal 2009)
As the aging population to some extent has had a negative impact on society , social policies play an important role in reducing the effect which could otherwise cause social disintegration within a country .
One important example would be the  Parents Maintenance Act of Singapore , which governs specifically the social relationship between parents and children .
One may argue that the social policy is not needed as it has already been perceived in the society itself .
However , the current economic situation and the decreasing fertility rate have left  young adults , who have no siblings to share costs with , no choice but to give up on their parents .
Furthermore , we should also consider the fact that society is changing over time and so does the social and cultural value of our traditions .
Particularly in Singapore , as a multiracial country , where many different cultures converge , the traditional Asian value of filial piety will continuously fade off .
Thus , social policy plays an important part to maintain this relationship and also to reiterate the importance of filial piety in the minds of the young adults .
As people get older , they tend to be more dependent on others in their daily activities .
This dependency may hinder the activity of the people around them which may otherwise be productive  .
With this in mind , countries have begun to provide elder friendly architectural design to assist elderly in their daily activities  .
For instance , in Singapore , more housing and transportation modes are designed to provide elder friendly designs such as: rubber flooring , alarm systems and supporting hand rails .
With the implementation of elder friendly designs , the elderly will be able demonstrate some level of independence .
Reduced dependency of the elderly would also result in better allocation of the country's resources , as young adults would be able to concentrate on their career and social organizations would be able to direct their attention to the more needy ones .
In conclusion , the problems of an aging population are likely to continue or even worsen over the coming years .
Including economic , social and architectural aspects of society , there are many other implementations that can be done to ease the aging issues .
With the success of these implementations , I believe the world can shift the paradigm of the aging phenomenon to have a sustainable positive impact .
Yes , I agree that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
In Singapore , the government and society have come up with various policies and strategies to assist the aging population .
For example , there are some organizations that help the elderly with their daily necessities; the government is planning on making a more elder friendly environment and having an Active Aging Festival .
One might object  that the government and society have not really done much for them .
For instance , there are still many who are living alone with no children to care for them .
This group of elderly usually live in small apartments with little contact with the outside world and they fall sick easily .
It is also quite inconvenient for them to move about , thus they prefer to stay at home and watch television , rest and not do anything much .
They just watch life pass by .
There were even cases of elderly dying at home without anybody knowing it .
Many are of the view that the government is neglecting the older generation .
There is a lack in government policies and regulation in ensuring that the elderly are well taken care of .
Another program by the government is the 'Enable Ageing-in-Place' plan to make places more accessible for the elderly .
This plan focuses on how elderly can travel safer and easier in public area using public transport .
We can see that some buses are now made with a platform accessible for people who are on wheelchairs; Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations with lifts and fare gates which allow them to travel just like many other commuters; Older HDB flats being upgraded to lifts that stops at each level and car parking areas now comes with wheelchair bounded slots .
These are just examples of the many strategies that the government has come up with to ease the aging process in Singapore .
Two years ago , the Active Aging Festival  was launched to encourage senior citizens to be more active in their lives Instead of living in the past , they are encouraged to pursue their dream and work towards their future .
The festival has been initiated by Council for Third Age (C3A) .
Its focus is on the six dimensions of wellness which an elderly will most likely be lacking in .
They are social , emotional , intellectual , physical , vocational and spiritual .
This festival consists of three main events , the Active Ageing Carnival , Grandparents' Day and Active Agers Award .
The idea here is to allow family members from young children to adult to get involved together with their elderly in the festival .
It turns out to be  fun and exciting for the elderly .
This promotes bonding among different generations .
In having this festival , the government allows the elderly to enjoy their aging life together with their family members .
An aging population is one of the issues that faces Singapore today . .
The Singapore Department of Statistics (Singstat) states in its Population Trend 2008 report that senior citizens aged 65 years and above make up  8 .5% of the population and that , it will continue to rise .
Having an aging population is a challenge and there is a need for public spending to assist the aged throughout their aging process .
However , the amount of public spending on the aged should nonetheless be limited so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Critics of this position point out that it is only right for the government to spend on the aged to recognize their contributions made to the country's economy .
However , doing so and not limiting the public spending on them would have dire consequences on Singapore itself .
Firstly , the national budget will come under pressure .
Having an aging population means that there will be lesser people in the workforce and this will have an impact on the country's economy  .
Further if public spending on the aged is not limited despite the decrease in the size of the workforce , the country's economy will be negatively affected .
In addition , the public money comes from taxing the workforce .
If public spending is not limited , this would mean that the workforce may be further taxed to provide sufficient funds for the aged .
Not only would this pressurize the workforce , it would also cause them to spend less as they have lesser discretionary income .
This action will ultimately affect the country's economy .
Thus , it is necessary to limit public spending on the aged due to the negative consequences that would arise from doing  otherwise .
One may argue that the high cost of living justifies the need for public spending on the aged .
However , measures have been taken by the government beforehand to help the aged ease their aging process .
One measure , linked through the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , is the CPF Life .
There may be a portion of the senior citizens who find it difficult to cope with the cost of living after retirement as they no longer have an income to support them .
Thus , in order to meet their needs , the government has came up with the CPF Life designed such that the elders will be able to receive a continuous steady stream of income base on their CPF contributions made during their working life .
Another measure that the government had taken was to include a Medisave account in the CPF Savings .
The money in the Medisave account was formed by a percentage of their income and could be used for hospitalization expenses .
As the senior citizens are more prone to health sickness , having this Medisave account would greatly benefit them .
Thus , public spending on the aged could and should be limited as the government had came up with several approaches to help deal with the aging process .
An aging population should not be the only issue that is given most attention to , as there are other areas of the country's development that would require  public money .
For instance , the government should spend part of the national budget in trying to increase the fertility rate .
Singstat mentions that despite the slight increase in fertility rate , the fertility rate is still considered low .
Having a low fertility rate would impact Singapore in the long run .
The government could probably use the national budget to provide incentives to encourage Singaporeans to do their part in increasing the fertility rate .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas of the country's development that would require the national budget .
In conclusion , though there should be public spending on the aged , it should nevertheless be limited .
This is because of the consequences related to doing  otherwise such as pressurizing the national budget as well as the workforce  .
In addition , the government has already done its part in preparing its citizens for old age through the CPF Life and Medisave Account .
Furthermore , there are other areas of development that would require the national budget .
I agree to a large extent that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The aging process means that as time passes ,  people will undergo a process of physical , psychological and social change .
In order to help the society and its people to cope with the changes , current research and development such as new technological inventions and employment schemes are being put in place .
Firstly , in many countries which have traffic lights at road conjunctions , the scenario of an elderly rushing to cross the traffic light is common because the elderly tends to have a slower pace in walking .
This is a concern for an aging population as there could be some danger posed in crossing the roads when the traffic light has turned red .
To minimize the risk of elderly fatalities , the Singapore Land Transport Authority (LTA) has invented an Elderly-Friendly Traffic System .
The system uses the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to identify any elderly pedestrians who want to cross the road , then extend the 'green man' timing , allowing the elderly to make their way across the roads safely .
It may be objected that if an elderly person took too much time crossing the road , it may cause traffic congestion on the road .
However , a countdown timer has been installed beside the 'green man' to signal to the pedestrians that the traffic light is turning to 'red man' .
Thus , the system is put in place for elderly to cross safely with a reasonable amount of time .
This example shows that the problems which will occur from an aging population have been well-thought through and measures have been put in place . .
Secondly ,  , mobile phones are used commonly and most  people around the world have at least one mobile phone .
With a large demand for mobile phones , phone companies have to compete with each other by inventing fanciful mobile phones with many functions such as Internet , games , music player and more .
However , with the shift to an aging population , the purpose of possessing a mobile phone changes .
The demand would be for its original functionality of maintaining contact and for emergencies .
Furthermore , as people get older , their vision will become poorer and responsiveness might be slower than before .
Thus , phone companies must take this opportunity to penetrate the market with elderly-friendly phones .
For example , Japan's phone companies  actually offer phone models which have bigger screens and larger font sizes , enhanced audibility and easier- to-operate keys to attract the elderly .
This will satisfy the needs of the elderly for a phone .
At this point , one may wonder , even if the phones are elderly-friendly , it will not be feasible unless the elderly knows how to use the phone .
In contrast , the Japanese phone companies which offer the elderly-friendly phones also offer a free one hour session on how to use the phone .
Therefore , this shows that the phone companies are attentive to issues regarding the aging population and have taken action to help ease the problems faced by an aging population . .
One argument against the large extent of current research and development/policies that helped to ease the aging process is the availability of jobs for the elderly .
Most of the companies are likely to avoid elderly employment as the elderly are often perceived to have lack of relevant knowledge and expertise for them to work or continue to work in the company .
However , it is not true as the government has implemented several schemes to help in the employment of the elderly .
For example , in Singapore , the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) is an enhanced funding support scheme that will help both the companies and individuals to build stronger manpower capabilities and more enhanced skills .
Thus , with the encouragement and funding from the government , the companies will be more motivated to provide enhanced training for the existing employee or relevant training for the elderly to enter the company .
This will help in relieving the aging process .
Being one of the fastest aging populations in the Asian region , Singapore faces many challenges in trying to overcome this aging problem .
For the last 30 years , the young population in Singapore has shrunk tremendously .
Accounting for less than 4% of the total population back in the 1960s , today the elderly , aged 65 and above  constitute 7 .3% of the total population based on the Singapore Census of Population 2000 .
This projects a significant growth in the aging population over the years .
To accommodate  this current changing age structure , on-going development of government policies , covering areas like economics , sociology and architectural design , have been carried out aggressively through these years .
At this point , one may wonder whether the policies implemented are effectively easing the aging process .
Even though The government has implemented so many policies to help ease the aging process , some people still view this as insufficient . . From what we can see today , the trend of elderly staying all by themselves or staying in the old folks' homes has been on the rise .
Although some of the government's policies are initiated with the goal of encouraging the young to look after their aged parents , it does not seem to work out as planned .
Due to the changing beliefs and values of the younger generation in the 21th century , many of them hope to achieve freedom in their financial status , personal life and other aspects of their life and thus deem that staying with their aged parents would cause a burden to them .
The Government should try educating this younger generation on the correct mindset before exploiting the full potential of these implemented policies .
However , government initiated policies are not as inefficient after all .
One of the main causes for a growing aging population is the low fertility rate in Singapore .
In today's society , many couples choose to have fewer children due to the high living expenses and financial burden .
Due to that , Singapore is facing a serious declining fertility rate that  is resulting in a huge difference between the aged and the young .
To overcome this problem , government policy is implemented to encourage Singaporean couples to have three or more children if family finances permit .
This includes the implementation of financial incentive schemes , such as the Baby Bonus scheme , to parents who are having their second or third child .
Under this scheme , a Children Development Account (CDA) will be opened .
For parents having their second child , the government will contribute S$500 per year into the CDA account and up to another S$1000 each year to match the combinations from their parents .
For parents having their third child , the amount contributed will be doubled .
Purpose of this financial scheme is to assist parents in the payment of the development and education of their children .
Through these implemented policies , it will help facilitate the growth of the fertility rate .
To further tackle the rising trend , the Government has implemented different housing schemes so as to better allow the families to look after their aged parents rather than putting them in old folks' homes or leaving them to look after themselves .
Examples of housing schemes include the Joint Selection scheme , which helps the parents and their children in their application for separate flats but in the same block or housing estate .
Multi-Tier Family Housing scheme is another scheme which allows preferential treatment in flat application , lower-down payment and also maximum loans for those who opt for it .
The applicants can request for flats that are larger in size with enough space for two independent households .
Through this policy , it helps to create responsibility awareness of the younger generation to look after their aged parents .
Furthermore , it also enables the aged to continue living in the environment that they are familiar with .
Support services and subsidies are provided to families with aged dependents so as to assist them and at the same time , help the aged to remain physically and socially active .
Catering to the upward trend of the aging population , initiated programs such as free health check for the elderly are implemented to encourage the elderly to constantly conduct full body checkup to ensure that they are in good health  and also to advice them on the dos and don'ts in their everyday life so as to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Besides that , incentives are also beingprovided for the elderly to further motivate them in conducting health checks .
With these , it will help to ensure that the elderly are physically and mentally healthy and thus more productive in their old age .
Nowadays , governments and policy makers all around the world are facing the problem of a fast aging population .
Indeed , a lot of research and development besides policies have been implemented in order to ease the aging process especially from the aspect of medicine , economics and technological inventions .
Modern science and medicine has brought many benefits to mankind .
Disease like Parkinson's disease which is known as an incurable disease is now largely controllable due to research  done to discover the cause of this disorder .
Of all the neurodegenerative disorders , Parkinson's disease is second to Alzheimer's disease in the number of cases , with more than 1 .3 million patients suffering from it in major countries .
Parkinson's disease usually develops after the age of 65 .
Currently , research and development  Solvay Pharmaceuticals Asia is progressing well on working with the newly invented therapy of SLV308 and SLV318 to improve symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease .
With the acquisition of the Swedish company Neopharma in 2005 , they were also able to enrich their product portfolio with the Parkinson's medication Duodopa .
Duodopa is intended for people suffering from late stage Parkinson's disease , while SLV308 is for the less advanced stages .
Together the products are expected to fit well alongside each other .
If the medications are successfully improved , Parkinson's disease will be highly  controlled .
Research has also been done on other  illnesses to find out the most efficient medications .
Compared to before , the research and newly invented medicines have helped to ease certain aging processes to a certain extent .
Technological inventions should also be taken into account as they are also essential in easing the aging process .
According to Science Daily , computer scientists have designed technologies to help the elderly maintain their independence .
One device uses optical sensors to oversee people as they pick up and use items .
Another device  uses radio frequency identification technology to track which medications have been take and when .
Besides , a team of researchers from UGR has created a system with Artificial Intelligence techniques which notifies elderly people or people with special needs who forget  everyday tasks .
These technological inventions enable the elderly to live independently and with these helpful inventions , they will no longer be classified as burdens .
Moreover , the inventions of a wheelchair controlled by a magnet on the tongue will also enable some elderly people who are unable to move freely move easily , wherever and whenever they want .
These inventions have indeed helped a lot in easing the aging process .
In a nutshell , it is undeniable that in this globalization era , research , development and policies have been doing their part in easing the aging process .
With these inventions , people nowadays are leading comfortable lives and the aging process is no longer tough for both the elderly and the young  .
Hence , everyone should appreciate these innovative inventions instead of abusing them .
Globally , there is  rising concern about the rapidly aging  population , especially in the developed countries , for example , the U .S . Census Bureau projects the number of elderly Americans will nearly double to 71 million by 2030 .
Many countries are starting to pump  money into research and to introduce policies to ease the aging process as it will lead to problems like widening of the tax base and healthcare shortages .
While current research and policies have helped to ease the aging process , there are limitations to these policies that make these policies not as effective  .
The policies that the government introduced and  current research have indeed helped to buffer the aging process .
The government has introduced effective economic policies to ease the aging process .
These economic policies are important as they will help to promote economic growth for the country .
Without growth , a country will not have the financial ability to be able to provide welfare benefits and to support the needy , usually the elderly .
One of the economic policies introduced is encouraging longer working lives .
For example , the Singapore government extended the CPF Minimum Sum withdrawal age from 62 to 65 , which in turn delayed the age of retirement .
This policy is effective in the sense that it not only increases the size of the working population so that the government will not have to increase the tax base , but also helps the elderly to save up more money for their future needs after they retire .
Therefore , this economic policy helps to promote growth for the country and also helps the elderly to prepare for their old age .
Medical research is one crucial element in easing the aging process .
When dealing with an aging population , the government knows that healthcare is one major sector that they cannot neglect .
As people havea longer life expectancy  , the aging population is going to make up a quarter of the population by the year 2030 in countries like Singapore .Therefore , more people will be demanding better health care as they grow older . .
This is because as people grow older , many are bound to suffer from age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease .
Thus , the government is investing large amounts of money into medical research on age-related diseases and bringing in new medical technology .
This research and technology will be used in finding new cures for certain diseases , developing of new treatments and increasing the success rate of surgery .
For example , in the United States , there is federal funding of $1 .4 billion annually in research that is crucial to finding ways to treat and prevent Alzheimer's .
Therefore , these investments on medical research will definitely be very useful in the near future .
However , there are limitations as to how effective the research and policies will be .
The research and technologies brought in are very expensive which makes it available only for the people who can afford it and the poor , who can barely make  ends meet , will not be the beneficiaries .
Some argue that the government has given a reasonable subsidy in healthcare , especially for the poor .
In addition , in the case of Singapore ,  people can fully utilise their Medisave funds , which they have saved up from their working lives , to pay for their medical bills .
However , these are really not enough to cover the high medical bills for most people , especially those who suffer from illnesses that require long- term treatment .
For  low income earners , they may have depleted their Medisave funds after one surgery , and for  subsequent treatment , they will have to either fork out their own savings or , as is often the case , they will refuse to seek treatment , which thus aggravates their illness .
So , more efforts from the government is needed in this area so that affordable healthcare will be accessible to everyone who needs it .
Aging population is a problem that no country can escape , so what the government can do is to reduce this aging process with the help of  research and policies .
However , there are limitations in the policies , thus the government can look into alternative methods so that  people will truly benefit from these policies and research .
Withe help from voluntary welfademographicstion , there ishas causedof health care services available to help the older people in tto revisemunity .
These health care services provided are such as day care centres , senior citizens club and residential care .
However , at times theservices are not fully utilized ascare oflack of publicity and the location may not be accessible to some of the elderlthe aging populationy near the health care centres .
Therefore , mostly these health care centres are located to the places where a high proportion of older people are staying .
These services are a great support and assistance to the working age people who are taking care of the elderly while they are busy working .
Moreover , Social activities such as games , keep fit exercises and karaoke sessions are organized to engage the elderly in a healthy sociable lifestyle .
With more of these health care services around , the elderly can remain physically and socially active , and it also help to lighten the burden of the working age population .
Currently , Government is encouraging organizations and able elderly to work longer by lowering barriers of eldemployment policy .
It  ,lso mean higher cost in term of healthcare clubsfits and insurances .
In such case , companies will find them as a huge financial butheyen slong the growth of the companies .
But , on the other hand , companies do save up a lot in their training costs as these employees are these health care centres are mostly locatedtinon the recruitment costs .
By working longer , there is more time to ensure that the valuable experience and knowledare passed on to the younger members of the workforce .
Countries such as Japan and United States are also encouraging more people to work longer by extending the retirement age up to sixty-five .
In addition , with still a good medical condition and good working performance , these people can be a great asset in contributing to the economy .
Hence , encohelpsing later retirement will benefit the elderly in saving up more for their old age and the economy of the country .

There are also more upgradingf older estates to improve accessibility such as more rams and lifts .
Even public transportation is more dised and elderly friendly these days .
In addition , beautifying with modern ign and interior improvements of olis housing estates is a strategy to prevent outflow of younger people .
Therefore , the United Statesinual support from the government is important to promote children to stay with their elderly parents .
After World War II , there was a rapid increase in the birth rate across the globe and Singapore too , faces the same problem .
With an increase in the fertility rate accompanied with an increase in the life expectancy of the population , Singapore was soon faced with an overcrowded population .
In order to prevent the situation from deteriorating , the government imposed strict policies in an attempt to reduce the birth rate .
For instance , civil servants are not entitled to paid maternity leave for the third and subsequent child .
In addition , public hospitals charge increasingly higher sums for each additional birth .
This move was proven to be effective as the fertility rate in Singapore dropped from 3 .0 in 1970 to 1 .7 in 1980 .
However , by 1986 , the Singapore government became aware of the low birth rate problem within the country and hence decided to come out with the "Have Three or More , if You Can Afford It" policy .
Monetary incentives are given to both the parent and the third and subsequent child .
Nonetheless , the policy did not work due to the rising cost of living and additional responsibility for each additional child .
With improved medical facilities these days , the life expectancy of the population has increased .
With low birth rates and longer life expectancy , the aging populationhas become a long term problem for Singapore .
Knowing the difficulties in encouraging Singaporeans to have more children , the government and related organizations decided to carry out research studies and implement policies to ease the aging process in different areas such as the medical field .
In order to combat the shrinking workforce caused by the rapid ageing population and a declining fertility rate , the Health authorities must first gear up their medical field and prepare for an aging population .
Due to the fact that older patients are more prone to hospital admittances than  other age groups , providing better medical care facilities and services not only helps to reduce the chance of re-admission , it will also facilitate better chances of making a full recovery .
With less frequent visits to  hospital , the amount of money spent on medical bills would decrease .
Hence , the elderly would be able live longer with their retirement funds .
However , to develop the medical sector , huge sums of funds have to be involved which may in turn hamper the development of other sectors .
Moreover , the drugs have to be tested so as to ensure the effectiveness of the medicine and that they are safe for consumption .
On the other hand , with the rise in aging population , it is necessary to invest heavily in the medical sector as poor medical facilities will lead to more health problems within the country .
This will then result in an increase in the amount spent on medication , thus adding a greater financial burden to the shrinking workforce .
With the constant rise in the cost of living , families can no longer rely on a sole breadwinner as they need to support both their parents as well as their children in terms of food , shelter and education .
Hence , it would be a wise decision for both adults to work in order to ease the financial burden of the family .
However , by easing the financial burden of the family , it may result in neglecting their obligations to look after their parents .
Furthermore , if either of their parents contract a long term disease which requires a significant amount of care , both  adults will be in a dilemma about whether to look after their parents or to carry on with their job so as to ease the financial burden that is added  because of the medical bills .
Either decision requires one party to sacrifice , thus the Singapore government decided to offer more step-down care services which provides basic medical care to the elderly after the patient has been stabilized .
With these services , working adults can still fulfill their filial obligation as children and maintain a manageable financial burden .
In the recent rally speech by the Prime Minister Lee Lee Hsien Loong , he mentioned that "the best way to keep health care costs down is to maintain healthy lifestyles" such as going for regular checkups and exercising regularly .
To ensure that the elderly maintain a healthy lifestyle , the government has started to build elderly fitness corners around  neighborhood .
Occasionally , the neighborhood polyclinics  also provide free medical checkups for the elderly .
Then again , even though it is the health authorities who are responsible for providing  better medical care to the citizens , senior citizens also have to play a part in ensuring their own well being .
It is their responsibility to go for regular checkups and seek proper medical treatment instead of self medicating if one is not feeling well .
This would then allow them to identify the possible illness and seek proper treatment early so as to reduce the chance of it developing into a terminal disease which would then in turn reduce the amount of money spent on treatment .
Hence , even though the government and health authorities offer facilities to ease the aging effect ,  people must also take the initiative to utilize them and be more proactive in keeping a healthy lifestyle .
In a nutshell , the medical sector plays a significant role in easing the aging process by providing a high level of medical care and wellbeing to  senior citizens .
However , the elderly themselves are also responsible for their own wellbeing by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and going for regular checkups .
Thus , if the elderly are able to take advantage of the advanced medical facilities offered to them , it will certainly play a big role in helping  society to ease the aging process .
Aging  is a time induced process that causes physical , psychological and social changes . . Its impact has been widely felt in developed countries .
Longer life expectancy and a continuous fall in population have caused the aging population in Singapore to increase .
In response , Singapore has devised strategies to cushion the impact .
In view of these strategies  , it can be argued that the current research and development  policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The first policy development is in themedical field .
There is an increased demand for health care services by the aging population .
Having quality health care services at affordable prices is viewed as one of the most important needs for the aging population .
The first strategy implemented by Singapore is to have a seamless community-based health care system .
This strategy calls for having private clinics to be within a hundred metres from the home .
The polyclinics , community hospitals , long term care centres and regional hospitals should be located within two to six kilometres .
The aim is to minimize the number of hospital trips made .
It has already been carried out in the northern and western parts of Singapore .
The second strategy devised is the implementation of means- testing .
This strategy calls for graduated levels of subsidies that are based on either the patient's income or the house type .
The subsidies can be up to eighty percent of the total bill .
It is supported by reducing the subsidies of the financially well-off .
Thus , the two policies have helped to ease the aging process by cushioning the impact on the health care services .
The second policy development is in the economic field .
Three main factors have caused the total fiscal cost to be increasing at an increased rate .
Firstly , more subsidized health care treatments is being sought .
Secondly , treatment costs have increased in relation to the tremendous advancements made in medical science technologies .
Thirdly , more financial help are being sought from the government .
The first strategy implemented is the creation of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) .
The purpose is to provide a compulsory and comprehensive savings plan for Singaporeans .
In response to the changing economic landscape , several major changes have been made .
Some of the changes are the increase in the the CPF minimum sum and the partial withdrawal of  retirement savings upon reaching retirement age .
The second strategy implemented is the raise in the retirement age to sixty two years old .
The original retirement age was set at fifty five years old .
As people are living longer and healthier , there is an increased need to save up for future expenditures .
Allowing later retirement will allow wealth accumulation .
Another benefit is that valuable working experience can be retained and imparted to the inexperienced .
This will lead to a higher productivity rate .
Thus , these two policies have helped to ease the aging process by cushioning the impact on the economy .
However , critics have pointed out that it is the motivation of individuals , instead of policies , that has to ease the aging process .
Having a quality and affordable health care system will be ineffective if individuals do not take care of themselves .
Without the determination of individuals to work past their prime and increase their wealth accumulation , implementing good economic policies will also be ineffective .
However , the critics failed to pointed out that even though individuals may be unwilling to save up; the economic policies implemented have actually helped indirectly in wealth accumulation .
Unless the individuals are self-employed , part of their monthly salary will go towards CPF and special interest rates are given for the amount held .
They also have not point out that Singapore has taken basic measures to ensure the general well-being of its citizens .
For example , it is compulsory for newly-born to have the BCG vaccination against Tuberculosis .
The integration of  health care service providers through  medical policies will result in a higher quality and more affordable health care system .
As for economic policies , having the CPF and raising the retirement age allows additional wealth accumulation .
Thus , the development of these policies has helped to ease aging process to a large extent .
It is norm that ageing is often associated with illnesses such as Parkinson's and  ,and as a result , it is a concern of many .
Thus , medical breakthroughs by the University of Nottingham in  research regarding to the slowing down and preventing of Parkinson's and dementia  has definitely relieved many .
Although , some may argue that breakthroughs in  research do not severe the root of the problem as those who are ill  the diseases are still not cured .
However , one must realized that  breakthroughs can help the aged to be better prepared or even prevent contracting with  diseases .
Additionally , since there is a breakthrough , the possibility of a cure cannot be ruled out as well .
Besides , if more are able to slow down or even prevent themselves from getting the disease , the aged can lessen their medical costs which will lead to a reduced cost of living .
Therefore , medical research greatly enhances the confidence of the aged to face the eventual ageing process .
Similarly , economic policy like the Central Provident Fund(CPF) also aid in the ageing process of Singaporeans .
CPF is a saving fund employed by the government .
It enforces working adults to save a portion of their monthly salary , so that they will have a sum of money upon retirement .
Consequently , this will bring about less monetary problems when people are aged .
It is true that the policy forces a person to save but if this policy is not in place , it is likely that one will have to work beyond the age of retirement .
However , it is also not guaranteed that the saving in CPF will be sufficient , especially with the prolonged life expectancy of many .
Therefore , recently adjustments have been made to the policies to ensure that the retirees' saving can last them through their life .
In the past , a lump sum was given to the recipients , but now the recipients will get the money in their CPF account on a monthly basis till they pass on .
Another plan in CPF known as Medisave .
This helps the aged to meet health care needs and hospitalization fees , so that the aged can afford the usage of healthcare facilities .
As can be seen , the CPF policy has not only help the aged to cope with monetary issues after retirement  , making sure that their savings are sufficient for their retirement but it has also made it certain that they will be able to afford  healthcare facilities if required .
Lastly , the HDB grant policy also displays how the government helps to ease the ageing process .
The policy aims to promote filial piety while helping filial children to decrease the burden of owning a property with a $20 000 grant .
This policy not only helps to minimize the fear of not being taken care of when one is aged , it weakens the negative idea that living with parents only increases one's expenditure .
It also diminishes the worries of aged parents that their children will not have a roof over their head .
Clearly , the current research and policies have helped to ease the ageing process tremendously .
Breakthroughs in the medical research field , not only provide a cushion for the aged with regards to old age illnesses but also help to reduce their future medical expenditure .
Similarly , the CPF policy , put into operation by the government lessens the worries of ageing as medical and life expenses  are already well planned for .
Finally the HDB grant policy decreases the worries of the aged living with their children .
It is relatively hard to deny how much ageing has been made much easier .
Aging is a continuous , complex , and dynamic process .
Aging  as defined by Wikipedia is the process of physical , psychological , and social change .
Physical change means that one's health will be likely to deteriorate as one ages .
While psychological change in general refers to the change in mental abilities and behaviors .
Social change in general points to the change in attitude towards life .
The rate of aging differs from person to person .
However , everyone will have to go through it eventually .
Fortunately , advancements in technology , economic policies and social policies implemented by the government has helped to ease this process .
Although elderly individuals can realize tremendous benefits from the advancement in technology , nevertheless , technology brings with it problems too .
Some elderly individuals may feel  left behind by the pace of technological change .
In today's modern world , most information is digitalized .
Elderly individuals , who lack access and training needed to familiarize themselves with modern technology like the internet , may find themselves at a disadvantage .
This is because they will miss out on opportunities to access  the large database of information , goods and services online .
However , efforts have been made to help these elderly individuals .
For example in Singapore , the government has launched the Wireless@SG initiative to provide citizens with free internet access .
Hence , elderly individuals will also have the opportunity to use the internet .
Moreover , the government is also providing subsidies to help these elderly individuals to purchase a computer .
In addition , there will also be concentrated efforts towards educating  elderly individuals to use the internet .
Therefore , they too can also enjoy the ease of getting information , goods and services online just by a click .
The internet also provides a platform for elderly individuals to network and socialize with one another without stepping out of their house .
This is veryconvenient especially for elderly individuals who have difficulty moving around .
Apart from that , advancements in technology also brings about the inventions of new gadgets that have significantly improved the lives of  elderly individuals .
For example in Japan , a mobile phone manufacturer has come up with a mobile phone that has a large key pad so that the elderly can use it without straining their eyes .
Similarly , wheelchairs are being made automated , so that elderly individuals , who are too weak to walk , will still be able to move around freely and independently .
Economic policies implemented by the government have also helped to ease the process of aging .
For example in Singapore , the government has implemented the Central Provident Fund (CPF) LIFE scheme that will provide lifelong income for the elderly in their retirement .
Under this scheme , they can get around $360 to $440 per month upon reaching the age of 62 .
As a result , elderly individuals can enjoy their retirement without having many financial worries .
Elderly individuals are generally more prone to illnesses as their immune system may have weakened due to aging .
In addition to that , they are more likely to be plagued with old age diseases like Parkinson's or dementia .
The government foreseeing that personal medical expenses would rise as one ages , has implemented the Medisave scheme to meet elderly people's healthcare needs .
Basically , this scheme helps individuals to put aside part of their income into their Medisave account to meet their future personal medical expenses .
Therefore , they do not have to worry about medical expenses when they are old .
Besides that , the government also provides financial assistance to needy elderly individuals who do not have the means to pay their medical expenses .
Social policies have also been implemented to ease the process of aging .
For example in Singapore , the government has set up a $10million Golden Opportunities Fund to create more programmes , activities and learning opportunities for  elderly individuals .
This fund will be used to construct more elderly-friendly facilities in all sports centres and within housing estates .
Therefore , through this policy , elderly people can pursue the lifestyle of their choice , be it sports , learning , or contributing through volunteering in non-profit organizations .
In conclusion , advancements in technology , economic policies and social policies implemented by the government have helped to ease the process of aging .
Elderly individuals are able to live freely , independently and fruitfully while pursuing their choice of life after retirement .

Currently , 7% of Singapore's population is over the age of 65; however , by 2030 , this will increase to 20% (Inter-Ministerial Committee on Aging Report 1999) .
Thus ageing population is one of the challenges Singapore will face in the near future .
There has been much attention placed on this issue and its implications .
It is undeniable that there have been many policies implemented to ease the aging process .
However , the extent to which these policies help to ease the ageing process remains rather limited due to the limitations of the policies .
Firstly , the Parents Maintenance Act can now address the  concern of the increasing number of parents who are neglected and abandoned by their children . .
It may be successful in getting the children to pay the maintenance of their parents ; but by enforcing such law ,   .
The act ensures that the child or children have to support their parents since they will face serious consequences they did not .
However , it is a question of whether if they have done it willingly .
Filial piety is supposed to be a virtue to be upheld , a respect for parents and ancestors , and yet now we need a law  to make sure everyone uphold it .
Does this imply morals are being eroded in this society ? 
Furthermore , Parents Maintenance Act may not be entirely successful in getting the children to pay for their  parents' maintenance .
This is because the act is only applicable if parents made a report against their children and  if the parents were aware of such an act , as well as  ready to do that to their children .
And children can only abide by the obligations if they were financially stable .
Therefore this act is rather ineffective in solving the problems of unwanted  parents .
Other strategies in solving the ageing problem would be to increase the birth rate .
With an increased population , there will be an increase in the workforcewhich would in turn lead to an increase in income tax Thus ,  this will solve the problems of labour shortage  , as well as  the heavy financial strain placed on the economically active population .
A pronatalist policy has been implemented since the early 1990s  , and yet the effectiveness it has on birth remains questionable .
Despite much efforts have been put in by  government to shape a policy that aims at lessening the financial burden of having children , fertility rates continues to  remain low .
It could reach as low as1 ,08 , which is way below replacement rate .
The pro-natalist policy focuses mainly on  cash incentives such as baby bonuses of $3 ,00 for the first and second child , up to $6 ,000 for the third and fourth  child; as well as  the government contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar matching for the amount of savings the parents contribute to their child's Children Development Account .
However , in Singapore , the financial burden is less of a concern when we are targeting at the 'productive group' of the population .
, so when they are encouraging population growth they are targeting at the educated ones , who are also the financially stable ones .
Thus cash incentives are not a strong enough factor to encourage them to give birth , as money is of a less important issue to them .
On the other hand , it can also be argued that  and the government's help in terms of baby bonus and Children Development Account is temporary .
and it makes people think twice about giving birth , given the other considerations such as high cost of living in Singapore and the increasingly competitive society we are living in .
All these make the task of raising  a child well challenging .
Therefore , the pro-natalist is rather unsuccessful in easing ageing population through the encouraging of births due to  other considerations people have when they decide to have a child  , and these considerations may not be related to cash incentives . .
In conclusion , the two policies have shown their ineffectiveness in easing the problems of ageing population .
Rather than having one policy to cater to the whole country , there can be different policies implemented to cater to different levels of income group .
I agree to a certain extent that the current architectural development in Singapore has helped in the aging process , the architectural development in Singapore was not barrier-free .
Aging process causes difficulties in movement The current scheme that the Singapore government is using is called the Barrier-Free Accessibility (BFA) () .
"This BFA Code requires all new buildings , as well as the existing ones to undergo major retrofitting works , to meet certain barrier-free requirements ."
From the quote , the key words are 'new' and 'certain' .
'New" refers to any building that comes after BFA has been implemented .
"Certain" means that it is  .
The statement highlights that  to a large extent .
The current BFA Code focuses on the accessibility to and within a building .
It does not address the issues on accessibility between buildings , and from buildings to nearby public facilities .
Therefore the public owner has a part to play: for example in shopping malls ,  , industrial estates , invested properties and private properties .
But that is only for buildings that do not belong to the government sector .
Buildings like the Housing development Board flats are built or upgraded to have desirable levels of  accessibilities .
Measures taken by the government to help ease aging process in residential areas are  sheltered linkways which are upgraded to allow the elderly to access from residential blocks to markets .
Other measures include the installation of more ramps in residential areas , which are designed to have a gentle gradient so that it is user-friendly for people in wheelchairs , as well as new lifts replacements with bigger button showing larger text and better lit buttons in lifts so that the old who are visually unsound can see and press for the correct floor .
Measures are taken by the government to help ease the aging process in non-residential areas by creating better public accessibility , for example , the Land Transport Authority making plans to improve accessibility to reach public transport like MRT and bus stops .
The National Parks is also working to into its designs for parks so that even parks can be allowed better accessibility .
Government efforts alone are insufficient .
Private building owners need to adopt similar measures to achieve  for aging population .
A large amount of development has been done by the government to help ease the process of aging but it is not enough due to the fact that the BFA Code only covers new buildings and government developments .
Existing developments by private entities still do not have better accessibility .
Since the implementation of the Code on Barrier-Free Accessibility in Buildings (BFA) in the 1990s , there has been an increase of improved buildings with better accessibility .
However , there are still many pre-1990 buildings that remain "inaccessible" .
Hence , I agree that the current architectural development in Singapore has helped in the aging process to a certain extent .
In October 2007 , UD was added to the BFA to provide a more complete set of guidelines for design in buildings .
UD is a new guideline that has recommendations that can be applied to commercial , residential buildings as well as public and community facilities .
But it is only a Guide; and its applications are not compulsory .
This means that there is no obligations to follow strictly to the guidelines; in other words ,  .
In effect , UD does not help in the development of better accessibility for people who are aged .
Therefore , a revised code on Barrier-Free Accessibility In Buildings , which is a  5-year Barrier-Free Accessibility (BFA) Upgrading Program (2007-2011) has been added to support the upgrading of existing buildings .
All areas intended for access by any group of people like employees , students , etc , to places such as workplaces , training institutions , hospitals , etc , should also be made accessible to their immediate target users besides the public .
The current BFA Code focuses on essential requirements confined to handicap features or facilities which are deemed to be of minimum standards essential for its intended use . 
The government also tries to encourage participation from the private sector , by setting aside a sum of $40 million as Accessibility Fund to upgrade building that are built before the 1990 and not compliant to BFA .
The Accessibility Fund also includes the upgrading of all key areas and necessary facilities in Singapore , so as to provide the bare minimum accessibility by the year 2011 .
Despite this effort , private sectors are still not incorporating desirable features in their designs to help make the buildings in Singapore to be 100% user-friendly to all intended users because they only meet the basic standards of accessibility needed by a building .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
The national budget has always been something that most taxpayers pay much attention to and the planning of the annual expenditure is always a big challenge  to meet the ever changing needs of the country .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted into more important areas of the country development , mainly health , education and defense .
Budget allocated to the health sector is essential in every country as reduced healthcare facilities and equipment will lead to reduced productivity as people fall sick and they are unable to receive adequate medical attention .
This will affect the country's development in both the social and economical aspect .
In the case of Singapore , a total budget of $3705 million has been allocated to the Ministry of Health for the financial  year 2009  (Ministry of Finance , 2009) .
Some might argue that more money should be allocated to taking care of the elderly  as the elderly are more prone to chronic diseases and other health problems .
However , I think that this is an of the elderly issue and is not practical .
It will be much better for the money to be diverted into researching for new medicines and vaccines and improving healthcare facilities .
This  is more important in the current situation when viruses are getting more adapted to current medications and a pandemic is imminent .
Furthermore , it will also be better if the money is diverted into generating more subsidies for  medical charges so that healthcare cost remains affordable for all citizens .
This in turn  will also benefit the aged as well .
Emphasis should also be placed on the education sector as it is crucial to the country's development .
Education is fundamental for the nation as it builds the nation's foundation  .
It is necessary and cannot be cut down even at the current stage of economic downturn .
Singapore has spent a large amount of budget on education , roughly  $8701 million in the financial year 2009  (Ministry of Finance , 2009)  .Some people might think that  educating the elderly is an important aspect of the nation's development as it promotes lifelong learning .
However , educating the old will require a considerate amount of money as most of their minds are not as active as the younger ones and they will take a longer time to absorb new knowledge .
The focus  should be setting a strong foundation for the young and the working population rather than spending money on the elderly .
In this economic downturn , it will be more efficient if we set a strong base through education so that our workforce will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to tackle problems and future challenges in life and work when the economy picks up .
Defence is also a major component that we have to place focus on when we talked about the country's development .
The country's aim is to enhance peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy; when these fail , it will ensure a swift victory over the aggressor .
In Singapore , defense has the highest percentage of the budget allocated in Financial Year 2009 , rounding to about $11 .45 billion , which is about 26 .4% of the national budget  (Ministry of Finance , 2009)  .Some people might dispute that the aged is a valuable asset as we can tap into their vast experience when it comes to defense .
However , in this fast paced and ever changing society , the experiences of the aged will get more irrelevant and money will be better used if the public spending on the aged can be diverted into defense to maintain peace so that the social and economical sectors of the nation can flourish .
In conclusion , I believe that there is indeed a need for  public spending on the aged as the aged are still able to contribute much when it comes to the nation's developmentsuch as through their experiences in life .
However , there have to be a limit as to how much we spend on them so that the money can be diverted into areas like health , education and defense , which are much more important  and crucial to the country's development .
In additionreleases the and .

With every effort puThis will strengtheny current researches and developments/ elderlyies in the various areas like psychology , medto lead , the ageing process in Singapore has been eased to a large extent , which iscommunities .ny .
Public spending on the aged has been rising rapidly  because people need more health care as they grow older .
This has been a major concern for the government because such massive yet increasing spending on the aged would mean a high possibility of economic and fiscal crisis for the near future (Public Sector HealthCare Roundtable , 2009) .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited to a certain extent , not only to avoid the high possibility of economic crisis in the near future , but also to divert the resources to other areas such as education and infrastructure development , which are essential for the economic growth of a country .
The increase of public spending on the aged is necessary because of the growing numbers among the aging population .
However , there are other useful measures that could be taken to reduce the amount of public spending on the elderly .
For example , Peterson states that "elder dependency should be reduced by encouraging later retirement , longer working lives , and lower barriers to elder employment" .
(citation) Another strategy that he stated would be to emphasize filial obligation and encourage the willingness of tomorrow's grown children to look after their aged parents , so as to lower  government spending on the elderly .
This could be achieved through informal and familial channels (Peterson , 2001) .
Therefore , public spending on the aged is necessary , but we should not eliminate other possibilities that will ease the spending
In addition , education also plays a crucial role for the wealth and future development of a country .
For instance , education teaches us the correct attitude and courtesy , thus making us civilized .
In addition , it assists us in the development of our virtues and values , and it also cultivates us into mature individuals , who are capable of planning for our futures and taking the correct steps .
When  people are well-educated , the advancement of a country's economy will be promised (Manali Oak , 2008) .
Education at the secondary and tertiary level will prepare  students to be efficient when they enter the working society , by equipping them with the necessary knowledge and essential skills .
When the efficiency of the workforce is high , it will benefit the economic growth of the country  .
Therefore , public spending on education should not be compromised due to the ageing population .
Infrastructure development affects the economic progression of a country; therefore , it should not be overlooked .
For example , the accumulation of deficit incurred by the American public infrastructure over the past several decades has resulted in a variety of infrastructure bottlenecks-traffic congested roads , clogged ports , and an antiquated air traffic system , which undercut the economy's efficiency  .
This clearly shows that if a country were to neglect its infrastructure development , it will affect the economy greatly .
Infrastructures that are designed and built for tourists will be a significant source of revenue for the country; hence , appropriate amount of public spending should be incorporated to develop such infrastructures .
For instance , the Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation in New Delhi said that by increasing public investment in infrastructure development , it would then attract more private investment (PTI , 2006) .
This would mean more income will be generated .
Therefore , infrastructure development is a crucial segment that affects a country's wealth .
In conclusion , public spending on the elderly should be limited , so as to divert the money into other areas such as education and infrastructure which are essential for the country's economy .
Public spending on the aged can be reduced by increasing the retirement age , or stressing filial obligation .
The government should divert the money into education to equip the people with the right attitude and working skills , so as to ensure  stable economic growth for the country .
Governments should spend sufficiently on infrastructure development because public infrastructure deficit will cause the economy to be less efficient .
On the other hand , public spending in infrastructure development attracts more private investment; hence generating greater income .
If a country neglects other aspects such as education and infrastructure development , but over focuses  on public spending on the aged , its economy will suffer drastically .
In Singapore , the population is aging rapidly .
An aging process means the process of growing old and getting more matured .
"The United Nations defines an aged population as one in which greater than 10% of its residents are aged 60 and above .
In year 2000 , the percentage of the population among Singapore which aged 65 years and above is 7 .2% , and 10 .6% for 60 years and above .
By 2030 , this percentage is predicted to reach 18 .4% for those aged 65 and above , as Singapore is the second fastest aging country in the world"  (Koh) , The Singapore government has carried out many policies to ease the aging processto ensure that growing old in Singapore will be a satisfying and fulfilling experience .
The government has been focusing mainly on economic policies , which are more effective ways in easing the aging process in Singapore's population .
One of the government economic policies which is successful is the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme .
This is a "national social security fund which was established in 1955 as a form of funded retirement savings plan"  (Mehta) .
Singaporeans are required to deposit a certain amount of their salaries into their CPF accounts .
"Employers are also required to contribute 16% of the employee's salary into the employee's account"  (Mehta) .
The contribution rates differ according to age and income of between 8%to33% .
Compared to other countries , Singapore has a much higher rate of contribution .
Some people might complain that the CPF is ripping away so much of their money that they do not have enough  to spend .
However , this is the main purpose of CPF --- to save and reduce on spending .
The high saving rate is to enable the elderly to support themselves in old ageand to provide  for old-age dependency .
Some other people might say that CPF savings is not enough to provide for their  retired lives .
Nonetheless , it is up to the individuals to plan  their  personal savings for their future as the CPF is just a way to help those who might not have planned their savings for oldage .
This is the intention of the government to protect its people .
It was a  strategy  implemented by the government in September 2002 .
"It is an affordable severe disability insurance scheme which provides basic financial protection to those who need long term care , especially in old age .
It provides monthly cash out to help pay the out-of-pocket expenses for the care of a severely-disabled person"  (Healthcare Financing - ElderShield) .
ElderShield is viewing at the increased life expectancy of Singaporeans  , which translate to people living longer as  compared to in the past .
Therefore , one should   deposit some savings during the productive years to prepare for old age disabilities .
Some people may think that  this scheme  is not needed and is a waste of money because they already have their account and they assumed that they will never get severe disabilities  .
This concept is wrong .
Firstly , "ElderShield and MediShield both provide different types of coverage .
ElderShield will pay you monthly cash payouts if you become severely disabled for any reason , whereas MediShield helps you pay hospitalization expenses , only if you are admitted to a hospital"  (FAQs on Policies) .
Looking at this policy , we  know that the government is really trying to ease the aging process in the population .
Apart from the two policies above , the government has also implemented the Public/Society Scheme , which acts as a 'safety net' for elderly Singaporeans . 
All in all , though  the government economic policies have some flaws , the policies have  done much  in making the lives of elderly citizens of Singapore easier and more comfortable .
Hence , the government financial policies are  successful  .
As the country will have less working force in 2030 , the government should invest more money on education to obtain a stronger working force to support the country and the large group of elderly .
"Each additional year of schooling appears to raise earnings by about 10 percent in the United States , although the rate of return to education varies over time as well as across countries ."
(Krueger and Lindahl 2001) the governmentinvestment in cation , the standard oncome due to the high output and competitive of the Singapore working force .
At the same time , better education will not only improve the earning of the working force , but also the moral of the younger generation .
Singapore will not be able to solve the ageing issues if the younger generation of Singapore is lack of moral and only put their focus on themselves .
However , Singapore has already invested much money in education , and by putting more money inside education may not have a better outcome .
The truth is the world is changing fast and many developing countries such as China , India and Vietnam are catching up with Singapore .
If Singapore stops her development in education and put her focus mainly in ageing issues , she might lose in the future .
Thus , invest money in education is important , relevant and important .
investinglose outonNot only education , Singaa smaller worko invest more in her defense to secure her county .
Singapore and her neighboring countriesworkong been threatened by the terrorists .
The recent bombings in Indonesia hotels and the escape and recapture of Mas Selamat show that Singapore is in danger all the time .
Also , Singapore needs to build up a stronger economic defense to prevent serious economic recessions dl ,e to that large amount of money need to be spent on elderly inworkarly future .
Yet , some reports suggest that to invest more money on elderly will benefit the country more compare competitivenessoney on defense whworkms a waste of resources .
The fact is that , the effect on defense is hardly observed workpublic due to the people have been living in a safe environment for too long , that most of them think that Singapore is safe with or without the delacksemorals , if the gputsrnment do not invest enough and promote better defense system , Singaa lot of  might have serious problems when huge crises sinto terroist attackes the 1997 economic recession happen .
In additionthe spending on ageing issues help to force the to provide security for her populationonsibility and not totally rely on government alone .

aging issueslimitthe safetytake the problem for granted ,responsibilitiesenoughwould ruinneglected , of which arenLimiting l not be able to be solved in a short per of time .
And the public should not not to totallynd the gothe governmento all the responsibilities .
The ility of the government is lim and the focus of the government should be placed on the fre of the country instead of just one group of people .
Instead , the public itself should take a major role in ageing issues and work togethof to solve this long term difficulties .
In  Singapore , ageing population is a major issue that the nation has to deal with , considering the fact that 315 ,800 of the population were at the age of 65 and above in 2008 (Annex .
A); and  that figure will only continue to increase , judging from the constant increment in the median age of our population since 1998  (Statistics 2009) .
It is clear  that public spending on the ageing population is essential .
However , the argument is that there cannot be unlimited public spending directly targeted at the aged because there are other major concerns with the economy and society that the government of Singapore has to deal with .
By placing an unlimited amount of public spending directly targeted at the aged , the government will be neglecting  economical , social and political issues which in a way , act as platforms for achieving better living conditions for the aged  .
There is absolutely nothing wrong in allocating a bulk of the public funds to the aged .
The yearly Singapore Budget Speech actually recognizes the fact that someone has to make a policy  to justify  the  amount of public spending in peace times or states of emergency (Gerald P . O'Driscoll , 2002) .
In addition , from the economic perspective , Singapore will never be a leading nation if there is no control  over public spending  .
Channeling more funds into the financial worldmay provide a higher possibility of a better economy , although no single entity till date can guarantee that .
Nonetheless , the government has to seriously consider the fact that a better economy will bring about higher employment rate , higher real income and lower  inflation as indicated by the Consumer Price Index , and all these will enable  Singaporeans in the workforce to save for the future .
In other words , financial planning , of which Peterson in "A Graying World" states to be a strategy to a new paradigm of ageing , (Peterson 2001) is important .
This is when more than 600 financial institutions in Singapore make the country one of the top ten most sophisticated financial markets in the world  , according to  the World Economic Forum .
(Kei 2009) For the government of Singapore to substantiate its standings in the financial markets of the world , it has to continue to provide incentives , which may come from the areas of world-class infrastructures , investment avenues , tourism and tradeand those that  require a sizeable amount of public spending , in order for the experts in the field to come in .
The government  has to groom potential leaders and scholars to understand the importance of financial planning before they can lead and share .
Grooming then , comes in the form of a more sophisticated infrastructure for learning and monetary incentives or aids in the form of  scholarships and bursaries .
One should not forget  that through the functions of education , the government can increase or influence the citizens' thoughts and awareness on being socially and morally responsible to the populationwhich include the aged as well .
In addition , the government has to work hand-in-hand with social organizations , like the which helps  ethnic groups financially , especially  the  aged . 
In conclusion , we have to consider public spending on the other areas of concerns other than that of an ageing population  
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
I do not totally agree with the statement .
A country's developments should be all-rounded but it should not be achieved at the expense of the health care for the elderly in the society .
First and foremost , the elderly are financially vulnerable in the society and need  public funding for their health care .
Though Peterson  (2001) maintains that the elderly could depend less on  public spending by seeking employment or depending more on their families , such a method of reducing and limiting elder dependency is not feasible .
Being old does not mean the loss of health for the elderly , yet there  are  social prejudices against the elderly when they seek for employment at their age .
In this competitive age , employers will tend to favour the non-elderly over the elderly as the latter are nearly retired and often associated with  diseases .
In addition , people are having lesser , if not , no children these days .
In 2008 , Singapore's birth rate was 1 .28 , well below the 2 .1 mark which is needed to meet the future requirements of the Singapore's development .
Such a societal trend reduces the possibility of the elderly tapping on filial obligation from their children to support them in  future .
Therefore , such unfavourable trends continue to place the elderly in need of  public support for their health care .
Where should the limit of  public spending on the aged be drawn  ?
Peterson  (2001) also argues that "health" should be redefined by the government and that the government should draw a limit to its support for the health care of the aged .
A limit on spending would lead to the imposition of a limit on the range of health care for the aged that would be funded by the public .
In the context of health care , different people require  different treatments .
If a certain limit were to be uniformly drawn across the public-funded health care , some elderly could  be cut off from the treatment that they need .
Furthermore , the elderly may suffer from  diseases which tend to be chronic in nature  , like cardiac and rheumatologic diseases .
Prolonged treatment is needed .
Yet , a limit on health care support could mean that some of these elderly would be denied of the necessary medical attention that they need .
There should not be a limit  on  public spending for the health care of the aged .
A balance should be struck in providing for the elderly and concomitantly , driving the country's development .
In The Graying World (2001) , Peterson argues that a lack of limit in public spending would "impoverish future generation" .
However , the withdrawal of governmental support in the health care for the aged would shift the responsibilities of looking after the elderly to the families of these aged and burden the development of the country in the long run .
As argued by Friedland and Summer  (2005) , the costs incurred by the families would "end up getting shifted back to the public sector through less direct and often more expensive means" .
How would this assist in driving the country's development ?
In addition , discontentment could be stirred up as people may question the lack of governmental efforts in the taking care of its citizens .
Therefore , instead of striving for better development for the future generation , setting a limit on health care for the aged could burden and prevent a country from developing better , in the way that it should be .
Public support for the health for the aged is for a real cause .
Hence ,  public spending on the healthcare of the aged should be carried out flexibly and should not be viewed as a hindrance to the development and progress of a nation .
It can be said that aging could be supported by oneself or by one's children and hence the need for public spending would be reduced .
In a modern individualistic culture , a person should be conscious and prepared for his post-retirement .
He should strive for independence and accumulate a surplus of wealth for his old age when he is working .
In an Asian society , where filial piety is stressed , it is the obligation of a child to support his parents; the aged will depend on their children and their own savings to live .
Thus , the emphasis is diverted to other areas of the county's development so that  the country's economy may grow , and the people will have a much larger income to support either themselves or their parents .
Money should be spent on education , research and growing the country's economy so that people can have larger income to tap on .
In addition , instead of spending on the aged , policies could be made to encourage higher birth rates and stress the importance of filial piety as a value so that the aged can  depend on their children .
In this way , focusing on growing the country's economy as a mean to help  support the aged seems  wise .
However , regardless how much the economy is growing , not every person is going to accumulate enough wealth for their old age .
There is a gap between the rich and the poor .
The rich is going to have a wealthy and comfortable life in their post-retirement but the poor is going to struggle with their daily lives paying for the necessary service bills , medical bills and  food .
Elderly who are poor  and who have no children or whose children have deserted them are only going to live on their depleting savings .
If their savings ran out , they would face difficulty acquiring income as their abated bodies may prevent them from finding a job .
They would end up living on the streets if no help were given to them .
Furthermore , these elderly cannot afford expensive medical bills .
Hence , help is heavily needed from the government to keep the poor aged alive .
Grants and subsidies should be given for health check-ups and medical treatments .
Everyday provision of living facilities and food is also needed for those who are poor  , as we should not leave them on the streets .
Hence spending on the aged should not be severely limited .
Besides , long- term medical bills for chronic diseases are so expensive that they undermine an average income person's total wealth .
Diseases that are common to old people , such as cancer , kidney failure and diabetes , require long-term medical attention and  expensive treatment  .
As a result ,  an average income earner would not be able to afford payment even if his income were huge .
While it is very unfortunate to have any of these illnesses , every old person is prone to falling prey to them as their bodies weakened .
While the wealthy could struggle to fight the illness , the average man and below would not be able keep up with the medical bills if no subsidies on medical treatment from the government were given .
Does it mean that he is not going to be allowed continuation of medical treatment to sustain his life ?
Subsidies are needed to sustain medical treatment or elderly who are sick are not going to received adequate treatment .
The aged have work very hard to develop our country in every way and they deserve a good rest for the rest of their lives .
It's ethically not right to leave them on the streets or not to relieve them from the unaffordable medical fees  , just because they have become incapable of contributing to  society .
It is also against human rights to leave a helpless person to be tortured by illnesses and then leave him to die .
Selfishness and cruelly will develop in society when we decide to leave the aged to fend for themselves .
Selfishness undermines unity and cooperation which ultimately will lead to the failure of a society .
Cruelty leads to insensitivity towards death and violence , which may link to increased crime rates .
Hence , if we focused too much on pushing  forward our economy and progress and neglect to take care of our aged , we might just lose  our values  .
By limiting public spending on the aged , there is most likely to be  more old people struggling with medical fees .
It is ethically not right and impractical to limit public spending on the aged to spend on other areas of development .
As each year passes , there seems to be an increase on public spending for the aged .
This seems to be a very popular trend , as a lot of developed countries , such as Spain and the United States of America , tend to increase their public Spending on the elderly .
Public spending is very essential to a country's development , and should be utilised sensibly .
spending on the aged should be limited so that the money can be diverted to other sectors of the country's development  , like public transportation or the army .
Public transportation is one area that could be improved if a country limited its spending on the elderly and raised its spending for the former .
The major problem with public transportation in this country is that it is privately owned and the fares are ridiculously high .
"The privatization of public transport has not delivered the improved service standards nor shorter arrival times , while fares have been increasing based on the justification that being private transport operators , they are not charity and need to make profit for their shareholders ."
(Cheong , 2008) .
According to a Singapore census held in 2000 , around 52% of Singaporeans go to work using public transportation .
That is a staggering figurebecause over half the population uses public transportation , and yet the conditions are  poor and the are high .
This  seems very unreasonable .
The Government can play a major role in creating a solution to this problem .
If they limited the amount being spent on the elderly , they can use their money to  buy back the public transportation , and provide reasonable fares to the public  .
Another thing they can do is improve the conditions of the buses .
Pollution is a growing concern to the environment , as observed by Zolla (1996): "small land area of the central business district led to severe traffic conditions including congestion , reduced traffic speeds , and environmental problems ."
Some of the buses used outside the city are fairly old , and unless they are disposed and substituted by newerbuses ,  the environment is in danger .
These are some reasons why limiting public spending on the aged could contribute to the development of the country .
Another way the government could use  public spending more effectively is to spend more on the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , which is also known as the MCYS .
By limiting the money being spent on the aged , the government could help a very important sector in the MCYS .
The Ministry's main mission is "to build a cohesive and resilient society .
MCYS seeks to fulfill its mission by fostering socially responsible individuals , strong and stable families , a caring and active community , inspired and committed youth , and a sporting people ."
The main thing here is that they support families .
The most important aim here is to build strong and stable families .
In that way the elderly have their families to look after them .
And if for some reason the younger ones in the family do not help their elders ,  they can be sued under the "Maintenance of Parents Act , which allows parents to sue their children for financial support ."
(Wijaya , 2009) .
This policy clearly shows why the government should limit its spending on the elderly , and spread it around to other more useful sectors .
It is no secret that Singapore has one of the fastest aging populations in the world .
"The island state's median age will rise from 36 presently to 41 by 2030" (Wijaya , 2009) .
Many people would use these figures to support their claims that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
however , it will cause major problems within the country's health care system .
Even though the elderly continue to get money from the public , they still cannot pay their medical bills , nor can their children .
"With the growing number of senior citizens and cash-strapped children who are unwilling or unable to shoulder the burden , the Singapore government will find it difficult not to bear more of the costs ."
(Wijaya , 2009) .
The solution to this problem would be to limit the money spent on the elderly .
The money should go instead to the country's health care expenses .
Countries like Sweden and the United Kingdom face no problems when it comes to healthcare , as over 80% of Health Care expenses are covered by the public funds of both  nations .
That is why it would be a fantastic idea to limit money spent on the aging .
To conclude , it would be very wise of the government to limit its spending on the aged , and to divert the money to other areas of the country's development .
There are a lot of sectors more deserving of the moneythat could be beneficiary to both the young and old , like improving the public transportation in the country .
In the recent years , global aging issues are of significant concern .
The population in many developed countries is aging , and Singapore is no exception .
If fertility rate does not increase , these issues will worsen , as the average age of the population will increase .
If this trend continues , by 2030 ,  one out of every five Singaporeans will be  65 years old or above .
The aging population will definitely cause a great impact on the society .
Over the years , the new researches , developments and policies in Singapore have definitely helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
And as far as these developments and policies are concerned , ageing workforce and the cost for elderly healthcare are  important factors that the government has to look into .
By looking into these factors , the country can greatly decrease the impact of the liabilities these elderly have on the country .
To prevent the older generations from being a burden to younger generations , the Singapore government has come up with several policies and acts which allow the elderly to stay in the workforce for a longer period of time .
One of the acts enforced is the Retirement Act .
Under this act , the minimum retirement age in Singapore is 62 years old , and thus  allowing the elderly to stay longer in the workforce .
This can be beneficial to them in several ways .
Firstly , they can accumulate more wealth through their work , of which they can then use it to support themselves in their old age .
Secondly , working provides them with a good environment to maintain and even build up their physical and mental health .
This is made possible through communication with their colleagues , which can help them to stay optimistic .
Thirdly , by working longer , they may also help to ease the financial stress of their family members .
Another worry that arises is the cost for health matters .
An ageing population with higher life expectancy is also associated with higher numbers of chronic and other medical conditions .
To help families in Singapore cope with the extensive treatment cost , the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports (MCYS) has come up with services and programmes that provide affordable healthcare and eldercare services .
MCYS have both intermediate and long-term healthcare facilities .
Intermediate healthcare facilities include community hospitals , day rehabilitation centres for the elderly , and long-term healthcare facilities include hospices , home medical , nursing or therapy services and nursing homes .
These facilities mostly cater to the needs of families with financial difficulties .
However , some Singaporeans have the mind set that these services and programmes are not of utmost importance to them as they  have their own medisave account to pay for their hospitalization bills .
Some  Singaporeans might not think that later retirement is a good idea .
For example , companies might think that it is  a burden to hire an elderly worker , as he or she might not be able to cope with the stress and workload  .
There are also worries about the health status of the elderly workers .
Therefore , they would rather hire a worker with higher qualifications , who is more competent , and most importantly , younger .
However , little did they know that the medisave account might be exhausted after a week .
Associate Professor Paulin Straughan said: "One hospitalization , for example , a stroke can set you back at tens of thousands of dollars .
Where are you going to get that money ?"
(Associate Professor Paulin Straughan , 2009) .
Therefore , without the help and support from welfare organizations such as MCYS , majority of Singaporeans might not be able to handle the high cost incurred for taking care of the elderly .
Also , when companies hire a worker , have they ever taken into consideration that experience does play a part in the working society ?
Without the past contributions from these elderly workers , these companies might not be able to be where they are today .
Therefore , it is important that companies try to retain elderly workers , especially when the Singapore government will provide incentives for them when they do so .
Clearly , as our country is nearing the "graying era" , the importance of these policies and acts seems to be more obvious to all .
These can be seen from the willingness of people to stay longer in the workforce , and to be enrolled into the services and programmes provided by MCYS .
Ageing issues can be further eased if family members took the initiative to encourage their elderly members to stay longer in the workforce , so that they can contribute more to the society , and help to ease household financial stress .
The elderly could also accumulate more wealth , and also  stay healthier and wiser .
In the current context , public spending on the aged has been significant , especially in  developed countries such as Singapore .
With better education system , there will certainly be more literate women joining the workforce , and this may result in them having late marriages .
We will also expect the life expectancy of people to increase due to better healthcare facilities and technology .
Without any doubt , it will be common to see an increase in the aging population .
As such , governments were pushed to invest resources , especially  monetary to solve problems  .
These may include  having a barrier free and accessible environment , a scheme to take care of the elderly and subsidies on the healthcare .
This spending on the aged is necessary but should be limited in order to  balance the spending between the aged and the country's developments on infrastructure , education and skills upgrading .
Infrastructure is one of the areas that the government can develop  .
More railway lines can be built to allow easy accessibility  from one location to another .
Expanding the railway line will  reduce the time spent on traveling  .
It focuses on the general public as a whole , which rangesanging from the young to the elderly and handicapped rather than mainly on the aged .
However , as construction is in progress , it often causes high pollution level and is unsightly .
But , the ultimate aim of investing expenditure on such a large scale project is to increase the standard of living of people .
Another instance could be the upgrading of roads to cater to the increasing number of vehicles , and to reduce road congestion .
It also facilitates  driving within Singapore by making it smoother and providing alternatives roads , which were lesser as compared to the past .
We may also have noticed that our buildings are often undergoing maintenance and upgrading , as it is part of the government's scheme to maintain the condition of buildings , minimizing the wear and tear after years and most importantly to create a better environment for the public to live in .
The above mentioned could be another area to which the government can divert their expenditure  .
Education is another area that the government should focus on as it aids in the development of the country .
The government can invest in additional amenities in schools , such as gymnasiums; swimming pools; and indoor sports halls  , so as to provide a conducive environment for the students .
Besides that , expenditure can be channeled into increasing the subsidies in education to encourage people to study .
When people are educated , they will be able  to contribute to the workforce in the near future .
Moreover , funds should also be diverted to provide skills upgrading for the workers  .
For instance , a scheme such as "Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience" (SPUR)was introduced to improve and upgrade the workers' skills .
The aim was to increase the employment rate by encouraging  retrenched people or the elderly  to improve and upgrade themselves on the necessary and essential skills to continue to stay in the workforce .
However at times , people may be reluctant to take up such programmes which they perceive as useless .
As Peterson's (2001) has stated , it is important for the elderly to have a later retirement to reduce elderly dependency .
It is a fact that if the elderly were employed , they would be able to support themselves with their savings .
In order to achieve that , the elderly workers  must consistently upgrade themselves to keep up with the existing demands of their jobs  , as employers are looking for the most cost effective resource for the organization .
Thus , this not only benefits the general public but also the aged .
In conclusion , although money spent on the elderly can ease the problem of an aging population , it is only effective for a short term and is not a feasible solution .
It will only create more reliance on the government .
Therefore , we should take into consideration the problems that we will encounter in the long run .
By investing enormously in the aged , other areas of developments for the country will be neglected  , and this will result in more social problems .
Hence , spending on the aged should be restricted  so that  resources  can be divided equally based on the needs of the various sectors .
There should be a limitation on  public spending for the aged .
Over the years , the expenditure on the aged has relatively increased due to a shift towards an aging population .
This is mainly due to the increasing needs of healthcare and welfare services for the elderly .
Should more public spending be used to cater for  the ageing population ?
We need to consider other  sectors   development for the country .
Providing better healthcare and welfare services is more important than before due to the ageing population  .
Policies change over time according to the needs of the elderly  .
As people are enjoying  higher life expectancy today , more spending is expected to provide better healthcare facilities and other services for the aged .
It is observed that in certain countries that are faced with aging population problem , there is an significant increase in hospitalization rates as well as physician services over the years .
However , the increased health costs should not be borne solely by the government .
People are more educated and can work longer to  support themselves today .
Furthermore , to stimulate economic growth , the government needs to work out carefully  the national budget allocated different sectors in the country .
Therefore , we need to consider other government expenditures such as education , infrastructure as well as research and evelopment (R&D) .
Education spending has always been looked upon as a significant matter in the government's agenda .
It has played an important role in supporting economic growth and promoting social integration .
Many education policies have been reviewed and improved over the years to promote the importance of education .
Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said that "despite the recession , the government will upgrade both the 'hardware' and 'software' of the education system" [ (Tan ,2009) There should be sufficient funds set aside to provide updated facilities for  schools , as well as to maintain the quality of the teaching force .
By ensuring that the younger generations are well educated  , we would be assured of achieving growth and stability for the nation .
Thus ,  public expenditure  on education should never be overlooked .
The government should also focus its spending on developing infrastructure .
The government will increase public sector construction spending to between $18 billion and $20 billion in 2009 .
This is significantly higher than the $15 billion contracted in 2008 and $6 billion in 2007 .
(Key Budget Initiatives , 2009) .
As the economy thrives  , infrastructure such as commercial buildings , bridges , roads and rails are developed constantly .
Infrastructure  reflects  how developed a country is and enables people and goods  move about quickly .
For instance , the transportation network in Singapore is always developing to provide citizens with top grade transportation as far as possible .
A recent development will be the introduction of the Circle Line to the existing MRT network .
Iconic infrastructure developments arethe Integrated Resort (IR) and casino  , which   aimed at attracting foreign investment and tourist attraction .
The remaking of housing estates is seen in various estate renewal programmes such as Home Improvement Programme (HIP) and Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) .
Expanding infrastructure spending reflects a country's economic favourably and helps  in more foreign investment .
The focus on Research and Development (R&D) has become more prominent  .
Many countries set aside huge amount of government funds for R&D activities .
For example , the South Korean government plans to increase investment in research and development by more than 10 percent a year in 2010 .
Many people see science and technology as a longtime investment and thus expenditure on R&D has not been affected even in the current economic crisis .
Singapore will become a biomedical hub that is globally competitive and will also turn into a trusted centre for scientific and related commercial activities .
Investment in R&D boosts economic growth , increases productivity and generates new product to improve the quality of  lives today .
The needs of a country will  constantly change according to the fluctuation of the economy .
Even though public spending on the aged has increased due to the shift towards an increasingly population , there should be a limit on this spending so as to divert the assets for developing other areas .
The educated aged group  should also be able to   plan for themselves in terms of  healthcare and social services .
The proportion of public spending on  various sectors should be divided properly in order to promote economic growth and maintain a sustainable development for the country .
As fertility rates remain stagnant , many countries are experiencing aging populations .
Governments have thought of many measures  to help improve the aging population situation .
They have invested time and money to research on policies that can help solve the aging population crisis .
Since such a trend is  likely to happen in the short run , much has been done to buffer its negative impact on society .
Therefore , I agree to a large extent , that current research developmentand policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Demographic changes such as a growing population will have  serious consequences on health issues in developed countries .
National budgets and economies will come under pressure as growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer younger persons .
To deal with such challenges , governments have only two options , and one of which is to reduce the future old-age dependency burden by increasing available resources .
This means coming up with policies that can increase the size and productivity of the current and next generation's working-age population .
Alternatively , governments can reduce the amount of money spent on welfare benefits for the elderly .
Firstly , elderly dependency should be reduced by encouraging the elderly to retire later , and by lowering barriers to elder employment .
This can be achieved by increasing the eligibility age for public pensions and government incentives .
As people work longer , the amount of wealth generated would be greater .
If they retired at a younger age , the amount of people left in the work industry would be lesser , resulting in a higher dependency ratio .
By lowering the barriers and making it easier for the elderly to be employed , more elderly people would have jobs and would be able to generate income for the country .
For example , the retirement age in Singapore and Britain used to be 60 and 65 respectively .
However , as of today , the retirement age of Singaporeans has been increased to 62 , and that of Britain is expected to be increased to 68 by 2050 .
This would lead to smaller dependency ratios for both countries , thus lightening the burden on the working class .
The size of today's economy and tax base can also be increased by encouraging greater productivity among the non-elderly .
This can be achieved by sourcing foreign talents from other counties to immigrate to Singapore to contribute to our labour force .
The revenue of the country would in turn increase and the government can use it for other investment and research purposes .
Therefore , the government has been granting permanent residency (PR) status and citizenships more freely than before , as well as providing incentives such as tax rebates to attract foreign companies to invest in Singapore's economy .
The Foreign Talent Policy would thus result in a larger workforce and ultimately lead to increased revenue for the country .
Secondly ,  healthcare for the society is very important .
As the society is facing an aging population problem , the retirement age would increase .
Older people tend to have more health problems and need more medical attention .
They tend to see the doctor more often .
By providing medical benefits and asking them to go for checkups every year , the number of elderly with severe health problems can be reduced .
The government should also spend more money on finding cures for common illnesses that old people are inflicted with .
These measures would ensure that medical problems are treated early and more effectively , thus contributing to a healthier workforce and ultimately , a more productive labour force .
For example , in Singapore , citizens are encouraged to go for medical checkups every year and various medical benefits are provided so as to ensure that our workforce stays healthy and efficient .
However , some may argue that the topic on "health" is very subjective as everyone's body condition is very different .
It is very hard to predict when your body system will malfunction .
The check up could only allow you to have early detection of your illness .
It does not guarantee the recovery from  illness .
Therefore they argue that more and more money would be spent on researching  new technologies to cure the illnesses .
However , research has shown that for many diseases like diabetes , kidney failure , heart diseases and so forth , the chances of recovery are much higher if the disease were diagnosed in the early stages .
Therefore , the opponent's argument does not stand .
In conclusion , I feel that no matter how much research is being done , it will not completely solve the aging problem .
It only helps to alleviate the problems caused by an ageing population .
The only way to really solve this problem is to increase the birth rate of the country .
Only by having  more children will the  burden be spread over a larger and more affluent future generation .
Therefore , I conclude that although current research and development and policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent ,  they have not managed to fully solve the problem .
With the decline of fertility rate in recent years , statistics have shown that in Singapore , the ratio of younger persons aged 15-64 to every resident aged 65 and above fell from 10 .4 in 1998 to 7 .5 in 2009 .
This would suggest an imbalance in the population ratio of number of young person to the number of older people .
As a result , Singapore will face the dangers of an aging population .
Hence ,  public spending on the aged will increase .
At the same time , with the rising economy ,  national expenditure would eventually increase .
"The family has traditionally been the main source of support for the elderly in Asia , and Singapore is no exception .
In recent decades , academic debate has centered upon gauging the effect of modernization or industrialization on levels of familial support  .
This interest intersects with the awareness of policymakers in Asia that traditional family support of the elderly may decline in future ."
(Cowgill and Holmes , 1972) .
This would indicate that the government should be prepared to meet the need of welfare services for the aged .
For instance , facilities such as Day Care Centres and Old Folks Homes will be in high demand as the ratio of the elderly to the younger generation is higher in the near future .
In the long run , if the government focused only on the development of the country and neglected the aged , it will result in economic inequality of "the poor getting poorer , the rich getting richer" concept .
This would cause the people to lose their motivation to work harder for the country  , as well as their belief in filial piety which is commonly known in Asia .
In Singapore , the government has strongly upheld the belief that familial support of the elderly is ideal , but if the individual family could not handle their aged , the government would have to interfere to help .
However , focusing solely on the aged population would not be the best approach .
The government should also focus on other areas that contribute to the development of the country , such as education , technology , military and research and development (R&D) .
This is because there is still a need to contribute to the country's economic growth   to sustain the well-being of its people .
The government can limit its expenditure on the medical fees for the older population and use the money to invest in the education of the younger population and develop the country .
Community centres can organise more activities to encourage the older generation to exercise and stay healthy .
This would  decrease the percentage of them being sick and also help them to build  healthier and happier lifestyles .
However , too much help from the government can lead to its people being too dependent on the government .
This would result in  the lack of motivation to work .
Therefore , the government can introduce policies to encourage its people to invest in their future during the early stages of their lives .
This is to ensure that when they do not have the ability to work anymore , they will still be able to support themselves without much help from the government .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should have a limit .
This will allow the people to learn to be more independent in supporting themselves when they retire .
This would not only benefit the nation's development but also improve its the well-being of its people .
Furthermore , better education for the younger generation would lead  .
Even though there is a need to support the aged , the efficiency of the country should not be compromised .
Due to the advancement in technologies and the implementation of efficacy policies by the Singapore government , the problems that accompanied the aging process have been alleviated to a large extent .
Take for instance , in the past , due the lack of current research and developments available , most elderly who were diagnosed with illnesses were unlikely to recover and in most cases , they would have to stay in bed for the rest of their lives .
Furthermore , in the past , elderly  spinsters and bachelors of whom they have no family members to turn to in their old age , often faced financial problems after they have stopped working .
However , unlike the past , most elderly now are coping well with the aging process  physically , economically and mentally .
As indicated in the statistics pertaining to the health status of the senior citizens ( National Survey of Senior Citizens , 2005) , it is stated that "among senior citizens aged 55 and above , only 35 .8% reported to have a clean bill of health ."
As such , it would seem that despite the great advancement in the area of medical technologies , a substantial percentage of the elderly is still suffering from medical ailments such as high blood pressure , bone or joint problems , diabetes and sight problems .
This may suggest that the current medical technologies have not helped to ease the aging process .
On a closer look , although the present medical technologies may not be able to slow down the aging process , these technologies may help to prevent  medical ailments from occurring and also in some cases , alleviate the sufferings which the elderly have to go through .
For example , the invention of high blood pressure and diabetes monitors helped people , especially the elderly to be more aware of and to be more able to monitor their own health conditions .
With proper medication , the 2 medical ailments would have a lower probability to lead to kidney damage  .
The  treatment of this illness is more difficultthan the common ailments .
As such , the advancement in medical technologies have shown to ease the aging process through  medical innovationsthat  prevent common ailments from exacerbating into serious illnesses  .
Although , in today's context , around 66% of the senior citizens aged 55 and above are provided with regular cash contributions from their children( National Survey of Senior Citizens , 2005) , there is still a significant number of senior citizens who faced financial difficulties in their old age , especially if these senior citizens are retired singles .
Hence , in order to aid the elderly through the aging process , the Singapore government has implemented several policies and measures to ensure that there is adequate protection for the elderly .
One good illustration would be the new CPF LIFE scheme (Introduction to CPF life) that will be launched in September 2009 .
Under this new scheme , it will offer members with a life-time income whereby the members will receive a sum of money monthly for as long as they live and the amount will depend on the cash savings they have in their Retirement Account .
Furthermore , besides ensuring that the elderly will have sufficient funds for their living expenses after their retirement , the Singapore government also ensures that the elderly are able to cope with the hefty and long term medical expenses in their old age through the implementation of policies such as the Eldershield (Healthcare Financing , year) .
"ElderShield is an affordable severe disability insurance scheme which provides basic financial protection to those who needs long-term care , especially during old age" (citation) .
Thus , the elderly will be able to draw on the monthly payout to aid in paying for his or her long-term care expenses .
Hence , with the implementation of such policies , majority of the financial difficulties that the senior citizens faced in their old age would be alleviated .
The elderly would be able to rely on the monthly payouts from the various schemes to cope with their everyday lives even if they had stopped working .
Lastly , the grieving process (Old Adult Mental Wellbeing , Health Promotion Board , year) is part and parcel of the aging process whereby for the elderly , it is more common for them to lose their family members and friends in their old age and thus , this makes each single loss even more unbearable .
However , with the current developments and advanced medical help available , these sufferings would be reduced .
The healing process will only start if the elderly are willing to seek and accept support from various sources .
For instance , one such facility development of which the elderly would be able to seek help from would be the REACH Elderly Care Centre  , where the elderly would be able to receive day care , supervision and supportive help .
In addition , the place also serves to offer ample opportunities for the senior citizens to mingle with other people and take on meaningful activities so that they would be healthier  both mentally and physically .
Furthermore , with the advancement in medical sciences ,  the elderly can also seek professional help such as consulting the therapists and psychologists to assist them in getting over the grieving process , if the intensity of the grief does not fade off after a long period of time .
As such , with the different types of facilities and medical developments available , the elderly no longer have to suffer in silence .
This further substantiates the fact that current research and development have indeed helped to ease the aging process .
It is ironic that how everybody wants to have longer life expectancy but yet , no one wants to grow old .
Nevertheless , the aging process is  an unavoidable , undesirable , problem-ridden phrase of life that we are required to go through  .
However , with the advancement of technologies and implementation of effective policies , the problems associated with the aging process are eased to a large extent . . With the help of the technologies and various , the elderly would definitely be able to better manage their lives in  old age  .
The Singapore population comprises  its citizens and permanent residents .
Between the year 1947 and 1964 ,  approximately 1 million babies were born .
These baby-boomers will reach 65 years old by 2012 and form the largest aged population that Singapore has ever experienced .
Therefore , the government of Singapore should not limit public spending on the aged .
Singapore is a developed country where the government has already spent millions on the country's development .
Singapore's government has invested millions of dollars over the  years to ensure that Singapore grows as a modern and sophisticated city .
The government has pumped money into various areas such as the transportation system , infrastructure , education , technology , health and welfare benefits for its people .
The government uses these developments  to boost the economy .
Singapore's transportation system is well-known to be one of the best in the world .
Almost all parts of Singapore are very accessible by road .
Another factor is the education system in Singapore .
The government promotes tertiary education to acknowledge its importance .
As one of the developed countries in the world , Singapore has only its citizens as its resource .
The government hopes that with compulsory education , its people will be provided with the necessary skills to foster the economy .
Although the standard of living in Singapore has increased , Singapore citizens are  able to cope with it .
This is because the government provides subsidies to the people in  housing , healthcare and education .
With these developments , Singapore has produced a skilled workforceand an and efficient infrastructure  .
These developments attract many foreign investors to  this country .
Today , there are about 3000 Multinational Corporations (MNCs) from all around the world .
Factors which have attracted the MNCs to do business here is  a corruption- free government .
Hence , MNCs feel safe and secure to trade and set up businesses in Singapore .
In fact , the strategy used by Singapore's government has proved to be a success .
For  instance , The economyhas shown  growth that averaged at 8 .0% between 1960 and 1999 to 9 .9% in 2000 .
As a developed nation , Singapore has already established herself .
There is not much  that the government needs to spend on developing the nation .
With a skilledworkforce , advanced facilities and infrastructure  , as well as  with the presence of MNCs , Singapore's economy is expected to grow in years to come .
Water , housing , transport and infrastructure are already available .
The issue is to maintain them  .
Advanced facilities and infrastructure such as the upcoming Integrated Resorts (IR) are expected to draw millions of tourists to Singapore .
Hence , it will benefit the economy .
Now the government should focus on sustaining and maintaining all these developments that are already in existent .
Furthermore , land is scarce in Singapore .
Singapore economy will still be unpredictable .
Knowing that the baby-boomers would reach 65 years old by 2012 , the government should invest on them .
This is necessary because if the baby boomers started to pull  their money out of the banks and the stock market , it will affect the total government spending .
They may not be able to pay taxes if they have lost their jobs and thus , the government should consider spending its funds wisely .
It should be aware of issues that Singapore will be facing in years to come  .
Thus , this would allow  to   remain employable .
By working longer , baby boomers could accumulate savings for retirement and  share their and experience with the society .
More funds are required to encourage later retirement  .
It is only through upgrading of skills and knowledge that the effectiveness of elderly employees would be increased .
Although the elderly are prone to illnesses and more funds are for them as compared to the younger employees in an organisation , they have the experience to guide the younger employees .
Due to a fast-paced and stressful working environment  , the elder generations would not be motivated to extend their stay in the workforce .
Thus , the government should nurture the younger generations to be productive through the use of public funds .
Although the elderly could only do the minimum for the society and the country , they made up a higher percentage of the population and should not be ignored .
There is a need to develop a  sense of urgency  over the an ageing population issue .
In shaping Singapore's economy , the government should not neglect the social issues associated with ageing population .  
According to  Singapore Department of Statistics , the Singapore resident population has grown older with the median age of resident population rising from 35 years old in 2003 to 36 .4 years old in 2007 .
The proportion of elderly person in Singapore aged 65 years and above increased from 7 .4 per cent in 2003 to 8 .5 per cent in 2007 , making it  the second fastest an an ageing population in the world after Japan .
The increase in life expectancy and decline in fertility are the two main causes of ageing population .
Singapore is concerned with the growth ofageing population because many older persons have minimal or no income .
Public spending on the aged should  not be limited , though other aspects of public spending should not be compromised too .
This is to maximize spending on the aged .
The burden on an average working class adult has increased with yearly inflation and higher standards of living .
Pressure on the working population will be exceptionally high  which may in turn cause social problems .
Therefore , health care for the aged should be included as part of the public expenditure fund  , to lighten the burden of the working population  .This is an investment that should not be overlooked .
The elderly often find themselves abandoned by their children  , and this is due to a greater emphasis on individualism among the younger generation  .
This has  eroded  traditional values such as filial piety .
Hence , the government can intervene by supporting the elderly using public spending to make sure that they are self-sufficient .
Policies implemented by the Singapore government like Medisave and Medifund are good examples .
In addition , the government should provide for public facilities , amenities and services , to cater to the needs of the ageing population .
These include day care centres , wheelchair-friendly access , subsidies for medical costs and transport .
Therefore , government spending on the aged is important and should not be limited .
Having established that public spending on the aged should not be limited , other aspects of government spending , however , should not be neglected  .
Money could be diverted to tourism and military uses ,  as these may be  crucial areas  that require public spending .
Money could be diverted to the tourism industry where it plays a key role in contributing to the country's income .
According to the Singapore Tourism Board , Singapore achieved a record of 9 .7 million visitors in 2006 , from 8 .9 million in 2005 , and is hoping to achieve a target of 17 million visitors by 2015 .
In order to achieve the target , Singapore has recently invested a substantial amount of money into the  development of the two integrated resorts in order to remain competitive among Asian countries and other popular tourist attractions .
The Integrated Resort is one of the many strategies that Singapore adopts to generate more economic growth and boost the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) .
Compared to the many areas of development , military defense is among one of the important  because it serves as a deterrent to protect a country's sovereignty .
Money spent on purchasing weapons and armours is necessary to ensure that the military men of the nation are well-equipped in an event when war occurs .
In addition , money could also be expended on local or overseas training to ensure that the military men are trained with relevant knowledge to defend the country .
There are many areas where public spending should be used for a country's development .
In developed countries like Singapore and Japan where ageing population is an issue , the importance of public spending on the aged can outweigh that of other aspects .
On the other hand , developing countries may invest most of their public spending on infrastructure instead of on the aged because economic development is likely to be their primary objective .
It would be unwise to limit healthcare spending on the aged since different countries have different needs .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited  .
Instead , the government should allow its public spending on the aged to hover at certain percentage .
In this materialistic world where we live in , when something loses its value , it will be forgotten  .
Many elderly are neglected by their children and have become homeless  .
There was  case of a daughter who cheated  her mother into selling her apartment  and taking away the  money , leaving her mother homeless on the street .
The  National Welfare Association will lessen the burden of  neglected elderly by providing shelters for them in Old Folks Home  .
However , such approaches will  not remove the root cause of the problem .
In addition , it will generate the idea that it is okay not to look after the elderly as the government will step in and provide the elderly a to stay .
This  will only encourage more infilial children to neglect their elderly parents .
Hence ,  sustainable solutions to the aging problem  start with  the children who are supposed to be taking care of them .
The root cause starts with children who have no wish to take care of their parents .
This can be due to many reasons .
One of which is the lack of financial income .
Japan is known to have many homeless elderly and by analyzing  the country' performance , it is known that Japan has the highest expenses among many countries .
Besides the cultural aspect , this gives us a slight indication that the people there may have problem handling their finance .
In Singapore , this is especially true for people who fall under the sandwich generation that have to pay for the expenses of their children and  parents .
Taxpayers' money  can be used to generate more jobs and higher income for the people , resulting in better economic growth .
In this way , the children will have better financial means to take care of their parents .
Educating the society on aging issue helps in the long run .
Just like  isues such as  smoking and yellow ribbon , the issue of aging  should be highlighted in the country .
This approach not only brings awareness to the people , but also educates  the people on what will happen to the elderly when they are being neglected .
Understanding the issue will change the way the society thinks about aging elderly , taking it to the level of humanity instead of practicality .
Laws should also be implemented  to help control the issue of the elderly being neglected .
Fine should be made on families that neglect their parents .
Laws should not be made severe , as there are also many reasons to why one has to neglect their elders .
Issues like financial problems and time allowance may prevent one from taking care of their elderly .
In this way ,   the welfare of the elderly will be taken care of by their families and the number of homeless elderly will be lessened .
In a nutshell , public spending should be  wisely used to provide aids to the elderly .
Instead of giving help directly to the  elderly , the government should tackle the root of the problemby getting the people  to take care of their elderly parents .
This can be done by improving on the economy , educating the young on the importance of taking care of the elderly and implementing laws  .
These approaches may not produce immediate effects , but they are useful for the future generations .
Throughout the years , the issue of aging has become a tremendous challenge for the developed countries .
Due to an increase in the standard of living , better medical treatment is available and this has caused the life expectancy of the people to increase .
People are marrying later in life and this has caused a fall in the fertility rate .
Young people are now faced with the insurmountable task of supporting an ever increasing population of the aged .
As a result , public spending on the aged has been on the increase .
Some may think that it is a waste of the taxpayers' money to fund such a spending as there can be no potential benefits to be reaped .
However is this the correct attitude to hold towards the elderly ?
Should we hold back the aid for the aged who had contributed to the country's success ?
That shouldn't be the case .
This essay will argue that public spending on the aged should not be limited to a large extent .
It will touch on the moral issues inherent and also argue that it is actually detrimental to a country's future if its aged are not well taken care of , even if the money saved by limiting public spending on the elderly is spent developing other areas such as education and research and development .
At first glance , spending on education may seem to be more important than aiding the elderly as what we teach the youths will determine the future of the nation .
An education provides a platform for the youths to face the challenges in the future .
When faced with difficult decisions , the analytical skills learnt in school will help us to determine how to deal with these problems .
Hence , for a small country such as Singapore of which human resource is the key factor to  success , it is important that the citizens constantly upgrade themselves with the latest knowledge .
Therefore , the government should devote more capital to ensure that the education system remain relevant in today's dynamic global economy .
This certainly seems to be more important than pouring money into public spending for the elderly .
Some may say that it is more important for a country to have an excellent research and development sector than healthy , happy senior citizens .
Research and development plays an important role in the innovation process which results in high quality products and  successful businesses .
Research and development will very likely increase the levels of overseas investment as foreign multinational companies will see the country as a good place for business .
Therefore , with a strong research and development sector , a country will be more likely to succeed economically .
Again , public spending on research and development seems definitely to be more important than spending public money on the elderly .
After all , what can a group of healthy , well taken care of senior citizens bring to the country ?
Their knowledge has long become obsolete and there's not much value they can bring to a country anymore .
However , is it really true that the elderly is irrelevant to a country's development ?
This is not the case .
When the government provides sufficient money to look after the elderly , what is developed is the intangible moral value of gratitude and piety .
When a nation looks after their elderly without reservations , the lesson conveyed to its populace is that one should always look after the people who have contributed to our development .
As a result , what we learn then is to be grateful to the people who have aided us .
Such values are the essential element of the society .
It helps create strong lasting bonds between citizens and the result will be a more cohesive nation .
What about education and research and development ?
A strong education system and a strong research and development sector in a country that is not unified and chaotic will not be able to reap the benefits that they are supposed to generate .
Thus , public spending on the elderly does provide important benefits to the country and should not be limited  .
Lastly , a country that does not take care of its elderly sufficiently runs the risk of having its younger population abandoning it and migrating to other countries .
No one would like to stay in a country with insufficient care for them in the future .
Majority of them would think that their hard work have not paid off .
They have worked so hard to contribute to the economy but   the government does not provide sufficient care for them when they are old .
Hence , no more future leaders will be staying back to help the country to boost  the economy and run the country .
Therefore , public spending on the elderly should still be continuedin the form of financial policies and benefits .
In conclusion , we should not see the elderly as a burden but an asset .
Even though other sectors such as education and research and development are important to us , we should not forget our earlier contributors .
They are the ones who build up a nation from the basic to what we have now .
Therefore , we must be grateful to those who have helped us and created a sense of belonging to everyone .
In this way , younger generation will then work harder for the nation in  future .
The baby boom in the 1960s and the current low fertility rate in Singapore has made Singapore into one of the fastest aging population in the world .
Living expenditure for the elderly has increased in terms of  rising medical costs and standard of living .
Therefore , it is necessary for the government to review the public policies for the elderly .
Essentially , the expenditure used to finance medical and welfare programs should be proportionate to the larger aging population .
The people are the assets of Singapore and they have contributed to the country's strong economic position .
As the population aged , it is the responsibility of the government to take care of its people .
Spending on the aged should not be limited .
The improvement in medical research has lengthened the life expectancy of the people .
However ,  longer life spans will inevitably incur a larger amount of long term health care expenses for the aged and the deterioration of physical mobility and communication might cause them to lose the ability to work and be self-sustained .
The situation is worse for a segment of the elderly  who are unmarried and inadequately educated .
They stand in the least advantageous position should there be a limit on  public spending on the aged because they do not have families to depend on and the depletion of their savings will eventually result in  starvation and homelessness .
Moreover , without the government's support for the elderly , the burden of caring for these elderly will fall solely on the "sandwich generation"of   individuals who will be financially responsible for their family , children and parents .
This is especially straining for individuals who are less financially well off .
In the long run , this financial responsibility may be too much for the working population to bear .
Hence , there is a need for the government to intervene by using part of the public funds to care for the aged population and ease the burden on the working population .
Singapore has invested much of our public spending on the other areas of the country's development  , like defence and the economy .
Although these areas of development are necessary for the  development of Singapore , we should not neglect the importance of public spending for the aged .
By providing more for the elderly and improvising health care polices , the government can actually improve the living conditions of the aged  , which will in turn reduce possible social issues .
Furthermore , if the government can maintain social stability in its country , it may then focus on the other aspects ,  such as defence .
Ultimately , it is the responsibility of the working population and the the government to take care of the elderly .
Other than taxation from the working population which is compulsory , it is necessary to garner support from the government to provide social welfare services , day-care centres , social support and improvisation of health systems .
Such coordination between the working population and government will benefit the aged who are concerned with the provision of welfare from the state and this will give them a sense of security .
An ageing population is a worldwide issue that is faced by all countries .
As a population gets older there are  social , political and economical impact on everyone .
The social impact would be that people  have to work harder because  the younger generations have to be more productive to make up for the elderly's low productivity .
An aging population will have a serious consequence on health issues in developed nations because more medical support will be needed by the elderly .
National budgets and economies will come under pressure as growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer younger persons .
It will hinder the countries' growth in the long run because more tax payers' money will be used for public spending on the aged .
However , public spending should be diverted to other areas of the countries' development , like the economy and the technological sector , which may help in prolonging and enhancing the quality of life for the elderly .
Investing in  economic growth will reduce the stress on the younger generation as more jobs will be  will be available  .
More businesses will start and more jobs will be created  ,  , which means more people will be employed  .
Thus , there will be  more income tax which means more government funds to help support the elderly .
When more work is available , more people will be able earn and save more  , and this  means that the standard of living for the working people will improve and they will be able to support the elderly as they are more affluent .
An increase in economic growth will also mean that people are earning more  , and thus there will be an increase in the taxes  which  will be used in providing better medical support to the elderly  .
Thus ,  this will provide for both the working people  and the elderly  .
Investing in technology in the form of research and development will allow  medical advancement as well as better facilities for medical cares .
New drugs or medicine will be available for the sick elderly and more cures for diseases and sickness will be available to help the elderly This may reduce the stress on the working force in the sense that they don't have to worry about their elderly parents .
New technology or medicine to prolong and enhance the quality of life will be available for the elderly and this will reduce the stress on the working force  and in return increase its productivity  as they are more focused at work and they are able to  spend more time at work .
This will allow for better economical growth for the country  , which in turn means more funds for the government to spend on the elderly  .
Investing in the social welfare of  working adults by providing better qualities of life and better living standards will help to reduce their stress and allow them to  provide better for the elderly .
Some of the facilities provided by the Singapore government were  park connectors  near working industries and central business district  .
This  allows working people to enjoy working and still have a good quality of life .
This helps to encourage working people to work and play better and gives them a better standard of living .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited and the money should be diverted to the other areas of the countries' development , like economic growth , research and development and the welfare of the people  .
This will allow  the people to solve their own financial problem  and allow the government to invest and provide for other areas of the country's development .
Public spending has constantly been an issue in any nation .
Politicians and law-makers are often debating on how much money should be spent on each sector of the country .
With the rising number of elderly in an aging nation , the amount of money spent in this sector would increase as well .
However , there are other areas that require cash inflow to facilitate and push the society forward .
Such areas include the military sector , the security sector , the education sector , the research and development sector , etc .
Thus , the government should not spend too much on the elderly and neglect the rest of society .
When one grows old , his body will go through many and soon , he will not be as fast or agile as he was before .
The government steps in to make the environment more user-friendly  , which includesthe installation of  handrails along steps and stairs , the building of  gentle slopes around the housing estates and the upgrading of lifts to stop at every floor in older flats .
The elderly become more vulnerable to illnesses and diseases as they age and it would take a much longer for them to recover , unlike during their younger days .
Rising medical costs and inflation would pose  a problem for the aged , even for those who had prepared an amount of savings for their golden years .
The government would get involved once again to provide subsidies for the elderly in medical bills and so on .
Terrorism is a growing threat today as it is getting more complicated to understand the terrorists and fight them .
Constant vigilance against them will take a toll on the civil service sector such as the police and civil defense .
More research and studies would have to be done to learn about them , their thinking and their actions and how one should be prepared to fight against them .
As  terrorism spreads  , from the bombing of the Twin Towers in United States of America (NYDailyNews , ) to the Mumbai attacks (Mail Online , ) , one could see  it is becoming much tougher to fight it in the future .
Other than relying on the police and the military forces , the government has to educate the public on the dangers of terrorism and the importance in preventing them .
Research has shown that it is more cost effective to prevent than to deal with the aftermath of terrorism .
Thus the need to divert reserves into this area of development is very important .
Education is also an important part of the country's development .
In Singapore's context , education starts when a child enters pre-school or kindergarten l . Government spending in the education sector has been growing each year .
This is due to increasing expenses for the needs to hire teachers and   provide subsidized education for the public .
Such costs do not stop once a child leaves  secondary school .
If he furthers his studies  , more spending will be sustained .
Even after graduating from a local university , education does not stop .
Emphasizing on continual learning and skills upgrading for older workers will help them to remain competitive in the workforce .
For instance , the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) (NTUC Learning Hub , SPUR) is introduced to employers to encourage  them to send their workers to these trainings .
Such courses and workshops are relatively expensive to conduct and thus , the government's efforts to subsidize them will encourage more workers to  upgrade themselves .
This could also keep the older generation longer in the economy and provide for themselves for more years to come , instead of relying on the government , which may in turn , reduce the need to spend on the elderly .
Hence education is comparatively important and thus requires a fair amount of public spending .
Clearly , spending on the aged is important .
However , the government should not focus too much on this particular sector and neglect the rest .
Education will have a positive impact on the economy" .
Educating the youth who are our future pillars of support , would equip them with skills so that they can handle potential problems , which in turn could support the elderly population in the future .
Education for the older generation would also  help the economy  as they will remain competitive and up-to-date with the relevant skills and are able to support themselves for a much longer period of time .
Security and safety of the people are as important as well .
As shown , preventive measures against terrorism is a cost effective way to counter them instead of dealing with the aftermath of an attack .
As the saying goes: " it's better to be safe than sorry .
Singapore was ranked third for the highest life expectancy in the world .
Before taking any  action , leaders must first realise that any further expansion of retirement benefits would only impoverish future generations and limit future public spending (Peterson , P .G .
(2001)) .
Therefore , I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that funds can be diverted to other areas like the Ministry of Finance , Education , Health and National Development .
Each area must not be neglected , as they have significant contributions in taking care of the aging population .
Firstly , for the Ministry of Finance  in Singapore , funds must be pumped into the economy to ensure solvency of the country .
For instance , the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) are established to make sure that entities operating within Singapore are attuned to  international standards and practices .
All these statutory boards and institutions require funds to run their operations to ensure Singapore's competitiveness .
For example , funds are needed to build good infrastructure and facilities for academic purposes  .
After all , the younger generations represent the future of Singapore and they will soon be the ones taking care of the aged .
Funds are also needed to provide effective educational programs to ensure that the young are equipped with fine skills to cope with the demands of the society  .
Funds are also needed  to educate the young on  moral valuesbecause moral values are the corner stone of an individual's character and personality .
Thirdly , funds are needed for the Ministry of Health to ensure that the rising demand of healthcare services for the general public is met .
For example , as mentioned by our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (National Day Rally Speech , 2009) , hospitals like Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Jurong General Hospital will be built to meet the rising demand of increased patients  .
Funds from the government are also needed to aid  voluntary welfare organizations .
More acute cases  could be handled by hospitals and the patients who are less serious can recuperate at home with their families  .
This in turn  is also a cheaper alternative for the patients to cope with the rising healthcare cost .
However , if public spending on the aged is not limited , more financial aid could be given to them , and this in turn will lessen the burden of the younger generation to provide for the elderly .
At the same time , the aged will feel more valued by the nation when they are being cared for .
Lastly , funds are needed for the Ministry of National Development to develop housing policies  and to build national parks and  neighbourhood parks  .
For the former , housing grants , subsidies , CPF schemes are used to ensure that the public could afford a flat .
Funds are also needed to build handicap facilities , for instance , ramps and the Lift Upgrading Program (LUP) .
For the latter it is especially important for the public as they can have a place for leisure .
It could be a place for all the residents in the neighbourhood to come together to interact , exercise and make friends .
This would help prevent them from experiencing loneliness and also serve as a channel for the residents to communicate and help each other in times of need .
Therefore , after considering all the factors , I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited as other factors are equally important  , such as  taking care of the public and  ensuring international competiveness and progress of the nation .
Each factor has its own way of contributing to  society as a whole and the elderly will benefit directly or indirectly from the developments as well .
Public spending must be cost effective to ensure a steady rate of returns from its investments to allow the country to develop and prosper .
Sufficient public funds are needed to develop different areas of the country which include social , economical , defence and government administration .
To ensure that there are sufficient funds for the country's development , public spending on the aged should be limited .
In order for the country to develop , funds are needed  in the retraining of the workers , expansion of the economic structure and maintenance of a high standard of education in various educational institutions .
Firstly ,  funds are needed  in retraining  the workers .
Due to globalization , the training of workers is important to develop and maintain a highly skilled workforce .
The Singapore Budget (2009) reported that the government will be spending $457 .7 million of  public fund to subsidise training programmes for working Singaporeans .
In Singapore , the Ministry of Manpower and Workforce Development Agency have developed a program called Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience or SPUR , to provide training courses at subsidized rate  .
Apart from helping population to be re-skilled ,  SPUR  also helps retrenched workers to learn new skills so that they can be reemployed and companies are able to send their personnel for training which helps to reduce retrenchments .
However , there are some older workers who are unable to attend any courses despite being to them at subsidized rates .
Dr Isa Hassan (citation) identified three factors on why older workers are not attending any courses .
Firstly , some older workers have weak command of English or are English illiterates as they are school dropouts .
This has discouraged them from attending the training course as it is conducted in English .
Secondly , older workers have little time to attend training courses .
Some older workers are earning minimal wages  , and thus they have to take a second  or part time job to boost their income earning .
Lastly , the older workers are resistant toward going back to school to be re-skilled .
Some older workers may feel embarrassed or dislike going back to school at an old age .
Therefore to develop and maintain a highly skilled workforce , workers have to go for training courses to be re-skilled and retrenched workers have to learn new skills to be reemployed .
Secondly , government expenditure is needed to expand and maintain the economic structure .
The Singapore Budget (2009) has reported that the the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Trade and Industry will be spending a total of $4624 .83 million on expanding the road network , railway network and developing the industrial infrastructure in Singapore .
Having an excellent  infrastructure like an efficient transportation network  , will attract foreign investors  .
This will turn the country into an industrial hub .
The  World Bank reported that Singapore had earned the top position of having a top logistic hub in the world .
As a result , the country is able to maintain its economic competitive edge , as well as to create more jobs for the people and enjoy higher standard of living .
Lastly , public spending is required to maintain a high standard of education in various educational institutions .
A high standard of education is an important factor of maintaining a highly educated workforce in the country .
Investing in education is like investing in the future , so that the future generations are able to meet future challenges .
In Singapore , the government invests heavily on education through subsidising school fees  .
In the Singapore Budget (2009) , the Ministry of Education is investing $7 ,884 million in subsidising school fees .
This is to ensure that school fees are affordable and every citizen is allowed to receive a proper education .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited so that funds could be used in developing the country through the retraining of workers , expansion of economic structure and maintenance of a high standard of education in various educational institutions .
Funds being used for the country's development would benefit both the young and old .
Firstly , investment in education is vital in promoting economic growth .
Moreover , it prepares oneself to think independently and logically .
Through education , individuals are armed with the necessary skills and knowledge which would increase their productivity and competitiveness in the labour market .
The process of gaining knowledge is of paramount importance in developing countries as it would reduce the level of poverty and increase the ability of their people to find quality jobs .
In this way , wealth would be generated and the economy would improve  .
Nevertheless , it could be argued that the benefit of education in elevating economic growth is still unapparent .
There is no one type of education that is suitable for all societies .
Joshua (2001) also mentioned that it is unclear which type of education would lead to a higher economic growth .
Yet , one cannot deny the fact that a shortage of educated people would restrict economic expansion .
Thus , it is crucial for countries to invest in a form of education that is desirable for its people to ensure greater economic development .
Secondly , countries should also focus on providing financial aid for trainings and seminars to be conducted for the working population .
Through the processes of upgrading , individuals are empowered with the relevant skills and knowledge demanded by the job market .
For instance , the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC) , of Singapore (2001-2009) has been active in providing trainings for jobholders to upgrade their skills and knowledge .
In this way , they would have the proficiency to deal with any problems that may arise .
Nonetheless , it could be refuted that this might promote job hopping .
With the new skills and knowledge obtained , individuals would hunt for better paying and quality jobs .
Ilana (2001) claimed that people who possessed the essential skills would change occupations due to the lucrative salary offered by different companies .
However , the funding of training programmes should still proceed as it would increase the productivity and capability of the working population in handling any challenges that might surface in the future .
Lastly , funding on national security should not be ignored .
A strong military defence helps to deter any possible threats and dangers that may occur .
This is of great importance in today's context where terrorism is becoming prominent .
In recent times , terrorists have access to sophisticated technologies that could create greater destruction to the surroundings and are able to instil fear in the people .
Hence , organisations and agencies related to national defence ought to receive adequate financial assistance for research and development .
In this way , military forces would then be armed with the latest equipment  to maintain their fighting capabilities .
For example , the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (2000) stated that 13 million dollars are spent on national security yearly even though it places an immense pressure on the federal budget .
Therefore , continual support on national defence is  important to ensure peace and harmony within the society .
In conclusion , nations should be careful in deciding the amount of money to be spent on each area of development .
Funds should not be spent solely on the elderly as it would hinder the growth of other areas like education , trainings and national security .
Policy makers should realise and recognise that it is through careful planning and a combination of effective policies that would allow the nations to grow and flourish .
Aging population is a worldwide situation which will affect all countries in the world at different intensities and speed (United Nations [UN] , 2002) .
This process is experienced by the developed countries at first but now the developing countries as well and it is especially rapid in this twenty-first century (UN , 2002) .
As the proportion of elderly persons in the world continues to increase , there is a need for the government to intervene as there will be many elderly who cannot support themselves .
Thus , the government needs to come up with policies to help them .
If this public spending on the elderly is not limited , it might have an impact on the countries in terms of national budgets and economies .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that economic growth can be sustained , societal problems faced by the communities can be solved and other essential policies can be sustained .
If public spending on the aged is not limited , the government will not be able to solve problems faced by society .
Many countries face problems such as housing , transportation and education (Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005) .
Policies will need to be introduced and thus will increase expenditures of the government .
This will increase the burden of the present and future working generations .
Through cutting  spending on the aged , the funds can be used in solving problems faced by society and help to relieve the pressure faced by the current working force  .
The government should channel its spending to sustain policies which are vital for the country .
It will need to focus on areas such as education and reduce elder dependency  .
With higher education , the future generations of working people tend to have higher incomes and thus can accumulate more wealth for future use when they are old (Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005) .
The government can also lower barriers to elder employment and stress filial obligation (Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005) .
However , all these policies might not necessarily produce the desired results .
For example , though the government gives subsidies to companies to urge them to employ older workers , there may not be many who have the necessary skills .
The government will need to spend some money on retraining the elderly to equip them with the necessary skills for the jobs .
Thus , the government will need to be flexible in altering its policies .
Though there may be uncertainties about the results  , it is still important to limit public spending on the aged so that some money can still be diverted to other important areas .
As more countries are facing the problem of an aging population , it is important to limit public spending on the aged so as to sustain economic growth , solve problems of the communities and support necessary policies for the country .
Different countries will need to have different solutions specially tailored to fit their own countries and public spending should be split evenly  .
Firstly , in order to cope with the drastic fall in fertility rate , the government has encouraged Singaporeans to marry and procreate , and at the same time attract foreigners into our society .
Additionally , the government has also introduced a Marriage and Parenthood Package which includes bigger baby bonus , longer maternity leave , as well as increased subsidies at childcare centres to boost her population .
Unfortunately , these schemes have not seemed to have appealed to appeal to the vast majority as the birth rate still remains stagnant .
In recent years , awareness on the extension of employment years has also been promoted .
The society today has widened their perspective in employing aged workers and hence encouraged them to continue working even when they reached their retirement age .
A latest survey confirmed that most Singaporean companies agreed that retirement of older worker will be a great loss of valuable skills and knowledge .
Therefore , having an ageing workforce might not necessarily be negative .
Elderly workers can also provide mentorship for the younger employees , imparting and sharing their valuable knowledge and past working experiences .
In an ageing society , the social aspects not only include the need for appropriate housing schemes but also health care systems for present and future generations of elderly .
An elderly-friendly built environment is a key principle to which the elderly elderly can adjust and integrate themselves into the community .
For instance , accessible infrastructure provides a safe and comfortable environment for the elderly to use in their their old age .
Indirectly , it also helps to maintain social network and allows them to participate in social activities .
Hence , The Housing Development Board has customised studio apartments equipped with elder-friendly fittings and features .
In addition , the lift upgrading programme was introduced to allow lifts to be provided at every level of high-rise HDB blocks for the convenience of the elderly .
Furthermore , other facelift programs in the older estates include ramps for wheelchair accessibility , fitness corner and covered walkways .
Hence , with these schemes , it is proven that the elderly in Singapore are given top priority in the community .
A nation needs a strong economy to support its expenditure .
A weak economy would have difficulty to divide its funds among the different areas .
Needless to say , the nation would have problems to support the increasing spending on the elderly in a bearish economy .
Hence , a strong economy would allow the nation to set aside more funds for the elderly .
Limiting the public spending on the elderly is only temporary .
This solution will benefit everyone in the long term .
Thus it is important for the nation to divert our public spending  with the aim of improving the economy .
Just like the elderly are an important asset to a nation , children are an also important asset .
The nation can help the younger generation by diverting its fund on other areas .
Hoover (Lewis , 2009) , 31st President of the United States , once said , "Children are our most valuable natural resource" .
Prof Ho (2007) also pointed out that children , being the future of a nation , are the most important asset .
This means that there is need to start early on each children's development .
The nation has great responsibility to help in developing the children's potential .
They will be the ones that will bring the nation to a greater height .
Therefore , funds should be diverted to assist  child's development .
There is another reason why public funding on the elderly should be limited .
A nation need to ensure the workforce is well trained to remain competitive .
Many countries , such as Denmark and Singapore , have started to retrain their workers (Onn , 2008) .
The workforce is the driving force that improves the economy of a country .
Since the economy affects how much funding a nation can spend on the elderly , it is important to ensure that the workforce receives enough training to improve the economy .
However , people should not rely on its government to provide funds for training .
The responsibility lies on the individual who wants to keep his rice bowl .
These people should spend more money on training to assist their future career .
But there is a need to remember that not all people can fully support themselves for training programs .
As a result , the government should still provide basic incentives to aid people to remain competitive in the industry .
The three reasons provided explain why public funds on elderly should be limited and diverted to other areas of development .
These areas will affect how much a nation can support its aging population .
Although the elderly are an important asset ,  they are not the only asset a nation has .
In conclusion , the nation needs to sacrifice the elderly temporarily for the benefit of everyone .
By diverting the resources to develop on other areas , the elderly will benefit more in the future .
The nation must not be short sighted and seek to solve problems of an ageing population only .
Policymakers should think of how the nation can solve the ageing population in the process of developing plans that will benefit the other areas .
To achieve this , we need to remember this; assisting the elderly is important but building a nation is more important .
In the developed countries , many countries are facing the problems of fast ageing population .
There will be great age shift between now and 2030 as the proportion of residents aged sixty-five or older will increased gradually ( , 2009) .
The seriousness of the problems will not only affect oneself but also affect the whole economy as there will be lesser population contributing to the workforce and to the National Service .
With regard to the problems , many countries focus much attention on it by introducing policies or by giving out funds in order to reduce the problems caused by the ageing population .
Public spending should be used to provide more options and protection for the elderly .
However , it would be better if the expenses used on the aged is limited so that there will be sufficient funds available for other areas of the country's development .
The government may implement certain policies to help the aged or give out enough subsidies to the needy but to a certain limit .
The burden on the government will be reduced and will in turn instill responsibilities between the aged and working people .
There are many areas that may contribute to the economy growth of a country .
If public spending is limited , the pressure on the government will be reduced .
Thus sufficient funds will be directed to areas which may contribute to the economy .
Subsidies can be given to other companies that are affected by the current economy downturn .
Singapore has been lending out its helping hands to many companies to encourage the balance among work and life .
This may result in greater productivity among the workers as they tend to be more committed to their work ( , 2009) .
The Government may also spend the amount in development where it can attract foreign talents to the country to solve the problems of manpower shortage .
In order to ensure that there are sufficient funds for these areas of development , the government will have to limit the amount of spending on the aged .
It will tend to create awareness on the serious problems due to the ageing population if public spending is limited .
This is to ensure that the elderly and the working people will not over rely on the government for aids .
In addition , it is the responsibility of the elderly as well as the working people to plan financially for their future ( , 2001) .
During their contribution to the working world , the aged should be able to plan ahead  for their future on the likely costs incurred for health care services .
If public spending is not limited , the aged or the working people may take the aids provided by the government for  .
Thus they may not work hard during their contribution to the working world .
However , some may think that if  public spending is limited , it will result in pressure on the aged as well as on the working people as they will have to provide for rising health care costs in the future .
Also , the numbers of working people supporting the aged have reduced thus putting strain for them .
In order to solve this problem , the government has implemented certain policies to aid the aged .
Some of the policies are the introduction of the Central Provident Funds , tax reliefs and the Public Housing scheme .
Central Provident Fund is a saving plan that has provided Singaporean with a sense of security in their old age .
For example , the MediShield is used to better prepare them for the future medical costs ( , 2009) .The implementation of these policies will hence reduce the burden on the aged and thus reduce the public spending required on them .
Meticulous financial planning is crucial to all country .
Inappropriate management of finance can lead to the downfall of the country .
According  (2003) , from 2000 to 2030 , the worldwide population aged more than 65 years is projected to increase from 550 million to 973 million approximately .
Therefore more attention is needed to be given to the aged .
Although there seem to be an urgent need to spend more on the aged due to the aging population , other aspects in the country should not be neglected too .
Public spending on the aged should thus be limited so that money can be diverted to areas such as the economy , defence , education and infrastructure in order for the country to develop healthily .
The government should divert money to build up its economy as economic stability is an important area which will contribute to the success of the country .
With economic prosperity , citizens will have jobs and are able to support themselves .
One factor which contributes largely to the economy of a country is the tourism industry; this is supported by  (2009) .
The government will require capital to invest and build more tourist attractions .
This will help to create more jobs , increase revenue of businesses and enhance the economy .
Some may say that maintaining economic stability will result in insufficiency of public funds to help the aged .
As technology advances , new methods of treatment and medicine will be invented .
The healthcare cost of the aged will increase too .
Therefore the government should use more of the public funds to subsidize their medical fees .
Indeed building and maintaining economic stability requires heavy capital , but with economic prosperity , more money will be generated .
According to  (2005) , with economic growth , society will have more choices and more policies can be implemented to help the aged .
Thus it is necessary to divert money to boost the economy so as to generate greater benefits for the aged .
In conclusion , for the country to develop , it is crucial to ensure all areas are taken care of .
To overlook in one area can lead to serious consequences .
Without economic stability , the country will not have enough funds to run it smoothly .
A weak military force will cause the country to be easily destroyed .
Without education and good infrastructures , the citizens will not be able to improve and maintain their standard of living .
Even though it is significant and essential to help the aged , public spending on the aged needs to be limited .
Excessive spending on the aged will help them in the short run but will also impede the development of the country .
A better way is to critically evaluate  the level of importance of the different areas and to prioritse and balance public funding
"Our baby boomers will join the ranks of theelderly in a few years .
Assuming the same level of demand we have now , the need for nursing home beds will double in 10 yearsand triple in 20 years ," exclaimed Mr . Lim Boon Heng ,  .
At this time , the effects of the looming aging population is becoming more evident and the increased pressure on public spending for the aged has left Singapore pondering on how to spend prudently .
If too much spending is put into helping the aged , neglecting other areas of the country's development which aids economic growth ,  .
As far as we would like to help the aged , there should be limits to which how we can help , such that the still mentally-competent or physically-competent aged will not be reliant on us unreservedly .
People in the current generation are healthier , wealthier and better educated than past generations .
We can tell by the incline in the economy that has taken off over the past few years .
The houses we stay look more superior to those dilapidated houses in the past .
We speak more fluently than our ancestors .
These are due to higher expectations , which arose from the increase in the standard of living .
In spite of these reasons , can we generalize that everyone is equally well to do ?
The group of baby boomers who are now in their 50s has substantial disparity in education attainment due to loosely enforced education rules then .
Some may not cope well in life and would need more financial help than others .
Nonetheless , when putting this in thought , disagreement will exist if we give preference the minority .
Maybe we can help the needy in other policies , apart from the general aging population policy , such that our public spending is cautiously used .
Thus , generally , future groups of the aged may be better off and can still depend on themselves if they were to make use of their intellectual assets .
In addition , housing should also be developed to instill a sense of belonging among the people .
Usually , when one owns a home , one will be more motivated to work so as to have a better home and thoughts of migrating would be lesser .
Furthermore , the provision of housing will also encourage the idea of starting a family .
As a result , in times of trouble , people will be more willing to protect their family , home as well as their country .
Thus , with the development of housing , people will learn to unite as one in times of trouble which is crucial for the progress of a country .
Limiting public spending on the aged should be done to favour  other areas of the country's development .
Besides taking care for the aged , there are several other areas the government should put the same amount of emphasis on when dividing how much each sector should get from the national budget .
This includes the country's economy , transport system and infrastructure , public housing , recreational facilities and more .
Moreover , the government should calculate the benefits over cost for the money invested .
One of the most important areas the government should invest their money on is economic growth .
The benefits of economic growth is not only current , it is for the long term as well .
Employment , national stability , economic stability and power are just some of the benefits that come with economic growth .
With regards to tending to the aged , economic growth may restrict some of the current plans the government may have , but in the future , the government will have more say and economic power to do more for the aged .
The next area the government should pay more attention on is the current economic and social issues that exist at that time .
For example , in times of an economic recession like now , the government should pump in more money to revive the economy , like the upgrading of lifts throughout the island .
Not only does it bring employment , it boosts business and trade .
These current issues should be with promptly .
Without prompt actions , the matter may worsen and if not dealt with properly , the consequence is catastrophic .
Hence , it is important for the government to rank the severity of the issues and deal with them accordingly .
As for the aged , although we cannot neglect them ,  we can always provide them with just the right amount so that they too will get what they deserve from the society .
The third argument takes the sentiments of the working class into consideration .
Making the working class pay more taxes to finance the needs of the aged will cause resentment amongst the working class .
Prolonged resentment is unhealthy for the society and it may cause social problems like strikes and protests , to name a few .
Therefore the government has to strike a balance and find the equilibrium whereby the amount of tax is reasonable and enough for comfortable usage .
As we grow older , our health will gradually deteriorate and we will no longer be able to work and support ourselves after retirement .
Hence , public spending from the government is needed to provide the elderly with a comfortable environment to enjoy their retired lives .
Some examples of government's spending on the aged in Singapore include healthcare benefits like the ElderShield and lift upgrading programme in HDB to provide an environment which is friendlier to the elderly .
We need to recognize that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development to attain higher efficiency and to have better allocation of resources .
Apart from that , it should be limited to instill the importance of being independent and prevent over-reliance on the government .
Firstly , public spending on the aged should be limited to ensure higher efficiency in government's expenditure and to have better allocation of resources .
This is because it is only entitled to the elderly , excluding the rest of the population who are not eligible .
By limiting government's spending on the aged and diverting them to development on other areas , we are not just targeting on the elder population but the entire population instead .
One example is by transferring the money that we can use solely on the aged to other fields of the country's development like improvement in infrastructure .
This will benefit the whole population including the aged by providing a more diverse and well-developed system in transport , like the construction of the new circle lines in Singapore .
One may say that development in other areas may exclude some of the elderly from the benefits due to their low levels of education and access .
However , we can always organize campaigns to educate our elder population to direct them to enjoy these benefits , allowing the government to limit their expenditure on the aged .
Secondly , to allow our population to realize the importance of being independent and to prevent over-reliance on the government , we should limit public spending on the aged .
This is to prevent the common misconception that the elderly can rely on the government to support them during old age .
As seen from past experience from other countries , over-dependence on the government would dampen the country's economy , for example , the failure of welfare state in Britain .
In order to help the population to be independent and to save for old age , the government  established the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board .
"CPF is a comprehensive social security savings plans that has provided many working Singaporeans with a sense of security and confidence in their old age ."
( , 2009) .
At this point , one may wonder if the government were to limit public spending on the aged , it will lead to higher burden on the rest of the family , perpetuating more social problems like family violence .
Even with the setting up of the CPF account , it will not help to solve the problem because the amount of income earned by the working population will still remain the same .
Therefore , one way to counter this problem is by diverting the money to other fields the country's development like education .
By investing more money in education , we will be able to produce a future generation which is more affluent and productive , ensuring economic stability and thus generating higher income .
We can then  increase our capability and independence to support the  .
Thus it is wise to limit public spending .
In conclusion , we should limit public spending on the aged in order to ensure that we can be more efficient and ensure that there is better allocation of resources by developing areas that can benefit the entire population .
Also , the government can implement more policies to allow the population to be more independent and increase the awareness of preparing for old age .
Most importantly , the government should divide public spending equally according to the different needs of the various areas of the country's development .
Public spending on the aged should be limited to maintain the standard of living of the aged and to reach out to those who are in need of financial aid .
"In Singapore , factors such as a relatively low birth rate and high-quality health care , which helps people live longer , contribute to the ageing population .
" ,  Aging population is defined as having more elderly compared to the younger generations .
Some of the reasons for an aging population are caused by low birth rate and low mortality rate .
Even though an aging population will slow down the growth and economy of the future society , it will not be long term .
Thus , public spending for the aged should still be budgeted and focused on other areas of development which will help generate more income .
By setting a budget on public spending for the aged , the government can develop in areas such as building infrastructures , attracting foreign investors , improving education system , and expanding the research and development of defence technology .
Firstly , with limited money spent on the aged , the government can build more infrastructures to attract foreign companies to set up businesses in Singapore .
Since Singapore is a safe country with no natural disasters and previous records of terrorism , foreign investors will feel safe to set up their businesses here .
Having more foreign investments implies an increase in foreign  .
As foreign currency grows  this would bring in additional revenue for the country .
At the same time , it will also increase government tax as more people begin to work .
Furthermore , increasing foreign investors would result in more job creations .
With the increase in employment rates , the standard of living will improve and people will have more money for retirement .
However , there will be a risk that the revenue generated by the foreign investors will be returned to their own country .
This will result in a loss of revenue and it will slow down the rate of return of investment for the government .
Even so , in the long run , the government will eventually get back what they  invested on building the infrastructure and the locals will still have a job which prepares them for their retirement .
Secondly , with lesser money spent on the aged , the government can improve the education system in Singapore for the younger generation .
This category of people requires more attention and funds from the government as compared to the aged , as they are the future ambassadors of Singapore .
The future growth and development of Singapore is dependent on them .
At the same time , by better educating the future generations of Singapore , they will be able to secure a better paying job in the future , which they will be able to support themselves as well as their aged parents .
Thus , by improving the education system , the children will be better educated and less dependent on the government for any form of subsidiaries for themselves or their aged parents .
Last but not least , the government can use the money to expand on the research and development of the defence technology .
With better defence technology , the government need not spend money on buying defence weapons from other countries and instead ,  they can earn revenue by selling their own weapons .
By limiting the public spending on the aged and using it on defence technology research , Singapore will be better equipped in safeguarding itself as well as earning additional revenue for the country .
At the same time , an expansion in the research and development of the defence technology will demand more manpower .
As a result , more jobs opportunities will be available for not just the future generations , but as well as the elderly .
Limiting the public spending on the aged opens up other areas for development such as infrastructure , education and defence .
These developments will improve the lives of the current and future generations and in the long run , dependency of the future generations when they are old will be minimal as they will most likely have sufficient money for retirement .
Therefore , public spending for the aged should be limited and focused on developing other areas .

fixedobligedUnity is the Best Stratstepped
Firstly , the proportion of the elderly is increasing rapidly , especially in the developed countries .
For example , in Europe , while the total population is estimated to shrink slightly by 2050 , the aged population is foreseen to increase by 77% ) .
There would be an increase in demand for healthcare , pensions and elderly-friendly facilities such as ramps and railings .
According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2009) , expenditure on treating the health problems of the elderly in America has increased by almost a third .
Hence it is inevitable that a significant amount of money has to be allocated to the funding of these facilities and the much needed pensions .
So , public spending on the elderly should not be limited .
Secondly , social problems may surface if the elderly do not receive sufficient care and help they need from the government .
In Japan , pensioners constitute one-fifth of the country's population .
More than half of the elderly who committed suicide in 2007 was due to health problems (Paddock , 2008) .This is because this group of people are adversely affected by the government's intention of reducing public spending on the pension and welfare system .
It is assumed that as people get older , they will have more health problems and thus need more money to seek medical help .
However , healthcare expenses in Japan are high and many lonely elderly have nobody to depend on except the government .
Thus , if the government chooses to reduce public spending on them , social issues such as elderly suicide rates may rise .
Lastly , it is a moral right and a civic responsibility for us to take care of the elderly .
They are the ones who worked hard and made sacrifices in their early days to provide us with the comfortable living we have today .
After all our education , can we really call ourselves a civilized nation if we close our eyes to the suffering of the elderly living with us ?
Therefore , government's expenditure on the elderly should be allocated such that it is sufficient to help those elderly who are in need .
However , the government should take care of the country as a whole and not just focus on providing for the elderly .
The government should not neglect the need for funding the other development areas such as education and tourism that can boost the country's economy .
With more resources allocated to the country due to its economic growth , the government can also spend some of these resources on the elderly .
Nevertheless , an efficient and well-organized government should plan the national budget carefully and allocate desirable amount of funds into the various aspects of spending areas in the country .
This is especially so for richer countries because they have the financial ability to finance sufficient resources into the different areas of development .
Hence there is no need to restrict public spending on the elderly just to have more resources to be diverted to other areas .
In conclusion , the number of elderly will constitute a significant proportion of the population in the near future in many countries .
There is an urgent need for the government to support these elderly , especially those without dependants , so as to prevent unnecessary negative social impacts on the society .
Furthermore , there is a moral need and obligation to take care of the needs of the elderly .
Therefore , the  expenditure on the elderly should not be restricted just because the other areas of development of the country are assumed to be more important .
Instead , the government should strike a balance in the spending amongst the various sectors of the economy .
Singapore , like many countries in the world , is facing the same crisis - a rapid graying population .
The fast ageing population has brought about issues such as increased demand for better healthcare and social services , a reduction in competitiveness of the economy that has increased the strain and burden of the working population .
By 2030 , the elderly population is estimated to reach a million ( , 2009) .
In other words , there will be one elderly (aged above 65) found in every five residents .
Hence , our local government will have to constantly review and implement appropriate policies to minimise these problems .
The government's continuous efforts did not go unrecognised .
In fact ,  government has already predicted that such a situation would be faced and planning has started since a few decades back .
Thus , the Central Providence Fund (CPF) scheme was introduced in 1955 and made compulsory to all working Singaporeans to encourage self-dependency when they are old ( , 2009 Furthermore , to increase Singapore's birth rate , Singapore the government has enhanced benefits offered in the Marriage and Parenthood Package , which includes higher Parenthood Tax Rebate extended to Singaporeans with more children .
However this is  capped at $20 ,000 per child ( , 2009 .
According to Lee Siew Hua , Senior Political Correspondent () , although benefits may be attractive , many young couples have no plans to settle down with a family immediately after marriage .
One of the reasons is due to other financial commitments like house installment , which has occupied a large portion of the couples' salary (
However , encouraging self-dependency and higher birth rate is insufficient to cope with the rising aged population .
Problems in the physical environment still pose a challenge to the senior citizens' mobility , especially those who are wheelchair-bound .
Therefore , creating a barrier-free environment is necessary to cater to the needs of the elderly .
For example , in the past , lifts only serve certain floors .
This has created much inconvenience in their daily activities .
To counter this problem , the Lifts Upgrading Programme (LUP) has been carried out in phases to upgrade older HDB blocks with lifts that stop at every floor .
In addition , more studio apartments will also be built to cater to the demands .
But , architects may have a harder time designing buildings now as their products must be of value yet able to beautify and sustain the earth's natural resources .
Also , due to the advancement in the field of medicine , life expectancy in Singapore has risen too .
With longer life span , larger range of chronic diseases is expected to surface .
This in turn , has generated demand for chronic disease management , geriatric services and other healthcare services .
For instance , Research and Development (R&D) has enabled cancer to be more controllable now .
To ensure that healthcare remains affordable for most Singaporeans , especially the lower-income group , the government gives different rates of subsidies to the different classes of wards in hospitals .
For example , Class C wards receive the most in subsidies ( .
On top of this , the government also strongly encourages her senior citizens to adopt a healthy lifestyle .
For example , regular physical exercises and a well-balanced diet are encouraged .
In conclusion , Singapore government has played a huge part in managing the ageing population .
For instance ,  , to improve physical environment by creating barrier-free access , and continual effort towards R&D are some of the necessary areas for improvement .
Most importantly , planning for old age is a long-term goal .
One must plan well to enjoy a fulfilling golden age .
Public spending is the expenditure by the government which includes health , education , military and development projects .
A fast aging population is a serious matter as this challenges the government to consider whether to reduce old age dependency or limit healthcare costs .
The government should allocate more resources to support other areas of the country's development such as education policy and health care policy .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be used on those areas most in need .
Public policies encourage and facilitate education .
Spending needs are growing in many areas , including social spending .
The spending should focus  on those most in need .
Due to the economic downturn , people are encouraged to spend more money so that this will help to increase the growth of the economy .
The public spending should be used in other areas of the country's development like shopping malls , the Integrated Resort , restaurants , hotels , museums , theatres , and theme parks .
The aim is to increase the tourism industry and to attract foreigners to spend more money .
For example , the Integrated Resort projects in Singapore is expected to enlarge the industry .
Deputy Prime Minister S . Jayakumar () said that a large amount of money has been invested and the overall proposal  meets tourism objectives and requirements .
The purpose is to attract foreigners and to strengthen Singapore's economic growth .
In conclusion , the government should set boundaries on public spending on the aged so that people will learn how to plan financially for their own old age at the early stage .
Public spending can be also used in other areas of the country's development to boost Singapore's tourism industry .
The aim is to attract more visitors to the country and create benefits for the economy of the country .
In these recent years , the entire world has been confronted with a severe economic recession; which is believed to not only negatively affect lives of millions of people in both developing and developed countries but also seriously threaten the development of numerous firms and companies from almost every sector of the economy .
The governments are strongly expected to efficiently use money from the national budget to maintain a sufficient economic growth and provide a better living standard to its citizens .
Some economists believe that the government should cut down public spending on the aged to invest in other areas while some completely disagree .
I personally support the latter .
Up until now , the social policies toward the aged rights always draw a great deal of attention from the community because of the vulnerability of this special part of the population .
The period of time after retirement often brings along lots of pressure and tension , which don't come from demanding tasks or heavy workload but come from the inevitable emotional and physical changes and also the financial challenges .
They are not able to earn their livings and probably must be dependent on the support and help from their relatives or from the society .
In 2006 , roughly twenty-five percent of the Japanese population was over the working age and approximately eighteen percent was under the working age .
These figures are predicted to increase remarkably by 2050 .
The Chinese population , unfortunately , is also experiencing the same pattern .
Researchers forecast that one thirds of the population of this nation will retire in 2050 .
It obviously means that the rest fifty-seven percent in the first case or two third of the population in the second case have to work and support for both themselves and those who are unable to work .
It is reasonable to state that once the governments reduces the amount of money spending on healthcare system maintenance or accommodation subsidy , it might result in a social and political crisis .
Some might argue that the elderly should have their own savings , which were accumulated earlier in the working years to partly support for their own needs .
However , not every worker can do so since the living expenses are increasing rapidly on a yearly basis .
Therefore , help and assistance from external sources and funds are still essential .
One more factor that should be taken into account is the moral or ethical aspect .
The elderly used to work and devote their talents and efforts to the development of the country .
Therefore , their dedication and sacrifice should be respected and rather relevantly rewarded by younger generations .
Moreover , policy makers and authorities should set good examples for the young .
A stable society in which all generations live in harmony requires a good moral foundation .
Once traditional values are reflected in the law , the law will be more practical and those traditional values will be more deeply ingrained in the society .
Furthermore , when the younger generation witnesses how their seniors are being whole-heartedly cared , they will have motivation to work harder and contribute to the country .
However , in some cases , the government probably should prioritize other areas of the country's development .
Let's take Zimbabwe as an illustration .
In a country where inflation rate reached an unbelievable figure of 11 .2 million percent , where almost every family had to struggle to put food on the table , where the only desire of the children is to go to school , a well-rounded health care system for the aged seems to be so luxurious .
The government here needs a drastic reform to restructure the entire political and administrative system before policies toward the old people could be brought to the conference table .
In brief , the policies toward the aged in each country seem to be widely different due to their very own and distinctive economic and social status .
Nevertheless , based on those different situations , each country should conduct more in-depth research and take necessary steps with the view to promulgating both short-term and long-term policies to ensure that the senior citizens  get what they deserve .
With the current trend of ageing population , many countries have come out with researches , development and policies which will help to ease the aging process greatly .
One such example is the introduction of Assistive Technology .
Technology has become one of the most important things for economic activity , education and innovation throughout the whole world .
As people age , their functionality depreciate in terms of physical and mental ability .
Therefore , in the United States of America , the policy of 'Assistive Technology Act of 1998' was  .
The definition of Assistive technology is the use of technology design to develop any service or tool that helps the elderly or disabled to improve , maintain or to increase their functional capabilities .
The implementation of this policy brought about many technological inventions which in turn eased the elderly with movement , mental ability and emotional distress .
Impaired mobility is a major health concern for older adults and through Assistive Technology , technological invention has helped ease the movement for the elderly .
For example , the installation of grab bars around the tub and toilet bowl can help to prevent falls and reduce the risk of slipping () .
The invention of the elevator and escalator allows the elderly for easy movement from one storey to another in a building and the installation of bedside controls for lights and other appliances reduces the trouble of moving around just to switch off certain appliances .
Additionally , therapy technology has been designed to improve mobility in elderly patients to increase their leg strength or balance .
Memory loss is one of the biggest problems for old age and Assistive Technology has proven to aid the elderly in their mental ability .
For example , in America , The Center for Aging Services Technologies  .
developed e-pill CADEX and 12 Alarm Wristwatch which helps to remind the elderly that it is time for their medication .
Nintendo also developed games such as Brain Training Game which is able to help to keep seniors stay mentally agile () Samsung's Jitterbug , a mobile phone that is currently on the market offers the elderly an easier way in making calls , sending text messages and listening to voice mail ()
Furthermore , emotional distress has impacted the elderly significantly .
With Assistive Technology , for example ,  poor cognitive ability can result in  increased in loneliness[ which may lead to  .
The use of sensor networks and online tools can help in reducing such symptoms .
Therefore they are researching on a product that uses in-home sensors to detect phone calls and visits that are integrated with online tools  .With this product; it can help to promote social activity .
Additionally , interactive technology such as Wii has enhanced social activity for the elderly , easing the distress they may face due to lack of companionship and social activity .
However , though technology has helped the ageing process through improvements in mobility , socially and mentally ,  to the elderly , family and friends are ultimately one of the most important aspects to them  .They can help them with money issues; meet their social needs and provide a home for them .
This would greatly ease their emotional distress as human companionship is most important to them as they age , where they become increasingly lonely and require more attention .
The love and concern provided from the family that can ease the ageing process from the family cannot be replaced by technology .
Hence , technology can be used as a tool to increase functionalities of the ageing adult but not able to provide the emotional support and care .
In today's context , the graying population has become a rising rising problem in many societies .
While it results in a delay to the country's economic progress , the problem also imposes a burden to the children as well .
Thus , this highlights the need for effective policies and research to be implemented and conducted , in order to cushion the negative impacts of aging process .
Three significant solutions would be , improve the economy , introduce elderly-friendly infrastructure and appropriate financial subsidies .
Increasing economic growth of the country helps to relieve the strain of resources to meet the demands of the elderly .
Monetary contribution is essential to aid the aging process .
However , this hinders the distribution of resources for the country's development .
To improve the development of the economy , the government can attract more foreign investors .
According to the Foreign Direct Investment in Singapore statistics () , Singapore received a total of 457 ,023 .8 million investments from the world .
It showed that with potential lucrative economic growth , the country is able to amass more resources to cope with the needs of the society .
With the increased revenue , this reduces the limitation of support given to the elderly , without taxing on the government resources .
Therefore , the elderly could benefit from the greater availability of assistance without jeopardising economic progress .
The development of accessible infrastructure helps the aged to  adapt to the environment .
As humans age , mobility drops relatively .
As a result , immobility would be a hindrance to their lifestyles without the existence of convenient infrastructure .
Thus , physical assistance from the surroundings would be recommended .
According to the Housing And Development Board (HDB) policy () , the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was introduced to install lifts at every level in the HDB residential flats .
As compared to the past , the elderly had much difficulty climbing the stairs .
Thus , this implementation helps to accommodate the inconvenience of the elderly .
Therefore , establishment of accessible infrastructure helps the elderly to adjust more easily .
Financial subsidies would also help to lessen the dependency of the elderly on their children .
As elderly productivity decreases with age , the ability to command the same income as before is almost impossible .
Hence , they would have difficulty maintaining their standard of living .
Therefore , appropriate financial assistance is recommended to help cope with their essential needs .
Australia is a welfare state that strongly emphasises the well-being of the elderly .
Policies such as age pensions and medical benefits allow the  aged to receive sufficient assistance to cope with the financial needs (Greg , 2003) .
On the one hand , the subsidy system compensates the lower income that the elderly have relatively .
On the other hand , this reduces the children's burden to support the parents .
Therefore , the burden on the shoulder of the children to take care of their elderly would be lightened .
On the contrary , implementating subsidy system requires heavy tax foundation which will be a burden on the working society .
A massive subsidy system is needed to sustain the hefty expenses of supporting an increasingly graying population .
This would be a substantial load on the working people , who would then be responsible for contributing to the welfare system of the elderly .
Consequently , this solution would not be effective in the long run due to the money-consuming factor  .
As a result , there should be a classification of the degree of need , in order to create an efficient subsidy system .
In conclusion , the negative impact of the aging process is inevitable .
Therefore , feasible solutions are in need of implementation to ease the aging process .
However , due to cultural differences , the requirements of our elderly population will alter gradually .
Thus , research and policies need to be revised to deal with the aging process effectively .
It is known that the world is facing the problem of an ageing population .
have shown with projected statistics that between  2000 and 2050 , the population of the world for those aged 60 and above will increase in every country .
With this increasing amount of the elderly , there are going to be consequences in areas such as the economical growth , the amount of national budget that we are spending and healthcare issues .
Thus , several policies which have helped to ease the consequences are being put in place .
These policies are successful with easing  the ageing process .
We will now look into some of the policies that help to ease the ageing population .
One of the policies that has been  introduced is that of the retirement age .
Under the retirement act (1999) , the Ministry of Manpower of Singapore raised the retirement age for the elderly from 60 to 62 .
By doing so , the elderly will be able to work longer and thus , they will be able to save up more money in order to support themselves during their old age .
However , we do have to take note that some of the elderly are unable to work even though the retirement age has been raised .
This is due to the fact that some of them do not possess the necessary skills needed for the job or they could be down with some illness causing them to be unfit for work .
Thus , there is a need for other policies in order to protect this vulnerable group of elderly .
Another policy that has been introduced is that of the Maintenance of Parents Act .
This act is a new policy mentioned by Prime Minister Lee during the National Day Rally Speech in .
It is mainly  for cases where the younger generations abandon their parents .
This way , it will ensure that the parents are not being abandoned by their children .
However , we also have to take into consideration that the children might have reasons for not supporting their parents .
One very good example was mentioned in a Channel Newsasia article ) .
It was mentioned by Associate Professor Paulin Straugha from the University of Singapore  that one hospitalization trip could cost tens of thousands of money .
She questioned where the younger generation would get the money from . ?
Therefore , by implementing this policy , it could cause more stress on the younger generations and it could also strain the relation between the elderly and the children .
Next , we will look at another policy which the government came up with .
This policy is to give out financial aids to the needy .
In Singapore , these come in the form of  topping  the Medisave account and providing housing options .
In the report on the ageing population found on the government website  it was mentioned that the government should top up the Medisave account of the needy when there is a budget surplus so that the needy elderly will be able to afford medical treatments .
It was also mentioned that HDB should introduce more rental housing options for the elderly , this can be done by exploring the rental of the vacant  .
In conclusion , with these policies in place ,  .
In Singapore , it was mentioned in a report found on the family and community development website ) that the majority of Singaporeans have positive attitudes towards providing concern and support to the elderly .
Thus , with such positive attitudes and policies , the process of ageing can be eased .
Public spending on the aged has been increasing in recent years due to the ageing population , which results in lesser spending on the other areas of the country's development .
Demographers predicted that by the end of the century , people who are aged 65 and above will be tripled .
This may pose many challenges to the society especially for developing countries , where poverty is evident .
The small labour force has to carry the burden of supporting the aged in the country and with increasing costs for goods and services , income inequality may be resulted .
In addition , the increasing demand on the country's healthcare system will cause the country to divert many resources for the healthcare industry thus neglecting the other potential areas .
Public spending on the aged should be limited because of the smaller labour force supporting its retirees in a country with an ageing population .
This causes taxes , budgets , living standards and economic growth to be adversely affected .
Unless benefits are cut , taxes to pay for pensions and health care may have to be doubled in the next few decades (Hoke ,2005) .
With ageing countries directing much attention to the aged , for instance , spending large sums of money on hiring healthcare workers focusing on the latest medical technology , there will be lesser investments made in other areas like military , tourism , education and research and development .
Hence , this will greatly hinder the development of these countries and deter national progression (Dooling ,2009) .
Therefore , the smaller labour force will face with many difficulties in supporting the retirees due to the high cost .
Secondly , there is a need to limit spending on the aged due to increasing costs of basic necessities ( ,2006) .
There are many other groups of people such as the poor , sick and disabled who need help apart from the aged .
If goods and services become consistently more costly , this will widen the gap between the rich and poor (Reuter ,2007) .
For a country to progress , income inequality is less than desirable (Dorling , Mitchell & Pearce ,2007) .
However , there are situations where the aged can still support themselves and contribute to the country .
In Australia , reports have shown that the aged have been contributing to the country socially and economically in many ways .
People aged between 65- 69 years old still form part of the workforce and some of the aged have been providing financial support for grown up children or relatives despite  their meagre income .
Furthermore , they have been providing voluntary services by actively involving themselves in community organisations ( ,2007) .
However , aged who have the ability to contribute to the country will only form the minority .
The increasing costs will outweigh their contributions .
Thus , more funds have to be set aside to lessen the strains on the people caused by the increasing costs of basic necessities .
Finally , as the population gets older , there is an increase in demand on the country's healthcare system , where spending on it should be limited .
The United States predicted that the demand for medical care will significantly outweigh the supply of healthcare professionals by the year 2020 ( ,2009) .
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is also facing demands for health care where it is likely to increase by 240 percent over the next couple of decades (Walid ,2008) .
This will mean that the countries will be diverting plenty of resources on the supply of health care and neglecting the potential of the other areas which may help to generate wealth for the country .
Hence , countries should limit their spending on health care to invest in other potential opportunities .
Based on the report of the United States Census Bureau , there are 506 million people hitting 65 years old and above as of mid 2008 .
This figure will be doubled to 1 .3 billion by 2040 , which accounts for 14 percent of the total global population .
Mr Richard Suzman (2009) mentioned that the problem of aging is affecting every part of the world .
Both developed and developing countries are challenged by the difficulties resulting from global aging such as limitation of public spending on the health care of the elderly .
Although there's no doubt that health care of the elderly plays an important role in public spending , it should still be limited so that funds can be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as education .
Cost-containment measures on the health care of the elderly have been practised by many governments all over the world .
Japan is a successful example in controlling the health care cost for the elderly .
The government directs most of the financial incentives to primary care .
It leaves some available services to the family .
Japan has also adopted more efficient ways of financing health care and paying claims using a regulated all payers system which allows payment through a standard system .
Compared with the US , it mainly relies on market competition to provide health care .
There are many insurance companies hiring lots of agents to sell their products and each of the insurance company has its own system .
This will result in high cost of health care services .
Thus , some perspectives can be adopted from Japan , for example how to set limits for hospital services , in order to lower the health care costs .
Public spending should focus on areas that play an important part in the the country's development as in the  education sector .
According to the Budget Speech ( ) , the government has a  budget of S$18 .1 billion expenditure in social development which mainly comprises six Ministries: Ministry of Education (MOE) , Ministry of Health (MOH) , Ministry of National Development (MND) , Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports (MCYS) , Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) and Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts (MICA) .
A total budget of S$ 8 ,701 million has been planned to be invested in education , accounting for nearly half of the expenditure budgeted for social development .
The government maintains that the expenditure on education sector would never be cut back even in the economic downturn .
The government heavily subsidises the education fees in schools and tertiary institutions every year to prepare students for the future .
In this way , public spending on the elderly should be balanced with other sectors .
In addition , with the limited funding on the elderly , people would be encouraged to work harder to accumulate more wealth before they retire .
It would tremendously relief the government's burden as they could support themselves in their old age .
However , some may argue that the government should provide more public spending on health services instead of encouraging the elderly to retire later .
It may seem true in some way as the elderly have less ability to perform as well as the younger work force .
More funds should be invested in health services instead of paying salaries to the working elderly .
However , there are increasing pressures on social benefits including health services funds especially during the economic crisis .
The limited fund could only be used in those more deserving areas such as public health services .
Therefore , the elderly should be encouraged to work harder to reduce the fiscal dependency .
In conclusion , there must be some limitation on the public spending in order to divert the money to other areas which will contribute tocountry's development .
The elderly should be encouraged to work harder to support themselves in their old age .
With many countries successfully practising cost-containment measures on health care , a lot of perspectives can be learned to spend the public funding within the limitation .
Besides , considerable efforts should also be made to educate the public to lead a more healthy life .
The problem of an aging population is increasingly affecting more countries .
In the developed countries , due to reasons like better healthcare and women joining the workforce , life expectancy increases significantly as the rate of reproduction decreases .
As the population ages , social problems increase  .
Many governments , in view of this problem , would invest more resources , especially in monetary terms , to seek remedy .
However , this is a bottomless pit .
A better solution would be to limit direct spending on the aged and redirect these resources to aid the country's development .
In fact , this can indirectly ease the stress of an aging population through developing the research and development industry and providing skills training for workers .
The research and development industry is important as it brings about new technology , which can help to improve the standard of living of people .
One crucial area is the research and development of healthcare .
By investing money in research and development , more is done to explore new treatment solutions for existing illness thus , allowing healthcare treatments to be more efficient .
This not only  improves the economy;  but provides more options for the elders when they have to seek treatment .
New methods of healthcare treatment often bring down the cost of it too .
This would in turn ease the cost of healthcare for elders and indirectly has the same effect as funding elders' healthcare costs directly .
Some may claim that one can never be sure if there will ever be positive returns .
Even if it does , more often than not , it would take years before the end product can be sold to the general public for use .
Although this is a point to note , one must also consider the fact that by directly spending money on the elderly , it would be like driving on a one-way street .
It would be investments without returns .
Furthermore , the issue is to limit spending and not totally cut it off .
Thus , it would be more effective to spend money on research and development so that not only will the elders benefit in the long run from the research findings; it can also catalyse economic growth .
Another area in which money can be directed  is to provide skills upgrading training for the workers .
Peterson's (2001) suggestion was to encourage the elders to remain in the workforce for an extended period of time to reduce elderly dependency .
This is because by working for a longer period of time , they support themselves with their salary and save up for future use .
In order to make this an effective policy , the older workers' skills must be upgraded and kept consistent with the existing demands .
Angelique Chan mentioned that at present , employers tend to be hesitant about hiring older workers and this has led to public debates on this issue ( This affects blue collared workers most extensively , and also happens to be the group of elders that have the highest dependency on the society due to their lower savings .
Providing training like the "Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience"  , which the Singapore government  introduced in 2008 , helps improve workers' skills .
In addition , not only does it equip the elders with the essential skills to continue contributing to the workforce , it also increases their employability .
Furthermore , these training programs can also be catered to the unemployed .
Those who were retrenched due to company downsizing or the likes of it can take the opportunity to improve  their skills and move up the corporate ladder .
Thus , this not only benefits the elders , it also benefits the general public as a whole .
In conclusion , although spending money on the elderly can help ease the problem effectively in the short run , it is not a feasible solution , as one must consider the effects in the long run .
By endlessly investing in assisting the elderly , areas of the country's developments will be overlooked , resulting in more serious social problems like unemployment .
Thus , spending on the aged should be limited so that more financial resources can be used to fund other areas of development , which in the long run , can actually help to ease the problem of an aging population .
Singapore is gradually moving into an aging population due to low birth rate and long life expectancy .
According to Mr Lee Hsien Loong , Prime Minister of Singapore , our median age today is 36 and the life expectancy is 80 years .
By 2050 , our median age will be expected to be 54 .
One of the reports estimated that "the demographic change would slice 3 percentage points from long-term economic growth , while possible government support for the elderly could cost the country more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) (Bryan , 2008) .
This shows that an aging population will result in lower productivity and affect our economies .
Bryan (2008) also suggested that healthcare and social cost will also increase as there will be longer life span due to better healthcare quality .
Therefore , to pre-empt the problems of aging population , several policies have been introduced and helped to ease the aging process .
These policies include social security , healthcare and housing .
Firstly , an aging population will have fewer working adults to support the elder dependents .
According to PM Lee , our social security system is based mainly on self-reliance and individual savings .
Policies such as encouraging a long work life and having mandatory savings have been implemented to enable each person to be self-reliant during old age .
For example , our official retirement age has been raised to 65 .
This allows people to work longer to accumulate more wealth for old age .
Many programs have also been set up to retrain the elder workers and upgrade their skills in order to maintain their work productivity .
These have helped to increase the employability rate for elder workers .
Furthermore , a mandatory saving scheme , called the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , has also been set up to ensure people  save as they work .
These savings can be withdrawn in stages when one reaches the retirement age and can also be used for medical expenses .
However , the CPF scheme may not be  useful as the money that can be used for medical expenses is restricted to Medisave and Medifund .
Moreover ,  an elder person who is incapable of continuing to work before he meets the official retirement age ,  is unable to make any withdrawals from his CPF accounts to cover his daily expenses .
Nevertheless , these two strategies are able to reduce elder dependency .
Secondly , healthcare system has been restructured to meet the needs of the aging population .
Hasnita (2009) reported that besides building new hospitals around the neighbourhood , Singapore also focuses on its step-down care sector which includes community hospitals and nursing homes .
PM Lee also added one vital step which is to associate acute hospitals with neighbourhood ones so that patients can seek treatment at the acute hospital and transfer to the neighbourhood hospital for recuperation .
This approach will help to free up beds in the acute hospital for more severe cases to be treated .
Through the reorganization , the new healthcare system will be able to accommodate more people .
Lastly , according to Mr Yap Chin Beng , Director , Estate Administration and Property , talks have been going on with the Housing Development Board (HDB) to initiate policies such as constant upgrading to our physical infrastructures to become more elderly-friendly .
The upgrades include lift upgrading to install new lifts which stops on every floor , shelters to the public to the nearest bus stop of the blocks and ramps for people who have difficulties in climbing stairs .
These upgrading projects have helped to create convenience for the elderly , especially for those who are disabled .
In addition , HDB is also building more studio apartments which are suitable for the elderly as it is customized with elderly-friendly fixtures and fittings .
These two approaches have helped to make an elder-friendly physical environment .
Nowadays , many countries have to face different problems about the aging population .
The popular one is about public spending for the elderly in each country .
It is controversial since many people are afraid that spending too much money on the elderly might decrease national budgets for other areas of development .
Therefore , it is necessary that the public finances spent on the elderly is always considered carefully by the government .
A limited amount of money given to help the aging population is a good issue for both the elderly and the rest of the population which benefits through the development of the different sectors of the country .
It is undoubtedly true that senior citizens always find it difficult to live independently in  their old age .
They need financial sources from not only their own children but also from the society .
For instance , the Singapore government spent more than 7 percent of the GDP (gross domestic product) on supporting the elderly with medical subsidies , public infrastructure and pension schemes () ,  while the percentage of American GDP for public spending on the elderly rose from 8 .5 percent in 1997 to 22 .5 percent in 2070 (Lee , 2008) .
Moreover , a significant share of the Gross National Product (GNP) went into pension schemes: 0 .58 per cent and 1 .22 per cent , respectively in Malaysia and Singapore (Yoon and Hendricks , 2006) .
Another example about public spending on medical subsidies for the aged is the elderly , who represented about 7 per cent of the South Korean population , accounted for 17 .7 per cent of total National Health Insurance (NHI) expenditures in 2001 (Yoon and Hendricks , 2006) .
These  show us the truth that the government spent a lot of money for the senior citizens .
We need to have the responsibility to care for the elderly .
However , we should not spend such a large amount of money on the elderly since it might cause the loss of financial supporting for other important areas of development such as education , military or infrastructure With the iincrease in the aging population and less financial support from cash-strapped young generation , the government even has a heavier burden on its shoulders to give more money to support the seniors' lives now .
Then , they might not focus on solving other problems in other areas , which may cause many troubles for the entire development of the country .
The next point  is about the consequence of having no limitation on spending money for the elderly .
A research done by the Swiss banking giant UBS reported that Singapore's long-term economic growth would lose its 3 percentage points because of the demographic changes while Japan's growth will drop from 9 .8 to 8 .3 percent and China's growth may cut down by 1 percent .
The aging population really affects the country's economy .
Without the guarantee of a healthy economy , the government cannot improve or develop any necessary areas in their country .
Thus , we must ensure that the money we use for the elderly is reasonable; otherwise , we will lose a lot and end up with preventing our development growth .
In my opinion , the limitation for public spending on the aged is a good issue for the entire population .
We actually have many kinds of help for the senior citizens instead of giving them money from the public budget .
For example , the financial problem can be solved by encouraging the elderly to work longer .
They can earn money by themselves .
Then , we are able to spend our money to develop other areas in our country .
Furthermore , the elderly now have a long-term provision for their own lives by their income and contribute their ability to the society .
The thing we should do is just give them a chance and help them in upgrading their skills to adapt to the modern work place .
For instance , in Singapore , the Tripartite Action Group (TAG) was formed to help the elderly increase their employability .
In conclusion , it is essential for us to set a limitation for the money we spend on the  aged .
This limitation will help us give the right supporting finance to the elderly as well as to other areas' development in our country .
Moreover , with the limited money spent to support the senior citizens' lives , it might give the government a motivation to come up with new solutions for the aging population .
To begin with , it is undeniable that Singapore faces a greying population due to the improvement in health care standards and elderly generally require more health care .
Even though health care is expensive , it is one aspect that cannot be overlooked .
The Singapore government provides health subsidies for the elderly to help  the hefty medical bills .
On the contrary , the National Survey of Senior Citizens conducted in 2005 showed that 63% of senior citizens had their own source of income , 66% received cash support from their children and 62% of elderly paid for their own healthcare expenses .
The provision of health subsidies might be seen as a waste of public fundings since most seniors have the ability to pay for their own medical bills .
To apply for health subsidies , the government assess elderly patients by taking into consideration the gross income of the patient and immediate family members as well as whether patients own any private property .
Therefore , the issue of wasting public finance is uncalled-for as elderly patients are assessed to ensure that the subsidy goes to only those who need it .
Meanwhile , in an article published on the 17th of August 2009 , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called for more community hospitals , nursing homes and home care to be built , to provide competent and appropriate care for the elderly .
The Government has also implemented various measures over the years to make homes more elder-friendly and to provide more housing choices for seniors .
Efforts were made by the Housing Development Board (HDB) through the development of retirement housings with non-slip tiles , support hand bars , emergency pull-cords and heat detectors that activate alarms .
Town Councils also came up with barrier-free features like ramps leading to blocks and outdoor facilities are provided to facilitate mobility of seniors from homes to public areas .
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) featured elder-friendly buses allowing seniors to move around Singapore easily with low-floor , step-free and wheelchair accessibility .
Road facilities have also been upgraded to enhance accessibility on public streets .
Such costly infrastructures and developments are fully funded by the government .
Despite many who would argue that such public spending could be better spent on other areas of the country's development , it is important to understand that they are beneficial to the general public .
Elder-friendly bus networks benefit not just seniors but also young parents with children in prams and those with physical disabilities .
Residences fitted with senior-friendly features not only enhance the ease of mobility but also the quality of life for the public .
Even though the development of retirement housing is costly , it reaps profit for private developers and benefits the economy as the greying population fuel the market with their special needs and demands .
Over the past years , the Government has begun to emphasize the employment of senior workers and to keep them in the workforce .
The Government believes that with later retirement , seniors will be able to support themselves independently and to allow seniors to remain physically , mentally and socially active for as long as possible .
Despite the decreasing productivity of elder workers , they possess vast experience and energy .
It will be a waste not to tap their strengths and abilities so that they can contribute meaningfully to their family and the society .
In addition , with the shortage of young workers , it will become increasingly critical for employers to attract and retain mature , experienced workers to maintain a competitive advantage in an evolving economy .
As one of the most rapid aging population in Asia , Singapore encounters the challenge of developing policies to accommodate this evolving age structure .
Now , people who are living longer and longer lives must  carefully plan their lives . .
It is a necessity to raise awareness concerning the issue of aging population .
Welcoming immigrants and increasing fertility rates are some of the issues that should become national priority and these subjects will be discussed in relation to the Singapore context .
Although the relieving of the aging process is unlikely to take effect immediately after the implementation of the policies , much can still be done to ease the impact of an aging population .
Firstly , the aging process should be eased by allowing more working-age immigrants .
Minister Mentor , Lee Kuan Yew () mentioned that there are complains about the welcoming of working-age immigrants resulting in a reduction of job vacancies available for Singaporeans .
Immigrants who have the skills and expertise in the various industries are  favoured by employers .
This is because they can contribute their knowledge and bring the companies to greater heights .
Hence , this has caused Singaporeans who are not as proficient to become unemployed .
The introduction of working-age immigrants has also increased the competition in the workforce .
Eventually , social issues like a surge in suicidal cases and psychological problems will surface .
Furthermore , immigrants who set up businesses or companies in Singapore would create more job vacancies .
They could share their knowledge and technology with Singapore and Singapore could in return , provide them the necessary infrastructure and manpower .
This will certainly be a win-win situation where both Singaporeans and immigrants will benefit .
In addition , competition in the labor force might stimulate people to be more eager and determined to improve themselves .
They will be shocked by the competitiveness and drive themselves to perform better .
This will bring about a progress in the overall standard of the country and the economy .
Secondly , the process of aging should be relieved by increasing fertility rates .
With the influx of immigrants and foreign talents , most Singaporeans believe that Singapore's current population is considerably large .
Minister Mentor , Lee Kuan Yew () pointed out that between the ages of 25 and 40 , more than 30% of the Singaporeans remain single and childless .
Many Singaporeans do not want their careers to be hindered and deem it is not worth to pay the high fees of educating their children .
Despite the introduction of the baby bonus scheme , Singaporeans are still unmoved and cold toward having a child .
However , increasing the fertility rates to replace the aging population in Singapore is vital .
Being a  .
If the low fertility rate continues , Singapore's economy and labour force will eventually shrink .
Thus , it is essential to introduce campaigns and educate Singaporeans on the importance of family formation .
The government could look into ways like longer maternity leave , financial supports in the form of tax rebates and maintaining work-life balance by allocating sufficient time for personal life .
Numerous countries experience aging population The older population is expanding at a substantially faster rate than that of the world's total population .
Presently , the total fertility rate is below the replacement level in essentially all industrialized countries .
The dramatic shift in age structure has caused the Singapore government to introduce many related policies .
Singapore's response has been to welcome immigrants , introduce baby bonus and many more .
In conclusion , the easing of the aging process should be a national effort .
The future is to assure that people everywhere age with confidence and courtliness and continue to enjoy full rights .
In the last 10 years , governments all over the world , especially those in developed countries such as Japan , United Kingdom , Singapore , etc , invested heavily in research and development and formulating new policies to tackle the prevailing ageing phenomenon which is threatening their economies .
However , some policies introduced by the government are causing much problems for the society which outweighs the effect of easing the ageing process .
In this paper , two strategies , one of which encourages older retirement and the other leads to the increase in foreign immigration , introduced by the local government to tackle the ageing population issue shall be discussed .
In 2007 , the government introduced a CPF (Central Provident Fund) reform scheme , which will push retirement age to 65 years  in 2012 which will then be on par with Japan .
This , coupled with other initiatives such as the  and incentives for companies to hire elderly workers , serves to encourage longer working lives and decrease dependency among elderly workers .
However , according to the Singapore National Census in 2007 , 68% of the elder workers are unskilled and most of them are employed as cleaners or laborers , working long hours per day for mostly as little as $5 an hour ( 2009) .
However , many might argue that through employment , older workers will be able to earn their upkeep , save up for future medical needs and live an active and healthy lifestyle ( 2009) .
But on the contrary , it has been statistically proven that older workers tend to suffer from occupational injuries that were inflicted and accumulated since younger working days , thus accidents are more prone to occur , especially for jobs which require substantial amount of physical strength such as lifting or carrying ( 1996) .
Besides , elderly workers can get abused just as much as younger workers , by considering the fact that if elder workers were to be dismissed for some reasons , finding another employment with equal remunerations and similar job tasks might not be easy .
In addition , if they were to be subjected to demands of work performance and long work hours in most jobs , how could they ever live a healthier lifestyle ?
On the contrary , older workers could develop more medical problems as they continue to work and grow older .
Therefore , it can be said that governments who support older retirement age could have committed the fallacy of equating both wealth and health together when it is the other way around .
Singapore has been adopting an "open-door" policy which favors foreign immigration as part of the strategy to overcome ageing population .
With a healthy supply of young workers from other countries , Singapore can fill up job vacancies quickly and replace those older workers .
As the saying , to kill two birds with one stone ,  it can be said that foreign immigration solves both the ageing problem as well as the shortage of babies . .
However , with the influx of foreigners into the economy , cultural clashes will occur and more often than not , misunderstandings due to language differences arise .
According to a survey published by the Institute of Service Excellence (ISES) last year , Singapore has a lower service level satisfactory score of 68 compared to 72 in South Korea and 75 in the States .
One of the reasons is the ease of foreign immigration here .
Nowadays , many semi-skilled foreign immigrants are working in service sectors , and even greet many customers in their mother tongue .
As a result , tourists and even mainland Singaporeans are often put off by their incomprehensible enunciation and insolent intonation of their native language .
Thus , businesses in these sectors employing lower cost foreign workers might lose the goodwill of customers .
Therefore , in the long term , it could hurt the service industry's economies and so , this policy contradicts the main objective of having a strong labor economy .
Nowadays , we are facing the old aging matter as it increases the pressure on our society .
A number of old people are going up day by day while young people , who contribute mainly to country's economics , are on the way down .
This situation makes some countries like Japan , UK or USA keep working on how to ease the aging burden .
Some policies such as later retirement age or increasing the responsibility of children for their parents have been applied .
Though there are still dubious opinions around these solutions , they really bring us  hope for a  better future .
Some researchers are still skeptical about the later retirement policy , which has been saving millions dollar for countries .
(2006) in her article "Can they carry on working ?
Later retirement , health and social inequality in an aging population"  questions  the opposite sides of higher retirement age .
She worries about its bad impacts on older people's health , which may increase the health care fees for government and about the unemployment of  that will cut down the GPD .
Yet , some believe differently .
(2009) finds out that longer working time may help us fight against  dementia , one of the most terrible illnesses of old people .
In fact , working helps the elderly become more independent , more enjoyable and healthier .
If older people keep working , they can pay for their own health care and contribute more for society .
Besides , younger workers still have various work chances , especially , when companies do know about the creativity , activity and intelligence of younger workers .
Ian Ziskin , chief of human resource and administrative office of Northman Grumman , says that it's necessary to have a new brand of workforce in a company and his company will keep hiring young workers for the next 5 to 10 years ( , 2008) .
In  short , encouraging later retirement of employees is an effective solution to reduce the burden of old age .
The second solution being discussed in many countries is raising the  children's responsibility to care for  their older parents .
Every year , the government has  to spend around 0 .2% to 3% of total GDP to take care of old people and the number is increasing year by year ( , 2005) .
Does the "light care" of family toward older people help to reduce this ?
In fact , this caring plays a critical role in easing the spending of government and citizens on health care for the elderly .
According to the Genworth Financial Cost of Care Survey (2006) , the average fees of nursing care for the elderly is $ 194 per day which does not include the fees of medical care , therapy , etc .
It means you have to pay nearly $6000 per month for caring for your parents , which is such a large amount especially in the economic crisis recently .
Home care for the older parents , therefore , seems to be acceptable for a lot of families to reduce the cost .
From the government's view , this strategy really saves a lot of money for them .
According to  (2006) , home care saved up to $350 billion in 2006 , which is even over the Fed's budget .
In USA , just only 50% of adults say that they are caring for their parents (home caring or supporting money) so if we can raise this number up by increasing the grown children's responsibility , we can save our budget to pay attention to other necessary fields .
Briefly , home caring is going to be the long term plan for us to cope with the problem of aging population in the future .
Although there is still skepticism around the two policies which are used to ease the pressure of aging population , a number of study and facts have shown us their benefits to our society .
Later retirement not only helps elders feel more active and healthier but also brings us a large sum of money .
Similarly , increasing adult's responsibility for their older parents particularly assists the government in caring a number of older people and saving health care fees .
By and large , until we find the better way to balance the global population , the two solutions are , at least , beneficial .
Nobody can deny the adverse effects of aging process in society today .
It is predicted that about 23 percent Singaporeans will reach the age of 65 by the year 2050 .
Imagine a country where nearly one-fourth of its citizens cannot work and have to depend on its younger generations .
Such a heavy burden will be placed on that country's sustainability .
In the urging need for solution , we have tried our best to reduce these detrimental impacts .
Recent policies , particularly the Later retirement policy and Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board's Saving for retirement have illustrated the efforts of our Governments .
The fertility decline and the expected shrinking population will subsequently increase the dependency ratio . .
Hence , such explicitly damaging results are unavoidable .
The worst impact is the pressure on the National budget .
Since many people are old and cannot work efficiently , young people have to carry on .
And if the situation gets worse , the young generation would not be able to pay tax and we would have insufficient funds to care for the elderly .
So what have we done to prepare for this doom day ?
Fortunately , some thoughts have been considered .
Although they have not been perfectly completed ,  based on fair judgment , such ideas have helped to lighten the aging effects in our society .
First is the intention to lengthen the working age .
In fact , the Government has introduced the Re-employment Act , which will take effect in the year 2012 , to extend the work age from 62 to 65 .
According to a scientific survey , 41 percent of people want to retire after 65 .
However , this policy has been strongly opposed .
One of the opposing views was  about the strength and perspicacity of the aged .
They fear that old people would not respond well enough to the fast changing world .
Moreover , some senior workers may be outdated in some field works .
These fears are not unreasonable .
However , old people can still contribute a lot .
Although their knowledge may be old-fashioned , their experiences are invaluable .
Besides , some older workers still keep them up to date and learn new things .
In addition , they can even train those inexperienced young .
Many companies nowadays have changed their views and greatly welcome these skilled workers .
More importantly , if we extended people's working age , which would give them several years to devote and save more for their old age , we would greatly ease the aging problem .
About 50 thousand people step into retirement each year , which will then contribute to the dependency ratio .
By encouraging people to work for some more years if they still can work well , we would somehow reduce negative effects of this dilemma .
Second is the conventional CPF Saving for retirement Scheme , which motivates people to save for their old lives when they are still young .
After many years of hard work , people can now enjoy their lives without having to worry about financial difficulties .
This scheme helps people to plan way ahead .
Therefore , they would not have to rely on their children later .
Unfortunately , this scheme cannot be adequately applied .
Since there are many people suffering to support their families , it is just harder for them to save for later years .
People with higher income will have better retirement life compared  .
A fact which cannot be neglected is that a great segment of people over the age of 65 are still facing very challenging hardness .
Old homeless people , for example ,  will have to depend on the Government for their livelihood .
As a result result , although financial difficulty is not a serious problem for the majority of senior Singaporeans , we still have to find greater plans so that all people are all well supported in their old lives .
These two  policies  are just representatives of many researches , studies , policies given out to alleviate the harmful consequences caused by this so-called "silver tsunami" .
Additionally , we are encouraging young couples to have more children , urging working-aged immigrants to come , inventing more ways to reduce the cost for health .
Tackling this fast aging problem is tremendous because it is hard to be eliminated absolutely .
However , such findings have already played their roles to pacify this aging process .
There has been an increasing trend in problems associated with the increasing population of the aged in Singapore .
To tackle these issues commonly encountered by these elderly people , the government has put in considerable effort towards alleviating their problems .
The solutions  which Singapore has adopted and the policies that they have implemented aims to help the aged lead a more comfortable life .
This will be further discussed in the essay .
Higher divorce rates and family breakdown are becoming rampant in modern , urbanized societies and will have consequential effects on the quality of care and support for the elderly .
A liberal country such as America operates in the form of nuclear families whereby the young adults leave their parents at an early age in search for their new home (Diderich , 2005 .
Thus , it will be very difficult for them to take care of their parents on a day-to-day basis .
Development of medium to long-term policies and formulation of appropriate implementation plans would be necessary to deal with problems related to the social and health care of older persons as the population ages .
In Singapore , a significant legislation known as the "Maintenance of Parents Act" in 1995 requires children to support their parents during the latter's old age which has the effect of preventing problems related to the neglect of elderly parents (Khalik , 2009 .
Such a forward-looking policy helps to ensure adequate care and concern for the elderly , helping to ease their aging process .
Financial independence during old age is of great importance to many .
During their twilight years , the weak and elderly would inevitably require to continually seek medical treatments .
Repeated medical treatments can be a financial burden and thus , create a trauma for the elderly .
In Singapore , the cost of living is high , in particular , medical cost .
Therefore , the opportunity cost of retiring early is too high and is almost beyond many individuals .
The government has thus taken measures to counter these problems such as setting up the Central Provident Fund (CPF) so as to allow people to save when they are economically active (Sarkar , 2009 These savings can be set aside for retirement purposes so that they can be self-dependent .
Since they have an ensured amount for retirement , this would naturally ease the financial burden in their later years .
Decreased economic performance may be directly related to an ageing workforce as a result of reduced labour participation and productivity , and reduced job mobility .
The labour force participation rate would be much lower compared to the young vibrant workforce of China and India .
This is worsened by the fact that older workers have relatively lower education levels .
Their skills may be irrelevant in the Information Technology age .
On the contrary , we can also tap on the vast experience and knowledge of the older workers who can then continue to contribute as economically productive members of the society and help sustain the creation of the "silver industry" targeted at older people (Princeton , 2007 .
In addition to that , the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) launched the "People-for Jobs Traineeship Programme" to help older workers who are prepared to take on a second career (Chia , 2001 .
This programme provides tax subsidies and grants to companies which re-trains older workers to help them be re-deployed effectively and to remain gainfully employed .
This will have the effect of helping them to be financially independent even beyond their retirement age .
In conclusion , although the aged in Singapore face increasing number of problems each day , the government is actually implementing many policies , funding , facilities , programmes and services such as the Central Provident Fund Scheme to ease the problems the aged faces .
In  light of the above , current research and governmental policies have , to a large extent , help ease the aging process .
Aging population is now a serious issue in most developed countries , where the number of young people is overwhelmed by the number of elderly ones .
This increases much pressure for the government when dealing with every aspect like economic issues , or infrastructure systems .
This essay will consider the impact of recent research , in particular science , on the aging process .
Despite some opposite opinions on how science makes aging a serious problem in many societies , the benefits  science brings to ease this process seems to severely outweigh its detriments .
Some may think that science is impractical to apply in daily lives .
The discovery of gene activation or brain reaction to environmental factors has little impact in comparison with money spent on  research , which can be more efficient to be spent on healthcare services and retirement pension .
Indeed , with the help of science , many diseases particularly old age diseases have been discovered and understood , which significantly gives a hand in treating .
An illustration of this is the finding of gene called p21 which associates in some old age diseases like heart disease , Alzheimer and arthritis .
This gene when activated can produce some types of proteins relating to diseases of the aged () .
This has led a way for scientists to find treatment , such as in 2009 , Frank LaFerla and Mathew Blurton-Jones of the UC Irvene  found a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease by using neutral stem cell .
Even though it is true that some science discoveries have not been applied efficiently in practice , they are the foundations for future scientists to rely on .
Scientists are seeking a way to prolong life and reverse aging process .
In this point , there might be arguments that the new technique , if available , will result in a larger number of old people , increasing pressure to an already aged and crowded population .
This opinion , in some ways , is not wrong , however , with the help of science , old people are consulted and encouraged to live healthily with appropriate exercises and sufficient nutrition .
The aged now mostly spend their retirement staying healthy and thus prevent diseases or damaged accidents more efficiently .
Besides , this can also lead to less dependency on their children and money from government .
This may not be a way to stop the aging process of a population , but is likely to be a good way to ease the stress and difficulties both government and each individual have to face .
Evans (2004) deduces that dietary proteins intake along with proper exercises can help improve muscle strength and prevent sarcopenia and high blood pressure .
Science with the invention of many toxic chemicals either used for fertilizer , pesticides or nuclear weapons , is responsible for higher infertility rate in humans and many mutant babies born .
The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has published a list of toxic chemical associated with gene mutation .
However , though it is undeniably true how chemicals increase mutation in tissues , it is still unclear whether infertility rates of human beings can rise due to chemical usage .
According to the Institute of Population Health , University of Ottawa and University of Medical Sciences , Iran , there is still not enough evidence to show the link between infertility and chemicals .
At the same time , in 2003 , Queen's University in Canada published a research on an increased amount of a chemical called TCE found in many infertile men .
While this seems to be a controversial issue ,  , a large quantity of babies are born from infertile couples .
This can be achieved because of biology and medical science , as well as new technology .
It is estimated that more than 100 ,000 babies have been born through in vitro fertilization (Trounson and Gardner , ) .
Medical researches have moderately changed these couples' lives , and also found a new path for further discoveries .
The aging process has many negative influences globally .
However , these may be eased with the help of new science applied to technology .
More importantly there are opportunities for infertile couples to have children , which in the long term might be the most effective way .
It is hoped that more theories and techniques will be applied to alleviate the aging process .
The world's population is aging .
Recent declines in the fertility rates and increases in life expectancy together have reshaped the global age structure in most regions in the world by shifting the younger groups to the older ones .
According to the UN , life expectancy is projected to reach 76 globally over the next half century , and fertility rate is also predicted to drop more than a half from 5 .0 to 2 .1 children per woman globally by 2050 .
Just like Peterson says "There's an iceberg dead ahead .
It's called global aging and it threatens to bankrupt the great powers" .
As a result , the social economy will be affected dramatically in a negative way , one of which is the lack of a labour force .
Thus , to prevent the situation from getting worse , many policies should be taken simultaneously by the government .
This essay will discuss t some suggested solutions to the lack of a labour force  that the demographic aging issue brings about based on the context of Singapore .
Initially , increasing the certain age of retirement would alleviate the burden of an aging population .
The retirement age of Singapore is currently 62 .
By this policy , if the retirement age is increased by a number of 5 years , the policy makers would have more time to activate some other policies such as boosting the fertility rates or allowing entrepreneurs to employ foreign workers temporarily .
In addition , the more time older people can work , the more savings or pension they will have to secure their life sufficiently during old age without being dependent on their children or the governmental fund .
The policy , however , has its own hindrances .
Later retirement could cause a decrease in productivity because old people tend to be less healthy or less up-to-date with the new technology and information than the younger ones .
The payment system based on the operation of age for a company could make it more expensive to pay for the old workers than the younger ones .
Secondly , the attempt to raise the fertility rates could also be one  possible solution .
In fact , this solution somehow could ensure the economy that there would be a sufficient new generation or workforce to provide for the labour market when it comes to the time for the previous generation to retire .
However , the policy might encounter a big obstacle , i .e .
how to ensure that there will be enough space for all people to be accommodated in a condition of land scarcity , especially in Singapore , a country with a total area of 710 .2 square kilometres .
Also , the policy might take at least 20 years to become feasible once it is started .
But in recent years , the Singapore's government has put more effort to tackle the housing issue , which can be seen through HDB's building programme to provide more public housing for residential use and allow citizens to take loans up to 80% of the value of the flat to make it more affordable for everyone .
In the mean time for the next new generation of the workforce , the government can consider employing immigrants for a short period of 10 or 20 years .
This solution seems to have been adapted fairly well by the Singapore government since the beginning of the 21st century , and the immigrant workers have been closely associated with the economic development of the country .
Like many other solutions , the government should be aware of this policy's hidden risk involving the race issue .
Many immigrants coming from different regions of the world with many different cultures and religions might result in conflicts between them .
Furthermore , since a lot of immigrant workers with different nationalities , their skills might not be similar or adequate enough to meet with the requirement of the jobs .
To solve the problem , a new standard of skills for immigrants should be established or the government should have the immigrant workers re-trained for the country's purposes although it might take time and quite a lot of money .
In conclusion , the problem of an an aging population is rather a problem of rigid and outmoded policies and institutions than only a problem of a demographic change .
Policies need to be developed that account for the natural incentives individuals have to adjust their behaviour in the face of aging population .
Current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Today , the aging problem has begun to draw people's attention .
Therefore , some research in economics , science and medicine might help to ease the problem .
Firstly , an aging problem can lead to many economic issues .
Today , the number of old people is increasing .
It can cause a drop in the labour force and population .
As people get older , they will stop to work .
So , the economics of a country will face a downturn .
It is because as they stop to work , people who pay taxes will decrease .
Therefore , later retirement is encouraged by the writer of "A Graying World" .
If people can retire later , then they will not need to depend on others in their old age .
However , in today's society , employers do not like to employ older people .
People who are aged over 35 are considered old .
It is because employers think that old people will reduce the productivity of their company .
Therefore , certain enforcements have to be introduced .
For example like employers should be fined heftily if they are found to refuse employing people whom they consider "old" .
Then , this can help to ensure that people can work longer .
Besides , aging can lead to a low population .
It is because the number of old people is increasing but the number of young people is decreasing .
Therefore , people are encouraged to have more kids .
Then , the problem of aging can be eased down .
But , the new generation today do not like to own too many children .
Some of them even refuse to give birth because they think that children are a burden .
Therefore , the government should encourage people to have more kids by giving incentives .
Furthermore , employers should be regulated so that they give enough maternity leaves to female employees .
Then , only the economics of a country will grow .
As the economics grow , the government will have more money to distribute to needy people .
Secondly , science also helps to cope with the aging problem .
As people get older , they are facing more and more health problems like kidney failure and other chronic diseases .
Science has helped scientists to find out more treatments that can cure illnesses like cancer , stroke , heart problem , etc .
In the past , many people died of cancer because there is no treatment for cancer .
But , nowadays , with the help of science , many types of operation appliances have been created .
For example like machines for radiotherapy , dialysis , etc have helped people to recover from the sicknesses .
However , not every person can afford to undergo such treatment because they need to pay up to thousand dollars in order to undergo such treatments .
If people are not afforded to pay the fees , they cannot receive treatment also .
Therefore , the government should give money to needy people especially elderly in order to undergo treatments .
Besides , with the help of science , the percentage of a surgery to succeed is getting higher .
It is because nowadays doctor will sterilize their operation tools before they start a surgery .
Besides , scientists have begun to create more healthy food through bioengineering , that is , the gene of the food can be altered so that the nutrition of certain food can be levelled up .
For example  scientists altered a gene of the tomato so that the vitamin "folate" can be levelled up .
However , there are side effects also when we are having such gene-altered food .
(Adapted from "About .com: U .S . government info")
Thirdly , the introduction of many new medicines has helped to ease the aging problem .
Today , many medicines have been created to treat cancers or other health problems .
For example like high blood pressure , there are many types of medicine that are available to treat these sicknesses .
Furthermore , besides medicine that are used to treat sickness , there are supplements which can make our body to become healthier .
Nowadays , there are many types of supplements available in the market .
For example like  vitamin , iron , calcium , etc .
The introduction of these supplements is due to people's hectic lifestyle .
Many people have no time to take a balanced diet , so these supplements can help them to get certain nutrition where they did not get from their diet .
However , such supplements have also found to have side effects .
Due to some findings , overtaking supplements can lead to kidney failure or diabetes .
It is because the sodium level in some supplements are too high , then it might lead to kidney failure .
Therefore , it is better for us to gain certain nutrition from natural food like fresh fruits and vegetables .
In conclusion , the aging problem is getting more serious , therefore , we have to pay more attention to this topic so that the problem can be eased .
With an exploding population , a quickly aging people is becoming a major issue in many countries .
With more career minded youngsters , marriage and having children are being postponed to the later stages of their lives .
The increase in the number of aged people has seriously slowed down the development of a country and burdened the government in terms of healthcare and financial aid packages for the elderly .
As a solution , several social policies have been implemented by governments around the world .
One of them is financial support managed by government pension funds .
Workers are obligated to contribute certain amount of their income to build up their retirement fund since day one of employment .
Governments have enacted laws for workers to save part of their wages so that financial security after retirement is guaranteed .
The Singapore government has set up the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , one of the many pension funds around the world , which requires employees to save almost 12% of their income in their CPF accounts .
The money cannot be withdrawn except for housing , education , investments or medical care purposes .
However , Adam Smith (1766) suggests that governments should not interfere with the free trade of society .
Trade should be free from affectation as the policy has been speculated that it reduces cash flow , and in turn reduces purchasing power .
This is untrue as the government can make good use of CPF funds to invest and develop the nation .
For instance , equipping a rural area with modern infrastructure and public amenities creates more job opportunities .
The consumption power of society will increase in the long run .
Another policy is to extend the retirement age to expand a nation's workforce .
A larger workforce allows employees to save for a longer period of time to strengthen their financial status for their retirement .
The Government of India has extended the retirement age of people from 58 to 60 in 2007 .3 However ,  productivity of aging people is lower compared to the youngsters .
Aged people are not able to work as porters , construction workers , and plumbers .
The elderly can opt to work as lecturers and teachers to put their experience to good use .
Mentoring the potential employees enables them to gain experience which would have taken them decades .
They can learn at a faster pace , thanks to the guidance provided .
Department head for example should be an older person so that they can impart their experience to the young worker .
The payoff of this investment is a highly efficient and the productive workforce .
Not only that , better working environments should be provided for the elderly workers .
Injuries that occur to the aged may permanently disable them .
By installing railings in the bathroom , stairs and creating ramps at entryways , the risk of falls are greatly diminished .
Although this may incur substantial cost , a few thousand dollars in modifications could save tens of thousands of dollars in welfare aid .
These costs are on an average of $34 ,000 per year .
Working from home is another option that can be considered .
Moreover , aging people can avoid the emotional stress of crowds and traffic congestions when leaving home for work everyday .
If one looks back into the past just only 20 to 30 years ago , he/she can see a big step in the improvement to the quality of life thanks to the rapid development of modern technology .
As a result , people's lifespan also increases .
However , the question is whether we are ready for the increase in an aging  population or not ?
It seems to be good news , but to many developed countries , this fact is causing trouble to their leaders and because of that , many research and policies have been established to ease the aging process .
This essay will discuss those policies as the government's efforts to create a brighter future for the old people .
The context in Singapore will be looked into more detail as illustrations for this essay .
Before the creation of any policy , there is a need to analyse what the possible causes are in order to find out the most effective solution .
The most common difficulty faced by the elders is finance since they cannot earn their livings from their jobs anymore .
Hence , the governments propose a solution of encouraging working aged citizens to work more or increasing the inflow of immigrants so that government's tax income is enhanced and so does the subsidy for the elders .
Unfortunately , there are quite a lot of side effects attached with this policy .
First of all , with the current intensive workload , is it possible to put more burdens on employees' shoulders ?
In Singapore , occupational stress has been popular and even become a dilemma .
Nowadays , working-Singaporeans get so stressful from their work that they could barely have time for their own enjoyment and for their family .
Even more seriously , young people do not have enough time for dating which is shrinking the country's population .
We usually hear Singaporeans complaining about stress , primarily from work or from the education system .
One of the common reasons for Singapore's low birth rate is stress .
Therefore , we need to pay attention to work-life balance amidst our economic pursuits .
(Liang , 2006) .
Secondly , inviting more working immigrants as an alternative method is not a good idea either .
(APMRN , 1996): One of the issues raised is the potential competition for use of resources such as public space , transportation , etc .
This concern has been expressed by some Singaporeans over the gathering of foreign workers in certain parts of the city on weekends , particularly where these places are at or near residential areas .
Overcrowding on roads and other public spaces , littering , vandalism , urinating in public and theft are some of the complaints levelled .
More foreigners not only raise the crime rates but also require government to spend more money on developing infrastructure , public housing to accommodate all of them .
All of these troubles that the application of this policy brings about may outweigh the benefits .
The appliance therefore needs further consideration and comparison between what we get and what we lose .
Besides , another method considered is encouraging later retirement and longer working lives .
Although it is true that when the elders work more , they can earn more , hence reducing old-age dependency , the implied cost may not be less than the benefit .
Though the elders have a lot of experience , they may not work as effectively and make decisions as quickly as the younger generations do .
There may not be enough jobs for both young and old people , especially in an economic downturn like today .
Therefore , finally , governments may need to spend a large amount of money on creating incentives for companies to hire old people , namely: tax reduction , subsidy for each elder employed , etc .
Moreover , old people may not be strong enough to withstand the stress at work and the cost for healthcare and insurance for old working people will surpass the profit , which all companies try to earn as much as they can .
For all the above reasons , this policy seems to be impractical .
In conclusion , it seems that we are still not ready for an increasing old age population yet .
Despite the government's attempt to ease the aging process , there are still many issues that need further careful consideration .
Having such advanced technology in the current world , the aging population will be expecting a longer and healthy life expectancy .
Therefore , the baby boomers in the early 1950s will be likely to live well into their 80s and 90s .
Such trends will cause a drastic decrease in the world's population by 2050 if the fertility rates do not increase substantially .
Due to low fertility issues , most developing countries are currently facing a situation where there will be insufficient people to replace the retiring labor force and mortality of the aging population in the near future .
Since such aging issues cannot be resolved instantaneously , technological means and governmental policies should be implemented over time to reduce negative societal and economical impacts brought by the aging trend .
Statistical researches have shown that most couples are unable to sustain two or more children due to the high cost of living and constant increase in inflation .
Despite  these economic constraints , there is still an urgent need for the government to increase the amount of children per household to replace the huge retiring labor force in order to maintain the economic growth within a country .
By having sufficient replacement in the labor force , it will generate adequate taxes and economic returns for the government to provide public pensions and subsidized health programs for the aging population .
On top of that , producing more children also means that it enables the future generations to better distribute their social responsibilities in the context of fulfilling their filial obligations , resulting in lesser elder dependency on the government .
Therefore , the government should implement policies such as giving monetary incentives and tax rebates to encourage the current generation to produce more children .
As for those couples who are facing infertility problems , the government can minimize such social problems by maximizing the use of current technology simultaneously with the aid of new policies and subsidy schemes to make infertility treatments more affordable .
However , such subsidies will be available on a case-by-case basis where only infertile couples who fall below a certain household income range will be entitled these subsidies .
In addition , for those who are not eligible to receive the subsidy , the government can liaise with local banks to offer short-term loans to encourage them to take up such treatments .
With these policies in place , infertile couples will less likely  be a burden to the social and economic aspect of an aging population .
Another way to ease the aging process is to encourage "active aging" , which refers to encouraging later retirement and longer working lives of each individual .
It is stated in CEC (2009) as "an orientation towards policies and practices including life-long learning , working longer , retiring later and more gradually , and engaging in capacity-enhancing and health sustaining activities .
Such practices aim to raise the average quality of individual lives and , at the same time , at a societal level , contribute to higher growth , lower dependency burdens and substantial cost savings in pensions and health .
They therefore represent win-win strategies for people of all ages ."
Nevertheless , this is a difficult task as the efficiency and productivity of elderly workers decreases with their increase in age .
This means that it is less likely to reduce elder dependency if there are no substantial benefits to employ such employees .
However , with the creation of new policies such as tax rebates , it will attract employers to hire older workers .
For example , giving tax rebates to employers who hire more than three workers aged 60 and above .
Besides targeting the employers , the government can try improving the productivity of elderly workers by offering training or retraining for employees above the age of 50 .
These schemes will equip the aging community with sufficient technological/technical knowledge to remain productive and efficient in the labor force despite  their disadvantages .
In conclusion , with the aid of the current technologies and governmental policies , countries can ease its aging process by increasing the fertility rates , encouraging filial obligations and active aging  , reducing elder dependency on government , and lastly , improving the productivity and efficiency of elderly workers .
With these in place , the impact of an aging population on the social and economic aspects will be greatly reduced .
In recent years , governments have been faced with the demographic reality of an aging population .
Main concern is that the graying population may cause the national economy to come under pressure as there will be less younger people to support the growing numbers of elderly .
The rise in the median age of a country can cause substantial burden to the economy because governments will have to incur huge spending on healthcare system to meet the needs of the growing demand of healthcare services .
However , current research and policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
Such policies include social policy like increasing the retirement age , allowing more employable immigrants into the country and introducing retirement schemes to ease basic needs after retirement .
The increase in retirement age will give people a few more years of earnings to build up social security and savings .
Karen Holden (2003) suggests that as people work longer , it can help to reduce the likelihood of the elderly falling into poverty when they reach a certain age .
This also allows them to lead a better quality life and support themselves so as to reduce the dependency on the younger generation for a longer period of time .
On the other hand , the increase in retirement age does not necessarily mean that people will be able to maximize their working years as some might be faced with health issues even before their retirement age .
Forcing oneself to work beyond his/her limit might cause one's health to further deteriorate and have a negative impact to the economy .
However , even if the elderly were to become inactive from the working society and rest at home , it does not mean that he/she will recover faster .
A greying population has created pressure for the younger generation as the ratio of young adults supporting one elderly has been constantly decreasing .
Therefore , allowing more employable immigrants into the country may be one of the social policies that can help to ease the aging process .
Increasing the number of employable immigrants will help to lower the median age of the population and at the same time , result in a rise in the efficiency level because of a more competitive workforce .
On the contrary , such policy can lead to social problems as the increased competition can result in citizens losing their job to the foreign immigrants and eventually causing them to lose confidence and feel demoralized .
However , the quote from Matthew Bandyk (2009) , "The evidence is actually pretty strong that immigrants create jobs--they don't steal them ."
can justify that the locals will have more job opportunities when foreign companies set up businesses here .
Policy to introduce retirement schemes is also believed to be one of the factors in easing the aging process .
Take Singapore as an example , the government has made it compulsory that every working adult must contribute a certain percentage of their monthly income into their individual CPF (Central Provident Fund) account in preparation for retirement .
This retirement scheme helps to reduce pressure on the economy as it allows the elderly to have a considerable sum of money in the future to support themselves .
Then again , savings in CPF account can be exhausted even before retirement depending on how it is used and a person's ability of saving .
People classified under lower income groups will usually face problems with insufficient savings and will ultimately still need support from the government .
However , this group of people is only the minority and that the retirement scheme will still make an overall impact on the economy as it can be deemed beneficial to the majority .
The social policies mentioned in the above paragraphs might be helpful in influencing the public on doing something individually which can affect the nation as a whole .
In summary , Social policies such as increasing the retirement age might result in lesser dependency on the younger generation while lowering the barrier of employable immigrants will decrease the median age of the population and lastly , the introduction of a retirement scheme can allow people to save for their retirement .
Therefore , it can be concluded that social policies do play a part , to a large extent , in easing the aging process .
The world population is expected to increase from 200million to 2 billion between 1950 to2050 , especially for people aged 60 and above (Somavia ,2002) .
It is becoming an increasingly important issue for governments all over the world .
Measures have been implemented to slowdown the process of a matured society (Peterson , n .d .) and at the same time cope with the problem brought about by an ageing population (Dobriansky ,2007) .
In the following paragraphs , issues on whether the government should redirect public funds to other more important matters concerning the country , or focus on improving the health of the aged by growing the resources especially for them .
The concerns that will be discussed if funds should be put into funding education and its facilities , and the growth of the country itself is  more paramount  with regards to the country's development .
Education is deemed one of the most vital matters concerning the public and it is of remarkable worth to the economy (Dobriansky ,2007) .
When majority of the funds are diverted into improving education facilities , the aged will not be able to save up enough money whilst actively working .
The reason for this is because bringing up children these days is expensive , which will result in a burden for parents .
So income earned by parents will be drained through educating children , and parents will have nothing to rely on when they age .
The government should implement schemes and insurance for parents to rely on instead of spending most funds on education facilities .
However , as stated by Afonso( 2008) , he implied that when there is high social spending together with good education , it will result in optimistic income distribution .
Afonso's view supports my stand that public funds being  diverting into the education system is fundamental .
In this case , governments can help parents to save whilst bringing up their children , this provides sufficient support due to aid by government for educating children .
With support provided by the government to educate children , parents can save a substantial amount while allowing their children to receive education .
Public education in Singapore is almost entirely financed by the government except for preschool education .
Singapore has a compulsory scheme for Singaporeans to save money for health-related issues through Medisave (StateUniversity .com , n .d .) .
Medisave is a contribution by every employee of about 6 .5-9% of his monthly salary to his personal account .
Funds can be used to settle hospital bills of the individual or his immediate family members , reducing the problem of having not enough monetary resources (Ministry of Manpower ,2007) .
Economic Growth is another issue that should not be neglected when a country is concerned about her development .
There should not be a diversion of public funds because economic growth is dependent on consumption , investments , and government expenditure (Alemohammad ,2009) .
Economic growth can be brought about through consumption and investments , not necessarily government incentives .
This means that public funds should be given to providing for the aged as economic growth can be dependent on other factors .
Conversely , as stated by Mackenzie (2009) , Canadians benefit amounts to $17 ,000 from the public services from tax funds , about the same amount a Canadian working full-time would earn .
Since extensive monetary benefits are given out to Canadians , it should not be a problem for them to cope with ageing as they can save while benefitting from government incentives .
In addition , economic growth can come about through diverting funds into more valuable areas like education .
Education worth directly affects individual earnings (Hanushek ,2007) .
Skills obtained allow for higher productivity in the workforce .
Young adults will be able to secure a well-paid job in the future; it will lead to higher consumption and investments (Saltz ,2007) .
Thus this leads to elevated economic growth and higher standard of living , and children will be able to look after their parents .
This means that through investing in children's higher education , the country is able to compensate for the decrease in public spending on the aged .
Hence , public funds should not be allocated solely to helping the aged .
At the beginning of the 21st century , we have to deal with a series of global issues , among them the aging population should be considered as a black spot .
Not only putting adverse impacts on other members in their families , the elderly  can cause many difficulties to societies'developments in general .
Beside the expense for societal aging , there are also sponsors from the government which need to be diverted to other fields .
For these reasons , it should be better if the money spent on the aged is deliberately limited for investing on many critical factors of the national economy .
To begin with , it cannot be denied that the governments have to care for elders partly because they weren't much concerned about their health in the past .
Along with the improvement of living standards , people have got used to the sedentary lifestyle - having a seat all day without any exercise .
Besides , during their adolescence , probably time for studying and various kinds of indoor entertainment such as movies or PC games constrained them from joining in outdoor activities and unintentionally stole the essential fundamentals for their health afterwards .
According to a study in 2004 , 20 percent of all deaths of people 35 and older were related to the lack of physical activities , even higher than those involved in smoking .
Moreover , because of the unawareness of humans , our damaged environment is really pushing us to the verge of  extinction .
Hence , before receiving public funds , aged people as well as their future generations should review their lifestyles to rescue themselves .
Secondly , the aged generation could strain national budgets .
When the aging population is excessive , this results in extra enormous expenditure and the government is pressured to ask the citizens for higher taxes .
However , once such taxes are applied , the poor unexpectedly become the first victims .
Naturally being full of financial issues , the more difficult and challenging life can push these innocent people to illegal behaviors .
Furthermore , due to high taxes , the reduced incomes of citizens could have negative impacts on their purchase and in the same way , the domestic market and the economy in general might be faced with a lot of trouble .
Countries with extended programs serving for health care to the aged might find the escalation in the cost when the number of recipients rise .
By 2050 , some economists predict that the fiscal burden of the financial crisis , for advanced countries , will be only about 10 percent of the age-related expense .
Additionally , it is clear that a nation's development is ruled by a lot of factors .
Some of them like education and military are compulsory and indispensable since they have unreplaceable roles in the destiny as well as a country's future .
For this reason , too much money paid for caring for the graying population means the shortage of concern on other essential areas .
Meanwhile , it might be recognized that public spending on the aged should be encouraged as a charity activity instead of being mandatory .
Why ?
The elderly can be looked after by their own families as a traditional aspect before relying on the support from the national budget .
Therefore , helping the aged on financial issues could not be the priority in a country's policies .
Proponents claim that the government should implement better policies to alleviate the aging population with increasing public spending on mainly medical benefits because illnesses catch up with them as they grow older and the expensive treatments could possibly wipe out their savings accounts .
Compared to other countries such as the USA Singapore does not have as much monetary reserves , therefore it is not feasible .
Singapore has already implemented adequate schemes such as Medishield and Medisave for citizens to pay medical fees which are also heavily subsidised .
Unlimited public spending on the aged would only pose  a long-term problem for the nation .
Instead , it should be diverted to other developments that can aid Singapore's future developments .
Public spending on the aged can be diverted to medical science development .
It can be utilized in more in-depth research that develops new and inexpensive medicinal drugs for the public .
With the occurrence and wide spread of mutant viruses and disease , medical research serves a greater purpose for survival of the infected patients and drugs can be manufactured in large quantities and be easily available for them .
New treatments can also be developed to cure the illnesses encountered by the aged .
Therefore , public spending on medical science not only benefits the aged but also the people  who are diagnosed with virus's or diseases .
In addition , public spending on the aged can be diverted to advancing science and technology .
As Singapore does not have its own natural resource , we can develop new ways to gain these resources in order to be self sufficient .
For example , water has to be purchased from foreign countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia .
If Singapore fails to maintain good relationships with these countries , our lives will be in jeopardy without water .
Fortunately , in the recent development of Newater , water can be 'renewed' .
The government should emphasize on developing new land for high technological agriculture .
Thus public spending in science and technology can alleviate the rising cost of food which deals with the problem of the increasing population .
In conclusion , the government should limit public spending on the aged and focus more on the major future developments which can help Singapore tackle the main problems that the majority of the local population faces , and also the root of the aging population .
Therefore , the aging population would be less of a burden to many politicians on how to allocate the national budget every year to cope with the problem .
Demographic changes such as a growing aging population will have an unprecedented problem in developed nations .
National budgets and economies will come under pressure as more funds are required to support the growing numbers of elderly persons .
In the context of Singapore , given the socio-economic and political disparity between the possible usages of the fund , the funding for the elderly issues remain controversial .
Ministry of Finance (2008) states that the Government will be contributing $226 million to top up Medisave accounts for the elderly .
The amount of public spending used to support the elderly has been seen as a more constructive expenditure on other areas of development of the nation .
To deal with such challenges , one of the options is to set boundaries on public spending on the aged .
However , setting limitations on public spending on the aged may or may not assist development of the nation but the changes may shatter the existing system .
With little economic growth and increasing expenditure to develop the nation , the majority of people regard the amount of public spending on the elderly can be used as a more constructive expenditure on other areas of developing the nation .
Ministry of Finance (2008) reports that many public infrastructure projects are financed by the Government through a combination of government grants , loans and user fees .
The budgett Speech in 2009 reveals the measures the Government is taking  to sustain the property market (Singapore Government , 2009) .
A 40% property tax rebate for industrial and commercial properties for 2009 will require about $800 million of the national budget (Singapore Government , 2009) .
These expenditures require the Government to explore possible ways to further utilize the national budget in order to continue to develop the nation .
Public policies assist the continuation of national development by encouraging education , research and development , and introducing the latest technologies to its people .
With the power of knowledge and advance technology , the nation can improve its economy and ensure that the well-being of current and future generations of older people is taken care of .
Public spending on the elderly in Singapore is carefully designed , so as to provide the needs of the aged in the best possible way , but the fund is insufficient to support the growing aging population .
Medifund Silver is introduced to provide means-tested socialized care for the needy elderly (The ministry of Finance , 2008) .
Ministry of Finance (2008) states that the Government will be providing $226 million in Medisave top-ups for 734 ,000 elderly in the nation , this amount of assistance cost breaks down to about $290 per elder .
MediShield covers more than 90% of the working population and almost 80% of the population (Ministry of Finance , 2008) .
On an individual basis , the elderly are ill-equipped to withstand the possibility of contracting a terminal disease , from the calculations from the Ministry of Health (2009) , a $2 ,227 treatment bill for  heart treatment is likely to devastate most retirees .
To increase the livelihood of the elderly , Dr Balakrishnan (2007) announced an increment of $30  .Forr the elderly living alone with no dependents will receive Public Assistance allowance of $290 per month .
All in all , Medifund Silver , Medisave and MediShield are focused and realistic approaches targeted to lessen the financial burden on future generations yet due to the insufficient fund , the current amount of public spending is not enough to sustain the basic necessity for elderly .
An agingderly people failed ano accumulate enough funds before retirement , they have to rely a lot on their children .
However , the younger generation have heavy financial burdens to take care of their own families and sometimes are unable to support their parents .
For example , in a Singaporean middle class familya retirementcouple usually has twhelp ease four children and lives in a governmental or private house with moforgage .
They have to work hard to provide the basic necessities of life , such as food , clothes , education etc .
In this harsh for dealingon , the elderly paof anave no incomes and no savings become a big financial strain to the young .
When the health conditions of the elderly people become bad , the financial burden on the young becomes overwhelming .
In some cases , an expensive medical bill can even lead a prosperous family to bankruptcy .
When the young are exposed to both financial and emotional stresses , they cannot concentrate on work .
Finally , it negatively affects the society by decreasing productivity and economic growth .
their workSome people think that the government has obligation to help the elderly by providing financial aid .
It seems that the young can shift the liability and solve the financial problem , but these excessive government subsidies will result in draining the public purse quickly .
The government has to increase taxes in order to fill vacanciehaveConsequently , the tax payers , mainly the younger generation who are productive , will pay even more taxes .
In many European countries , the unemployed people receive unemployment benefits from the government .
On the other hand , the jobholders hincomepay more taxes .
High welfare always comes with Relying merely on governmental subsidies does not solve the problem .
On the contrary , the government should coman obligation to save a certain portion of their incomes into special retirement accounts before they reach retirement age and allow the owners to withdraw the money when they retire .
The government could also give subsfunds to encourage the public to do so , for instance , offering a reasonably high interest rate .
Singaporean government has been doing well in this respect .
All Singaporean must save 5 percent of their total incomes and their employers contribute additional 20 percent into a government retirement account .
The government provides a 4 percent annual interest rate which is relatively higher than many commercial banks .
There are two reasons that the Singaporean government to do so .
One is to give confidence to the public; the other one is to help them to mitigate the effects of inflation .
Most Singaporean are expected to accumulate sufficient amount for retirement with the help of this system .
foran additionalwhileincomeSingaporeansThe SingaporeAging population is a social problem as well as an individual problem .
The government haincomensibility to help and guide the public to plan their retirement life .
Furthermore , the public must take care of themselves .
Providing retirement fund in advance is a long term project and this can only be achieved by raising public consciousness .
Public spending , in terms of taxes , refers to the sum of money charged by the government for specific facilities or services , levied upon incomes , property , sales , and more .
Some of the taxes include Income Tax , Property Tax , as well as Goods and Services Tax (GST) .
This strategy suggested is feasible to a large extent .
Public spending should be limited to a certain degree so that the budget would be diverted to different areas such as education , research and development , tourism  and the transportation system of the country .
The most basic yet important area of the country's development would be education .
In most countries , education is considered to be one of the fundamental sectors that the country's government can develop and improve on .
It is the base system of the country that imparts knowledge to the people and keeps a majority of them employed .
For that reason , the process of education is considered to be essential for the development of our society such that every child has to go through a minimum of ten years of basic education .
It has also become such an indispensable part of our lives that to the majority of people , it appears to be a norm to complete the whole process of the education .
It is crucial that the country has a good education system for  future economic development .
However , on the other hand , there should be limited , but adequate percentage of public spending allocated to the aged  .
The reason being , many elderly are being neglected by their own children , and thus uninsured .
They might not have enough money to get their regular medical checkups done .
So , does this means that they will die ?
This problem will continue to get worse every year if there is  inadequate attention paid .
Though it is important to solve the problem of the graying society , we should limit our public spending in this sector so that we can  budget for other aspects of a country's development , such as the transportation infrastructure .
A significant level of road traffic can be created due to the high density of an urban environment .
This can have a great impact on businesses and environmental factors .
Therefore , careful planning and development of the transportation system are crucial .
More money should be used to develop this infrastructure in order to support the moving of goods from one place to another efficiently and effectively .
Parking space is another concern .
For example , in Singapore where land scarcity poses a big issue , multi-storey carparks are built to allow more vehicles to be parked given the same land area used .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited to a certain percentage that is adequate for the welfare of the aged .
On top of that , public spending should also be diverted across different aspect of social concerns that lead to the development of Singapore .
By putting a limit for the spending on the aged , we can create more budgets to spend on  education , research and development , tourism industry and transportation system as they are equally important to our nation .
No , I do not agree with the statement .
Current researches and development/polices have indeed eased the aging process but only to a small extent .
The aging issues that today's elderly face include active life expectancy , diet/nutrition , disease prevention , health behaviors and beliefs , health service utilization , mental health , long term care  etc .
The technological advancement in medical science will be discussed to address some of the issues mentioned .
With investment in technologies , it provides new opportunities for medical interventions .
For example , Stem Cell technology greatly helps to aid the discovery of new medicines by improving the process of developing new compounds .
By adopting this technology , we can now develop medicines that are safer and more effective .
This is necessary to help ease the aging process .
Moreover , with recent advances in science , more treatments can be developed to treat disease .
These treatments will be helpful because people get increasingly susceptible to chronic illnesses .
However , with new development of treatments , it will mean that there will be an increase in health care cost .
This will lead to an increase in burden for the elderly .
In the context of Singapore , to address this issue , various financial health care schemes like Medisave and Medishield are implemented to help lessen the financial burden for the elderly .
Technology and its advancements have given medical science the forefront to ease the aging process .
Another example will be the invention of nutritional supplements .
Research has found out that by taking nutritional supplements on a daily basis  ,it can provide significant health benefits for the elderly , reducing the possibilities of them falling sick .
There are current on-going research on the different types of dietary supplements that can reverse disease , improve the overall health of the elderly and help them to live a longer , happier life .
This in turn slows down the ageing process and promotes a healthy lifestyle .
However , some nutritional supplements have harmful side effects .
It contains addictives that can deteriorate the health of the elderly .
Preventive measures can be taken by referencing medical brochures/guides , or consulting the doctor on the suitable type of supplements to consume if one has a medical history .
Such well-tested medical products have helped to ease the aging process .
When people grow older , they have to cope with the physical , mental and emotional stresses of being old . .
These stresses will cause negative influences on health as it affects our bodily functions .
However , social policy can address such issues to make the aging process less painful for the elderly .
For example , the Singapore government has introduced a pilot wellness programme for the elderly Singaporeans in an effort to promote a healthy lifestyle among them and also engaged them socially .
The key components are mainly regular medical-check ups and follow up , regular exercises , and social networking .
By exercising , the elderly improves their overall health and helps to prevent chronic diseases .
Social networking helps the elderly battle against loneliness and makes new friends .
All these factors improve the overall quality of life for the elderly .
However , social policy has to be revised  to address the changing needs of the elderly .
With effective social policy , it will help to slow down the aging process .
However , the easing of the aging process does not only depend on the above factors .
Other factor includes individual's responsibility on maintaining a healthy diet/nutrition .
So what type of foods should the elderly consume According to Neilmark (2008) , The foods that decrease inflammation in the body are called "anti-inflammatory foods ."
These foods help stop the aging of our cells and help restore youth and vitality to our body and mind .
Elderly should adopt The Best Longevity Diet Around .
According to Neilmark (2008) , he defined it as eat fewer calories .
Eat no processed foods .
Eat no fried foods .
Take an ultra-refined fish oil supplement .
Exercise moderately .
Stop stressing: your mental diet .
Remain calm emotionally: your emotional diet .
?
In conclusion , current research and development/polices has helped to ease the aging process but only to a small extent .
Technology can be used as a solution to cope with the current healthcare challenges we are faced with .
However , in the future , healthcare systems have to be reformed to deal with the increased needs of healthcare support required by the aged .
While the advancement in healthcare industry can help prevent diseases and other consequences of aging , medicine alone is inadequate .
A healthy lifestyle is important for the elderly to enable them to cope with stresses physically , emotionally and mentally .
It also helps to reduce the risk of disease .
An ageing population is currently a global phenomenon that occurs in many parts of the world .
Singapore has currently one of the fastest growing ageing population in Asia , with the current one in twelve citizens being the age of 65 and over set to increase to every one in five in 2030 .
Hence , public spending on the aged in Singapore has a high possibility of rising in order to cope with the shift in aging structure .
However , limitations should be set on the public spending on the aged to a large extent in order to promote the country's development in other areas .
In Singapore , where there is a reasonably low birth rate and top-notch health care which helps prolong people's lives , population aging is inevitable , hence being prospective-looking , the strategy that is feasible would be to reallocate  funds and attention to other areas , in particular , Education and Tourism .
The diversion of capital into the Education Sector will enable Singapore to identify more opportunities .
Singapore is presently building an education hub in Asia , investing millions of funds to boost her image and economy .
As foreign students start pouring into Singapore , it is projected that education services will generate about five percent of the gross domestic product .
Moreover , a high quality education system will be beneficial for the next generation , as exhibited by the ripple effect .
The increased education quality will extend an average Singaporean's working span allowing an increase accumulation of savings .
This will indirectly help to solve some of the problems posed by an ageing population , as it will help to reduce elderly dependency and changing Singapore into an independent society where elderly will be less reliant on the government .
The tourism industry is another area Singapore should divert her funds into as the industry is highly influential , affecting other related industries such as the hotel and service industries .
The tourism industry posted high revenue of S$14 .8 billion in 2008 , a 4 .8% increase from 2007 .
This increase has demonstrated the potential of Singapore's tourism industry and making full use of every opportunity presented in this sector will be vital , owing to the colossal impact this industry has on other industries .
For instance , the upcoming Integrated Resorts (IR) will without a doubt stimulate a positive impact on the economy , both financially and image-wise .
Therefore , by reallocating more funds and attention to this industry , it will bring about a positive change in the Singapore tourism industry and economy as a whole .
Nevertheless , the choice to not limit the public spending on the aged will only help to solve today's problem of the ageing population .
On the other hand , diverting capital to the education and tourism sectors will not only help with the country's developments , but will also help to solve the current problems with today's generation of the aged .
This win-win situation will allow Singapore to embrace itself for the future challenges and reduce elder dependency .
In conclusion , the decision whether to limit public spending for the aged in order to divert it into other areas is a very debatable issue .
With many pros and cons on both sides , this issue will definitely meet many different opinions from different people .
Nonetheless , the decision to divert funds to other area's for development such as education and tourism will be the most viable one , solely because of the fact that not only does it help with Singapore's development , but also coping with challenges that arises with an  ageing population indirectly with time to come .
Hence , Singapore should continue to focus and direct her attention and spending onto the tourism and education sector so as to reinforce the country's development and strength .
Old age , for a normal person , is the last stage that one has to go through in his life .
This is the stage when the elderly have to face the changes in their physical appearances and also mental sensitiveness .
They start to have wrinkles on their face and their hair colour turns gray or white .
Their memory power starts to become weak and they tend to forget things easily .
This aging process has made old people suffer from functional and mental disabilities , causing them to feel inferior and being alienated .
This is the time when the psychological practitioners and the government have to step in to help ease the aging process of the elderly .
Psychological treatments have helped the elderly to cope with their emotional problems .
People tend to be emotionally unstable when they reach old age .
This is because they feel they are not capable of doing things that they can do when they were still young .
They have problems getting promoted or hired because of their age , and also are afraid of being asked to retire earlier , causing them to have work pressure .
Special care that they receive from their family members and the society makes them feel old , and indirectly contributes to their emotional problems .
These may , sometimes , lead to depression .
Most people think that psychological treatments are meant for those who have serious mental problems .
They feel ashamed and choose not to approach psychologists when they are emotionally unstable or depressed .
It is this kind of misconception they possess which causes their mental illness to worsen A professional person , in this case , the psychologists , can offer help by counselling the elderly and giving them useful advice to encourage them that they are not the group of people who always require special help from the others , and also to let them feel that they are accepted by the society .
The government can help ease the aging process of the elderly through the implementation of social policies which encourage later retirement , longer working life and lower barrier for the employment of the elderly (Peterson , 2001) .
By working longer , the elderly can accumulate more wealth , which can be used in their post-retirement life .
Some people may say that old people's working ability starts to decrease when they approach retirement age .
The aging workforce will then decrease  work productivity and lower the nations economic development .
However , it is proven by John Rowe and Robert Kahn in their study that those who continue to work and participate in social activities after their retirement life are very unlikely to experience physical and mental decline .
There are still a portion of elderly persons who age successfully .
The working experiences of some elderly individuals can be  a good asset to the development of the society .
Therefore , in order to introduce this policy , the government has increased the retirement age of working persons , and has given fewer incentives to fund their after-retirement life , so that they will prolong their working life .
In conclusion , psychological treatments such as counselling and also the implementation of government's social policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Although it has become an arising issue that the aging population will have a great impact on society and also the economic growth of the country , more emphasis should be given to the older generation , as they are an important asset to the nation .
Therefore , more measures have to be taken to make the aging process an easier one for the elderly .
In general , our society is aging and there are problems associated with an aging population .
In Asia , Singapore is one of the fastest aging populations .
According to Inter-Ministerial Committee on Aging Report (1999) , currently 7% of its population is over the age of 65 , and this number will increase to 19% by 2030 .
There are three broad aspects of problems associated with the ageing process , namely the physical , emotional and financial aspect .
Physically , the aged will feel weak and body ailments will increase as a result of wear and tear of the body .
Emotionally , the elderly will feel lonely as their parents , friends and in some cases their life partner has departed .
Financially , the old no longer work and they can only depend on their savings or their children for their daily expenses .
Current policies such as Medisave , HDB's rules on housing where the young live near their parent and parents' maintenance act are therefore put in place .
Unfortunately , these policies have played a little role to ease the aging process for most of the elderly .
Currently , there are policies implemented to help the aging population in three different areas , physical , emotional and financial .
First , the elderly have weaker health and are more susceptible to chronic illnesses .
Medisave policy is introduced to aid in healthcare needs such as paying hospitalization expenses and selected outpatient treatments .
Next , to meet the elderly needs of emotional support , the government implemented additional grants on HDB housing to foster family bonding .
To illustrate , if couples are staying near or together with their parents , they have priority over regular applicants when they apply for new HDB flat .
Similarly , those buying resale flats benefit from a higher housing grant , approximately an additional of 10 ,000 dollar .
In this way , it enables the young to continuously get in touch with their parents .
Moreover , the elderly can help to take care of their children , if any .
Lastly , the  elderly lose income upon retirement , therefore , they have to depend on their savings or children for their expenses .
In cases where the elderly cannot support themselves financially and their children refuse to take care of them , Maintenance of Parents Act had been implemented in 1996 .
Consequently , parents can demand financial maintenance from their children through family court .
On the contrary , "the elderly will use between three and five times more health-care services compared to the younger generation" (Straits Times , 2007) , thus Medisave would be still inadequate to assist most of the elderly in their course of aging .
Besides , Medisave can be easily drained especially on chronic illnesses , which can tote up to a huge amount .
Furthermore , women of older generation in Singapore had particularly low average incomes because they received lesser education .
As a result , the amount of money in their Medisave will be very limited .
Moreover , most of the aged Singaporeans are not insured by anything else .
In essence , most of the old remains incapable to afford their medical expenses despite with the help of Medisave .
Even though it is essential for the government to allocate public spending on the aged since the effects of the ageing population will impact the national economy and society , unlimited funding on the aged may have negative implications on the economy .
By 2030 , the number of elderly in Singapore will increase to 18 .7% and the number of working persons supporting one elderly person will decrease to 3 .5 persons .
These statistics have proven that population aging is enduring and this means that tackling the challenges that come along with it is a long term process for the government and government spending on the aged will continue to increase .
Hence , unlimited funding instead of proper allocation of public spending on the aged may drain the economy .
Since a primary source of revenue for public spending comes from taxation , the government will have to increase the tax rates in order to finance its unlimited spending on the ageing population .
This may lead to unhappiness in and weariness of the working population especially given that the number of working persons supporting an elderly has decreased .
High levels of taxation may also lead to a decrease in domestic and foreign investments .
Unlimited funding may discourage people from staying employed and accumulating savings to see them through their old age as they may have the tendency to rely on the benefits provided by the government .
Unemployment will cause the workforce to shrink and result in an economic slowdown .
Therefore , it is important for the government to develop policies like the Central Provident Fund Scheme that helps the government to limit spending and assist the elderly to be self sufficient at the same time .
As the only natural resource available in Singapore is people , human capital is crucial to the survival and progress of the nation .
Hence , the Singapore government should be far-sighted to see the value of education and should set aside funds to continue investing in it .
In order to have a well-trained workforce to cope with a knowledge-based economy of the 21st century , the government has to provide  more funds to ensure that the people are receiving a more all-rounded education by introducing a more extensively planned academic program , building more educational institutions and hiring and training more educators .
The Singapore government has unveiled in its 2001 concept plan that the vision for Singapore in the 21st century is to become a thriving world-class city .
In order to become a world-class city , the government has to pump in funds to rejuvenate and upgrade existing areas for living and working , creating more recreational space and continue to develop the commercial and industrial sectors .
A world-class city also means that the nation should be safe and secure .
Thus , the government also has to invest in research and development of defense technology which can deter small and vulnerable Singapore from any potential invasion .
As evident , the government has to handle many areas of concerns with regards to developing the nation into a world-class city .
Therefore , the government may require several years and a huge amount of public spending to achieve the vision of becoming a world-class city .
The challenges that come along with an ageing population are unavoidable and Singapore has to make preparations now to confront them .
Even though the government has implemented measures such as the CPF scheme and building of more healthcare institutions , more remains to be done .
As the pace of population ageing increases with time , the issues may become more complex because of the changing expectations and preferences of the population .
With a demand for a higher standard of living , the government may have to divert more public spending to look after the increasing needs of the aged .
However , as the government also needs to focus public spending on other areas of developments , the government can look into adopting an integrated approach which urge better cooperation between key agencies and emphasize the need for community support .
Everyone has a responsibility to assist seniors living among us and people need to change their mindset of seeing the elderly as  a burden to the society when in actual fact , the elderly are the knowledgeable and experienced resources of the society .
According to the United Nations (UN) the number of elderly people has tripled in the past 50 years and will continue to rise in the near future .
In developed countries , the median age rose from 29 .0 in 1950 to 37 .3 in 2000 , and is forecasted to increase to 45 .5 by 2050 .
Declining fertility , along with longer life expectancy , attributes to an aging population .
In order to cope with the rising numbers of elderly , the government has increased public spending on health care programs and subsidiaries .
Although an aging population is a global phenomenon , public spending should also be allocated in other areas of the country's development such as tourism or housing to help increase economic growth , to make Singapore a global city .
One of the major problems the elderly face today is the lack of financial security .
Singapore is not a welfare state unlike countries such as America and the United Kingdom .
Elderly who were not able to save enough will face the problem of making ends meet when they are old .
Furthermore , global inflation and rising medical costs will add to their financial burden .
Thus , their only solution is to turn to the government for assistance .
The Singapore government has recently introduced a new CPF policy which provides lifelong income for the elderly , instead of the current policy where payouts only last about 20 years .
However , such programs are a burden on the country's budget .
Tourism is an important aspect that Singapore could further dispense its budget on .
According to the Singapore Tourism Board , in 2006 , Singapore achieved a record of 9 .7 million visitors , compared to 8 .9 million in 2005 .
An estimated sum of $12 .4 billion was spent .
Singapore hopes to achieve a record of 17 million visitors by the year 2015 .
With such a high volume of tourists , more hotel rooms are required to accommodate them .
Strong competition from the region also requires Singapore to be unique from its neighbouring countries .
With no natural attractions and little resources , Singapore has no choice but to create man-made attractions such as resorts and casinos , or to come up with attractions that is only attractive to foreigners .
Such attractions require large amounts of money .
However , the benefits outweighs the negatives as it helps to create more jobs and attract foreign investors to invest in its thriving tourism which will help boost the country's GDP .
Education is also a very important development in a Global City .
The lack of education is one of the problems that elderly face in today society , thus leading to poor financial management .
As Singapore is small and doesn't have any natural resources , it is shaping its economy into a knowledge-based economy .
In order to achieve such goals , more resources should be channeled into the education system , such as providing additional funds to needy students , which allows them to break out of their poverty cycle; improving the infrastructures of schools and universities; and recruiting more teachers .
With a better education system , it allows Singaporeans to enter the workforce with better skills and increases their employability , thus preventing the problems which current the elderly are facing  .
Housing is also another major issue that Singapore faces .
Singapore currently has a population of slightly more than 4 million people .
The average population density is about 6814 per km  , thus it is one of the most crowded cities in the world .
To cope with the increasing population , more high-rise residential buildings known as HDB flats arebeing builtt .
These flats are heavily subsidised by the government to make it affordable .
More money should be invested in older flats , such as providing upgrades to the current facilities to improve the quality of life of citizens living in such areas .
Public spending on the elderly should not be removed .
However the government may have to consider limiting it .
Without limiting it , there will be over dependence on the government , worsening the current situation  .
If public spending is allocated to areas such as housing , education and tourism , the new generation will be more financially secure than their parents .
It will also help Singaporeans to stay ahead and be competitive in terms of employability and marketability , furthermore contributing to the country's GDP growth which helps in the overall  development of the country  the long term .
In 2007 , a Financial Times's reporter  mentioned that with the low fertility rate and an increase in life expectancy , Singapore would soon have only 2 .2 workers to support each elderly person[i] .
With such a low number of working adults to support the elderly , there would be a need for the government to at least maintain its current expenditure on the aged .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be overly limited .
Though public spending should be used fully on the aged , there are other areas of concern that the government money should be diverted to , such as the healthcare system .
Recently , the Singapore Prime Minister , Mr Lee Hsein Loong ,  stressed the need for a step down care system during his National Day Rally Speech for the nation's 44th birthday .
The step-down care system requires Singapore  hospitals to link with community hospitals , this , in turn , will enable long term  patients to enjoy a suitable care while saving money on hospital fees .
As the community hospitals charge less .
However , Singapore should not make use of the budget for the aged to improve other areas .
This is because Singapore will be suffering from an aging population by the time it reaches year 2030 .
If public spending for the aged is not well utilised for the next few years , Singapore will be having problems when the time comes .
Though the government has encouraged children to fulfill filial obligations by taking care of their parents , with their own family to take care of , children of these elderly parents would not be able to bare the financial burden .
This further emphasizes the need for a helping hand .
For the past decade , the Singapore government has  been emphasizing the value of self reliance on its citizen despite the economic ups and downs .
Policies , such as the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , has been implemented to ensure that Singaporeans are able to support themselves after retirement .
However , recently , many found that the amount is insufficient to keep up with the rising cost of medical fees , resulting in the use of the children's CPF account .
Currently , the common age group of children , whose parents are elderly , are in their late 40s or early 50s , and it is common that the children's CPF account is emptied because of the hefty medical bills .
If this vicious cycle continues , the future generation will suffer .
An extreme example would be when a grandfather uses and depletes the CPF account of the parents , and when the children grow and their parents suffer from long term illness , such as diabetes , they may use their CPF account if they do not have sufficient cash on-hand .
Therefore , the government should not limit their public spending on the aged .
In the above paragraph , the vicious cycle occurs when the elderly depend on their children but , what will happen to the elderly if the children refuse to fulfil their filial obligations ?
As a matter of fact , these old folks will be left on their own , with the support from welfare organisations .
However , for most cases , welfare organisations can only help in getting daily necessities for them .
When it comes to financial assistance , the welfare organisation , too , will have difficulty in helping the elderly .
This is because donations from the public are used to support the basic daily operations of these organizations , thus leaving little or nothing to help these old folks financially .
This , therefore , requires  further assistance from their next supporting pillar: the government .
Though decades of self-reliance has taught Singaporeans to stand firm and learn how to support themselves and their family  , now they can no longer do so .
With the rising cost of medical facilities , the elderly with the support of their children could no longer rely on their own CPF accounts and their children's income to pay the fees .
If such scenarios are already occurring to those elderly who have family , the situation would be worse for old folks who have no one to turn to except for the government .
If the government refuses to help these people who had once contributed to the country , who can they rely on ? ?
Therefore , even if public spending is required in other areas , public spending on the aged should not be limited .
As the saying goes "Time and tide wait for no man" , ageing is an inevitable process one has to face .
As an individual grows older , one will become more susceptible to various ailments and diseases that may render one incapacitated in some way or other .
(Illnesses of The Elderly , 2008) .
Moreover , one will become physically weak as one ages and this will lead a higher tendency to cause a lesion to oneself .
Thus , accessibility in the built environment is especially crucial as the number of people with mobility difficulties will increase significantly over the next 25 years in Singapore () .
This leads to a sudden need of facilities and technologies to cater for this particular group .
Consequently , the government has implemented several policies to lessen the burden of the ageing process while researchers have come up with brilliant inventions to increase the convenience and comfort level for the majority .
To put it simply , the technological inventions' researches and architectural policies have helped to ease the ageing process to a great extent in terms of convenience and comfort level .
However , the  ageing process is putting a strain on users' pockets financially even though the introduction of the facilities benefits them in terms of comfort and convenience .
To illustrate , although the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) that is introduced in Singapore is heavily subsidised by the government and the Town Councils , the beneficiaries are still required to pay a large sum in order to enjoy the benefits .
The maximum amount which the flat owners have to pay is capped at $3 ,000 (HDB , 2006) , and this amount is not a diminutive amount .
Although the residents have to pay to enjoy the benefits of convenience , the amount of benefits enjoyed by the residents are definitely more than the value that they have to contribute , in terms of long-term usage .
Seeing that , the policies or acts that were implemented under Building Construction Authority (BCA) and Housing Development Board (HDB) have improved the standard of living for the people .
The BCA states that "a $40-million Accessibility Fund had been set aside to upgrade buildings built before 1990 .
This fund is also used to upgrade all key areas and essential facilities in Singapore to provide at least essential accessibility by 2011" (BCA , 2009) .
Under this scheme , the LUP is introduced and it is designed to improve the flat's access and personal convenience by the Singapore government in 2001 (HDB , 2006) .
Since lifts in HDB blocks that were built before 1990 are not providing 100% access to every level , any existing building under Housing Development Board (HDB , 2006) will be altered and added with lifts that stop at every floor .
This change has made a significant change to the residents , especially elders who are physically weak .
Thus , there will be no need for them to climb the staircase where they might have the tendency to fall when using it .
Other than the LUP , Singapore government has also inputted public ramps to ease elders from climbing the stairs under the same scheme .
These strategies have aided in easing the ageing process effectively .
To give an example , The Straits Times on 31 August 2009 , reported that two new ramps , a covered shelter connecting the 20-year-old station to the nearest bus stop in Yishun Avenue 2 , as well as an additional drop-off point have been constructed for the elderly residents living at Nee Soon South , where it housed approximately 50 ,000 elderly residents (The Straits Times , 2009) .
Hence , the government policies with regard to architecture have helped to ease the ageing process effectively .
On the contrary , with the alteration made to the flats , the elders might rely too much on the lifts rather than using the staircase which could be the only form of exercise for them .
Thus , the convenience might unintentionally exacerbate the health of one being due to the lack of exercise .
Due to the fact that negative effects occur when one is too dependent on the usage of facilities , the town council has solved this problem by building Fitness Parks for elders to exercise to maintain a healthy body .
Moreover , the elders would have a more conducive place for them to do exercises as well as to treat it as a place for gathering .
Hence , the government policies with regard to architecture have helped to ease the ageing process effectively .
Besides that , other countries such as Japan that is facing ageing population problems have spent a large  amount on researching and testing on technologies to create healthy lifestyle products and medical equipment .
Therefore , the end products produced in terms of medical and lifestyle products will be costly and unaffordable to purchase for those financially weak elders and thus , not many elders will be enjoying the benefits .
This means that the elders will either have to work , use their savings or to approach their relatives for money to buy the products .
Hence , the elders who use these methods to obtain the products will only worsen their ageing process with financial worries .
Despite the fact that the end products might be expensive , it is still beneficial .
technological inventions have played another imperative role to ease the process of ageing .
Numerous innovations have been developed to ease the problems faced by everyone .
With the help of bio-technology , various types of massaging equipments and machines have been invented to ease the process of ageing .
This technology usually helps to ameliorate the health of users such as improving blood circulation , which helps users to have a healthier body; especially for elders who tend to have weaker bodies .
As these equipments or machines may calm down , give strength , relax the body , improves self-sensation and trigger regeneration mechanisms (The "Medical Club Ltd" , 2008) .
For example , OSIM has come up with many innovative healthy lifestyle products that provide such benefits .
In addition , there is a robotic suit that reads brain signals and helps people with mobility problem ()  launched in Japan , .
It is an invention that may have far-reaching benefits for the disabled and elderly .
Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is a computerized suit fitted with sensors that read brain signals directing limb movement through the skin of user .
() .
This is extremely beneficial for elders who have lost the strength to handle daily's needs .
Hence , their lives could be eased by using this invention .
To sum up ,  current research has done a marvelous job on inventing new technologies that have helped to ease the ageing process of elders and the disabled .
The advanced technologies have proven to enhance the comfort zone with  sophisticated medical equipment and lifestyle electronic products .
Over the past few decades  technological advances has increased significantly .
At the same time , the aging trend somehow seemed to have caught up with it .
The post war baby-boom generation is now starting to age , due to advancement in medical science and increased standards of living .
The average life expectancy has also increased , meaning that the elderly population will form a majority of the population  .
More emphasis will have to be placed to catering to the needs of the elderly , so that they can transit into the aging phase more easily .
Thanks to modern research and development , the aging process has been made less painful not only to the elderly , but to the societies as well .
As a person ages , physical changes in one's body occurs and their functions degrade with time .
Traits such as one's mobility , as well as visibility will be significantly reduced as compared to their younger days .
The chances of injury increases with age , as proven by statistics .
It was observed that more than one third of the elderly fall each year , and the chances of falling increases proportionately with age , and that three quarters of elderly falls were caused by "non-elderly friendly" design flaws of buildings .
If this trend were to carry on , national budgets and economies will come under pressure , as a large sum of money will have to be spent taking care of the elderly .
As a result some government campaigns might have to be delayed or even cancelled due to shortage of funds .
Therefore , a prevention measure , in the form of upgrading public facilities have been implemented to prevent this from happening .
One way is through advancement in technology .
Technology has always been beneficial to man .
With each passing day , technology evolves and moulds new inventions which can make life better , and easier .
Technological inventions can help the elderly overcome the limitations of their body due to old age or sickness , and in a way , prevent accidents from happening due to these limitations .
This can be achieved through introduction of inventions such as step-free buses , which helps ease the difficulty of elderly climbing up the steps of the bus .
Other inventions such as slip proof tiles and solvents can effectively cut down the possibility of falls due to slippery surfaces .
We are living in a concrete jungle , and as the population ages , the design of the structure has to evolve accordingly so as to cater to the needs of the people staying in it .
Architectural design with elder  friendly considerations will be crucial so that the chances of an injury in their homes will be kept to a minimal .
As stated earlier , proven through statistics , three quarters of elderly falls were caused by "non- elderly friendly" design flaws of buildings .
A series of upgrades are therefore implemented , in countries like Singapore and The United Kingdom , engaged in the 'UP' project .
In this project , buildings are being modified so that the lifts can stop at every level of the building .
By doing so , it effectively reduced the chances of the elderly having to use the stairs .
There has also been an increase in usage of slip free tiles in wet markets , a place frequented by the elderly .
Distress warning devices were also installed at every elderly home unit to ensure that they have a channel to call for help in event of trouble .
However , these are long term investments and the advantages will surface as time goes by .
Furthermore , people , being a country's most valuable asset who have once contributed to the economy during their prime , should be entitled to all these inventions which will make their age transition less painful .
In a way its a form of 'paying back' by the government for their contributions to the country's development over the past few decades .
It is no longer a secret that our society is facing an aging population problem .
The government faces great challenges as the increase in the proportion of elderly aged 65 years and above grew from 7 .4 percent in the year 2003 to 8 .5 percent in the year 2007 [ .
There are many conflicts regarding the welfare of the elderly , for example , the government has been blamed for neglecting the emotional needs of the elderly .
Such situations cannot be helped in the short run .
Nevertheless , the current research and development and policies have helped to minimize the painful effects of the aging process .
As the world developsand progresses in medical science as well as in other fields , fields it has enabled the human race to make suitable changes .
These changes allow us to fight diseases , as well as make improvements in the quality of life .
The main objective of this report is to discuss and analyze the extent to which these various factors have helped ease the aging process .
Thirdly , the relief of the aging process can be established through family obligation .
This is achieved as people are encouraged or compelled by the law to carry out their duty as offsprings .
The Family Court of Singapore has established laws to ensure that an adult child has to put forth effort to support their own parents through informal and familial channels , for example: Parents Maintenance Act .
Thus , this gives a form of security to the elderly that they are loved by their children .
The change in the research and development of the country is so rapid that the elderly finds it difficult to catch up with the changes around us .
The world has become so IT savvy that almost all trades require employees to be equipped with IT skills .
As a result , the elderly are often rejected when searching for a job due to their inadequate skill set .
Thus , this gives an impression to the  aged that they are redundant and useless in the society .
Low self-esteem grows in the hearts of the elderly and can cause psychological instability , especially when they have been the head of the family in the past .
This drastic change cancause the elderly to be unable to keep up with the pace of the society .
Equipping of skills can be done with the support of the government by encouraging the elderly to take up courses at an affordable price .
Therefore , it enables the elderly to make use of the skills learnt to join the workforce , enabling them to increase their esteem level .
An ageing population or what has been coined the "silver tsunami" is a phenomena faced by developed countries around the globe and Singapore is no exception .
Currently , one in 12 of the population is above 65 , but this has been projected to hit one in five by 2030 .
(Lee , 2009) .
Factors such as improvements in sanitation , medical technology , and public health awareness have raised the life expectancy of Singaporeans , resulting in an ageing population in Singapore .
The challenge of an aging situation will cause social issues such as the shrinking workforce to be faced with an increasing burden of supporting the elderly .
In 2000 , one elderly person was supported by 9 .8 working persons .
This will decrease to 3 .5 working persons per elderly person by the year 2030 (Vasoo , Ngiam , and Cheung , 2000) .
This sharp reduction in labour growth is expected to cause the average GDP expansion to slow to 3 .9 per cent between 2006 and 2030 , down from 6 .9 per cent from 1981 to 2005 .
Thus it is crucial to solve the issue of an aging population as it has a domino effect on the social and economic aspects of the society .
Thirdly , the healthcare cost in Singapore currently accounts for 4 .5% of the gross national expenditure , being one of the lowest figures compared to countries such as Sweden and the United Kingdom .
A research report by Nanyang Technological University's David Reisman highlighted that 36% of health-care expenditure was government financed in Singapore in 2007 .
This was comparable to the percentages of much poorer and less developed countries such as Indonesia and Zimbabwe .
However , the recent global economic crisis and inflation in Singapore have caused the government to focus on the economic aspect of the society in an effort to bring Singapore out of a recession .
The building of the Integrated Resort is one example of Singapore's economic decision to spend money in this area of the economy where rewards are deemed to be centred on .
Defence which the government has spent quite a huge sum on , aims to protect the nation from increased threats of other countries and finally education which  is important in grooming the future leaders of society .
These are just some examples of other areas of the government's expenditure .
Therefore , although it is true that Singapore comparatively spent less , we have to balance it with other crucial sectors .
"Aging does not denote a process at all , but merely describes a medley of unhappy outcomes ," claims Richard A Posner (1995) .
These unhappy events will involve the deterioration of  health as well as the occurrence of mental and physical disturbance .
But of course , it is not right for anyone to say that the older generations should be taking care of themselves and not bother others isn't it ?
Furthermore , it can be argued that research and development policies have relieved the aging process in a very successful way .
The development of medicine in this era has shown its capabilities to ease the aging process .
In the ancient times , the development of medicine was so superficial that many did not get to live their old age because they died of lethal diseases such as leukemia .
But with the development of medicine from the East or West , people can not only live to their old age , but to live their old age in a more comfortable way as well .
For example , Anti-Ageing in western medicine involves specific and detailed analysis of blood , urine and saliva to ascertain the level of hormonal imbalance and cellular damage caused by ageing and Traditional Chinese Medicine acts as a complementary treatment to western anti-ageing medicine which includes acupuncture .
Therefore , the combination of both sides has helped to ease the aging process
Other than that , architecture has helped older generations to have access to various places as well .
Architecture usually involves the building of infrastructure in a place that can benefit users who are unable to access the area normally .
Nowadays , in the Singapore context , we have special entrance and places for the disabled or older persons in MRT Stations . . Other than that , we also have ramps for wheel chair users and playgrounds for the older generations to keep their body healthy and fit .
All these infrastructure allows the older generation to have more freedom in their action and they do not need to compete with the younger generations .
Thirdly , the search for foreign talents is often considered as higher priority compared to the employment of older generations when it comes to the country's development .
This results in the lack of employment by the older generation and thus they will have financial issues trying to support themselves .
However , social policies that are introduced by the government have helped the old folks through various ways in terms of savings and employment and many more .
The most obvious policies that benefit them are the Special and Retirement CPF account , which are being topped up as much as possible by the government .
Although incentives are given to companies who hire local older generation workers , the upgrading of skills of the older generation has been done as well , in order for them to be more competitive in the job market .
Therefore , it is proven that social policies have to work together with the older generation's effort to ease the aging process .
Clearly , as the population of the older generation increases , the importance of research and development of policies grows larger .
Imagine , how life would be for the older generation now if we are still using methods from a few decades ago ?
Other than that , with the current pace that the world is in now , medicine , architecture and social policies must work hand-in-hand to establish a sense of security for the older generation .
If we do not pay attention to the needs of the older generation , we would be considered as people with no sense of appreciation to what the older generation has done for us .
In today's society , people are particular about their physical appearance .
The first impression is important as it determines how others perceive the person to be .
As the baby boomers are now approaching their senior years , there is an obsession for youth and beauty .
Therefore , to a large extent , current research and development have helped to slow down the aging process .
The negative effects of aging are major problems which the aging population is facing As people get older , it becomes more difficult for them to complete their daily tasks due to the loss of muscles and strength and health problems such as diabetes , cancer and dementia are commonly found .
Therefore , scientists and researchers have conducted experiments to identify solutions to ease the aging process .
Research has shown that reducing the calorie intake can decrease the negative effects of aging .
This is because it helps to reduce damages on vital cells and tissues which are crucial in prolonging the lifespan of a person .
Thus , illness such as heart disease , cancer and diabetes and other disease can be prevented .
Christiaan Leeuwenburgh , Ph .D . , an associate professor of aging and geriatric research at the UF College of Medicine stated that with lower calorie intake and moderate exercise program , significant signs of dysfunction in the aging process are found in key organs such as the liver (Christiaan Leeuwenburgh , 2006) .
Thus , with the results from experiments and researches , it would be beneficial to ease the aging process .
However , the mind plays an important role in controlling the beliefs and thinking of an individual which helps to ease the aging process .
It is amazing to see a sixty year old woman exercising at a gym and dressed like a forty year old working adult .
If the person holds thoughts that they are old and incapable of achieving great things , then she will succumb to the negative effects of aging .
However , if the person maintains a positive attitude and lives a healthy lifestyle , the aging process could be slowed down .
For example , if the person suffers from back pain , instead of lamenting on it , she needs to change her mindset and tell herself what she can do to improve on this weakness .
This would enable the person to regain its youthful lifestyle .
Therefore , this shows that research and development and policies are not the only factors that reduces the aging process , the mindset and attitude of a person is also a contributing factor  .
As people age , some of them are unsatisfied with their appearance .
Fine lines would gradually appear on their eyelids , foreheads and mouth .
As a result , they feel inferior and have low self-esteem .
With technological innovation , there are many types of equipment in the market which help to reduce the aging process .
For example , the invention of laser technology aids in the removal of wrinkles in areas such as the eyelids , foreheads and mouth .
After receiving approximately four to six sessions , visible results can be seen .
Besides , the creation of nano liposome technology enables active ingredients to penetrate the skin and deliver the vital nutrients more efficiently .
According to John Kressaty (2008) , the head chemist at 3Lab ,Inc who was in charge of the product h" Serum , an age defying booster , supported that clinical studies has shown with the use of this technology , that there was a fifty percent reduction in the depth of the wrinkles after using the product for four weeks .
Therefore , technology has played a vital role to eliminate or slow down the negative effects of aging .
A declining  population and a longer life expectancy results in an aging population , causing a high dependency ratio in some countries .
This creates further problems such as a less efficient economy and a rise in public expenditure to meet the increasing needs of the elderly .
Hence , solutions have been suggested to reduce the heavier burden of the young in future , and one of the solutions proposed is to limit public spending on the aged .
The idea that public spending on the aged should be limited so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development is feasible as these developments may actually help to gain greater benefits for the aged .
However , it should be noted that the limitation should not be too much to the extent that the aged are neglected and are not being provided with the basic needs of living .
The aged are citizens of the country and they deserve the necessary welfare rights .
The general perception is that over spending of public funds on the aged would lead to over-dependency  on the government .
Hence the burden of costs would hinder the growth of the country's important developments , and one of which is the economy of the country .
In Singapore , the government allocated huge sums of money to build the two Integrated Resorts and host the Grand Prix Formula One night race to promote tourism and investments , leading to an increase in revenue .
With this additional wealth in the economy , the government would then have the capability to have more choices to look after the aged , for instance , holding more welfare programmes .
However , diverting the resources to boost economic growth may not always result in a guaranteed protection of the welfare of the aged .
This is because ,  the wealth may not be distributed appropriately and furthermore , there is always uncertainty in investments and returns are not guaranteed .
For example , it was reported recently that the Singapore state-owned investment company , Temasek Holdings , has lost over $US4 billion on its investments in organisations such as Merrill Lynch .
[1] Therefore , despite the benefits economic growth could bring to the elderly , it is still necessary to set aside a portion of the government spending for the elderly as a safeguard to protect their basic interests and not only to rely on the revenue earned to help the aged .
It is argued that development in the healthcare sector is important and this benefits the aged as well .
Investment in the healthcare sector could bring about new and more efficient medical technologies .
New cures of diseases may also be invented , like  Alzheimer's disease , which is a common illness among the elderly and it does not have an exact cure at present .
This would thus benefit the elderly who would require an increasing need for healthcare services .
Hence , it is perceived that public spending on the aged could be reduced and be switched to the healthcare sector in providing more quality medical services for all in the future .
However , we should not neglect that these new technologies come with high costs , and it is unlikely to benefit all elderly as many are not financially self-sufficient .
It is thus necessary for the government to subsidise healthcare costs in ensuring the availability and affordability of these services .
It is part of the government's responsibility to meet the basic needs and look after the well-being of the citizens .
Therefore , even though the aged could greatly benefit from the advancement of healthcare services , public spending on the aged still should not be limited to a large extent so as to ensure sufficient funds to maintain affordable healthcare costs for the elderly .
Lastly , infrastructure development is also said to be a crucial development of a country and funds should be diverted to support this area of development .
An improvement in the infrastructure of the country such as having an efficient transport network system brings economic advantages , as seen in the case of China , the rising economic giant .
Hence , this leads to an increase in national income which could then be used for the aged in future .
However , we should also keep in mind that infrastructure development not only improves the economy , but also improves and brings convenience to the lives of people , especially the aged .
Some money should be set aside to provide tbasic housing and transport facilities that are elder friendly .
for example to build lifts with grab- bars and lower the platform of the buses .
Although the government's spending on the aged may be minimised to develop a country's infrastructure for greater economic benefits , there should be at least some effort by the government to satisfy the social needs of the older citizens by building an elder-friendly place , making it a comfortable place for them to live in .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited as over- provision would cause over-reliance of the elderly and lead to an inefficient and low productive workforce and population .
The money could have been put into better use by diverting it to other productive developments to improve the country's economy and overall standard of living .
Yet it is also impossible for the government to limit the spending too much as the elderly should also be entitled to the basic rights and be provided with the basic necessities .
Too little provision may represent an increase in the social costs for the families of the aged and more difficult lives for the communities .
Adopting other solutions to reduce the effects of an aging population , such as extending the working lives of the elderly , may also require the government's spending to provide incentives for them to work longer .
It is thus important for the government to reach a balance and spend the public's money appropriately to have the optimal effects on the aged , population and the country's essential areas of development .
The trend of an aging population is becoming more common nowadays .
One of the main reasons for this situation may be a result of the post World War II baby boom and also the shift in women's role in the society .
As the post war babies age , coupled with the fact that many women are delaying marriage and having lesser children , the population of the elderly has become increasingly significant in proportion in the society of many developed countries today .
The problems pertaining to the process of aging are also becoming more prominent .
Today , with constant breakthroughs in medical research and development as well as reassessment in  social policies , the aging process has been eased for many .
Nevertheless , a small portion of the aging population is still experiencing much difficulty in the process of aging .
In the field of medicine , new developments and technology have helped the aging population to improve their physical appearance as well as provide cures to their ailments .
Particularly in the field of aesthetic medicine , anti-aging procedures such as Botox injections and face-lifts are becoming more common and readily available to the aged .
The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) has reported that more than 6 .3 million women chose to have cosmetic plastic surgery in 2000 and there is an uphill trend over the years .
These procedures seemingly help to turn back the hands of time and stall the physical process of aging .
This is extremely helpful to the aging population and especially for women who are known to be more concerned about their outward appearance .
The improvements in appearance may relieve the emotional stress of aging and gain further access to many opportunities .
However , these aesthetic procedures are costly and usually not subsidised by the government .
Generally , the improvement of their outward appearance through the means of plastic surgery would be exclusive to only those who can afford it .
Therefore , only a limited number of the aged will benefit from these new developments in aesthetic medicine .
Nonetheless as time passes , new technologies are constantly being introduced and the prices of relatively older aesthetic procedures will eventually become more affordable to the majority of the aging population .
Thus , current developments in aesthetic medicine can greatly help to ease the physical process of aging .
As demographic shifts take place and the aging population grows , social policy reforms are required to cater to the problems which arise in the aging process .
In Singapore , the government has reassessed the ElderShield policy in the year 2007 .
According to Singapore's Ministry of Health , the policy is an affordable severe disability insurance scheme which provides basic finances to those who require long-term care during old age .
Singapore citizens and permanent residents are covered by the scheme at the age of 40 .
The recent ElderShield policy together with previous policies such as the comprehensive social security saving scheme , Central Provident Fund (CPF) , provides a basis of financial support for the aged .
As the population ages , it is more difficult for them to work as efficiently as before and their market value also falls .
In addition , the elderly are more likely to suffer from health issues and incur high medical cost .
Therefore , it is important for them to build up a financial reserve to support themselves in their aging process .
Despite the introduction of these policies , there are still some elderly who are excluded from these schemes .
Some elderly women have remained a housewife for decades and they have not worked in the workforce before thus there is no contribution to her CPF account .
In this case , it is dependent on oneself to save from the money she receives to support her in the future .
This is especially true for those who do odd jobs where the employers do not help to contribute to their CPF account .
Although the current social policies can help to build up the financial capability of the aging population and make their aging process easier , there remains an unprotected group .
Nonetheless , the government has also introduced the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly (IDAPE) , a government assistance scheme providing financial help to needy and disabled elderly Singaporeans , who are not eligible for ElderShield because of their age or pre-existing disabilities .
The government also recognize the heavy cost of elderly patients who require immediate and long-term care (ILTC) services as they are admitted for a long period of time .
Thus , government subsidies are given based on the patient's eligibility and financial status .
Therefore , the different social policies have been introduced to complement one another so as to ensure the entire aging population receives a form of financial support when they are in need .
As such , it is possibly true to say that the current social policies can indeed help to ease the aging process to a large degree .
In conclusion , the aging process is indeed one that is difficult to cope with but with the current medical technologies and a wide range of social policies and reforms the elderly are more protected .
The policies intends to  benefit as many aged as possible and thus it is possibly true to say that the technologies and the policies have helped the majority of the aging population to cope with their problems more effectively today .
The advances in science and technology has brought both opportunities and challenges to our society .
One of the difficulties is the increase in life expectancy , the result of considerable improvement to life's quality ,  leads to the growing burden  in developed countries over the years .
Adequate preparation and judicious policies are musts to ensure the sustainable and stable social progress in this baby-boomer transition period .
The appropriate financial need scheme and the retirement saving fund from individuals is one of the six fundamental approaches for demographic-transform-based policy planning (Peter G . Peterson , fall 2001) .
Based on Singapore's context , veterans' retirement saving scheme is a feasible solution to ease the aging issue but there are still some problems that need to be carefully analysed .
The Central Provident Fund (CPF) in Singapore is an inclusive social saving plan that require savings from the labour force in order to better prepare for an aging population in terms of retirement , health care , home ownership and family protection  .
The fact that it may pose serious challenges for financial resources and the caring from the younger generation when the aging population changes rapidly urges people to alter the way they support themselves .
For example , by 2030 , only 3 .5 economically active persons will be supporting one elderly whereas the number now is 10 in Singapore .
(Singapore CPF Board , 2009) In addition , Singapore's aging population might decrease a 3 percentage segment of its long-term economic growth and the elderly support programme from Government could cost more than 7% of GDP according to the recent national report .
Therefore , employees and employers are asked to make personal contributions and supplements to CPF which includes involvement from public sector , corporate fund , industry fund , retail fund and small fund from financially sophisticated people .
Having the fastest demographic change , but by applying  sensible planning and policies , currently , Singapore's CPF achieves the highest exposure than any other retirement plan in Asia and adds from 16 .3 to 30 .4% to Gross National savings rate .
(Asher , 1995) Alleviating the aging structure , the contributions to these savings are deductible in Singapore as the Governments aim to address basic needs and medical expenses security and stability for aging population .
Therefore , Singaporean citizens will be more sensibly confident and well prepared for their old age when they have financial guarantee for retirement years .
However , more effort needs to be put into strategic planning for bridging the retirement saving gap as this , basically , is a method of short-term  .
The debates on this national strategy also lies on the ownership of the money raised in this government programme and the  part of employees and employers .
Additionally , the income differentiations , low level of commitment from individuals and lack of awareness from a certain number of populations can be the main obstacles to the achievability of the policy .
Together with improvement from financial security , more effort is needed to put in living arrangements , health care and employability to ensure a better living condition for the elderly .
All in all , the result of retirement saving scheme is acceptable in the society as a whole and it is an undeniably necessary step we need to take to cope up with the burden of a speedily aging population .
Singapore has a low population and a transparent administration in compared to other Asian countries to attain high workability from this programme and hopefully , it can reach a higher level  when the health care and employability policies are implemented .
In this modern world we live in , a country cannot develop without considering the aspect of globalization .
The main aim for almost all countries is attaining economic stability and progress .
We do not deny that the elderly have their values .
However , we have to be realistic and accept the fact that the elderly have very little contributions in terms of economy as they are not able to join the work force as they are too old to work .
Therefore , we emphasize that public spending on the elderly should not be totally absent but limited .
With globalization , countries are now more integrated .
Hence , we can achieve economic growth through investments in other countries; especially highly developed ones such as China and India .
For example , Singapore has limited resources and land area , thus in order to expand their economy , more overseas investments are needed .
Also , this increased integration would also mean people are able to travel between countries more easily , bringing about tourism which is a highly profitable and marketable economic sector , therefore the need for public spending on hotels , recreational facilities ,  etc .
As globalization becomes more widespread , countries are exposed to tougher and higher levels of competition as can be seen by multi national companies moving to low labour cost countries like China .
Being a country highly dependent on the foreign market and  , Singapore has a need for better skilled workers in the future as competition is bound to reach more advanced levels .
In order to do so , education plays an important role .
Hence , there is a need for public spending  in terms of better training for teachers , better school facilities such as advanced technological equipments and schemes for an all rounded curriculum .
However , public spending for education does not only have to be for the young .
The elderly can also be educated on how to take better care of themselves , reducing their dependency on the society and help them ease the aging process .
People today are less willing to have children , which resulted in low birth rate .
There is a need for government to spend on "baby boomer" campaigns .
For instance , Singapore government came up with a Baby Bonus scheme to supports working adults' decision to have more children by helping to lighten their financial costs of raising children .
According to the Baby Bonus scheme (2009 , August ,4) , "A cash gift of up to $4 ,000 each for the 1st and 2nd child and $6 ,000 each for the 3rd and 4th child .
All children born on or after 17 August 2008 will also enjoy government contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar matching for the amount of savings contributed to the child's Children Development Account (CDA)" .
Currently , these policies are not working as well as the government's expectations , seeing that the future generation in an ageing population is essential , public spending would be needed to intensify these campaigns so as to improve its efficiency .
Regarding issues of elderly illnesses and recreation , there are actually adequate facilities for them .
For example , Singapore has a well connected system of foster homes and hospices providing the elderly with a comfortable environment  .
Furthermore , community activities are well planned with many interesting ones to accommodate their interests .
However , if any spending were to be done regarding this aspect , it could be spent on promoting the establishment of more non-profit organizations volunteering and holding charity events to help ease the elderly problems .
The impact of globalization on our society has been rewarding yet punishing .
With the availability of birth control methods and equal opportunities given to women in terms of education and in the workplace , the aging population is inevitable .
In addition , expenditure on a new born baby is extensive .
However , with the current economic growth , majority of the populations are educated and are able to support themselves throughout their golden years after retirement .
There is much concern due to the negative impact on the stable economy and society caused by a graying population .
What is therefore needed is a wise plan for limited yet sufficient public spending on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
According to the text "Doomsday Predications about Population Aging Are exaggerated" written by Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer , it mentioned that the population aged 65 to 75 is healthier , wealthier and better educated compared to those in past generations .
Due to the rapid economic growth , majority of the populations are earning enough for a living and are already having sufficient savings for old age .
This is commonly supported by substantial insurance policies and personal savings .
On average , the working population holds 5 to 6 insurance policies which is adequate for health and financial coverage .
On top of that , the government has implemented mandatory schemes like Central Provident Funds to ensure that all Singaporeans have sufficient amount of money for the latter part of their lives .
Human aging is known to be a continuous , complex and dynamic process that  starts with birth and ends with death .
Everyone will eventually grow old and experience the effects of the aging process .
Even though it is a natural process , which every individual knows that he or she will have to undergo , many still fear the process of aging and dying .
To minimize the fear among this increasing group of people , research and development in areas such as medicine and technology and social policies supported by the government have helped to a very large extent to ease the aging process , be it physically , emotionally or socially .
The development of anti-aging medicine such as anti-aging injections , special mineral waters and other products and services like hormone replacement has helped to slow down the fundamental process of human aging and prolong human life .
Anti-aging injections such as Botox is one of the anti-aging medicines that many elderly , especially  older women ,depend on as a solution for youth .
For the majority , physical appearances are usually the first sign of aging; hence , look-conscious individuals turn to Botox when they want to retain their looks or to look even better when they age .
Hence , only when they look physically good , will they feel good emotionally as well .
Naturally , when they feel good , their self-esteem and level of confidence will gradually increase .
Therefore , this will lessen the feeling within them that aging is a helpless yet painful process .
However , not all people can afford this substantial amount of money to invest in such anti-aging medicines as it is more often than not , expensive .
Therefore , they might turn to counterfeit products that may cause even more harm to their body .
This will not pose  a threat as it can be overcome with strict regulation by the authorities on anti-aging medicines .
Besides the  amount of anti-aging medicine available in the market ,  advanced technology has also helped to ease a generation into old age despite the fact that some elderly people might not be able to accept these complex technologies .
From simple gadgets to complex computer systems , marketers are developing almost everything to ensure that the elderly do not face any difficulties in the transitioning process .
For example , some luxury car companies such as Lincoln offer night vision that projects an infrared image of the road within the car .
With such an invention , failing eyesight will not be the reason to stop old people from driving; therefore , they will not feel emotionally affected by the inability to drive .
Elderly often perceive that old age is a barrier for them to continue doing things that they like because there is a big difference in them physically .
However , this is not always true because technology can overcome some obstacles that they face during the aging process .
For instance , at the Institute of Technology's AgeLab in Massachusetts , they invented shoes with battery-powered vibrating soles that will stimulate nerves to improve balance for the elderly .
As there are many other complications if an elderly person were to fall down , such inventions help to prevent the elderly from falling down .
Apart from depending on the invention of new anti-aging medicines and the development of new technologies , social policies catering to the welfare of the elderly are equally important in helping to ease the aging process .
According to Stansfeld (1998) , loneliness , lack of social support and isolation are identified as major risk factors that when combined can increase the risk of stressful life events in old age .
Therefore , policymakers need to implement new policies to ensure that elderly people enjoy a happy yet productive life even when they age .
This is to minimize the emotional and social implications that old age will bring about .
Indeed , current research and development in areas like medicine and technology and the implementation of new social policies have helped to lessen the discomfort that the aging process will cause among the elderly to  a large extent .
However , it definitely cannot ease the aging process for the elderly totally as this process is still a natural process .
This can only be achieved when the elderly do not perceive themselves as suffering from old age .
Moreover , they need to adopt an attitude that refuses to succumb to the traditional stereotypes of them as the process of aging is controlled by one's beliefs , thinking and  .
In addition , individual effort like getting sufficient sleep and nutrition has to be made to slow down the aging process physically and mentally .
In conclusion ,  actual age does not inhibit one's ability to living life to the fullest .
With the right mind and attitude , one can easily and comfortably overcome the aging process especially with the aid of the latest medicine and technology available in the market as they play an important role in helping to ease the aging process .
Remember the old adage ," Take The Bull By The Horns ?"
This saying used in the ageing process implies that people must do everything in their power to look into the difficulties faced as they age  .
This has been a vital issue globally because slowing down and easing the aging process can extend  life expectancy and  .
To deal with such challenges , research and development as well as the implementation of policies have come into the picture .
Over the years , research and development in all fields of study has been constantly changing and improving the life of older people .
Architecture is one of the fields in research and development that plays an essential part for the aged .
In addition , social policies have also played a major part in solving the ageing process .
National policy  which pays special attention to the elderly has been ameliorating over time for the benefit of the older people .
To start off , the definition of "ageing process" is required .
The ageing process (Wikipedia) refers to the multidimensional process of physical , psychological and social change .
Therefore , the process of ageing could eventually , pose problems especially in physical aspects such as arthritis , rheumatism , and various types of impairment .
Implementation of both , research and development and policies could help to solve these issues , but it does not alleviate them entirely .
As  policy changes and the need for technology increases ,  .
For instance , the Central Providence Fund is a policy which helps people to save for their retirement .
As a result , the elderly , who depend on the fund , would have the mindset of not saving up for an emergency or the thought of having longer working periods .
Thus , those elderly who have subsequently used up their funds will then seek  financial help .
Moreover ,  policies or welfare schemes are only provided  for cases which require specific attention .
In this case , not all elderly people will be  .
Furthermore , if the technologies which are inaugurated in the buildings become faulty , some of the elderly who are used to the devices will not leave their comfort zone .
This in turn , creates 
Even though research and development or policies in  can have  an unconstructive impact , it still has a positive impact in aiding the ageing process .
In countries like Japan , the United States and Singapore , research and development has come up with technologies for the welfare of the aged .
In Singapore , some buildings such as the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple have installed the stair-climb device on the rail of the staircase to help the elderly to move from one storey to another easily .
Hence , there are other  devices developed that have helped to relieve the accessibility of the aged as they move from one place to another in the building .
On top of that , Singapore has also implemented policy for buildings such as the Barrier Free Accessibility Upgrading Program (BCA , 2002) .
In this program , the government has set aside $40 million into the Accessibility fund so as to encourage owners of  buildings to provide accessibility features in  existing or new buildings(BCA , 2002) .
Therefore ,  having accessibility features like ramps and accessible toilets helps to minimize the problems faced by the aged .
Likewise , National policy has also helped to improve the lives of the elderly .
The government has considered  various aspects of policy such as employment , financial security , health and recreational needs , social services and institutional care , and family relations .
As reported , "most of the elderly are in favor of raising the retirement age due to financial security"( Ministry of Social Affairs , 1983) .
As they grow older , the need for adequate income is essential to sustain  the high cost of living in Singapore .
Thus , in order to ease this issue faced by the aged , the government has raised the retirement age beyond 62 and introduced various schemes .
To enumerate , schemes like the ADVANTAGE !
Scheme (WDA , 2007) and SME Manpower Scheme aims to encourage and allow  employers to employ older workers .
Other than  employment policies , the government has also implemented policy to aid in the health care of the elderly .
The health care policy provides supports such as financial assistance , manpower assistance and the allocation of premises to  non-governmental organizations which is also known as , the Voluntary Welfare organization (VWO) .
The services provided by the VWOs are day care centres , hospices , nursing homes and many more .
Henceforth , the policies  Generally speaking , issues related to ageing are inevitable but solvable .
Solutions , for instance , decision making for the policies and development of technologies through research can definitely influence the aged .
Certainly , there are pros and cons of the latter situation .
Nevertheless , the pros have offset the cons as shown previously .
IIt is recommended that more policies  be considered and technologies  be developed  in order to improve the life of the elderly .
Other than that , the elderly must also play their part by creating more awareness in society and participating actively in the policies or devices produced for them .
It can be argued to a certain extent that current public spending on the aged should be limited so that the money saved could be used in other areas of the country's development .
The problem of an aging population is an issue for most  developed countries .
For instance , in Singapore , the number of people over the age of 65 will hit a high 19% by year 2030 .
(Population Asia 2009) .
Judging from the statistics ,  the elderly will form a relatively big portion of the country's population structure in the near future .
This implies that the impact of the aging society will increase with time .
Therefore , it is important for  countries to tackle the situation before it reaches its peak .
But nonetheless , countries that are already dealing with the problem of their aging population have identified the limitations of the policies that are implemented .
For example , in the context of Singapore , we have been holding pro-natalism campaigns since the 1980s , but there is still an insignificant rise in our replacement rate .
This indicates that perhaps the emphasis towards the investment of the country's revenue should be diverted to other area such as economic investments and improving the education system to further boost the rate of advancement of a country .
Firstly , public spending on the elderly should be limited and not be reduced .
in additionl , a pool of reserve funds should be available to cope with the rise in aging population as well .
This is because the problem of an aging population affects the rate of development of a country in the long run .
And if this problem persists , it will gradually become a roadblock for the future advancement of  society .
As such , the country should still pay attention to the proper handling of the issue .
The approaches that countries usually adopt to solve the aging issue include the prolonging of the working lives of the elderly and the provision of an array of welfare pension schemes for them .
The idea of extending their retirement age is beneficial to both the elderly and the company itself .
But the controversy of the ability of the elderly to generate more wealth in comparison to the remunerative younger working adults had deterred many private companies .
As a result , the government has to provide funding for  companies to encourage them to retain their elderly workers .
But this move is viable as the vast knowledge and experience that these elderly workershave gained over the years of working in the company  .
This will in turn generate more economical benefits for  companies .
Besides it also allows the accumulation of more wealth for the elderly to be more self-sufficient after they retire .
This two tier solution would definitely help  the progress of a country .
In addition , the introduction of health related welfare schemes for the aged is also one of the main solutions .
It provides a sense of financial security for the elderly as high medical costs would be highly subsidised .
This would lengthen the ability of the elderly to be self-sufficient throughout their golden years .
As a result , it helps to reduce the reliance on the public welfare schemes , allowing a more  of the funds in other aspects of the country .
But on the other hand , there are also other important areas that  public spending could be used on to facilitate the country's development .
For instance , investing in the lucrative tourism industry would generate a lot more wealth for the country .
This would allow additional financial iinput for the country to tap upon to provide greater welfare benefits for its citizens .
Besides , focus could also be placed upon  education for the younger generation .
Equipping  students with  essential technical skills would require a considerable amount of funds .
However , considering the future financial input that these well-equipped workforces would generate , proves that it is a worthwhile investment for the country .
Finally , all in all , a country should deal closely with the issues of an the aging population .
This is because it is a problem that is here to stay .
Being flexible about the limitations of funds and not rigidly capping the maximum budget for the elderly , will allow more room for a greater variety of solutions to be carried out .
In addition , there is no need to neglect the developments of other areas of investments such as the dual approach of slowing down the process of aging population .
Lastly , improvements in other areas of  society will bring about a quantum leap in the country's development .
Aging does not mean that the population's age is reaching a certain big number .
It means when people get older , they are less healthy and their working capacity decreases .
Since the aging process has given the country's economy  ,   scientists have invented methods , compounded medicine and also introduced a  solution for the aging process .
Medical scientists create  treatments which are able to prolong human longevity .
Those treatments help delay organ malfunction by keeping them younger .
For example , stem cells recently have been an effective way to make thehuman dream come true .
In medical science , there has been  promising break-through research in finding the application of stem cells in anti-aging  .
Stem cells , coming from the umbilical cord of a mammal , can successfully regenerate tissues destroyed by diseases such as old age  .
Its options are limitless for regenerating skin , muscle tissue , lost eyes etc  .
If successful , they also help  organ breakdown .
Nowadays , with medical treatment , people can be "young" for a longer time bringing about better health when they reach their old age .
People usually want to work to earn money as long as possible .
That's why when they are able to live in their physical condition of 30-years-old even if they are over 70 , they will work longer and will be able to accumulate more wealth which they could use to support themselves in their old age .
Secondly , medical science has also come up with many types of  anti-aging drugs such as Deprenyl , one of the best anti-aging drugs currently available .
People will look younger and surprisingly , not just women but also men are now using the drugs .
Anyway , not all the drugs are good and cheap  so finding a suitable drug is a tough task  .
Furthermore , the nutrition industry has also jumped in this battle against the aging problem with milk and other products like Quintessence that  .
As people , especially the youth , feel healthier , they will work harder and earn more money for their future life .
It would not only help  government to reduce the amount of money they have to spend on the welfare program for the elderly , but also provide the elderly with a chance to have a rich old-life .
If people have to work for themselves , they will try their best to earn as much as possible .
Therefore , they may get even more money on their own rather than receiving money from the government welfare .
However , taking too many anti-aging medical products like medicine in general is not as good as supporting yourself with a suitable and healthy diet .
Natural solutions to the anti aging process  include fruits and vegetables .
Fruits like apples , strawberries , etc contain ellagic acid that has the capacity to hinder the growth of tumors within the body and those such as cantaloupe , peaches , etc contain lycopene gthat guard the body's cells and organs like the heart and bladder from damage caused by free radicals .
Vegetables would also demonstrate the same benefits in antioxidant capabilities , for example , Genistein in soybeans works as cancer gene enzyme inhibitor .
Besides , people who usually do gymnastics will live longer and healthier than those do not .
Some may argue that fruit and gymnastics do not play any part in easing the aging process .
In fact by doing physical exercise , their immunity increases , making them immunized against lots of bacteria and viruses .
A healthy diet along with gymnastics will prevent  .
To countries with old populations , medical science needs to be considered and invested more in so that we will have more and better ways of easing the aging process .
With the achievements of medical science , treatments , medicine and dietary habits , humans get not only happiness and health but also a better longer life .
Furthermore , medical science is one of the effective solutions for the aging process , which helps ease the economic burden for the country by reducing the money for old people's welfare , diverting it to other areas of the country's development .
The aging population in Singapore has been growing .
The percentage of residents aged 65 and above has increased from 6 .8% in 1998 to 8 .7% in 2008 (Population in brief , 2009) .
This is expected to reach 20% in 2030 (Seah , 2007) .
Thus , measures for aiding the increasing aging population in terms of healthcare subsidies and daily expenditures should be proactively prepared .
Some strategies can be introduced to deal with the aging population .
Firstly , greater productivity should be encouraged with the younger generation being cost-efficient and productive .
Secondly , filial obligation should be stressed among the younger generation .
Lastly , people could be encouraged to have proactive savings when they have a job to save up for a rainy day (Peter G . Peterson , 2001) .
Therefore , the aging population is not an insurmountable problem , funds could be sub-divided for  expenditure in other sectors such as education , tourism and Research and Development (R&D) .
Firstly , education is  important  in Singapore as it secures the future of the younger generation .
Singapore has institutions with outstanding records of interactive learning and a bilingual education system .
At tertiary level ,  the National University of Singapore (NUS) , and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are leading local universities .
Funds are constantly pumped into the education system for the financing of students and also for constant improvements in the education system .
For example , the Tuition Grant Scheme is provided for the subsidising of high school fees .
Therefore , by investing in the education sector , the future of the younger generation will be secured .
In turn , they would be able to support the aged thus reducing the dependency of the aged on the government .
Secondly , the tourism sector is a revenue generator for Singapore through the various tourist attractions such as Sentosa and the upcoming Integrated Resorts .
Hence , funds have to be constantly injected for new tourist attractions and contingency plans in the case of an economic crisis .
For example , in February 2009 , the Singapore Tourism Board announced that an incentive of $90 million has been provided for the BOOST (Building On Opportunities to Strengthen Tourism) which is targeted at aiding the tourism sector duringchallenging times (Singapore Tourism Board , 2009) .
Thus , funds are essential to ensure that the tourism sector is filled with vibrant attractions and is prepared for any crisis .
This ensures a constant flow of revenue for the economic stability of Singapore .
Lastly , R&D is extensively utilized  in major institution projects , for innovation and creativity in new developments and for environmental concerns .
For example , R&D is supported by the National Research Foundation which focuses on areas such as  Environmental  , Water Technologies and  Interactive and Digital Media .
A total of $1 .55 billion is invested in these areas (Singapore Budget , 2009) .
In addition , R&D discovered  NEWater and ensured its consistent high quality for the past few years (Channel News Asia , 2009) .
Although , the R&D sector is important , the aging population must not be neglected as a portion of the old may still remain vulnerable .
Due to globalization , the aged have become richer and of better health .
However , a portion of the population could still need financial help such as those with lower incomes .
Thus , financial benefits should be provided to those that are in need of help .
In contrast , schemes such as the Central Provident Fund and the Medisave schemes do cover a large proportion of expenses .
Hence , funds spent on the aged should be limited in order to accommodate any high expenses in the three sectors that contribute a large proportion of revenue to the economy .
In conclusion , R&D brings about innovation and inventions , hence bringing various business opportunities and revenue to Singapore .
On the whole , the aging population is not an insurmountable problem .
Hence , public spending on the aged should be limited in order for funds to be sub-divided among the education , tourism and  R&D sectors which are the main sources of revenue .
In turn , with more revenue being generated , more benefits and financial aid could be provided to the aged which benefits the country as a whole .
Aging population is a global issue nowadays , especially in  developed countries .
This will soon affect  Asian countries with serious repercussions .
According to Jackson and Howe's major findings , today , 8 of 16 nations of Western Europe have a median age of 40 or higher (The Graying of The Great Powers , May 2008 , CSIS) .
By 2050 , 6 will have a median age of 50 or higher , so will Japan , the East Asian Tigers , and 17 of the 24 nations in Eastern Europe and the Russian sphere .
Due to the size of the increasing aging population , public spending on the aged has been rising .
Hence , this has exerted more pressure on  society , which could lead to problems such as low social security , economic depression and inadequate education .
Hence , it is essential to limit  public spending on the elderly , so more money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
It is essential to set spending limits on healthcare .
As healthcare services gradually increase ,  public spending on the aged also increases .
In 2000-2001 , seniors accounted for 43 percent of total health care spending but represented only 12 .5 percent of the population .
In 2026-2027 , seniors will represent 22 percent of the population and will be responsible for close to 60 percent of total health care spending (Population Aging ,2009 .
An aging population has placed the federal budget on an "imprudent and unsustainable path" and that "passage of time only serves to worsen this situation(Congress Daily , 2009) ." .
To maintain the healthcare system for the elderly , a significant amount of money will have to be spent on it , which may have serious consequences for society .
Therefore , the government should adjust  spending on healthcare to an appropriate level .
Setting limits on  spending on the aged would raise indignation among the elderly , especially among people without  savings , poor single women , and the illiterate .
Some may say it is inhumane to limit  spending on the aged .
However , policy makers should always look at the interests of the whole country rather than just focusing on one particular area .
Additionally , the government can conduct specific tests such as the means- test for those who really require financial support .
In conclusion ,  .
Money saved from reduced spending on the aged can then be invested in other areas for instance education .
When  education is enhanced , graduates  have a higher chance of getting a job and hence contributing to the economic development of the country .
In addition , together with the development of economy , the young adults would be capable of supporting their parents .
Furthermore , they could enjoy high living standards and security in life .
Generally , the government would have enough budget to empower the stable development of the country , and to maintain the welfare and pension system at an acceptable level .
To illustrate that these are only some  of the many benefits which  can be achieved from reducing spending on the aged .
To conclude , it is vital for the government to limit  spending on the aged to a reasonable level , so money can be invested in different aspects of the country's development .
In the short run , the country may face difficulties , but in the long run it will be beneficial to  society .
During the past decades , the lifespan of human beings has been rising rapidly .
Advanceddvanced research and developments in every aspect of life have completely re-defined the word old . . New discoveries in medicine , technological inventions and also economics have been helping to slow down the aging process .
The aging process refers to changes in the biologicall , physical and social conditions of an individual as time goes by .
People used to think that it was naturally driven and that there was no way to  on it .
However , it has eventually been proven that what we used to think is not necessarily right .
Medicine nowadays gives us a strong belief that the aging process is something we can alter .
Medically speaking , we can expect longevity if our body is able to continuously re-generate living cells .
Results of different research have revealed that there are certain components which help to maintain a healthy cell like antioxidants , enzymes , hormones or "no cellular waste" (Dr . Grey , 2005) . "
Together with cell collapse , diseases like heart disease or cancer ,  speed up the process .
Luckily , modern medicine can provide  procedures to cure  serious diseases and to prevent aging .
For example , doctors nowadays can  build a complete plan to slow down the aging process; such a plan includes an individualized nutritional , hormonal , dietary and exercise program .
After six months of joining the program , the biological age of a man can decrease by 20 years .
With currently available anti-aging strategies , people can confidently look forward to a longer lifetime .
Besides , there are also some drugs which can be used as an anti-aging treatment like the Estrogen hormone (for women) .
In other words , medicine can be used effectively to ease the aging process .
Developments in technological inventions have been having an impact on detecting and curing aging diseases .
Human beings have an increased understanding of the biological system of their own body  Some modern technologies such as Advanced Cell Technology can give us a close look at how and why the aging process happens .
Once the reasons are known , researchers can come up with ideas of how to slow down or even reverse  aging .
Besides , there are many other types of equipment which helps in the treatment of anti-aging .
For example , nutritional diets are usually calculated by computer programs so that they are more accurate and practical .
Modern machines help us with more effective exercises and warning whenever necessary .
As a result , treatments for the aging process are now well assisted .
Although almost everyone agrees that economics is a vital component in the world's life , not many people realize that it also plays an important part in easing the aging process .
The effects caused by the global economy indirectly control the speed of aging .
In developed countries with strong economies , health issues and other social services are sure to be cared much more about than in undeveloped ones .
With a simple comparison between Western societies with those from Africa , significant differences in life expectancy and actual lifespan can be seen . .
While Western people tend to live long happy lives with a small number of serious diseases , people from African countries usually have a much shorter life expectancy .
However , economic problems may have a very bad impact on  efforts to slow down the aging process .
As the economy goes up , there are more concerns to be taken care of and people get busier .
This will be reflected in their bad habits like over-working and also harm their mental health , which will shorten their lifespan .
After much research , it is not surprising to know  that , usually , the richest man is not the happiest man .
But again , these are individuallifestyles so a person should be able to change it easily by himself putting some understanding into it and by making an effort .
Hence , economics , in some ways , is providing a useful helping hand to ease the aging process .
In conclusion , aging is nowadays a global issue .
Human beings , with their intelligence , can find  ways to ease the aging process .
The only problem left is that with a longer life , what will a person do to give back to  society and the next generations ?
Aging population and longer life expectancy will inevitably lead to rapidly increasing elderly residents .
Housing , which is one of the basic needs of elderly people , is significant because the elderly need a safe , pleasing and interactive environment for their old age .
Current housing developments and policies have provided better choice to enhance the quality of life of older people .
Government agencies have strived to promote an elderly-friendly physical environment .
Policymakers have implemented various strategies to ensure older people own a home while enjoying sufficient retirement income for old age dependency .
Some housing schemes are also introduced to facilitate mutual care and support for elderly .
In most developed countries , governments have enforced various measures to make the physical environment more elderly-friendly .
As people grow old , their competence will decay .
The elderly will face more specific needs such as the needs for social and healthcare support .
Hence , a residential environment  specially planned to meet their physical , social and recreational requirements is a must ((Libencore ,2009) Nowadays , various kinds of retirement housing is being developed in many countries like the United States Japan and Singapore .
These housing villages provide a diversity of elderly-friendly facilities and services , which encourage older people to maintain a dynamic and independent lifestyle .
In Australia , the Granny Flats , which are integrated with elder-friendly fixtures and fittings , have been developed to facilitate independent living of the elderly .
Besides , housing developers nowadays are focusing on creating a barrier free housing estate in order to enhance the  A barrier free environment allows elderly people to have  safe and easy access to the social facilities and amenities within their neighborhood .
For example , the Singapore government has committed lots of funds to improving the mobility of elderly people by retrofiting lifts to stop on every floor in public housing .
It is true that these developments incur significant costs and more public spending has to be poured in to establish such developments .
However , a safe and accessible environment for elderly people is vitalas it can lead to  healthy , increased well-being and an  Therefore , it can be anticipated that more elderly-friendly features will be set up in our neighborhood in future .
Housing policies and schemes play a critical role in easing the aging process .
Most countries have provided various housing schemes to ensure an adequate supply of affordable accommodation for the aging population .
Under these schemes , housing developers are subsidized with lower land costs to build  retirement housing , while needy elderly are given priority  access to public housing .
It may be argued that  a number of elderly people are "asset-rich , cash-poor" .
They own a house but do not have sufficient funds to meet their basic needs in old age (Ministry , 2006) .
Nevertheless , there are policies that allow the elderly to monetize their housing assets .
These people are encouraged to sublet their house or to downsize to a more affordable one .
In Singapore , the Lease Buyback Scheme helps the elderly in smaller flats to monetize flat value whilst continuing to stay in the same flat .
Hence , it can be noticed that the housing needs as well as the financial needs of elderly have been effectively tackled by various public policies .
Finally , a harmonious and caring elderly society has been promoted through housing schemes as well can be looked forward to in the future .
On the one hand , policymakers have carried out a range of policies to encourage younger children to take care of their elderly parents by staying with them .
In Hong Kong , the Harmonious Families Priority Scheme allows families to live in one flat or two nearby flats when they apply for public housing .
On the other hand , senior activity centres are also developed in housing estates to encourage the elderly to remain integrated in society .
These centres provide social and recreational activities , as well as community-based care and support services for elderly residents .
Indeed , these strategies have effectively enabled elderly people to lead a fruitful and meaningful social life .
Clearly , the quality of life of elderly people has become more enjoyable through various housing developments , policies and improvement programmes .
These efforts have successfully eased the issues of an aging population .
A blending of housing schemes and developments  that help  older people to live as independently as possible .
One such policy in Singapore is the Central Provident Fund (CPF) .
Set up by the government in 1955 , it serves as a retirement fund for all Singaporean citizens .
The CPF is a mandatory savings plan for workers , where a portion of their income is being set aside in this fund , and will be being made available to them once they have retired .
This policy provides for financial security for the elderly as they would be financially dependent , and need not rely on public initiatives or their children for money in their golden years .
With this policy , the government is then able to redirect  resources to more vital sectors .
Critics of this position point out their concerns over the misuse of the funds once it is made available .
Being unsure of their future financial requirements , the elderly might be unable to plan for their expenditure , and might drain their finances too quickly .
However , a recent introduction by the Singaporean government has eliminated this problem .
Participants of this new and compulsory scheme named "Lifelong Income for The Elderly"  (LIFE) will receive lifelong monthly payouts from their CPF accounts .
Instead of being granted with a lump sum of money upon retirement , this ensures that the elderly do not exhaust their retirement funds too quickly , thereby easing reliance on public funds .
Another policy introduced by the Singaporean government is to encourage the citizens to work longer .
This may be implemented by giving tax rebates or financial incentives to companies which  are proactive in the employment of older workers .
There is also evidence to show  that the government is encouraging this; such as from the proposed increase in retirement age from 63 to 65 years  by 2012 .
A longer working life would alleviate the manpower shortage in the next decade , when a majority of the baby boomers are set to retire .
At the same time , with more social interaction at work , the elderly will not feel  lonely .
This allows the elderly to know that they are still being appreciated , and on top of that , it is beneficial for them .
A study (Robert , 2007) has shown that the elderly who feel less lonely have a lower risk of getting Alzheimer's disease .
This might reduce potential foreign investments  .
However , the correct implementation of this policy will help to solve this problem .
By acknowledging that the elderly are slightly slower than their younger counterparts , companies can arrange for more suitable jobs for them .
Such examples include jobs that involve mentoring as well as counseling .
Equipped with their valuable experience , the elderly are the best candidates to offer  advices , and to groom individuals .
Therefore , they will be financially independent . 
Lastly , developments in medicine have also helped in the ageing process .
With new technological advances , the elderly now have a variety of medical treatments for most old-age related illnesses .
For example , advances in surgery have helped developed a non-invasive surgery technique for glaucoma , one of the main leading diseases among the elderly  .
This non-invasive technique will help to minimize any potential surgical risks .
One impending problem with such rapid technological advances in medicine would be the rising cost of healthcarewhich is brought about by the intensive research processes to develop new cures and treatments .
With most of the elderly retired and having no source of income , they might be unable to fund their medical expenses should the need arise .
In view of this , the Singaporean government has in place a variety of measures to minimise the occurrence of this situation .
One such measure would be Medisave .
Introduced by the Ministry of Health in 1984 , Medisave would set aside a portion of an individual's income to  be made available to fund medical expenses should the need arise .
With this fund , most Singaporeans will  retire with a sum of money  which can be used to pay for medical expenses .
This reduces the possible reliance of public funds for funding  medical expenses for the elderly .
In conclusion , this essay has illustrated that the current policies in Singapore have helped ease the ageing process to a large extent .
Policies such as implementing the CPF , raising the retirement age and developing  healthcare policies have helped to ease the ageing process in the society , thereby reducing the  effects of an ageing population .
The issue of an ageing population is a great challenge faced by many developed countries in the 21st century .
The great advances in medical technology over the years have resulted in  improvements in the health conditions of individuals , and hence reducing the likelihood of them contracting life-threatening diseases .
The life expectancies of individuals have increased due to better accessibility to the provision of healthcare services and facilities  .
In countries such as Singapore , the existence of an ageing population is attributed by the baby boom period after World War II , and the persistently low fertility rate ever since 1970s (Chan 2001) .
As such , this has increased the need for public spending on the aged in order to fund for the needs of the elderlywhich include the construction of facilities for the elderly and healthcare subsidies .
It could be argued that public spending on the aged is being carried out at the expense of a country's development in other areas .
These areas include the education sector which will increase the productivity of a country , and also infrastructure and transport facilities which will serve as attractions for direct foreign investments .
However , Jenson (2007) reported that it is inevitable that individuals have a higher tendency to consume more healthcare services as they age because of  their  susceptibility to diseases .
Thus , it is not practical to limit  public spending on the aged so that the money can be used alternatively for a country's developments .
It is unethical to embark on the developments of a country at the expense of the aged .
By limiting the fiscal spending on the elderly , the extra funds created can be diverted to areas such as education , which has potential long-term benefits for a country .
As such , it will be even tougher for the government to cater to the growing needs of the elderly due to a constraint budget , and this problem will affect countries  facing an ageing population , such as Japan .
Opponents of this position argued that there is no need to divert too much resources to the elderly because they are no longer contributing to the society  .
Instead , these resources should be used in other areas that provide long-term benefits to the country .
For instance , the investing of funds for research and development will raise the productive capacity of the country , thereby attracting more direct foreign investments .
However , it is wrong to regard the aged as a burden , because the aged is a national asset that should not be neglected by the society .
Even after they have retired , they continue to contribute to the society  , but  in  different ways , such as taking care of their grandchildren on behalf of their children who are  at work .
In this way , they help to coordinate the work life and family life of the working adults (Conference of European Churches 2007) .
Consequently , the aged , with their insights and experiences , is a valuable asset to the society and thus  public spending on the aged should not be limited .
In addition ,  spending on the elderly might increase the financial burden of the future generations .
This problem is particularly pertinent in countries challenged by an ageing population and  low fertility rate  .
In the past , there are usually three or more children in a family .
The filial obligation to provide financial support for the parents is thus shared among the few children .
As for now , most families have at most two children .
This could be due to  increased women participation  in the workforce , later marriages , and  financial costs of having children .
In  future  , the ageing population might worsen if low fertility rate persisted .
The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Aging Report (1999) states that in 1999 , 7 .3% of the population comprises  older Singaporeans aged 65 and above , and it is expected that they will make up 19% of the population by 2030 .
Some critics might argue that the country will lag behind and lose its competitiveness if the fiscal spending on the elderly is not limited .
They perceived public spending on the aged as a form of liability to a country because such spending brings no future benefits to the country , and may cause the country to neglect its development in essential areas , such as infrastructure and transport facilities , which serve as a pulling force for foreign  investments .
Thus , if a limit was not imposed , the economy of a country will be adversely affected in the long run .
However , instead of limiting fiscal spending on the aged , there are alternatives that can  improve the productivity of a country .
For instance , when older workers are retrained , they can be as productive as  younger workers  , and this will also increase their employability .
Alternatively , there should be some adjustments on fiscal spending on the aged based on their percentage in the country's population .
All these constitute a win-win situation which proves that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
Lastly , the limiting of public spending on the aged will increase the financial hardship of the elderly .
This will affect the elderly who are either single or have no children , and those who have low educational level .
In their younger days , their earnings might just be sufficient for them to cope with their daily living expenses and hence they have negligible or no savings .
When they fall ill , the high costs of medical fees may discourage them from seeking medical care , and as a result , their health conditions may deteriorate over time .
As they age , they become more susceptible to diseases , such as osteoporosis .
Thus , it is inevitable that their demand for healthcare will increase with age .
It will come to a time when they are left with no choice but to seek medical help for their illnesses; but since they are left with little savings , they are unlikely to be able to pay for the medical expenses .
It is one's social responsibility to be healthy , and to be accountable for one's  medical expenses should one seek healthcare services , instead of relying on the government for subsidies to lower one's financial burden  .
Jenson (2007) mentioned that the ageing population has accelerated the growth in healthcare spending , and this will lead to a fiscal crisis as increasing pressure is exerted on the fiscal budget .
However , the presence of a fiscal crisis might not necessarily be attributed to  fiscal spending on the aged .
The facilities built for the elderly should not be seen  negatively because these facilities  provide long-term benefits to every individual in the country  , since ageing is an unavoidable process .
This applies to the healthcare subsidies , as one will hope that one can be entitled to such privileges when one has limited savings , regardless of one's age .
Hence , it is infeasible to limit public spending on the aged .
In conclusion , instead of placing a limit on the public spending on the aged , the government can look into the few alternatives proposed to ensure that the elderly will not be neglected and will be given sufficient attention as the country pursues its development . 
With an increasing number of Singaporeans belonging to the golden age group of sixty-five years old and above ,  Singapore needs to deal with the financial challenges of an aging population .
An aging population , the result of a decreasing fertility rate and  longer life expectancies , will certainly affect Singapore's economy .
Although the net impact on the Singapore government's financial position is unsure , public spending on the aged should not be limited  and should vary accordingly to the needs of the country  . 
The population in Singapore is increasing yearly and aging rapidly (Singapore Department of Statistics , 2008) .
Public spending on the aged should fluctuate according to the composition of the aged citizens within the population of Singapore .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited  .
Public spending should reflect the current composition of the aged citizens within the Singapore population .
On the other hand , others might argue that by not limiting the public spending on aged means that lesser budget will be allocated to other areas of Singapore's developments  , such as education , defence and health sectors .
This would cripple the economy of Singapore , which has already been affected by the  shrinking workforce .
However , by spending more on the aged does not necessarily denote that budget spent on the development of Singapore will be affected .
This is because the public spending could come from the surpluses that Singapore has  accumulated over the years . 
Aged citizens will  require for basic healthcare and treatment .
According to the National Institute of Aging (2007) , experts predicted that there will be a huge rise in disability resulted from increases in age-related chronic disease in all regions of the world .
This implies that public spending should not be limited as it will be required to subsidise  costly healthcare expenses .
This is because the aged population will not be able to afford the financial burden for the recurrent treatment of their illnesses .
Truly , aged citizens accounted for greater than 40% of the total hospitalisation days in  public sector hospitals in 2006 (Ministry of Heath , 2007) .
On the other hand , it is fortunate that the Singapore Central Provident Fund (CPF) , which is the fundamental pillar of our social security framework for the aged , lends itself readily to provide  for the needs of aging population .
Healthcare in Singapore are made affordable through the administration of the Medisave , Medishield and Medifund framework .
Each citizen's CPF account consists of Medisave , Medishield and Medifund , which help individuals to put aside portions of their income to meet their medical expenses  when they are old .
The medisave accounts assist older Singaporeans to pay for  their expensive medical bills .
This would help to ease the public spending on the aged and money can be spent on other area of Singapore's development .
However , Singaporeans still enjoy heavy subsidies in public hospital , especially in the lower class wards .
Direct subsidies borne by the Singapore government have increased from $850 million in 2001 to more than $1 .6 billion in 2007 and are forecasted to exceed $2 .2 billion by 2012 (Ministry of Health , 2009) .
As the population ages , the need for healthcare services will increase .
Public spending will keep increasing and should not be limited as the aging population in Singapore progresses .
The increasing popularity of smaller , nuclear families and the trend of more individuals remaining single could raise the number of wholly-elderly households (Singapore Department of Statistics , 2009) .
In addition , elderly are having higher life expectancies rate  due to the advancement of medical healthcares and technologies .
This would imply that lots of public funds would be required to build an environment with suitable facilities for the elderly  .
Public spending will be required and should not be limited for modifications works  , such as lift upgrading projects that enable the lift to stop at every level of the flat .
Besides ,  public spending will be required for modifications works in neighbourhood estates  , such  as the building  of more railings and slopes with anti-slipped layer (Tong , 2007) .
In addition A neighbourhood could be specially developed with slopes , railings and lifts that cater to stop at every floor of the flat .
This would help to limit the public spending on the elderly as the elderly can be grouped together and special needs will be provided for them in that neighbourhood .
More funds could then be spent on other areas of Singapore's development .
However , this would create an impression that the elderly are unwanted and being left alone .
It also means that the government is encouraging the elderly not to stay with their families .
Furthermore , modifying facilities such as a lift to every floor of the flat , railing and slopes with anti-slipped features , not only benefits the elderly but also the handicapped and residents living in the estates .
It allows heavy and bulky items to be unloaded from a vehicle and delivered to the flats using slopes and lift without much effort .
People should see these modifications as assets to the neighbourhood estates rather than expenses incurred on the elderly .
Therefore public spending should not be limited as  the elderly   .
Eventually all flats will require a lift that serve every floors if not alternate floors and elderly-friendly facilities which can be beneficial to all .
In conclusion , fertility rates are declining while life expectancies are increasing around the world .
As a result , populations are aging rapidly and Singapore is not exempted from this trend .
The ratios of Singapore citizens aged sixty-five and above will climb from one in twelve in 2007 to one in eight in 2020 (Ministry of Finance , 2008) .
Therefore  public spending on the aged should not be limited and should fluctuate according to changes such as impending demographic shift , population growth and healthcare expenses .
However , it is also important  for Singaporeans to plan ahead so that they can depend on several sources of income to sustain their old-age livings and at the same time ease the burden of public spending on the aged .
Employers should also do their part in changing their traditional perceptions that aged employees are unproductive and potential burden to society (Harper , 2001) .
Employers should try to retain and retrain older workers for them to be retained in the labour force; this will extend theirorking lives  and they will be in a better economic position to sustain themselves .
Public spending is the amount of money expended by a government to pay  the maintenance of  defence , development projects , education , social security , health , infrastructure , law and order   .
It represents a large share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and has a major impact on the productivity of the whole economy .
Public spending on social security and health care will directly benefit the aged people in the country .
This essay argues that the public spending on aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other area of the country's development .
The elderly in a country are usually supported  by public spending .
It is argued that the government should provide more public assistance to the elderly and not to limit the amount of spending on them .
However , some people may not  realize that there are many countries which are already having high public spending .
Schuknecht and Tanzi (2005) stated that many countries have peaked at almost 52% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the past twenty years .
Most countries tend to spend more than half of the public funds on social protection  , health and  the aged .
Mahal and Berman (2006) mentioned that several studies have indicated that  expenses of health and social protection for the elderly are usually much greater than those non-elderly .
If countries are to increase their public spending on the aged further , it may cause the proportion of public spending to be spent on other important areas , such as infrastructure and education , to be  lessened .
This could eventually slow down the productivity of the whole economy .
Therefore , public spending on the elderly should be limited and controlled to prevent it from increasing further .
Population aging is progressing rapidly in many countries and in the near future , this may push up the public spending on social security and healthcare costs .
In view of  the aging population problem , some people argued that we should not limit  public and financial assistanceto the elderly because of  the increasing number of elderly in an aging population .
However , the increase in public spending means that working people may need to pay higher taxes , as public spending is supported mainly by taxation .
Minford and Wang (2008) stated that researches have shown that the increase in tax to GDP had reduced GDP growth and lowered the output per worker .
In an aging population , having increasing tax contribution from the shrinking workforce can be a burden to the working people .
The Straits Time (2009) mentioned that the huge increases in public spending could slow down countries' economic growth .
In an aging society , it is important to limit and  control  the increasing public spending on the aged .
If not , there could be a drop in the GDP and eventually  the percentage of public spending  on the aged could be reduced too .
It should be the responsibility of the country to ensure that all the aged , who have contributed to the society , to be properly assisted in their old age .
However , when public spending on the aged is not limited and allowed to be raised continuously , everyone in the country is going to suffer in long run .
There might be one day when the to country's work force can no longer support the extremely high an amount of public spending .
This may cause the the working people to be under pressure and financially strapped .
It may then cause them to fail to take good care of their elderly parents and neglect their needs .
Toh (2009) mentioned that researches have shown that during the global economic recession , there are more elderly abuse cases reported .
Thus , one of the ways to prevent this from happening is to have control over the public spending on elderly , so as to prevent further increase in tax contribution .
Besides that , a country should try to divert a higher percentage of public spending to other areas that might contribute the country's growth and development , such as  infrastructure and development projects .
By investing more money in these areas , a country may generate higher return and has a higher GDP growth .
This may again increase the amount of public spending  on the aged .
It is no doubt that a country should do its best to assist and support the elderly .
However , countries have to be mindful on the amount of money that has to be spent on the social protection and health for the elderly .
We have to ensure that they are efficient and effective in spending this large amount money and preventing it from rising too high .
To spend too large amount of public funds on the elderly will definitely  burden  both the country and working population .
Thus , we should try to divert more money to other areas of the country's development and promote higher GDP growth .
This can definitely benefit the aged  and without adding anyurden to the country's economy and the next generation .
The limited public spending will increase financial burden for working population in Singapore .
As people grow old , their bodies will become weaker , and hence they are more prone to illnesses and disethe dses .
Mdical care tends to be expensive mos of the times; this wie ,l place a heavy financial burden on those whoiesare caring for the elderly .
On top of the increasing cost of living , the younger generations have to bear this high expense of taking care of the elderly .
This situation might result in elderly being neglected bmust concern themselves with not onlyessure caused by the large amount of expe , but also try toCritics of this position point out that actually elderly themselves impose financial hardship to the working population .
As the aging population increases , the active contributors have to bear an increase burden of more elderly by paying more taxes .
However , by reducing the share of public merely means leaving the families to be responsible for a larger share (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
Families will face various other problems , such as education , housing and transportation due to the high expenditures of taking care of the elderly .
theonthe eaexcessivethe eestheAlthough the aging population decrease Singapore's economic comthe wetitiveness , their large demand for health care and special elderly- related goods such as hearing aids and walking sticks would boost the economic sectors that produces these g . Therefore , rather than hinder the development of Singapore , the elderly provide opportunity for these sectors of economy to develop .
In addition , it is unethical to develesp a country at the expense of the aged .itshe past , the aged have been through the difficult years of strus ,gling for Singapore's development such as , wthe racial riots of the 1960s .
Thus , they are full of incredible wealth of experience and wisdom .
Asringa result , the elderly are likely to be assets to our society ,iesby providing invalues of advice and knowledge .
For example , Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew plays an integral role in contributions to Singapore's progress during his period .
Additionally , senior workers have immense experience that would help them serve as advisors to the companies they belong to .
Grandparents play their part by imparting skills and moral values to their grandchildren .
At this point , one may wonder that the elderly pose a financial burden on the development of a country .
However , the adjustments to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) policies have reduced the burden of the country by providing some of the fund for the elderly in their golden years .
Additionally , the increasing retirement age of workers from 60 to 62 also reduced the burden of supporting the elderly .
In fact , some fast food restaurants have actively recruited the elderly because many are just as reliable and hardworking and sometimes more loyal as their younger counter-parts .
All of these show that the elderly could still contribute to the development of Singapore .
sg of In additiondstoposedifOne of the issues if the public spending is limited is that it will impose financial hardship on the elderly , especially for elderly women .
Women tend to have longer life expectat ,cy as compared to men (Fanny , 2000) .
However , this demographic ws that the elderly women are likely to be widowed or single , and hence , iney will be economically dependent .
Moreover , it also accentuated the financial risk of long term care that may not be sufficiently covered contributingnsurance policies .
This wmeIn additionnerable financially .
This situation might result in the incapability to seek for medical assistance when the need arises .
trythe The aged may be a liability to the country due to the increasing cost of looking after them .
However , their experience and knowledge can be an aonet to the country .
Furthermore , lewealth distributionthe elderly to the care unequalmembers may be more detrimen to the overall developement othe g the country .
Therefore , the government should pnsovide appropriate support and take care of them .
Every government makes a great number of efforts to bring more benefits to the public , such as giving them much more welfare , better lives , higher living standard , etc .
However , it is when people can prolong their life-span that the governments need to pay attention to another difficulty --- the social influences of an aging population .
It is a controversial issue regarding how much governments should invest in this matter .
Despite the fact that many people approve the idea of unlimited budget for the old , it would be better to set a limit to governments' expenses  for various reasons .
Investing in the aged  is not as profitable as investing in some other domains .
Apparently , it is not the elderly but the younger generation that is the "future" of a country .
Generally , the elderly cannot contribute to the development of their countries as much as the younger do and it is the younger generation that will assume the responsibilities of consolidating the country's powers as well as enhancing the nation's status in the world .
Therefore , instead of spending too much on the old ,  government's budget should focus on the people who will decide the future of its state .
The old people did contribute to the improvements of their countries in the pastand consequently , they deserve the government's care    .
If the government ignored this problem , the next generation may not be willing to devote itself to the country .
It should , however , be emphasized that the governments do pay attention to the aged population  .
The article Help the aged (2009) stresses that "the budget must not forget older people" even when governments are in difficult financial situation  .
In other words , governments greatly appreciate the contributions of the elderly and try to offer them more  , though they are constrained by a limited budget to do so .
From the point of view of the elderly , the more public expenses governments spend on them , the better the situation would be .
For instance , people will find that there is no need to prepare themselves for old  age  because  governments will ensure that they will live completely on public welfare  .
As a result , the   dependence on the governments may lead to unexpected problems  such as overspending  and a lack of the budget to invest in other fields  .
The Strategy for Older People (Welsh Assembly Government , 2003) also approved that the the spendingpending for the old should be limited so that the budget can be balanced  and it is considered as a strategy for the long-term development of every country .
The expenses for old people need to expand according to the  living standard as well as the increasing expenditure in modern society .
However ,  the problem lies with the definition of "limited" .
It is a constant proportion of the GDused to support  old people  .
When governments have budget to invest in other areas of  countries' development , the economy will operate welland he overall income  will escalate .
As a result , the spending for old people will also increase .
In conclusion ,  there should be a reasonable limit on spending for the old people so that the governments can balance their expenses  .
The aged should also be aware of this situationand be sympathetic towards their governments  .
With the combined efforts of governmentsand  individuals  , it is possible that the countries can achieve many targets at the same time: limited budget for the old people and the development of their nations .
The Korea population is graying rapidly , and the proportion of elderly with the aged of 65 and over is expected to reach 13 .2 per cent in 1960 .
Korea needs to reform its national policies if it hopehoped to create a better and sustainable future society as there will be a lot of negative impacts on the country  , such as the inevitable labor shortage , increase in public spending and healthcare problems if the ageing population continues to grow disproportionately with the country's fertility rate .
This is supported by Jones (1995) , stating that the increase in  population will have strong physical , psychological , social , cultural , economical and cultural implications .
Therefore , in view of this  , current research and policies have been carried out by the Korean government and have helped to buffer the ageing process .
A government pension system , namely the National Pension (NP) , which is financed in part by employee's contributions and employer's liability for general workers was introduced in 1988 for retirees over 60 ("Silver jobs in lieu of golden years , 2009) .
It is the main old- age pension program covering the majority of Korean workers .
However , this policy executed by the government did not attain its goal when many of the retirees chose to take their pension in a lump sum at retirement .
This implies that the financial security for these elderly in the future will be strongly affected if they do not use their pension wisely .
Considering this matter , in 2004 , the National Pension Service started finding jobs for the elderly and the project was made permanent in 2006 .
There was an overwhelming result when job placements rose from around 30 ,000 in 2004 to more than 83 ,000 in 2006 and 196 ,000 in the first half of this year .
Despite this progress , there are still  not enough openings for the baby boomers .
So , local governments have established "silver jobs" fair like chaperons for children returning home from late- night cram schools , gas station attendants , opinion survey interviewers and wedding officiators to recruit elderly job seekers as part of the government effort to assist a rapidly growing population of older Koreans in a changing society .
Social service programs have been introduced for the welfare of the elderly .
It can be divided into two groups: the recreational programs and community programs .
Under these programs , the elderly are able to obtain personal needs and social- psychological developments needs amongst others .
For example , under the community program , there is this sub- program called the Home- Help Program which provides home- help services to the elderly without any fees incurred .
Around 35 ,000 volunteer home helpers were active , linked to 552 voluntary organizations in 2001 with the provision of government in financial assistance for recruiting , training and maintaining volunteers .
Although many beneficial services have been provided to the elderly , this program  does not seem to be so effective as volunteers may or may not render their services whenever the elderly need them .
It is not a mandatory  for them to always lend a hand to the elderly .
Therefore , the government should think of a better way to tackle this problem so that the society will have a  domestic routine to serve the elderly who need its assistance .
Due to the low fertility rate and the growing number of elderly in the society , there is a shortage of workforce in certain occupations .
To keep an ideal and constant working age group (15-64 years) and ensure the stability of manpower in Korea , the government has been inviting immigrants to join the workforce .
The number of foreign labors has grown from a few thousand to estimates of 168 thousand in 1999 (Bureau of Medium- Sized Industries , 1999) and 358 thousands in 2005 .
This replacement migration  has not only helped to ease the ageing process when  older Koreans started to retire , which resulted in the decrease of manpower in certain specialization , it also has helped to buffer the current shortage of labor in the market .
Unfortunately ,  there are around 65 percent of the immigrants  in 1999 who are working illegally (Bureau of Medium- Sized Industries , 1999) .
The large volumes of immigrants to fill up the labor shortage due to population aging has also aroused fears of the loss of national identity (UN , 2000) .
Thus , even though the adoption of the immigrant policy has helped to ease the ageing process , it might not be the best policy to conquer the problem .
Intyre (1977) once said that old age throughout this century has been seen as a 'social problem' and this is true when the government has to adopt  all kinds of policies to overcome the problem .
With the  ageing  population , the priority of constructing a sustainable socioeconomic system at the beginning of the twenty- first century  must be given .
Peterson (2001) commented that in many developed countries , an ageing population will lead to a shrinking workforce , long- term stagnation and  a decline in real GDP .
Nevertheless , we agree with Frieden (year) , who concluded that ageing is not lost youth but a new stage of opportunity and strength .
Therefore , leaders  must design a desirable socioeconomic structure under the pressure of an ageing population and environment constraints by identifying the necessary  tools to attain stable and sustainable growth before taking any effective actions .
There will be 2 billion people with more than 60 years of age in the year 2050 , according to the UN (Nichols M . , 2007) .
Medical advancements allow people to live longer , and as a result , the number of elderly people has been on the increase .
Currently in many countries , the growing aging population has put a lot of pressure on the social services .
However , we can't  simply cut public spending on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development because of  3 reasons .The elderly have contributed to the societyand in the short run , old people without any means to support themselves will be struggling to live on .
Furthermore , in the long run , we may have to pay twice the price for what we have done .
Firstly , the aged have contributed their youth to the advancement of the society .
More than half a century ago , they have fought to restore peace to our country .
They worked hard to rebuild and develop the war-torn country into what we are living in now .
We owe them for the peace  and we have to thank them for  developing the country and the safe environment that we are living in .
Public pension , healthcare and all the services for the elderly symbolise our debt of gratitude to what they have done for us .
Won't it make us inhumane if we made our benefactors struggle when they are near the end of their lives ?
Is this really a decision coming from a civilized world ?
And how do you feel if the younger generation did this to you ?
Secondly , limiting  public spending on the aged means leaving out in the cold these vulnerable sub-groups of elderly people: single women , the uneducated and those who cannot save during their young days .
In the report "Demography is Not Destiny , Revisited" (2005) , R . B . Friedland and L . Summer pointed out that single women have particularly low average incomes .
The report also said that the uneducated have lower income and worse health than people with higher education .
Furthermore , it is not assured that all  are able to save up money during their younger days .
Therefore , they are the people who will suffer the most if we limit spending for the aged .
"Those who do not work do not eat" (author , year) .
However , what if they worked hard but still cannot afford to eat ?
In these situations , they really need a helping hand from the government to get by .
Critics of this position suggest that means-testing should be applied to limit the spending to just these vulnerable sub-groups .
However , things are not always simple and we will consider in the next paragraph the effect of reducing public spending on the society , even if means-testing is applied .
Thirdly , limiting public spending can lead to problems more grave than what we are currently dealing with .
Let us suppose that the government uses means-testing to limit spending on the elderly .
The old people outside the vulnerable sub-groups will either have to continue to work , or rely on their savings or their children to live on .
In the current situation , when the economic crisis is still not over yet and ageism is still present in workplace , old people are less likely to get a good job .
Moreover , old people are subjected to illnesses which may wipe out all their  savings .
Eventually , they will have to depend on their children or ask for help from the government .
Their children who  have to support themselves and their own children  would have to take care of their parents' well-being .
With all the extra expenses , the children may not be able to save enough for their own retirement .
This will result in an inescapable and cruel cycle of life which can only be resolved by reverting to the original policy and at the same time , create an  abrupt change in budget distribution .
In a country with a growing aging population , the elderly make up a substantial part of the populationand  play a bigger role in decision-making on  many issues .
The country's social stability will inevitably be disrupted if such a policy is applied forcibly without any consent from the elderly .
Another argument advocating the limiting of  budget for the old is that it is better to increase the wealth of the country by investing in the younger generation , which will be the future workforce of the country and temporarily spending lesser on the elderly , who have left , or will soon leave the workforce .
However , in times of difficulties , old people have no one but their families and relatives to rely on , and we are back in the situation that we have discussed earlier .
Furthermore , this strategy does not solve anything since the money diverted to other sectors indirectly become the money spent on the elderly .
In conclusion , we should not limit spending on the aged because it is our way to express our thanks to their contributions to the societyand this allows the under-privileged old people to live on  to maintain  economic and social stability .
Global aging population is one of the most critical and pressing issues that the leaders of the twenty first century face .
According to the United Nations report , the proportion of population aged 60 or above in  developed and less developed countries is projected to reach 33% and 25% respectively by 2050(United Nations , 2002) .
The change in the age structure of a country's population will have a profound impact on the political , social and economical conditions of that country .
In view of the increasing number of elderly , governments across the globe have implemented various policies to help them cope with the aging process .
Aging process here refers to the problems that will come about as one grows old , such as healthcare issues , financial problems and many more .
Although there are already policies in place , much changes and improvements have to be done to effectively help the elderly address their growing concerns and improve their quality of life .
Advocate of the government policies often argue that many countries have provided financial security and support for the aged through policies such as social pension and compulsory savings (Wesumperuma , 2009) .
While this may be true , such measures are ineffective in reducing old-age poverty as many elderly have little understanding of how the system works and do not possess the necessary financial knowledge to manage their savings and allowance .
As such , government has to put more emphasis and effort in imparting financial education and providing money advice and information to help the elderly to better finance their savings and incomes .
Due to the complexity of these policies , some elderly do not even know how to use them to their benefits , hence rendering them worthless .
In addition , a study by (Age UK  ,2009) shows that old people often do not know how to optimize their savings and spend their money carelessly .
As a result , their savings and incomes are exhausted quickly .
In another separate study by Chu &Yuen( 2008) , it is stated that around 67% of the respondents think that the compulsory saving in Hong Kong cannot provide them with a happy retirement life as they do not understand about the benefits of Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) scheme and hence do not care about it .
Therefore it is necessary that the government highlight the availability and benefits of their financial policies and equip the aged with basic financial education to increase the effectiveness of these policies .
Secondly , there is a need to increase the efficiency of the social and health care system by curbing the rising cost of health care service and making it more accessible to the aged .
Critics of this position often point out that there are already established health care system and policies in place to subsidise the cost of health care and that changes are frequently introduced to improve them .
Despite the changes that are being implemented , such measures are insufficient to help the aged as the root problems of rising cost and increasing inaccessibility are not addressed .
As pointed out by Tanner (2008) , rising health care cost is a global phenomenon .
Costly health care system is highly unsustainable as it strains government budget and imposes a great burden on the aged and their families' finances .
As a result , the savings and the income of the elderly may be used up quickly or large portion of their finances have to be spent on health care services .
One possible solution is to encourage people to buy more health insurance (University of Maine , 2001)  .
Many elderly are uninsured as they fail to realise that many of the illnesses that can be prevented or treated cheaply in the early stages very often worsen into critical conditions .
In addition , although there are health care systems in place , there are still many who do not have access to them .
This is due to the confusing systems that access the elderly base on ambiguous criteria that make it harder for them to obtain the service  , as well as  information and advice ( Help The aged we will , 2007) .
Hence , containing rising health care cost and increasing accessibility are essential to help ease the aging process .
Lastly , more should be done to increase the labour participation rate of the aged in the workforce .
An argument against this is that adequate effort has been put in to encourage later retirement and longer working lives .
Despite the effort , employment level of the aged still remain low as the elderly continue to face discrimination at work .
Older workers are often viewed as less dynamic and less creative as compared to the younger workersand thus they are less preferred .
Unless there is a change in attitude towards the older workers , it will be difficult for them to be find jobs , which can keep them active and support their financial needs .
Discrimination towards the older workers is more evident during the recession .
There was a 46% increase in the number of unemployed people in the UK whereas the biggest increase was those aged 60 and above with an increase of 65% (Wallop , 2009) .
A possible solution for this is to scrap the national default retirement age which often gives the power to employers to retrench those above this retirement age .
Also the government can give benefits or incentives to older workers to encourage them to go for re-training in order to increase their employability .
Employment can reduce elder dependency and provide some financial support for the aged to finance some of their activities .
Public spending is the amount of taxation collected by the the government to provide for services for its people such as education , health care and law and order maintenance .
Changes in demographic trends haveled to the rapid increase in the number of seniors  .
If the number of elderly continues to increase , pertinent problems will definitely escalate .
Therefore , government should spend more on the aged not only to ease their aging process , but also to tackle problems arising from a growing population .
Despite the government's consistent spending on the old , public spending on the aged should not be limited but should be used accordingly based on the circumstances .
First , it is a social obligation to provide for the seniors .
They are the ones who have contributed to the development of the country  .
They should at least be compensated for the efforts that they have put in for the younger generations to live more comfortably .
If the government were to place a limit on its spending for the aged , the aged will have to go through more difficult aging processes as there won't be sufficient provisions for the elderly to live more comfortably  , especially when the country is experiencing a huge demographic change  .
However , theseelderly constitute only a small portion of the whole aging population .
As asserted by Sol de Saca(2008) , the government should incorporate the needs of the older people in social policy designs and make them the first priority .
In order to ensure that , despite their different behaviours , the government have to generalise them as a whole and place more focus on their living .
Second , the elders will be the ones contributing the most in the near future .
Increasing spending on them will lead to increasing benefits for the country in the future .
Supported by the AARP report (2007) , most Singaporean  leaders consider population aging as an opportunity to create new roles for the elderly .
The government should therefore focus more on the older people by providing them with more training  .
In spite of the elderly's willingness to work , the employers may not want to take them in  , as suggested by the statistics retrieved from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2000): the forecasted number of people being employed for every person in year 2030 is 2 in Japan and 2 in Canada .
The reason may be the older people are not as productive and employers may not be prepared to take in these elderly citizens (AARP 2007) .
However , Angel Gurria , (2008) cited that in an era of rapid population aging , employers can no longer afford policies , employment practices and attitudes that discourage work at an older age .
This shows that employers will have to resort to employing the aged .
Thus , it will be prudent for the government to commence its course of actions earlier before the situation become worse .
The aged are not able to depend on young adults .
As Molina (2007) stated , the present-day adults are having increasingly fewer children , and thus , there will be increasingly fewer young people to care for their parents in their older years .
Due to that , the government is advised to lend a hand in helping them and  limiting its spending does not assist the aged .
However , one may argue that the elders maybe old but they have full capabilities to care for themselves .
In Japan (Reuters , 2007) , an old man passed away in his apartment for 3 years and no one knew about it until the landlord was prompted to visit him .
In view of that , it's known that the elderly can't really manage themselves , especially when they are getting older .
If nothingwere to be done to protect them , the aged will continue to suffer and the situation may even worsen in the next few decades .
It will help reduce the burden of the younger generations  when The government put more emphasis on the aged .
Lee (2009) has provided suggestions on helping the elders to become more self-reliant through the implementation of various policies  , such  as providing the elderly with better health care services and jobs  .
By doing so , the younger ones will be able to concentrate on  their jobs , which will in turn help develop the country and probably even increase the birth rate .
However , by doing so , it will increase the dependency of the young adults on the government to help support their parents .
They will begin to neglect their parents and forget about filial obligations to their parents .
What is recommended is the government should probably help only those elderly whose children are not financially capable of supporting their parents .
the government may have to create a new policy stating that those children who have stable income of a certain amount will have to take care of their parents .
By doing so , the government is able to concentrate on those who really require the help .
In Singapore Country Report (2007) , it is shown  that the most prominent  economic challenge in the next 20 years is the aging of the population  .
The future is dependent on how well the government incorporates policies to support the aged .
The Japanese are even resorting to the help of robots to support the aging population and cope with the declining labour force (Reuters , 2007) .
The government is able to buffer the effects if it places more attention on the aged .
Hence , the government should be advised to continue providing for the agedand try to overcome the obstacles presented  .
There are always some controversies over  the future of aging   , which is one of the most interesting subjects nowadays .
Some people think about it as a burden to the national economy which requires spending a lot on pension as well as health issues ,  while others argue that old people have the right to enjoy public money .
From my point of view  , I strongly agree with the idea which encourages government to reduce the amount of money spent on the aged  .
The very first and most striking point to note is that the world economy is suffering from many  recessions and the most recent one occurred from 2008 to first 6 months of 2009 .
This means that it will be a burden for the government to keep financing the pension or taking care of all the  expenditure  in health and accommodation issues .
And to be specific , I think there are also many other important fields that  need  government aid  , such as education or children's upbringing , which will definitely have a considerable influence on the country's future .
Secondly , the family should be responsible in taking care of the old  , so that the government can have more time and money to spend on other fields .
For example  , in some Asian countries such as Vietnam or Japan , their children are very willing to take care of their old parents till the end of their lives  .
This  is a  common moral obligation in Asian culture .
Nowadays ,  there are many blue-collar jobs which are  reserved for old people to earn a living .
For instance ,  I can see that most  blue-collar workers in Singapore are about over fifty .
Even though there are some people who argue that old people have the right to use the government financial aid because they have paid taxes , I personally think they , as well as their children , have  benefited from public services such as transportation , education , etc .
In short , I think not only the government , but also the family  have the responsibility to take care of the old people and so  public budget could be spent on many different areas to develop country  .
It is known by all that our society is aging .
Our government has played a huge role in implementing and improving our policies to maximize  aid for the elderly .
However , there will always be persisting problems that the government will face  , such  as planning for the national budget  , managing rising cost in the medical field and providing safety  measures in public areas .
Thus , current research and development in these areas are required  .
The national budget and the economy have come under pressure as the government provides heavy subsidies to the elderly in medical , transportation and even social activities .
Some might think that rather than having to research for and develop better economic policies , the government should  allocate  public funds tothe   .
However , we should not  blindly put these money into subsidies , but instead ,  use it to research for better policies or systems  .
With better policies , the government will be able to increase the productivity of the work force .
When productivity increases , economic growth will also follow .
There will be more money generated and fewer people will be in need .
One example would  the "Foreign Talent Policy" , which opened our market to foreign talents and thus increasing the productivity of the workforce .
The government introduced a scheme that allows people to provide in advance for their old age dependency .
They are encouraged to save a portion of their salaries into a special account when they are most active in the workforce .
In Singapore , this particular self-funded retirement scheme is called "CPF Contributions" .
This is where the employer and employee have to provide monetary contributions for that particular employee's CPF account .
Apart from this , there are additional or related schemes such as Medisave and Medishield .
Britain , Australia , Chile have also moved towards this kind of funded retirement schemes .
Therefore , current research in development and policies in the economy sector have helped in easing the aging process .
In the medical aspect ,  no medicine in the world can cure aging illnesses such as Dementia and Arthritis .
Even though this is a fact , advancement in the medical field has proven to  cure some old age diseases like Cataracts .
Constant research in this field has better prepared the elderly in terms of knowledge , treatments and physical conditions in relation to these diseases .
With prior knowledge , people will be mentally prepared for the aging process .
In addition , they can seek treatments in the early stages to prevent worsening of the conditions or even get cured .
This will also in turn save huge amount of money for the people , as later treatments will require one to pay a higher price .
Knowing the symptoms of a disease does help too .
One example is that when an elderly is having doubled or blurred vision , sensitivity to light and glare , he or she might be having cataract .
Thus they can seek treatment or go for a cataract surgery if needed .
Research and developments have also seen implementation of the latest technologies being used in hospitals , clinics and some even at home .
New age technologies like these have helped doctors to react within precious seconds in saving a person's life .
They can also assess the their patient's condition in a shorter and more accurate time frame .
For example , elderly with high blood pressure can check their blood pressure anytime and anywhere with just a push of the button on a compact , portable blood pressure monitor .
Thus , all these researches in medical field have aided the aging process tremendously .
From the medical sector , we have learnt that prevention is better then cure .
With that , architecture too has moved towards a more elderly-savvy approach in buildings and public areas to prevent unwanted accidents .
At this point , one may wonder if it were a waste of resources to invest in architectural aids because these structures are costly and do not serve as much purpose as compared to the other sectors such as medical .
However , these aids have proven to be essential despite their costly structures .
In areas populated with elderly  , such  as Redhill or Tiong Bahru , railings have been installed not only on pavements but also in public toilets as well .
Tiles or pavements with better friction have been placed in toilets to prevent the elderly from slipping .
In addition , one of the major projects that the Singapore's Ministry of Transport has developed is to install lifts in almost every MRT stations , which creates a barrier free route .
All these developments  help the elderly  , the disabled and pregnant women as well .
Thus , developments in these area are definitely worthwhile .
In conclusion , all the research and developments  , as well as  policies that the government has invested in , have made aging a more joyous and less terrifying journey .
Thus , current research , development and policies in the economy , medical sector and architectural sector have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
One of the biggest issues the world is facing now is the problem of an aging population .
Thus , there is an increasing number of concerns as to how to solve the problems of an aging population .
One of the most direct ways of dealing with the problems is to divert more government spending to the aged .
However , the amount of government funds available is limited .
By directing more funds to the aged , there will be lesser funds for other areas of the country's development .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Critics argue that by limiting the government spending on the aged , it would increase the negative impact of an aging population .
When lesser amount of government spending is given to the aged , the individuals and families will end up paying more .
Their financial burden will increase with financial related social problems following behind .
However , without limiting the government spending on the aged , the people may become too reliable on the government .
They may not take the initiative to save their money for future uses .
This could create serious problems for the government as it will cause additional pressure on the national budget and the economy .
The children may even end up not supporting their parents at all .
An example would be the increasing number of elderly suing their children for not supporting them in Singapore .
From August 2008 to July 2009 , Popatal (2009) found that there were 172 people who have filed applications at the Tribunal for Maintenance of Parents .
This is much higher than the average of 100 in previous years .
The elderly are being forced to get help from the government as their children are not willing to support them .
By limiting the government spending on the aged , the children will not push all the responsibilities of taking care of their aged parents to the government .
They will not form a habit of relying too much on the government .
Public spending on the aged should be limited as the elderly today are healthier as compared to people of the same age in the past .
The advances in research and development have made it possible to cure illnesses that are otherwise deadly .
For instance , according to the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports (MCYS , 2009) in Singapore , the percentage of residents aged 55 years and above who are physically independent are as high as 92 .2% in year 2005 .
This means that they are capable of finding a job to support themselves without having to depend on others .
This is also proven by the fact that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM , 2009) increased the retirement age in Singapore from 55 to 62 and the age is still expected to increase to 65 by year 2012 .
More elderly are now able to participate in the workforce actively .
Minimum help should be required from the government and so public spending on the aged should be limited .
Another reason why public spending should be limited is because a country does not only consist of the aged .
There are other sectors that need  government's help .
If the government's spending on the aged is not limited , the other sectors will be neglected .
The education sector is an example .
The education sector is very important to a country as it nurtures the young and turns them into useful adults .
The government helps the young by issuing bursaries and scholarships  , as well as encouragesthe students to study hard and helps those who are poor but are eager to go to school .
Without setting a limit on the government funds spent on the aged , all these will not be possible .
There will be lesser amount of skilful adults in the workforce and this may in turn slow down the economy .
Without economic growth , the government may face a deficit .
Taxes may have to increase and takes a bigger toll on the people .
Hence , it is important to limit  public spending on the aged so as to divert it to other areas of the country's development .
In conclusion , it is important to limit the spending on the aged so that people will not be too reliable on the government .
They should also be aware that the elderly are now healthier and  are capable of supporting themselves .
A country does not consist of only the aged and spending too much government funds is unnecessary and will cause a negative impact on the economy .
The population in the world is aging rapidly and the number of persons aged 60 or over is expected almost to triple , increasing from 737 million in 2009 to 2 billion by 2050 globally .
(United Nations , 2009) This signals the need to deal with this pressing issue of aging Population .
Fortunately , many countries have recognized this need and have come up with different strategies to tackle the aging issues .
Many countries' current strategies have been formulated with the elderly in mind and hence they are able to address the needs of the elderly , thereby easing their aging process .
"Aging" is defined as the process of becoming old .
(Oxford University Press , 2005) Hence , easing the aging process would mean making the course towards old age an enjoyable and less tedious one for the elderly .
In the Singapore context , there are many different approaches in place and the few main ones include the implementation of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , development and improvement made to the existing healthcare system and elder-friendly infrastructure and the implementation of the Tax Relief Scheme .
All these have  helped to alleviate the aging process and allow the elderly to enjoy their twilight years to the fullest .
The CPF in Singapore has played a crucial role in helping to reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency as it compels citizens to save in advance for their old age (Central Provident Fund [CPF] Board , 2009) .
Critics of this plan have debated that it is unsuitable as high costs of living makes it difficult for people to save more of their earnings for  pensions .
Thus it is incapable in helping to relieve the financial burden of the elderly .
However , this may not be true as with judicious planning of their spending , it is not impossible for them to save more while they are still active in the work force and be financially independent in old age .
Also , other social issues associated with an aging population ,   like declining birth rate and people living longer , have indicated that there will be fewer working adults available to contribute to the society and to support the aged .
Therefore , this has increased the significance of the CPF as it compels people to save in advance lest they are unable  to support themselves during their old age .
Furthermore , the CPF has helped to rule out the possibilities of younger generations neglecting  the importance of saving for their old age  .
Hence , the CPF has indeed helped to ease the aging process and the financial burden of the elderly as it requires people to save in advance and also informs citizens on how much they should save in order to be self- sufficient for their old age .
This gives people  a sense of security in their twilight years as they are now  able to enjoy their lives without much financial worries .
Apart from the CPF , development and improvement made to the existing healthcare system and elder-friendly infrastructure have also eased the problem of disabilities and old-age illnesses .
These actions are superficial and inadequate as they do not directly deal with the problems related to old age; and therefore are unable to ease the aging process .
However , this may not be the case as with improved healthcare system; it helps  the elderly because their healthcare needs will be better taken care of .
An example will be the introduction of more community hospitals to provide better and affordable healthcare services to the elderly .
In addition , with the development of more elder-friendly infrastructure within the community ,  the community will become barrier-free , safer and more conducive for the elderly .
One of such projects is the lift upgrading programme (Lee , 2009) .
The improved lifts will stop at every floor and this will  better cater to the needs of the elderly .
Additionally , to allow the aged to move about conveniently , many places , including public transportations have been made wheel-chair accessible .
Hence , with a safer environment and with the provision of elder-friendly infrastructure and unhindered access to the public facilities , the elderly will be allowed to move about freely and enjoy their old age .
Implementation of the Tax Relief Scheme such as The Aged Parent Relief is also an important step to improve the retirement security as it encourages children to take care of their parents , thereby easing the aging process (CPF , 2009) .
At this point , one may take advantage of this scheme to claim the tax reliefs for one's use as it is nearly impossible for the government to keep track of where the money is being spent on .
Thus the elderly parents may not be at the receiving end .
While this may indeed happen , the government has taken a further step to discourage this from happening .
For instance , the government has passed the Maintenance of Parents Act to allow elderly parents to file lawsuit against their children who have failed to carry out filial obligations (Khalik , 2009) .
Hence , this act has helped to deter the children from making use of the tax relief scheme inappropriately and has also sustained the main objective of the scheme to promote filial piety .
Thus , with the potential "loophole" being dealt with , the tax relief scheme will be able to help in lessening the financial burden that the children have to take on from looking after their parents .
All these helped to encourage the children to look after their parents and at the same time , ensure that the elderly parents will be at the receiving end .
Hence , these approaches have increased the seniors' confidence and security during their twilight years .
Overall ,  strategies such as the introduction of CPF , the development and improvement of the elder-friendly infrastructure and healthcare system and the implementation of tax relief scheme have indeed helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
These strategies have helped to ensure that the elderly are self-sufficient during their old age and also allowed them to live in a more conducive and barrier-free environment .
Although there is still room for improvement , current strategies have already done a pretty great well in ensuring that the individuals have saved enough for their old age and  increasing their sense of  security .
All these have indeed made the process towards aging a more enjoyable and fulfilling one and  allowed the aged to truly enjoy their well-prepared twilight years .
Expenditure on the elderly is taking up more of the government budget due to the rapidly aging population .
Money that can be otherwise spent on the country's developments has to be used in settling the problem of the greying population .
Countries are spending more and more money on health care , infrastructure and transportation specially custom-made for the elderly .
Due to this , the country's development in other areas has to take a step back , thus resulting in the inability to attain its potential .
In the  essay , I shall discuss the problems that are brought about by the increase in public spending on the aged and the areas that could have benefited if the fund were to be used on them instead .
When a country like the United States'' elderly population increased eleven-fold between 1900 and 1994  , it  is evident that there will be an increase in personal assistance for the aged (Hobbs , 1993 , 25-1104) .
This will translate into an increased funding  to provide care for this group of people .
On top of the money being put aside for health care  for the aged , barrier-free facilities like wheel-chair friendly roads and transportation system have to be planned to accommodate  them .
To deal with these global aging problems , governments  have to reserve a large proportion of the already limited public spending for the elderly .
This result in a reduction of the government budget for the country's development in both economic and social terms .
The fund used on the elderly could otherwise be spent on allowing the country to have better economic growth by building a better infrastructure  and an  education system .
In this way , the general population will be able to benefit from the increase in income as a result of the economic growth .
On the other hand , it is not morally right to leave the aged to fend for themselves , especially when they had contributed in one way or another to the country's development in their younger days .
It is true that the government should reward the aged for their contributions; but in order for the country to continue enjoying a sustained growth , the public spending have to be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
In addition , the responsibility of supporting the elderly does not only lie on the shoulders of the government , the elderly themselves should plan for their retirements when they are still economically active .
This is done by implementing policies like the Medisave system , where Singaporeans have to put aside a certain percentage of their income into the Medisave account (Central Provident Fund) .
This system is to ensure that the senior citizens will be able to live on their own savings in the Medisave account .
Not only that , the children should also be show filial piety for their aged parents .
In cases where the elderly are childless or physically ill due to aging ,  it will be the government's duty to take care of them .
However ,  contrary to what is commonly believed , Pat Thane (citation) argued that , they are not inevitably unhealthy .
As  living conditions improve and technology advances , people are able to lead a healthier lifestyle and live longer as compared to the past .
Thane also said that " many tasks can be performed as well by people in their seventies as by younger people , even when they involve quite heavy physical or intellectual demands" (Thane ,1991) .
As a result of the above mentioned arguments by Pat Thane , the Senior lecturer in Social Science and Administration at Goldsmiths College , London , being old might not be translated to being a burden to the society .
The elderly , especially the "young elderly" , would surely be able to earn a living on their own if they do not have the luxury of  children supporting them .
Therefore , an aging population might not pose problems as feared .
In summary , public spending on the aged should be limited because of the fact that the elderly should have planned for their old age when they were young and they might still be able to support themselves if the need arises .
A country will be able to progress if its citizens do their part in planning for their retirement  .
Many countries are facing the problems brought about byan aging population  .
For instance , the workforce gets smaller as elder workers retire and the working class has to pay more taxes because of  a slower economic growth and the need to provide more healthcare services for the aged .
Even though the world is facing an aging population , public spending should not be spent only on the aged as there are many other areas that need to be taken care of in a country's  development .
The aging population is already a problem in many countries such as Japan and Singapore .
Therefore , public spending had been reviewed to address this problem and  to reduce the negative impact of the aging problems  .
However , due to  practical reasons , a country has its limitations in supporting the aged .
Hence , countries should assess the other important areas that public spending should be focused on as well .
On the other hand , if public spending on the aged were reduced , many social problems would arise in the country .
As the aged are used to receiving allowances and subsidies , the lack of government aids might affect their lives .
They would be unable to support themselves , especially with the increasing  healthcare costs .
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics , the Consumer Price Index for healthcare had  increased  3 .6% from February 2008 to February 2009 .
This would mean higher costs of living for the aged .
Therefore , in this case , moral issues need to be considered as well .
Children of the aged they should do their part in taking care of their parents after their retirement .
In conservative countries such as Singapore , children are expected to taking care of their parents by providing them with allowances to meet their daily needs .
Children should remember how their parents have taken care of them when they were young and hence , should do their part in demonstrating  filial piety and take care of their aged parents , instead of relying on the country to help .
In order to ensure that the aged are properly taken care of by their children , government could introduce policies and enforce them  .
This would help to enforce  moral values and also directly reduce public spendingthat could be diverted to other areas of development .
Other areas of development include addressing social issues such as the decrease in the birthrate and the increase in child abuse cases .
In Singapore , the Marriage and Parenthood package with the extension of the Baby Bonus attained only marginal success in increasing the birthrate of Singaporeans .
The median age of citizen mothers at first birth had increased over the years from 28 .6 in 1998 to 29 .4 in 2008 , thus causing the fertility rate for the prime childbearing age group of 20 to 34 to decline .
Hence , public spending could be used to introduce more programs and subsidies to encourage people having larger families instead .
With increased birthrate , Singapore would be able to resolve the problem of aging population in the near future .
Besides aging population , other social issues such as child abuse are also crucial problems that need to be addressed .
According to the Social Statistics 2009 conducted by the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , the number of child abuse cases investigated in Singapore had increased from 154 in 2007 to 176 in 2008 .
This significant increase indicates that attention should be diverted to address this problem .
Public spending could be used to ensure that there are ways to reach out to the abused victims in the society .
In addition , it is essential to increase public awareness through campaigns and seminars to givethe public a better understanding on child abuse .
With this , the society could play a part in creating a safer environment for children and hence , enhancing the social development in Singapore .
Even though many countries are facing aging population , there is a still a limit on what can be done .
Thus , countries should not be overwhelmed by the problems of aging population and overlook other potential problems .
In conclusion , public spending should be used on the aged but also not neglecting other problems  which hinder the country's development .
Too much of the nation's budget is being spent on aiding the elderly and the government should limit and channel these funds to other more important areas for the country's development .
For most countries , part of their national budget will be spent on funding the aged each year .
For example , $121million is set aside as Senior Citizen Bonus in Singapore this year (Budget Highlights , 2009) .
The elderly receive subsidies in various areas such as housing and medical benefits .
As the elderly today are able to survive without subsidies from the government , these funds should be put to better use and be directed to support the country's development .
The society has stressed on the importance of filial piety which requires children to take care of their parents .
Children are obliged to take care of their parents and this will lessen the burden on  society to take care of the elderly .
Thus , less funds are needed to help these elderly .
Excess funds should then be channeled to other areas for the country's development .
Many may think that with the obligation to support their parents , the  family members will bear a heavier burden  .
However , providing for the parents is not an additional burden for the children as there are benefits when they take care of their parents .
For example , the tax relief for adults who live with their aged parents has been increased to $5000 and the CPF Housing Grant Scheme to encourage young couples to stay near their parents ("Round Up Speech" , 2007) .
Therefore , it is not true to say that  working adults bear a heavier burden from supporting their parents because government incentives are provided .
Hence , the government should limit the amount used to aid the elderly as their financial needs are taken care of by their own family members .
Nowadays , the elderly are able to support themselves .
Chan (1999) showed that elderly respondents with CPF accounts are significantly less likely to rely on children as their main source of financial support .
Evidence suggests that as CPF coverage widens , reliance on children will probably decrease .
The government has implemented policies to help citizens prepare for their retired life .
Policies such as compulsory CPF and Medisave savings both require citizens to set aside part of their salaries to meet their future  needs .
Even if the elderly can support themselves , some may argue that since they pay taxes  , they  should be allowed to use the funds set aside for them .
Funds directed to other areas for the country's development will also benefit the society , such as  the construction of handicapped-friendly ramps and upgrading of HDB flats' lift to serve at all levels .
The taxes that they pay may be channeled to support these upgrading works and benefit everyone .
With these policies implemented by the government , the elderly do not need so much financial assistance to meet their needs .
Everyone should be responsible for themselves .
The aged should  continue to work  beyond their retirement age when they are still capable of supporting themselves .
In recent years , the government has been promoting elder employment and raising the eligible age for employment .
Hence , the elderly should have no problem finding jobs to financially support themselves .
Others may think that the elderly have already contributed their share to  society and should now retire .
However , instead of letting them idle at home , the retired should be allowed to return to the workforce and continue to contribute to the economy .
Not only are they able to benefit financially , they are also able to share their precious experiences with the younger generations .
With the elderly returning to the workforce , they will be less dependent on the government subsidies and thus , less funds should be set aside for the elderly .
The elderly will be supported in their retirement   by their working family members  , and gaining help from government policies (CPF savings , Medisave funds and Elderly bonuses) .
There is no need to worry about the large sum of financial aid required by the aged .
All in all , funds should be limited and directed to other more important areas for the country's development so that the country will be able to remain competitive in the economy and achieve sustained economic growth .
As developed countries globalize and industrialize , the aging population is one of the most prominent problems faced by them .
They not only struggle to balance the social needs and interests of different demographic groups but also to sustain economic growth .
Countries like Singapore and Japan have a social security system in place to help the aged , and at the same time , a substantial sum of public spending is allocated to look after their health and welfare (Takayama , 2005) .
However , public spending should also be allocated to other areas of the country's development ,  such as education , small medium enterprises (SMEs) and the infrastructure   .
These areas would  benefit the public and are effective in tackling the aging issues in the long run .
Therefore ,  public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development to strike a balance while tackling the aging issues .
Education is a key area in which public spending should be utilized to increase a nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) .
per capita , labour productivity and international competitive edge .
One nation's economy success depends on the quality of the workforce (Edwards , 2008) .
Highly educated future generations will tend to earn more incomes and be more health conscious , thus less reliant on government for health and welfare (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
Singapore owes its economic success to the good management of the education system and meeting the demand for skills through training the workforce to meet and keep up with the economic changes (Lee , Goh and Fredriksen , 2008) .
Singapore's social security system , which focuses on self-reliance and individual savings , is in line with the compulsory saving scheme , the Central Provident Fund (CPF) .
The CPF Education Scheme allows people to use the ordinary account to pay for  tertiary education in  local institutions , and at the same time , encourages more people to further their education (Mehta , and Wee , 2004) .
Education can also be a channel for the nation to emphasize filial obligations in order to increase willingness of the future generations to take care of their parents when they are old (Peterson , 2001) .
As part of the Singapore's education system , National Education aims to foster national cohesion , a sense of belonging and good moral values (Ministry of Education , 2009) .
Nevertheless , educating the workforce , including the aged , on the importance of planning for retirement and continuous skills upgrading are also essential .
This allows the workforce to start accumulating their wealth until the retirement age and at the same time , especially for the aged to remain productive through skill upgrading (Peterson , 2001)
Public spending should also be allocated to implement various schemes for the development of the Small Medium Enterprise (SME) .
sector .
The various schemes aim to help the SMEs increase their revenue and attract investors through upgrading the existing business operations and creating gateway and funding opportunities (Spring Singapore , 2009) .
In 2008 , the National Research Foundation (NRF) announced that 75 million Singapore dollars were set aside to support the Proof-of Concept grants (POC scheme) for the SMEs to strengthen innovation and entrepreneurship as the sector contributes over 40% of the GDP and half of the employment workforce (Loh , 2007) .
At the same time , the government also provides grants to support SMEs to recruit , retrain and retain their workers , especially the older workers , to ensure productivity .
Two examples of the grants are the Human Resource Capability Package developed by SPRING Singapore and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) , which improves and strengthens SMEs' human resource management capabilities  , as well as  the ADVANTAGE !
Scheme , which motivates SMEs to recruit older workers (Ministry of Manpower , 2006) .
These will help to lower the barriers to elder employment , enabling them to work longer and accumulate more wealth for their retirement (Peterson , 2001)
Infrastructure is another area where public spending should be set aside for as it benefits everyone in the long run .
Enhancing and upgrading of common places such as sport facilities , schools , public housing estates , roads and parks are to satisfy the needs  of the public .
It can also be seen as an evidence of public spending .
In 2009 , the Singapore Senior Minister of State for National Development announced that the government plans to spend between S$18 and S$20 billion on infrastructure projects and another S$15 to S$17 billion in 2010 and 2011 respectively .
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted in the National Day Rally Speech 2009 that new general hospitals (Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Jurong General Hospital) would be built in response to the healthcare needs in Singapore , and  on top of that , there is also a need to build step-down care .
Twinning the current general hospitals with  community hospitals , which are run by charitable organizations , will make healthcare affordable for all , especially the aged .
For example , a bridge would be built to link Tan Tock Seng General Hospital to Ren Ci Community Hospital that enables  patients from Tan Tock Seng General Hospital  to be moved to Ren Ci Community Hospital for rehabilitation and the patients may pay lesser for health care costs .
The 2008 yearly report from the World Health Organization on global health statistics stated that Singapore utilizes 3 .7 percent of its GDP on healthcare , which is generally low as compared to the United States' 15 .4 percent .
Singapore uses only one-fourth of its taxes , which is about only $381 per capita on health and individuals pay for the rest (Callick , 2008) .
This shows the importance of tackling the roots of the high cost of healthcare instead of using the public spending directly on the aged .
Aging issues are very complicated but not indomitable .
For all nations , wise planning on public spending and wise policy planning are very crucial as they influence one's future (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
Creating welfare dependency on the government only solves the issues temporarily .
In order to prevent this , public spending on the aged should be limited .
Instead , it should be used on other areas of development to tackle the roots of the issues and improve the quality of life for the aged .
Public spending refers to the expenditure incurred the government , which may include expenses on  military , health , education , infrastructure , development projects , and the cost of servicing (paying off the interest on) overseas loan .
Aging problems are likely to cause a substantial increase in public expenditure on health .
But the steady development of a society as a whole needs a balance of public spending on all aspects .
Thus the government should be cautious in expanding spending in the aging population , taking into account the impact on economic growth .
Many recent reports (citation) from developed countries have found that ageing will have only a small effect on the healthcare expenditure in future , thus spending on the aged can be limited within a certain small scope of the proportion of GDP .
For example , reports from the United States , the United Kingdom and Australia have reached similar conclusions .
There are two reasons why researchers have reached this conclusion .
Firstly , the older population is not spending a large proportion of the country's GDP , and the fact is not simply that the  greater the proportion of older people  , the greater would be the  spending  .
For example ,  Sweden and  Australia have similar  ,  .
In 2000 , 17 .3% of the Swedish population was aged 65 years or older; it spent only 8 .6% of its GDP on health .
This is less than the 9 .3% spent by Australia in 2001-02 , when only 12 .7% of the population was 65 years or older .
Secondly , many countries have adopted effective strategies to make the expenditure on health for an aging population  small and manageable , Here are some of the strategies: (1) stratify the old by age and sex; (2) ; (3) increase transparency about self-employed income to ensure fairness in the financing of social insurance systems , including the new long-term care insurance .
But , the aging problem may be exaggerated , due to a variety of reasons .
Firstly , the factors that increase the financial expenditure have been over-emphasized  .
It is true that older people use more health care services than younger people and that the proportion of older people in the population is increasing .
These factors do have a certain impact .
For example , the proportion of people in the UK who require help with activities of daily living in 1991 is half of that in 1976 .
Secondly , some groups of people may require a significant increase in public spending on the aging population .
One group is the old .
Compared to long-term economic development , they may be more concerned about their own welfare .
Another group is the government .
With an increasing number of elderly voters , politicians may provide excessive benefits to the elderly to win votes .
If the government finds that aging is a heavy burden , it is bound to decrease the necessary public expenditure , thereby forcing more people to use private health institutions .
Thirdly ,  increased fiscal spending may be due to other factorsinstead of the aging population .
Here I list three of them .
Firstly , the cost of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic tests have increased .
The report published by the Australian Federal Government found .
Thirdly , normal doctor's prescription prefers newer drugs and the drugs are inclined to be expensive , but not necessarily more effective  . 
If  public spending on the issue of aging were unrestricted , the coming wave of retiring Baby Boomers may wash away projected budget surpluses and  erode existing spending priorities .
For example in America , it is already estimated that over half of federal domestic spending  went to people 65 and older .
The burden of the government will increase as the richer old people  For example , in  Korea , there is  pressure on the government for increased outlays on pensions and  healthcare .
Thus it requires additional tax revenue .
In conclusion , the public spending on the aged should be limited , so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Many countries , including Singapore , are facing the issue of  aging population .
There are many implications for this issue and one of them is that the spending by the government on the aged has increased in order to deal with this issue .
This affects the amount of available funds  spend on other areas of the country's development ,  such as the economy , education and infrastructure .
Thus , in today's society , much has been debated on whether public spending should be limited so that more money can be diverted to other areas for the country's development .
In my own opinion , I agree to a large extent that public spending on the aged should be limited .
One of the reasons to limit public spending on the aged is that there is a greater need to spend money on education than on the aged .
For countries such as Singapore where labor is vital and is the only resource , spending on education is important for the future growth of the country .
Furthermore , in Singapore where it is currently experiencing a low birth rate , developing  the young is crucial to ensure there will be sufficient  local talents in  future .
This is to ensure that Singapore will be able to stay competitive  in the future .
Therefore , in the long run , spending on education will generate economic benefits for the country .
On the other hand , if this same amount of money is to be spent on the aged , there will be no economic benefits generated by them for the country .
Hence , if the government did not limit its spending on the aged , there would be a  budget  left for developing the education sector .
This may affect the country in the long run .
It can also be argued that there is a greater need to spend on infrastructure development as it is  important  .
to limit spending on the aged means that there will be a larger amount of funds available to spend on infrastructure development .
This fund allows the country to develop proper infrastructure such as roads , electricity and even water supply to attract more foreign investors to set up firms in the country .
Superior infrastructure attracts foreign investors to set  up business in the country as it reduces production cost and also increases accessibility for their business .
Attracting foreign investors is important as foreign investments contribute to the country economic development .
Therefore , if government spending on the aged  increases due to aging population issues , the budget on infrastructure development will be lesser and this may affect the country's economic development  .
Another reason to limit public spending on the aged is that there is a need to set aside a larger amount of money for economic development especially  when there is global economic downturn .
As the economy is a key area of a country's development , the government should spend more money on economic development in order to sustain a healthy economic growth .
In addition , a prosperous economy will lead to the increase of wealth .
This means that the burden of supporting the aged by the society will be lessened .
Thus , developing the economy will bring benefits to both the country and the aged in long run .
On the flip side , spending on the aged is  equally  important  .
To limit spending on the aged does not mean that government should not spend on them .
As they are part of the country's population , there is a social responsibility to take care of the aged .
Moreover , this group of elderly had worked hard for years when they were young and had contributed to the economy and society .
I conclude that there is a need to limit public spending on the aged as there are other areas that require money for the country's development .
After all , the aged is not the only area that we should look into when deciding on the allocation of public spending .
There is a need for the government to take a wider perspective on the different areas that need money  when deciding on how much money is to be spent on each area .
Throughout the entire world ,  leaders of developed countries are concerned with the problems of an aging  population .
A country's budget would be spent in a few key areas such as defense , healthcare , environment , transport , research and development and education .
Public spending on the aged is necessary but should be limited in order for the money to be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
If majority of the spending is focused on the aged , it would limit the growth of the country  , which  would consequently lower the standard of living for all .
Firstly , with a shrinking workforce and an increase in expenditure required in welfare , the country will need to focus on developing the further generations .
"All who have meditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depends on the education of youth" --- this quote by Aristotle clearly states that education is the crucial factor to determine a country's success and progress .
With proper education system , the young will be more productive when they enter the workforce .
Hence a highly skilled workforce in turn will boost the country economy and sustain the additional demands of a graying population .
The population should also be instilled with a strong sense of responsibility towards their parents from young through education .
Therefore a portion of public spending should be given to  equip the young with the right mind set and skills which are relevant to the needs of the workforce .
Secondly , a key area which requires funding is  research and development sector .
With strong support on research , new breakthrough can be discovered to cure chronic illnesses or age related diseases .
The cost of health care could be lowered with advancement in science and  medication which are more effective  .
Effective medication would translate into a shorter time spent in hospitals .
Therefore it lowers the elderly's burden on healthcare and improves or stabilizes the health of frail elderly .
Healthier elderly are able to return to the workforce and contribute to the country's development .
It may be argued that the amount invested in research does not produce equal rewards .
However , without continuous trials and errors ,  new innovations could not be made .
It is due to the persistent effort of researchers that many of today's technologies have been discovered .
Research and development on the defense of the country is also essential .
A country would be considered extremely vulnerable  with its graying population (less able-bodied individual) and outdated weaponry .
Thus with adequate funding on the research and development ,  the country will be at a better position .
Thirdly , an emphasis should be placed on the country's healthcare system .
With a shrinking workforce and an ever-increasing cost of living , the aged would  have difficulty coping with daily expenses and  medical bills .
Critical illnesses could empty  the elderly of their retirement fund and thus the government should provide medical subsidies .
If the government did not provide any form of aid and shifted the responsibility to the family or society , there would be catastrophic consequences .
Society could deem the government as unsympathetic .
Those who are more affluent might migrate  , which could cause a loss of investors and talents  .
This may affect the country's development .
Statistics have also shown that there is an increase in spending on prescribed medicine ; from $535 in 1999 to $1410 in 2001 (Goulding , 2005) .
Families footing the medical bills will in turn have lesser capital for the other expenses; namely , the children's education and  daily necessities .
Needy households might encourage their children to take up part time job to supplement the family finances .
Children might  grow up to be ineffective workers as their education have been disrupted .
This would negatively affect the society and the country's economy on a whole .
A developed country with a graying population brings about a shrinking workforce .
If spending were focused  on the aged it could cripple the country's economy and halt developments .
With appropriate  spending on key areas such as education , research and development and healthcare ,  the country could progress despite the additional demand of an aging population .
Leaders of the country should balance the benefits of individual , society and country with care to maximise the country's potential for development .
Dealing with baby boom had always been the predominant issue in the past decades .
Sectors like housing and consumers'market had to be carefully taken care of .
The economy underwent a series of revolutionary changes due to the  surge in population , hitting greater heights as the trend continued .
Now , the perennial concern of a fast an aging population has surrounded the world .
Increasing elderly spending has shrunk the budgets of many countries , especially the developed ones where the problem of aging population is more vivid .
If no effort is being put to limit the increasing healthcare and social security costs , expenditures on other priorities will soon come under pressure .
Although spending on the elderly is inevitable in the face of aging population , careful spending is necessary in diluting the effect of fiscal consequences .
Limiting elderly spending does not confine to only within the present .
It is about coming out with a permanent solution which would curb  spending in the long run .
In Australia , the mean-testing pensions have helped to cut down a significant amount of aging population costs .
However , statistics have shown that the nation's health care spending will still nearly double from 6 .4% of its GDP in 2002 to 11 .5% in 2025 due to the larger proportion of elderly in relative to its population .
Therefore , the fiscal outcome may not turn out to be ideal because other expenses such as education and national defence will end up being squeezed .
So it can be deduced that limiting elderly spending in the present does not equate to paying off in the future .
To deal with such challenges , the proportion of GDPs spent on healthcare and social security for the aging population should be aimed to scale down permanently .
Governments should spend more money on creating healthcare awareness .
As the average life expectancy in the world increases , people are living longer and they may become more vulnerable to contracting chronic illnesses at  old age .
Promoting healthy lifestyles and imparting valuable knowledge on healthcare are some of the options .
It is important for the elderly to know how and where to seek for help once they have contracted an illness  .
They can tackle the illness at its earlier stage , thus reducing the hefty healthcare costs if it were treated at a much later stage .
Eventually the economy will benefit when people become healthier and spend lesser on their healthcare .
After all , the benefits of this measure will definitely outweigh the limitations , and the measure is able to cut down the amount spent in the medical sector in  future .
Freidland and Summer (2005) suggest the importance of increased productivity of future workers , regardless of age , for better economic growth .
However , in the future , the bulk of the working population will have to come from the retiring baby boomers .
There are several limitations to the extent of how  productivity can be increased among these workers .
Firstly , for the more well-off elderly , they are less willing to work as they want to enjoy their retirement .
Secondly , more health issues will surface if the elderly are to work more or longer , especially for the less well-offs as most of them have difficulty in paying for their medical expenses .
Hence , in order to have  better economic growth , the process should be viewed with a more comprehensive perspective .
Government should provide a wider protection net for the elderly , such as implementing health insurances , promoting health campaigns  and  better welfare programs so as to reduce the mental and financial burden on the aged .
And this means spending on the elderly is required .
Although economic growth is important in providing care for the elderly , the limit  on the elderly spending should be set carefully , so that they would not create any adverse effects on the economy .
As the elderly will likely to form the core of the population in  future , they are becoming the major source of the economic growth .
Thus , their welfare and healthcare should be well taken care of .
When this condition is satisfied , economic growth then can be sustained to cater for other areas of country's development .
The aging population in Singapore is increasing .
This implies that there are lesser young people to support the larger group of elderly .
Therefore , the government has to channel more resources to look after the welfare of the elderly , especially in the healthcare sector  .
Additional hospitals , such as the Jurong Hospital , are being built in Singapore to meet the escalating demand for healthcare and to provide better services .
However , this may result in the elderly being over dependent on the government .
Eventually , this will strain the country's economy and development .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be controlled so that money can also be diverted to other important areas of the country's development .
This  gives rise to the problem of  the aged being self-sufficient and self-supporting in old age .
The elderly are physically disadvantaged in the workforce .
Moreover , employers often hesitate to employ them as the  society is technologically inclined  .
There are many young professionals who , although may not have  work and management experience ,  have the much sought after skills .
Thus , it might not be easy for the elderly to work and support themselves .
In addition , the elderly might be reluctant to work due to being over reliant on the government .
Apart from providing financial support to the elderly , the government should try to help the elderly in other ways so as to reduce the dependency of the elderly on the government .
Hence , public spending on the aged should be restricted .
"The Government has a duty to look after the elderly , he said , but it cannot replace the love and warmth of a family ," said PM Lee in the National Day Rally 2009 (2009 , Aug 17) .
The government has been constantly emphasizing the importance of filial piety and the duty of  children to look after their parents .
From young , the students are taught the values of filial piety .
In Singapore , filial piety is enforced legally .
The government came up with the Maintenance of Parents Act in  1996 and has been studying to  use  legal pressure to ensure that the children will take care of their parents  .
This would reduce the reliance of the elderly on the governmentand subsequently , the government's budget on the elderly need not be as huge .
The government has highlighted to the public the importance and benefits of Financial planning for  old age .
financial planning allows  people to provide for themselves when they have retired or are incapable of supporting themselves financially .
Thus , they would be less of a burden to the government .
The CPF sets aside a sum from their monthly salary to prepare for the rainy days and their old age .
The various aspects of the benefits of CPF include retirement , healthcare , home ownership , family protection and asset enhancement .
Hence , self supporting is another way to reduce dependency on the government .
The government has a duty to take care of the aging population .
However , they should limit  public spending on the aged .
The responsibility to look after the aged should be shouldered by the children as well .
In addition , the aged could prepare themselves for their old age  , and thus reduce the burden of others .
Limiting  public spending on the aged reduces their dependency on the government .
Also , more money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Ageing population is a pervasive phenomenon affecting countries worldwide .
Governments have been working on strategies to deal with this problem .
One of the strategies is to increase the birth rate of the country .
For example , Singapore has implemented the baby bonus scheme to lighten the financial costs of raising children .
However , the government not only has to deal with reducing ageing population ,  but also to attend to the needs of the aged  .
There is a need to subsidize the aged for their healthcare , transport , facilities  .
More public spending has to be channeled to cater to the needs of the aged .
One may argue that public spending on the aged could be used on the country's development .
The development of the country is important but public spending on the aged should never be limited under all circumstances .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited .
The aged  deserves to receive the best welfare given by the country .
It is known that they had contributed to the country  during the prime  of their lives .
Their contributions should be recognized .
A practical way of recognizing their contribution is to provide them with subsidies and growth packages .
By limiting public spending on the aged , it may signify that the government perceives  the country's development to be as more important than the welfare of the people .
Some  people would resent the government for seeing development more important than its people .
In  extreme cases , some of them would hold protests to vent their anger towards the government .
There could be a social backlash if the government were to limit the public spending on the aged .
The people may view  the government as not wanting to take care of the aged , and see them as a burden .
This could cause the people to be skeptical about their welfare  in  future .
The morale of the local workforce could be affected .
Some people may seek to migrate to countries that will look after the welfare of the aged .
And the migration of the workforce would lead to a shortage of workers in the country .
Shortage of labour would impede the growth of the country .
Therefore , this would affect economic development of the country  .
On the other hand , limiting the amount of public spending  on the aged could help the country to develop more effectively during a crisis .
If the country faced an economic downturn , its revenue would be reduced .
This calls for a need for the government to spend on areas which could boost the economy .
Money should be spent more wisely in helping the country to get out of an economic downturn .
With  reduced revenue , the government should be more flexible in limiting the public spending on the aged .
By limiting  spending on the aged ,  the government will have more funds available to get the country out of an economic downturn .
More public funds could be allocated to education , and upgrading the skills for workers and building projects .
In the economic downturn , the government could use  their reserve funds instead .
This could be a morale booster for the people because the spending on the aged  is not reduced despite the economic downturn .
To conclude , the effects of limiting public spending on the aged should never be underestimated .
The government should weigh the social and economic cost of reducing public spending before making a decision . 
Limiting public spending on the aged is important because it indirectly controls the funds which would be channeled into other areas of a country's development .
This accounts for the difficulty in deciding the amount of funds to be diverted to helping the ageing population as many believe that money directed to boosting a country's economic growth is more practical than spending it on an ageing population which offers no economic returns .
Hence , a country should decide on the amount they want to commit on the ageing population as different amount would lead to different results .
For a country which places a low limit on  public spending for the aged , the amount of investment being channeled into other areas of the country's development would be lower than another with a higher limit on  public spending for the aged .
For example , Britain spends more on its ageing population as compared to America and its level of investment in research and development is lower than that of America .
However , this is not to say that  public spending on the aged is the sole factor for the cause of lower investments in other areas of a country's development , though it is only one of the many factors .
Nevertheless , it still affects the level of funds from being diverted to a country's development .
A low limitation limits the funds being diverted to other areas of the country's development such as education and economic developments .
This may result in a slowdown in the progress of a country because the progress of a country is dependent on its ability to keep up with the competitive global economy .
With less funds being pumped into areas such as technology and infrastructures , investments may flow out when other nations offer better incentives .
This would then lead to an overall fall in the revenue of a country which will translate into a drop in the public spending on the aged (Weil:1997) .
Thus ,  negative results are  achieved , with neither the aging population nor the country's economy benefitting from it .
However , it may be argued that countries such as Britain are still progressing well in the global economy despite a high level of spending on the aged population  .
This shows  that a low limitation on public spending does not equate  a halt in the progress of a country .
In addition , the low level of limitation would mean that quality healthcare is being catered for the elderly as sufficient money are being invested in them .
This may lead to a healthier ageing population which may then contain the spread of elderly illnesses (Dunnell:1995) .
This containment could possibly lead to a fall in money being diverted to the aged population as they are healthier now; and thus increasing the funds being diverted to other areas of the country's development .
On the other hand , a country with a high limitation of public funds allocated to the aged means that more funds are being diverted to other areas on their country's development .
For instance , Singapore spend approximately 9 million on her ageing population , encouraging elderly independence instead .
Thus , she has a greater amount of money to be diverted to other areas .
Again , this is not to imply that the spending on the aged population is the sole factor leading to investments in other areas of Singapore .
With  lesser funds being channeled to the aged population , more of it may then be used in areas that can spur the development for a country .
This may allow improvements in fields such as infrastructures , research and development , education and technology .
Hence , it may attract more investments and that can generate more revenue of a country  , which in turn may increase the spending on the aged population (Weil:1997) .
Hence , a win-win situation is achieved .
However , the increase in investments may not necessary lead to a rise in the revenue of a country because an outflow of capital may occur as those investments are foreign based .
Also , one cannot be sure that the increase in revenue would be diverted to the ageing population as a country may continuously tap on the increase in revenue to spur more economic growth .
Lastly , by having a high limitation , it may mean that proper healthcare and medical technology are not provided for the ageing population and this may lead to a poorer health standard among the aged .
This would then translate into a more serious problem as the country would then need to pump in even more money to increase the health standard of the elderly in the future (Weil:1997) .
Hence it can be seen that different levels of limitations on public spending produce different results , which can be both good and bad as shown above .
These results may not be the same for all countries because each country has its own unique way of implementing different policies to deal with its ageing population .
But there is no doubt that public spending on the aged should be limited because it affects the level of funds being diverted to areas that aid the development of a country .
However , more importantly , it is the levels of limitation that a country has to take note of .
Different countries will have  different level of limitation because of the differences they have within their societies .
In conclusion , each country should understand its society well and implement a limit which will best benefit its ageing population and economy .
Fast-aging population remains a precarious global challenge in today's world .
This unprecedented demographical shift with the number of dependent adults surpassing the number of dependent children envisages serious negative impacts , from declining of work forces and real GDP to sharp increasing of elderly fiscal cost , that will impoverish and subsequently impede developmental growth .
Among all , the astronomical healthcare-cost issues generate most controversial arguments as more chronic degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or arthritis are perceived as an inevitable component which tend to manifest in the later life .
Nonetheless , current research and development as well as policy have preeminently help to alleviate the dire consequences of the aging process  .
Alzheimer's or Alzheimer Disease is the most common form of dementia mostly diagnosed in people aged 65 and above .
It is well-known as a terminal disease leading to cognitive impairment , memory loss , apraxia , aggression , muscle mass and motor skills deterioration and ultimately death results in complication by external factors .
According to Bonin-Guillaume , Zekry , Giacobini , Gold and Michel (2005) as well as Meek , McKeithan and Schumock (1998) , dementia specifically Alzheimer's is one of the most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States , placing great psychological , physical and economic burden on caregivers and governments .
It is speculated (Alzheimer's Disease International , 2006) that the figure of dementia patients in Asia Pacific will quadruple to 65 million by 2050 .
This could be a calamitous tribulation to the nation .
However , scientists are now offering glimmers of hope by making headway on research to diagnose , treat , prevent and optimistically to cure this devastating disease .
For example , last year , Prana Biotechnology in Melbourne (Reader's Digest , Sept 2009) developed PBT2 that targets and reduces beta amyloid , a sticky protein hypothesized to be the cause of Alzheimer's which form plaques that kills brain cells .
Memory and learning behaviours are reported to improve drastically sometimes within hours being given the drug .
Other drugs such as Rember , are announced to delay progression of the disease up to 81 percent while Dimebon promised to power and halt the perishing of brain cells (Reader's Digest , Sept 2009) .
Researchers also hope to develop early detection methods which  help by prescribing preventive medication before the actual occurrence of the disease .
Moreover , advanced molecular understanding of scientists towards life-span reveals that contrary to common belief , aging is actually regulated by specific cellular pathways instead of being an uncontrolled gradual breakdown process .
This implies that aging perhaps can be influenced with the manipulation of certain cells .
The breakthrough took place with the discovery of Sirtuins , a group of anti-aging genes (Dipp , Guarente , Westphal , 2007)  (Kennedy and Valter , 2006) .
The theory by a group of researchers from Harvard Medical School (as cited in Reader Digest , Sept 2009) suggests that "with more Sirtuins , DNA repair would be more efficient"  , enabling the subject (mouse) to maintain a youthful or healthy gene pattern into old age , eliminating traits of aging and subsequently increasing lifespan by 24 to 46 percent .
In short , based on the findings ,aging may one day be reversible .
Critics have argued that though these researches are seemingly impressive and hopeful , there is simply no concrete empirical evidence on their practical significance or effectiveness .
Furthermore , these findings fail to address the exigent issues of aging societies presently facing .
Yet , one should be constantly aware and confident of the actualization of technology's development for a promising future on account of the past .
Also , policies are implemented in attempts to dissolve current concerns .
Countries like Singapore who have long promulgatpromulgated self-reliance do adopt certain policy framework such as  the 3M's--- Medisave , Medishield and Medifund simultaneously with Eldershield , to protect and support citizens on  Healthcare cost .
Government subsidies on a wide range of intermediate and long-term care services such as community hospitals and dementia care centers are available for patients  , especially elderly who require continuing care after hospitalization .
between the Oxford Institute of Ageing and the Singapore Council for Third Age (C3A) are launched to educate  , as well as promote active aging among Singaporeans (The Oxford Institute of Ageing and Ow , G , 2009) .
In conclusion  , society should now move toward a new paradigm : aging is not a burden  on the economy or the development of a country .
Although fertility rates have fallen , longevity has increased .
Advancement in technology has certainly  transformed the definition and experience of aging .
An aging population has been an issue in recent years as the increment in the social needs of the elderly and  public spending  , as well as the burden on the younger generations have governments probing  into the issue .
Despite these significant consequences related to an aging population , "they (Governments) must realize that any further expansion of retirement benefits would only impoverish future generations and limit future public spending" (Peterson , 2001) .
As concerns have been raised on the effectiveness of excessive money injected into financing social welfare policies to arrest short term issues , the improper use of public spending will likely to create much burden for the next generation .
These measures almost certainly do not benefit the nation in the long run .
Therefore , public spending should be spent on other sectors of the economy  .
There is little doubt that social welfare policies can alleviate the difficult situations that  aging populations are facing today .
Direct monetary policies can provide a significant income support for them .
For example , the public assistance program can provide the elderly with a sense of security for food , shelter and daily necessities .
Some of the elderly have no dependents and they live by themselves , while others are looking at hefty medical bills and healthcare costs as their health deteriorates .
As the aging population grows ,  spending should increase proportionately  to ensure that the elderly are taken care of .
This can prove beneficial to the elderly as significant changes in living standards are achieved .
At the same time , the economy benefits from it since there will be fewer costly social issues . 
Excessive public spending only adds to the comfort of the aging population and does not effectively benefit the economy .
As the elderly will not be encouraged to work ,  they will take for granted that the government is providing everything for them .
For instance , if a physically fit old man is given monetary assistance beyond the minimum amount , he will not be compelled to work  , especially if the benefit  made up a large part of his salary .
Another example in Singapore can be the availability of funds allocated to town councils for social welfare services  .
The government has not effectively utilized tax payers' money to the best of its ability .
As resources are being poured into  different sectors in the economy , growth will increase along with public spending .
This is ensured by the motivation for personal gains in the economy as each seeks to benefit the most out of the stimulus that governments would inject into the economies .
For instance , as more money is being pumped into the infrastructural development within a country , the industries benefit  , with lesser taken to set up plants , tax benefits and cheaper rental .
All these will drive the costs of doing business down .
As these costs decline , businesses become more profitable when they effectively try to make use of the incentive from the government and this may translate to better salaries  .
The elderly can then benefit from larger social budget allocation as the economy grows .
At the end of the day , public spending should always be limited to finance the basic needs of the aging population .
Governments should weigh the costs and benefits associated with each dollar being spent on social policies and the economy .
They must then determine where the necessary point is to effectively solve the issues an aging population is facing and then channel the remaining resources into the other sectors of the economy .
With proper policies  , "public budgetary resources would be used only to secure minimum standards and basic social services"  (Tanzi .
V . and Schuknecht , 2000)Till then , only  can the economies as well as the aging population benefit  from the effective use of tax payers' money .
Public spending on the aged should be limited as money should be spent on other areas such as defense and public infrastructure as they play  more important roles in a country's future development .
Currently , most developed nations such as Japan , Singapore and Australia are facing problems on their societies turning grey as the numbers working to support the old are dwindling .
This causes social security problems which question the ability of the young to support a larger number of people .
An aging society means a smaller working force which would result in lesser tax payers This might cause in a decline in government fund .
It is not feasible for a country to spend more on the elderly when funds have a possibility of being decreased in future years .
Money for the aged can be saved as people should take care of their own parents when they become old .
In the Singapore's context , each child has to take a compulsory module of moral education in their early years of schooling .
It teaches the importance of family coherence and the virtue of filial piety .
With these values in placed , responsibility in taking care of the elderly should not be pushed to the government but should be shouldered by the people themselves .
A step further was taken to reinforce this idea .
The maintenance of parents act  protects the future of the elderly , allowing the elderly to sue for monetary needs if their children refused to provide . 
Funds should be used more on developing talents instead .
The problem that the aging population is facing right now is the lack of human resources .
We should now invest in creating and attracting talents , both local and foreign  , to reduce the impact of the dwindling working force .
Taking Japan for example , by year 2050 , one in three Japanese will be past their retirement age as the average birth rate is reported at 1 .23 babies per woman .
One of the solutions is to do a "replacement migration" where  foreign talents are recruited to strengthen the  human resource in certain countries .
A country can secure these talents by setting aside funds for education , giving bursaries and scholarships to attract foreign students whom will in turn stay and work .
Other than talents , providing the people with a high level of security is essential .
There are currently growing fears of terrorism after the September 11 attacks  .
Funds should be cast aside for security purposes , such as military technology to protect the people from external threats .
Only by living in a safe country then can one enjoy the benefits of living to a ripe old age .
Moreover , a dwindling population signifies that there are lesser people to defend the country .
Therefore , technology is highly needed to replace the loss of manpower .
However , not all elderly are well supported by their children .
During the wallstreet meltdown in 2008 , many have lost their jobs .
With huge families facing financial crises , the government will have to stand in to provide for the elderly in need .
Not only that ,  elderly who are being abandoned or are childless are disadvantaged as there is no one to support them  in the future .
Therefore , the retirement age should be extended and people should be educated to work longer and save more for their future livelihood .
The elderlylderly should be more independent instead .
Some portion of the funds can be saved if people start to become responsible  .
In an aging societywith lesser tax payers , government funds will eventually drop and this will provide a huge cut in possible public expenditures needed to sustain a country .
With the portion of money saved , it can be used in other areas of developments , which will bring about a better living environment for the people .
Therefore , funds should be limited in the area of spending on the aged .
This year , our government intends to spend $42 .1 million on community- based and residential programmes for the elderly and the disabled (Singapore Budget , 2009) .
Let us just think about the money that is going to be spent on the elderly .
Now , the problem some may question is whether such expenditure is too much .
Why not use the money in other areas so that these areas can improve ?
However , we need to realize that the older population  refers to people who are not only oldbut are also facing certain difficulties in supporting themselves and they may  help to do better .
Thus , I do not think that we should limit the amount of money to be spent on the elderly .
As mentioned earlier , one reason why we should not limit the spending is that it may not be fair to the elderly when  there may be those who are really in great need of  support from the government .
We do know that the older population has a higher chance of facing illnesses and inconveniences in their physical movements .
Furthermore , based on the Census 2000 data , in Singapore , we have 14 percent of the elderly who only live with their spouses and 12 percent of the elderly do not live with their immediate family (citation , 2000) .
These elderly are facing problems in their lives .
In this case , they may not have the financial ability to take care of themselves without any help from the government .
Hence , it is the government's duty to  render the help to them instead of limiting the help they can receive .
Another reason why we should not limit  public spending on the older population is because of the fact that the phenomenon of ageing population is expected to continue growing .
By limiting it , the amount may not be able to cater to all the needs in the future as the limit is set on the basis of a population at a particular time .
Yet over the years , when this group of people increases , especially at rather high rate , the amount needed will be more than the amount being put aside  . 
However , there is always an opposite side to the issue .
If we did not limit the amount we are spending on the elderly now , this amount would increase proportionately with the increasing number of the elderly in the future .
This will cause the proportion  left for developments in other areas to be reduced in the future as well .
In an article in the Reuters , it is indeed believed that as the United States faces growing number of  older people , pension and healthcare services are pushed up and thus , compelling major increases in public expenditure (Maggie , 2009) .
However , I see the argument in another way .
The amount of money that the government can use for developments in other areas may not increase even after limiting the spending on elderly .
This is because in actual fact , the burden is shared by the families of the elderly as well as the government .
The government does not pay the full cost .
If we limit the amount the government pays , the additional cost falls on the shoulders of the family members which will then be shifted back to the government by the family in other means (Robert and Laura , 2005) .
Since no difference is expected , be it limiting the amount or not doing so , we should try to reduce the pressure that will be felt by the majorities in the future , such as having to pay for the high expenses for the elderly at home .
After looking at both sides , we can see that the older population is not a small group of people and the number will continue to increase in number in the future .
Thus , to cater to the needs of the older population , which may also be the largest group of people within the country in the future , it is best not to limit the amount .
Instead , keeping it flexible , such as to have it increased in times of great need will be a better choice .
Our society is aging .
The Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (2002) highlighted: "since year 1950 , the average life expectancy has increased by 20 years and is expected to extend a further 10 years by 2050" .
This increase in life expectancy has been said to be the result of better public health care and advances in medical care .
Governments , realizing that there will be profound consequences followed by this global demographic transformation , have now come out with different strategies and policies to ease the aging process .
Nevertheless , the effectiveness of current research and policies in helping to ease the aging process are doubted by the public .
In fact , it calls into the question whether the elderly really benefit from the policy implemented in the aspect of financial security , employment and living arrangements  .
In terms of economics , old age financial support is the government's main concern and therefore mechanisms that provide citizens with financial security in old age have been introduced .
For instance , the Central Provident Fund (CPF) , a comprehensive financial savings plan for the workers , has been implemented in Singapore .
Although the CPF was aimed to give security to the retired elderly by providing income to support their basic needs in old age ,  it has been accused for its deficiency .
Shantakumar (1999) , Asher (1996 and 1998) , Lee (1999 an 2001a) ,  pointed out the lack of universal coverage and the lack of adequacy of funds for retirement security in the CPF scheme , especially for the low-income elderly (as cited in David R . Phillips and Alfred C .M .
Chan , 2002) .
Along with the criticism , recent National Survey of Senior Citizens 2005 (Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , 2005) showed that only 41 .3 per cent of the elderly aged 55 and above had CPF savings and , of these , 61 .6 per cent felt that their CPF savings were inadequate .
Meanwhile , in a study by Asia Times Online (Megawati Wijaya , 2009) , it was shown that   less than 5% of the current elderly population rely on CPF disbursements for their livelihood .
All  these prove the failure of the CPF scheme in providing a secure future life for most of the elderly .
Apart from that , the government's initiative in raising  retirement age is also seen to be not effective .
In Singapore , the retirement age for its citizens will be raised from 62 to 65 by 2012 and eventually to 67 along with the higher life expectancy of its ageing population (Reuters - The Inquirer , 2007) .
It is undeniable that by increasing the retirement age , the elderly will be able to accumulate wealth and eventually the strain on their finances  will be ease .
However , people should take note that the problem now is not about the mandatory retirement age of the elderly , but  the employability problem faced by the senior citizens .
Most of the elderly claimed that they could not find a job even though they have the willingness to extend their retirement age .
The National Survey of Senior Citizens 2005(Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , 2005) showed that among the current generation of the elderly , only 28 .2% of them are employed .
This data shows the seriousness of the employability problem among the senior citizens .
Therefore , unless the employability problem is resolved , the increase in the retirement age might worthnothing to most of the elderly that are now  unemployed .
Besides that , the a ttractive financial incentives for  co-residence with  parents which are introduced by the Singapore government have faced certain criticisms .
Inevitably , after the financial incentives such as tax reliefs and priority housing have been introduced , there are more adult children who live with , or nearby , their elderly parents .
However , the anncrease in  co-residences with  parents does not imply increase in the willingness of the children in taking care of their parents .
No one can guarantee that children who live nearby their parents will eventually take good care of them .
There are children who live nearby their parents just because of the attractive incentives .
As suggested in  Channel NewsAsia (Asha Popatlal , 2009) , there are more elderly citizens applying to the Tribunal for Maintenance of Parents over the last 12 months .
"From August 2008 to July this year , 172 people filed applications , much higher than the average of 100 in previous years" .
(citation) This figure shows that  the rate of co-residence increaseswith the cases of parental abuse .
Therefore , it is possible for people to remain dubious about the effectiveness of promoting co-residence in improving the quality of care of the elderly by the adult children .
In conclusion , to a large extent , current policies implemented have not helped much to ease the aging process .
It is mainly due to the deficiency in the policies themselves .
For the CPF scheme , there is lack of adequate funds to ensure retirement security .
For the later retirement act , there is employability problems among the elderly that need to be resolved .
For the co-residence  , there is doubt on the quality of care that the older parents received from their children .
Therefore , current policies should be re-evaluated in their feasibility and should be amended in order to reach the ultimate goalof easing the aging process .
''Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
''I  fully agreed with this statement .
Nowadays , a lot of countries are having aging problem , especially advanced counties like Japan , Sweden , Germany , Singapore and the United State of America .
This global aging is also starting to affect some developing nations such as Malaysia and Thailand .
According to the journals 'A Graying World' and 'Doomsday Predications about Population Aging Are Exaggerated' , the population of aged 65 and older is anticipated to more than double by year 2030 and furthermore median age in many first-world countries will reach between 52 to 54 by 2050 .If the fertility rates do not rise again , the problem will be worsened  .
Demographic changes due to growing aging population will have  serious consequences on health issues .
Governments are forced to spend more money to overcome them .
For instance , Singapore needs to restructure the whole health care system due to the aging population as mentioned by the Singapore Prime Minister .
However , the funds have to be used wisely and diverted to other fields of the country's development .
Firstly , governments have to continue to raise the retirement age in line with rising life expectancies .
The elderly are encouraged to work longer to accumulate more wealth ,  which could be used to support themselves .
Moreover , a tardy  fertility rate has increased the importance of having an workforce in the market .
They could help to boost  economic growth by being involved in different kind of sectors .
For some countries with little economic growth , the society faces few choices on how to care for those who are least able to care for themselves .
On the other hand , with sufficient economic growth there are more choices and fewer persons in need ( Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer ,2005 ) .
Secondly , money can be diverted to the education sector  .
Well educated people tend to have higher incomes and better health generally .
These people are not only helping the government to cut down expenditures on health care , but also helping the country to generate more income ,  as well as to stabilize the economy .
That is why a lot of countries are spending  a large portion in education .
To illustrate , education expenditures always occupy  a larger segment in the fiscal budget in Singapore and Malaysia .
Besides , public policies that encourage and facilitate education , basic research , and the application of promising technologies can enhance the well-being of current and future generations of older people ( Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer ,2005 ) .In other words , elites are able to invent more advanced technology to accelerate nationational development .
All advanced nations are using high technology in every field .
For example , Japan is one of the countries which uses the most advanced technology in manufacturing .
Its car industry almost dominates the world market and has always produced the top-selling cars in most of the countries  .
For instance ,  Honda and Toyota are preferred by a lot of car users .
These companies are not only making cars , but are also involved in technology exploration to benefit people .
The Japanese government  gives subsidies to these companies to create something more innovative in solving  daily life problems .
Consequently , Japanese is one of the most civilized races in the world .
In contrast , North Korea is still a communist country and it is conservative .
Everything is under government control and civilians are not given any chance to involve in monopoly or private business .
All the market judgments are determined by the government itself .
Moreover , most of the funds are spent on nuclear research and relatively there are less spending on  people's needs .
This  causes the majority of North Koreans living in poverty .
In addition , governments could give subsidies or incentives to encourage people to increase fertility rates .
Nowadays , people are more educated and usually having small families .
If governments provide subsidies to encourage couples to have more children , fertility rates might be changed .
For example , the Singapore government gives different types of incentives and benefits to encourageparents to have and raise children .
The increase in fertility rates is very important to every country as it could generate more manpower  , as well as reinforce the country's military strength .
In a nut shell , every country needs to consider wisely about public spending on the aged .
Other fields of the country's development are important too .
Therefore , governments may have to choose the most sustainable and efficient way to plan for their national budgets .
The Survey of Senior Citizens (1995) showed that although the health status among respondents aged 60 and older was generally good , more than 30 per cent have received treatments for some chronic illnesses .
The majority of respondents had little or no formal education .
About 25 per cent males and 69 per cent females  were never married ,  widowed or divorced .
Collectively , these findings suggest that the elderly must rely on others for financial and social support .
Another policy is to ensure that Singaporeans are financially secure after retirement .
The Central Provident Fund (CPF) has been the state institution to provide economic support to older Singaporeans .
Currently , Singapore's CPF has the highest coverage of all retirement plans in Asia (Asher , 2006) .
In 2007 , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the age at which individuals can withdraw their minimum sums will be increased from 62 to 65 .
This move will increase the period of time for individual savings to last during retirement .
CPF LIFE was launched this month to provide Singaporeans a lifelong income into old age .
Members will receive a monthly income depending on the cash savings they have in their Retirement Account for as long as they live (http://mycpf .cpf .gov .sg/Members/Gen-Info/CPF_LIFE/CPF_LIFE .htm , accessed 14 September 2009) .
In addition , for individuals 62 and above , the Housing Development Board will buy back the lease of their apartment and provide a shorter lease of 30 years for the same flat .
There would be two payouts; a lump sum up front and monthly installments for the rest of the individual's life .
All these schemes ensure adults have at least a source of cash income available to them during old age .
However , the main source of financial and emotional support for older persons in Singapore still rests with the family .
Approximately 60 per cent of older adults live in households where other family members pay for all the expenses .
One-fifth of older adults are self sufficient and there is almost no dependence on welfare (Chan , 2001) .
Additionally , co-residence or living in close proximity to children remains the norm in Singapore .
Only 9 .3 per cent of the 60-plus lived alone or in other arrangements , and 5 .8 per cent lived only with their spouses .
The majority received financial or in-kind support from their children , if these were present (Yap , 2008) .
Existing policies would be rendered inadequate without the family being responsible for the care of its older members .
Nevertheless , filial obligation should be stressed .
The Government has introduced schemes to encourage Singaporeans to maintain their parents such as the legislation on filial piety , which is as the Maintenance of Parents Act (Vasoo , Ngiam , 2000) .
Under this scheme , elderly parents who have no other support can claim financial aid from their children .
Taxpayers who maintain their parents or grandparents in Singapore are also given income tax relief .
These social policies should be credited in helping the current generation of older adults cope with the emotional and behavourial challenges of the aging process .
An aging population has been talked about much in recent years .
Goh (2007) stated that countries like Singapore and Japan who face a fast aging population are expected to have a projected median age of 54 and 55 respectively .
Hauner , Leigh , and Skaarup (2007) believed that countries with a high and rising old-age dependency ratio will expect their age-related spending to escalate by 4 percentage point of their GDP (Gross Domestic Product) over the next 45 years .
As a result , governments and policy makers around the world are ready to set aside a larger portion of their countries' budget to cater for age-related spending , with healthcare for the elderly as most of their top priorities .
However , to avoid compromising the development of other sectors , it is essential for policy makers to limit  spending on the elderly by looking into viable alternatives .
Prime Minister Lee (2009) suggested that although it is the government's duty to look after the elderly , children should do their filial duty by taking care of their own parents .
However , some might argue that the burden of their own families and the high cost of living in Singapore make it hard for them to provide for their parents' living expenses .
While this may be true , it is still possible if these working adults can make adjustments to their lifestyles by cutting down on unnecessary expenses like the purchasing of luxury items .
This way , they are able to provide for their parents instead of abandoning them in a home or hospital .
Even though the government can look after the aged , Prime Minister Lee (2009) has pointed out that it is ultimately the warmth and love from the families that they need .
Majority of the elderly are not concerned with how much their children give them ; instead they are satisfied as long as their children are able to spend time with them and show their love and concern for them .
By taking care of their own parents , these working adults can be positive examples for their children .
Under the influence of their parents , these children will be more likely to follow in their footsteps and will voluntarily take care of them when they are old .
Therefore , it is highly encouraged that children should fulfil their filial duty by looking after and caring for their own parents .
Chow (2008) proposed that mandatory medical savings scheme should be implemented in order to tackle the challenges of an aging population and the rising medical costs in Hong Kong .
Critics of this proposal have pointed out that the money set aside for this scheme will go to waste if the elderlypassed  away even before they can utilize them .
However , governments of many countries have urged that such saving scheme that offers health protection can be unpredictable .
By implementing a mandatory medical savings scheme , its contributors will have a ready sum of money to deal with any hefty medical cost which they may incur when they get older .
In this way , it minimizes the chances of them  being unable to afford their medical bills , and at the same time reduces the heavy burden on government subsidies .
The scheme provides not only protection for its contributors .
In addition , a substantial payout from the medical insurance will be awarded if he or she is to encounter any mishap  , of which   death or any form of disability would render the contributor being unable to work .
This ensures that the family is still able to sustain themselves financially in the event that the contributor is unable to provide for the family .
Hence , implementing a mandatory savings scheme is essential to its contributors , their families and the government .
Lee (2008) proposed the plan to limit social welfare spending in South Korea in order to invest in programs that will increase the country's economic growth .
At this point , one might wonder if this move will compromise the welfare of the society and the elderly  .
While this may be a problem , a potential growth in the country's economy will allow for even more funds to be made available for the area of social welfare in the future .
With a limited social welfare fund , people will rely lesser on the government and more on themselves .
Hence , it encourages them to work harder and save more in order to be better prepared for old age .
Furthermore , the limited spending on social welfare releases funds which can be diverted to other key sectors .
For example , these funds can be used in the research and development of  cures for terminal illnesses like cancer .
So , limiting spending on social welfare might just prove to be a feasible strategy which benefits the country in various aspects .
Countries with a fast aging population face an ongoing battle against the ever increasing welfare and health care costs .
It is therefore crucial that the governments and policy makers do not recklessly sink huge portion of their countries' spending on these areas .
Instead , they should be looking at viable solutions that do not compromise the development of the other sectors .
Therefore , a boundary to the spending on the elderly should be set in order to avoid increasing the burden on future generations and upsetting of the development of other key sectors as mentioned earlier .
"Until recently , the ills of old age interested only poets and philosophers .
However , this has changed because governments and policy makers in the developed world are now confronted with the unprecedented problem of a fast aging population"   (Peterson  , 2001) .
The aging population has become a major issue in many developed countries , including the United States , Japan and Singapore .
Increasing population of the aged created many problems on the society .
Clearly , both governments and the public are becoming more aware of this issue .
Governments in various countries have come up with different policies to address the problem of an increasingly aging population .
As the problem of the aging population worsens , governments have to spend increasing amount of money to counter the problem and at  the expense of other areas of the country's development .
It is important that governments take note of this and control their spending so as not to neglect  other more important areas such as  education and the economy .
Governments are stressing on filial obligation and hope to increase the willingness of tomorrow's grown children to support their own elderly parents .
However , such practices are not common .
It is crucial for the government to spend money on the aged  , as not doing so will lead to social problems .
Already , we are seeing a breakdown in extended families .
The young no longer see filial piety as being important .
The elderly who are unable to support themselves and are being abandoned by their children will have nowhere to turn to if the government turned its back on them .
This will lead to increased crime rates , begging and vagrancy in the country , which are harmful for society .
However , this is not the only area where government spending is required .
As countries spend more money  on the aged , other important sectors such as defense and education may get neglected and become under budgeted .
These sectors are as important as , if not more important than , spending on  an aging population .
For example ,  in an increasingly challenging global economy , it becomes increasingly important for countries to focus on education to maintain a skilled workforce .
An educated workforce increases productivity , which drives the economy  to increased wealth .
By increasing public spending on an aging population , governments risk overlooking other areas of the country's development  .
Moreover , healthcare cost has been increasing .
New technologies and treatments for the aged are relatively expensive .
Governments have been spending too much money on the subsidies to help the aging population .
People may take advantage of the the government subsidies to pay for  expensive new technologies which are not necessary .
Governments should specify the types of treatments that it considers essential and subsidise these treatment , while leaving non-essential treatment cost to be borne by the consumer .
Limiting public spending will make sure that government does not overspend on treatment that is not essential  , so that the money can be diverted to other areas .
It is hard to cure the illnesses of the aged .
Governments may be spending too much money over expensive medical infrastructure such as  new facilities to suit the elderly .
Medical facilities can only prolong their lives  , which do not have any significant impact on the country's economy .
Instead , the governments can divert the money into other projects that are more beneficial to the country's development .
In Singapore , one of such projects includes the investment on infrastructure .
Such spending generates revenue and boosts the economy .
For example , a new entertainment centre can attract tourists  , which will increase foreign spendingand benefit the tourism sector .
Governments should be cautious of their spending on expensive medical infrastructure which does not contribute to the country's future developmentand should focus more on the nation's areas of development that do .
It is important and  governments plan their finances well to benefit different sectors of the country .
Public spending is increasing rapidly with the growing aged population that governments are losing control of their spending .
Governments should adopt a wider perspective to ascertain whether the spending is necessary or  the money should be diverted to other areas .
Public spending should be controlled to establish a balanced outcome for both the young and the aged .
If the usage of public funds is not well balanced , it will not only affect the country's development , but also put the country's future into jeopardy .
It is undeniable that aging population is still one of the current issues that are affecting our world nowadays .
It is predicted that the problem will be worse in the future: many of the people in the first world countries will reach the median age of 53 .
Therefore , much should be done to help ease the aging process to avoid social and economical problems in the future .  
Of all the different aspects of development that have been done to ease the aging process , the most significant field is medicine .
The aging population has forced a restructuring of the whole healthcare system .
In Singapore , to provide a better life for the  aged  , many new hospitals are built ,  such as the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun and the Jurong General Hospital .
With these new hospitals , the  aged patients get better treatment  .
They do not have to wait too long and travel too far to a particular hospital to see the doctor .
More  hospitals are built to provide appropriate service to the elderly .
With this , the elderly will be able to enjoy their stays in  hospitals and do their medical check ups regularly to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Although more hospitals were being built  , many  aged patients with financial problems can't afford  to go to them .
Knowing this , the Singapore government provides sufficient financial aid to help the poor elderly .
Subsidies are given to the eligible ones to help them overcome this problem .
On the other hand , there are also researches done on illnesses which most commonly affect the  aged .
Researches on healthcare are being done to help maintain or improve the health of the elderly .
Better solutions are hoped to be found in order to help the elderly with their health issues .
For instance , in the United Kingdom , researches on dementia are being done to find a better solution to cure the patients , who are mostly the  aged .
According to Rebecca Wood , the Chief Executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust , the population living with dementia is forecast to double within a generation .
To help ensure less elderly from suffering from dementia in the future , researches are now being done by the UK .
Much investment have been put into this research to defeat this illness which is currently and will to continue to haunt the  aged .
Some may argue that these researches do not help to ease the aging process because most of the time and money are wasted as the proper solutions are never to be   .
But it is better to try rather than to allow the devastating disease continue to haunt  the older generations .
Besides researches and developments in the field of medicine , social policy also plays a  role in helping to ease the aging process .
Many countries have taken this step to  lighten the burden of the elderly  .
In Japan , the government has imposed the "National Pension Scheme" on all its citizens  .
In this scheme , a basic  pension is provided for all citizens who are above 65 years of age and have contributed for 25 years or more to the country .
This scheme is helpful in easing the burden of the elderly as it provides financial security for them .
The  aged can then be independent and they do not need to rely on their children for money .
The  aged can live a comfortable life without worrying or without seeking for financial aid  .
On the other hand , with these schemes , children need not do their duty to take care of their parents .
This may result in social problems in a country .
The younger generation will not be filial to their parents and will not bear the burden to take care of the older generation and will  push the burden onto the government .
Although such thoughts may arise ,  there are no better ways to guarantee a better life for the  aged .
Clearly , all these researches , developments and policies have helped the aging population to get a better life .
This effort should be continued  as this would guarantee the living standard of the  aged .
Thus , with the living standard of the elderly guaranteed , the social problems can also be avoided in a country .
In conclusion , the issue on the "graying world" can be solved and well taken care of if necessary steps are taken to prevent it .
Caring for the aged is definitely an act to be applauded for and encouraged .
Some might have the perception that caring for the aged is the theiresponsibility of the country .
Nothing could be further from the truth; to care for the aged is to be taken upon by respective dependants , such as their children .
In fact , the ideal situation would be that they should actually take the initiative to be responsible for their own welfare .
If the country were to spend its budget entirely caring for the aged , then many citizens would shove responsibilities and  would  not care for their own health , since the healthy , as represented by the country , would care for them .
While it is important to care for the aged , it is just as important to take into consideration and not neglect other areas of the country's development .
Thus public spending on the aged should be limited .
Since birth , parents would give the best to their children  , from clothing to education and this should be reciprocated .
Being able-bodied and in good health , children should not forget their parents' kindness towards them .
They should assume this responsibility by providing for their parents .
On the other hand , a substantial amount could be saved if not spent in caring for the aged , thereby enabling more funds to be diverted for the country's development in many other areas .
To rely on ourselves would still be the best option  .
For a start , prior planning is crucial  , when from young , one should  be  actively saving .
This would be  beneficial in the short run , when facing emergencies , or in the long run , when facing retirement .
Policies that encourage skills upgrading have also been introduced to enable the aged to re-enter the workforce .
This is further enhanced by incentives being offered to companies that hire them .
Instead of grieving with regrets of having to work after reaching the retirement age , they could actually be optimistic and take this as an opportunity to be active in the society  , where they could  establish friendships through interactions at work .
Not only could they be able to sustain living through earnings obtained from working , the aged could also keep a healthy mind and body .
Although it would be ideal if the government need not  be 'burdened' with expenses to care for the aged , it is not feasible .
There are those who are without any dependants and savings to see them through their retirement years .
In addition , it could also be dreadful for those who are not well equipped with education or skills to work and who really needs the country's help .
Even so , the country should not be obliged to care for them entirely .
Help given could be in many other forms instead of just monetary  .
With policies such as those that encourage the aged to acquire new skills , the government could also provide aid by compensating the loss in
income during that period of 'learning' .
Although help is given , it is not encouraged for the aged to continuously be reliant on it .
Instead , with the skills acquired , they should 'venture' out and earn a living of their own which would in turn reap many returns in both monetary  and health .
It is also true that  "work can help us stay physically active , mentally alert , socially connected and financially self-reliant" (Yap , 2009 , p . 7) .
To rely on the country's help is definitely not a solution in caring for the aged .
In fact , every single one of us has a responsibility and role to play  in caring for them and the country .
When the country's resources are not focused mainly in caring for the aged , it could be diverted to other areas of the country's development , such as the economic and social developments .
Limiting  public spending in caring for the aged and diverting it to other areas of the country's development would reap success in the long run  .
Many  many would be able to enjoy economic and social benefits then .
A country always has to be ready to with any form of challenges .
One such challenge  would be the ageing population .
To find a solution to that problem , certain amount of the public spending has to be diverted to it .
However an ageing population is not the only concern of any government .
Therefore public spending on the aged should be limited to allow diversion of the funds to other areas of the country's development .
One of the reasons why public spending on the aged should be limited is due to the emergence of other better alternatives .
According to Robert B .Friedland and Laura Summer (2001) the working population would be able to share a large proportion of the responsibility , with the government taking care of the aged primarily .
One of such initiatives would be the baby bonus package which has been introduced in several countries .
In the case of Singapore , the government has increased the cash gift for the first two children from $300 to $400 .
This is one of the long term efforts that the government has decided to invest in so that their public spending on the aged would be reduced in years to come  , as the future working population starts to emerge .
Another temporary measure would be to increase the working population by encouraging immigration into the country .
Canada has experienced the highest per capita immigration rate in the world and expects an increase of 23 .1% of population growth over a period of 25 years (Wikipedia , 2009) .
An increase in the working population will then allow more resources to be channelled  to other areas which demand such funds .
This proves to be a better solution because it allows the government to limit the public spending and  fellow citizens to take responsibility .
It is necessary that the country allocates sufficient funds required for its growth and to maintain its competitive edge  .
Therefore it is  necessary for the country to limit its public spending on the aged .
Singapore has decided to increase its public spending in the area of research and development (R&D) to $7 .5 billion (Singapore Budget highlights , 2009) .
Singapore sees an aging population as a potential risk and it  channels sufficient funds to the aged  .
Nonetheless ,  at the same time , it focuses on other areas of development as well .
Through its R & D , Singapore aims to reach greater heights in the research fields  .
This  would then yield substantial profits to the nation , without which the growth of the nation would be stagnant .
Therefore , public spending on aged should be limited and channelled to other areas of development .
A government should cater to  various groups of the population without any form of discrimination  .
4 .68% of  America's Federal spending constitutes  the  assistance category in which 4 out of 5 top assistant recipients come from the health sector (USA spending , 2009) .
The healthealth sector would be one of the areas where help is needed for the aged due to the rising medical expenditureand it is not  fair to burden them with the entire cost .
Nonetheless they should also take into consideration the cons of not limiting  public spending on the aged .
If that happens and the nation decides to be a welfare state  , then it will fail like  Britain  .
It would no longer be able to  have constant economic growths and that would  be detrimental  for the country .
As such  public spending should be limited .
This ageing population problem can be dealt with  by increasing the working population  , so that it could share the burden  of caring for the aged .
Public spending should also be limited because areas like R&D need more  funds to ensure constant progress of the nation .
Without a on spending the country would then experience a decline in economic growth .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
It is an ironic truth that Singapore is facing a demographic challenge as the population aged 65 and older is anticipated to more than double by the year 2030 .There is much concern about the current development and policies  , of which older people tend to be the principle beneficiaries .
Many policies such as  the Maintenance of Parent Act , Baby Bonus Scheme and later retirement agreement have helped to ease the aging process significantly .
Currently , much of the public discussions about an aging society involve the responsibility of  children to look after their aged parents  .
As we know ,  Asians pay great attention to filial piety and it is their traditional practice to live together with their parents even after the children are married .
However , life today is different from that of the past .
Some Singaporeans do not practise this tradition and they  abandon their parents in the old folks' home or hospitals .
Some of them even disappeared or changed their contact numbers after they have sent their parents to the homes .
This new social phenomenon could be curbed by implementing the Maintenance of Parents Act .
This act came into force in 1995 to give parents above 60 years old who could not support themselves the legal means to claim maintenance from their children .
Some feel the state has gone too far by intruding into the delicate relationship between children and their parents .
However , this enforcement of law ensure the seniors of a more secured life .
According to  statistics , over 400 parents have sought the aid of the Tribunal of the Maintenance Act since it was set up 3 years ago .
Therefore , we could conclude that this act is efficient in dealing with the aging population .
The problem of a growing aging population in Singapore could be curbed by encouraging late retirement , longer working lives , and lower barriers to elder employment  , as suggested by Peterson (year) .
Some might argue that the seniors are old and fragile to be productive  .
However ,  reality remains that later retirement will ensure the senior citizens  a high quality of life in their twilight years .
This is because they could earn money on their own and need not rely on their children for living expenses .
With financial independence , the seniors would not become a burden to their families .
Instead , they can age with respect and dignity  .
Not only that  , longer working lives enable the elders to remain physically , mentally and socially active for a long time .
Being occupied with work , the aged could actually use their brains more frequently and this reduces the chances of developing senile dementia and Parkinson 's diseases   .
As the saying goes , 'no man is an island'and social activities are essential for the aged to stay healthy .
The seniors could build up their social circles at their work places and this reduces their dependency on their family members .
Moreover , many have expressed their desire to work longer as they want to feel valued and being able to contribute to the society .
In a nutshell ,later retirement and prolonged  working lives are effective solutions to ease the problems of an aging population .
Last but not least , an aging population brings about a shrinking workforce  and  a significant decline in real GDP .
The critical challenge of the government is to ensure the productivity of future workers .
The main root of this problem is because of low birth rate .
Modern parents prefer to have fewer children  , as compared to the past generation .
They claimed that the living cost now is very high and they could not ensure a quality life style with more children .
Therefore , the government introduces the Baby Bonus Scheme which lightens the financial cost of raising children .
The parents will get a cash gift of up to $4 ,000 each for their first and second child and $6 ,000 each for their third and forth child .
Furthermore , all the children born on or after 17 August 2008 will also enjoy government contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar matching  .
As a result , the birth rate increases from 2 .1% (2006) to 2 .55% (2008)  .
In a long run , it is believed that the Baby Bonus Scheme would increase the population  .
Issues relating to aging are complex but not insurmountable  .
In a nutshell , it may be said without any fear of contradiction that the current policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
With the implementation of the Maintenance of Parents Act in Singapore , it is arguable that the younger generations are not only morally responsible for , but also compelled to taking care of their aged parents  .
However , the low fertility rate in Singapore challenges this argument because the financial burden resulting from the provision of aged parents is currently increasing on  fewer offspring .
It is definitely taxing for an only child to bear the financial cost of his orher parents .
Moreover , the rising cost of  healthcare  adds  further strains to the limited income of the younger generation , which often lead to  children being unable to fend for their parents and thus abandoning  them .
This is  shown in year 2008 , in which approximately 172 senior citizens  filed applications to the tribunal against their children (Wijaya , 2009 , ) .)
Hence , this shows that even with current government assistance such as healthcare subsidies and tax reliefs , , the low fertility rate in Singapore continues to urge the government toc speng on the aged in order to meet the needs ofane ageing society .
Singapore is a well-established country  with advanced healthcare facilities .
Many perceive the current public spending  on the development of healthcare facilities as being sufficient to meet the ageing demands .
However , this is often not the case .
Singapore faces a sharp shortage of medical specialists in the areas of geriatric field and palliative care and to the extent of importing foreign nurses into the medical industry .
This implies that the government has to invest more on training local medical specialists in these fields to meet the growing ageing needsand thus , more expenditure is required .
Furthermore , hospitals are constantly facing  shortages of beds and long average waiting time; the major factor of this problem is the geriatric patients .
The geriatric patients are often the ones who occupy the majority of  hospital bed space and they suffered from chronic illnesses that require regular follow-up consultations .
Therefore , in the recent 2009 National Day Rally speech , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the need for step-down care such as  more community hospitals , day-care centres as well as nursing homes .
In this way , more competent healthcare is provided satisfy the  demands , since geriatric patients can receive treatment in acute hospitals and then recuperate in the community hospitals .
Therefore , the development of healthcare facilities to meet growing ageing demands would inevitably raise public expenditure on the aged .
In addition , some will disagree that it is not feasible to expand public spending on the aged because it would neglect the development of other areas such as the Research & Development sector and the Banking & Finance sector , resulting in the loss of competitiveness and investors' confidence on Singapore's economy .
However , most people fail to realize that limiting public spending on an ageing society's welfare system actually weakens the country's economy .
A neglected welfare system for the aging  causes social instability to the country .
For instance ,  citizens would feel cash-strapped with the rising healthcare costs and there would be myriad cases reporting about elderly poverty or abandonment .
Thus , foreign investments will decline drastically even with an advanced Research & Development sector or Banking & Finance sector because the social instability of Singapore loses foreign investors' confidence , and Singapore will incur severe loss in terms of economic competitiveness .
Therefore , it is feasible to expand public spending on the aged .
All in all , it has become a fact that Singapore is currently facing a rapidly ageing population   .
Many problems will arise should public spending on the aged be limited and this include  increased financial burden on the fewer offsprings , insufficient funds for rising healthcare development costs and weakened economic competiveness . 
On November 13 , 2006 , the Prime Minister of Singapore ,  Lee , said in a speech: "Singapore has treated social welfare as a dirty word .
The opposition and the Worker's Party have called for a permanent unconditional needs-based welfare system .
I think that is an even dirtier five words ."
In Hong Kong , welfare is seen as an individual's responsibility and the government will only step in to help those who are proven incapable of helping themselves (South China Morning , January 13 , 2007) .
The four economies in East Asia--- Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan , and South Korea have taken the approach to being a 'light welfare state' , in which they have achieved high standard of living without burdening the state with heavy social expenditures (Midgley , 1986) .
In contrast , the western welfare states that fund heavily on social expenditure have hindered the functioning of the private market .
Public spending on the aged should be limited to avoid heavy social expenditures and money can therefore be diverted to other areas for the country's development .
The old age dependency ratio is estimated to increase with longevity and the decline of fertility .
With no limits set on the expenditure of welfare for the aged , a country  will face enormous financial burdens in the funding of the public pension system , expensive healthcare system and long-term dependency expenditures .
The higher the expenditure of a country's welfare , the higher the tax rate will be to finance it .
It may undermine investors' incentive to invest .
Currently Japan is facing financial difficulties in gathering funds for their National Pension and Employee's pension insurance .
The Japanese government is now emphasizing on achieving economic growth rather than increasing welfare expenditures to support its growing aging society .
The Hong Kong government reluctantly implemented deficit financing from 1998 to 2004 to meet the growing expenditures of caring for the aged .
It is estimated that if the deficit budget continued , Hong Kong's $369 billion fiscal reserves would be wiped out by 2008-2009 (South China Morning Post , February 23 , 2002) .
Instead of limitless spending on the aged , funds should be diverted to develop economic growth , and in turn use the revenues gained to finance aging welfare .
There is a contradiction of a capitalistic society being a welfare state .
Limitless welfare for the elderly would impede the functioning of the private market .
When people are provided with social services that allow them to maintain a living , they are less inclined to work (Esping-Andersen , 1990) .
This means that people will not see the need to save for retirement funds or work to be financially secure , as they know they can depend on the government .
The abuse of a welfare system can be examined in the case of British National Health Service (NHS) .
Hon .Lianne Daziel , New Zealand's minister for senior citizens comments that "New Zealanders who are now sixty-five plus are more highly educated and healthier than their predecessors .
Their capacity for productive work of all kinds , not necessarily for pay , is a national treasure ."
Encouraging senior citizens to work will help them to contribute to  society , and at the same time , ensure that they are financially independent .
It is a win-win solution .
Some may argue that limiting public spending on the aged while funding other aspects of development will neglect the aging population's needs .
However caring for the elderly , especially those who cannot provide for themselves , is being prioritized as a national issue .
Besides having support from the government , the 'light welfare states' rely heavily on the private sector and family to provide care for the aged .
The government encourages financial independence by implementing pension schemes , adjusting retirement policy and providing employment opportunities .
There are also other public assistance programs for medical , housing , transportation , and even funeral preparations .
In addition , there are  public and private sector mix of welfare programs and organizations .
In Singapore , there are "over 300 existing voluntary welfare organizations and service providers" and recently , the Centre for Enabled Living (CEL) , with some help from the government , was launched to provide a first-stop referral service to the existing welfare organisations .
Family support and close kinship , which exists strongly in an Asian society , has also helped in decreasing the state's welfare dependency .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited  to curb heavy financial expenditures , and t 'welfare diseases' that would undermine any incentive to work .
It will not be a feasible plan to drain  money from national reserves to fill up a bottomless pit .
Money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development to earn revenues in order to support the aging population .
The responsibilities of caring for the aged are divided  between the private and family sector to lessen the burden on the state .
Help is readily available to those who are incapable of providing for themselves .
"Aging of population" is a  term used to describe  the shift in the age distribution of a population toward older ages(Leonid A . Gavrilov and Patrick Heuevline , year) .
Thus this refers to an increase in the population's mean age which is generally due to a decline in birth rate and an increase in life expectancy  .
Problems associated with an aging population will be the increase in social and healthcare cost and lower level of productivity .
As one ages , one's body tends to be more vulnerable to health problemsand this will add on to the medical cost which requires funding from the government  .
This would put greater stress on the younger generation in terms of  increasing taxes .
Moreover , we will also expect a shortage of labor which would affect the level of efficiency of the country .
Hence , ongoing medical research  and government's policies can help to alleviate these problems .
Firstly , medical advancements help to lighten the burden of healthcare cost .
The mass production of medicine lowers the cost of the drugs .
Moreover ,  polyclinics provide highly subsidized medical care which benefits the elderly greatly .
There is also an increase in research on healthier food and supplements that helps to inform and advise the public to adopt a healthier lifestyle .
However , these benefits may only favor a small group of the elderly , probably the more educated and richer ones as they are the ones who can comprehend the latest information regarding  healthcare research  , as well as  afford  health-checks and supplements .
Long waiting queues in polyclinics due to highly subsidized medical fees may deter  those elderly with real needs .
In addition , the location may not be accessible to some elderly  ,  , especially for those who are physically disabled .
From another point of view , government intervention may help to solve the problem .
In the case of Singapore , the increasing number of polyclinics that are set up throughout the island  resolved the long queues and inaccessibility problem .
Besides this , polyclinics are upgraded to offer a clean and fresh environment  .
For example , air-conditioning are installed and Nurse Clinician Service is implemented where patients with chronic conditions can make appointments in advance to reduce their waiting timeand this  further ensures the comfort level of the patients(Polyclinics Singhealth , 2009) .
Health screening at affordable prices organized by the government helps to identify potential health risks  .
In addition , free health talks  help to educate the elderly especially the uneducated ones and advise them to lead a healthy lifestyle .
Hence , these measures  enable the elderly to have a better understanding of their bodiesand therefore reduce the healthcare cost .
Secondly , automation helps to reduce the social cost and reduces the need for the younger generation to take care of the aging population .
Automations such as dish-washer allow the the elderly to do simple chores at home and it increases the level of independence of the elderly  .
As one ages , our body tends to suffer from pains all  , automation such as massage machines help to relieve pain and it might reduce the possibility for a doctor consultation .
Besides this , remote controlled lighting helps elderly to control the house lights with a remote controland therefore ,  minimizes the risk of falling in the dark .
Thus , the responsibility of the younger generation can be greatly reduced  , such as  the  need of caretakers and medical costs .
However , some may argue that this is the ideal situation and only a minority of the elderly will benefit .
Luxurious goods such as massage machines and lighting systems are only affordable for the rich and they may not cut down the chances of getting sick .
In addition , automation only reduces the need for human labor , but there is no guarantee that it is able to drive down social costs .
When viewed from another angle ,   government policies help to maximize the welfare of the elderly .
The setting up of community centres which  organize activities for the elderly ,   is beneficial for the elderly .
Hence , we can conclude that automation can be seen as a tool in relieving the aging process  .
Extended lifespanshave the the elderly to work more and longer .
Hence , higher productivity is achieved  , thus reducing the burden of the younger generation in paying taxes .
However , some may argue that the elderly may not be fit enough to work and  there are doubts  if the older workforce can achieve a similar level of efficiency that is expected from the younger workers .
Therefore this makes it more difficult for elderly to look for a job .
From another point of view , there is only a minority who are unable to work; the majority should continue to work as long as they are able to and thus will not be seen as an extra burden to  society .
In addition , countries like Singapore has started to tackle aging problems where the government is getting companies to rehire workers aged 62 .
Unions are also working with companies to help older workers find and keep jobs through retraining programmes(Valarie Tan , 2009) .
Moreover , extended working years should be encouraged as a result of longer lifespan and  increased literacy  of future elderly .
Therefore , it is possible that productivity can still be sustain among the aging population .
In conclusion , I agree to a large extent that  government policies that have been implemented  helped to alleviate the aging process .
Developments in the future will be expected to be much  better , and though aging process is inevitableits inconveniences  can  be minimized  .
The average age of human has increased drastically within the last  and this has led to fast aging populations that raised concerns among governments and policy makers .
According to  (2008) , from 1900 to 2005 , life expectancy at birth increased from 46 to 75 years for men and from 48 to 80 years for women .
The aging process has caused unprecedented problems  for society  , especially for the aged  , who   face plenty of illnesses when they  become older .
Besides that ,  countries face difficulties in supporting a growing number of the aged as there are many vulnerable aged who live alone and need assistance from  governments .
Therefore  policies have been implemented to ease the aging process and to  support  the aged  .
Undeniably , there have been significant successes in the strategies used .
To ease the aging process , the governments have to put in a great effort in the research of medicine to provide the best treatment for the aged .
Since there is an obvious advancement in technology when compared to previous years , there are more inventions in medicine and equipment to treat  illnesses .
However , some people may think that the aged will not be able to afford  the treatment  as better equipment and treatments will increase the cost  .
To prevent such a situatio from happening , governments have introduced  insurance schemes to reduce the cost of treatment .
For example , the Singapore government has introduced the CPF Medisave Scheme and Medishield Scheme which can cover part of the treatment fees: the patient need not pay any fees for outpatient treatments and Medishield will pay 80% of the actual expenditure up to the claimable limit .
Through this , government ensures that the aged get the proper treatments to reduce their sufferings  .
Thus far , The governmenthas introduced some new economic policies  to ease the aging process .
This includes lengthening the age of retirement  , so that the aged have longer working lives (Peterson , 2001) so that they can earn more money when they are still working to support themselves .
The strategy of lowering the barriers to elder employment is effective in increasing the rate of employment among the aged .
However , some people may think that the aged is a burden to  society as they believe that the physical condition of the aged cannot cope with the development of the country .
While this may be true ,  facts have shown that the aged can still contribute to the economy as they have more experiences when compared to the others .
They share their experiences with the young and this can help to improve the economy of the country .
The government  could use the money to help the  aged and ease the aging process .
In addition , community centers or community clubs have their policies to ease the aging process  .
For instance , An Area Agency on Aging (AAA) is designated in each of New Jersey's 21 counties to serve as the primary entity responsible for developing comprehensive , coordinated systems of community-based services for the aged .
It analyses the needs and existing services within the county and prepares a comprehensive plan for the delivery of services to the aged .
The community centers organize  activities such as performances , games and feasts to help them feel less lonely , cheer them up and make them happy and this has eased the aging process in the society .
There are also many enthusiasts and volunteers in the society who are willing to spend their time accompanying  the aged  , as they know that they can give mental support to the aged .
Peterson (2001) mentions that  aging process in a country will cause a shrinking workforce , long-term stagnation and decrease in real GDP .
As a result , the whole societ ,including the aged , will face a lot of problems as some of them are still seeking aid from the government .
Leaders of countries must rise above ideology and engage  practical realities to cope with the problem of a fast aging population .
Therefore , governments and policy makers have implemented some  policies  in easing the aging process  .
by doing this , governments can ensure the development of their countries and provide a better living environment  to all their people  .
For a country to do well , the government has to ensure that all areas of its development are well funded .
Healthcare , military , education , and research and development are just some of the key areas affecting a country's development .
With so many issues to be considered , it is certain that the funding available will never be sufficient .
Thus , it has always been a tough choice for the government to decide how much budget should be spent on the various areas of the country's development .
In recent years , the increasing severity of the aging problem has brought about yet another problem that requires action to be taken promptly .
One of the most direct solutions to the aging problem is to allow more public spending on the aged .
However , with the limited budget the country has , it is essential that the more important priorities are first taken care of before large scale policies are implemented to help the aged .
First of all , the country should spend the bulk of their budget on areas which are of great importance .
One of these areas would be that of the military The significance of the military to a nation is so great that it is not possible for a country to constrict its spending in this area .
With the ever present threat of terrorism , which has the potential to cause huge destruction , there is no doubt that investing in the military is of  greater importance than taking care of the welfare of the elderly .
The government should not hesitate to invest in the latest military technology and equipment .
This is to ensure that the country will be able to defend itself should any undesirable situations arise .
However , others may argue that Singapore has always enjoyed peace and that there are no signs of any conflicts with other nations arising .
Thus , are these large investments in military goods really required ?
Shouldn't we put the welfare of the elderly as a higher priority ?
With the increasing number of elderly coupled together with the issue of the low birth rate , the aging population problem has certainly become more pressing in recent years .
True enough , Singapore has been successful in avoiding any direct conflicts with other countries .
However , national security will always be one of the most important aspects to a country .
The consequence of a weak military has the potential to destroy an entire nation especially one which is as small as ours .
This dire effect is something we cannot afford , thus , investing in military goods will definitely be one of the top priorities of the government .
Secondly , the government should allocate its available resources wisely so as to obtain the most effective use of them .
To achieve this , money has to be channelled into  research and development  instead of spending excessively on the aged .
By doing so , our country will be able to progress more quickly .
New technologies and more efficient production methods will be discovered .
With these , the country will be well-equipped to ensure  sustained economic growth and to head towards a prosperous and progressive nation .
No doubt , some may argue that the nation should always show its gratitude to the elders of the nation by making sure that they are well taken care of .
However , if the country were to divert most of its public spending to the aged now , it is almost certain that it will face an arduous problem in the near future .
Neglecting the other areas of the country's development will hinder its progress and lead to limited economic growth and thus  a shrinking budget .
As mentioned by Friedland and Summer (2005) in "Doomsday Predictions about Population Aging Are Exaggerated" , with little economic growth , there are fewer choices about how to care for the elderly thus intensifying the problem on hand .
Therefore , it is  essential to ensure  healthy economic growth as it will provide many alternatives to the problems Singaporefaces .
As can be seen from the above arguments , due to the limited resources available , and the ever growing number of issues that need to be tended to , it is impossible to ensure that all areas of Singapore's development are well funded .
Thus , the government has to prioritize and allocate  resources wisely so that the goals of having a stable and prosperous nation can be achieved . .
Humanity has come a long way in evolving and adapting to the changing environment .
Through the years , it has managed to overcome several limitations , which in the past were nothing more than dreams .
It succeeded in landing on the moon and communicating over long distance , yet there are still some boundaries it still has to cross despite its best effort .
Aging is an inevitable process of nature .
While  the ticking clock in our body cannot be stopped advance technology and modern governance have made it possible for aging to be delayed and relieved to a great extent .
High-tech equipment and medication are available for the treatment of more illnesses as our understanding of medicine improves  .
Governments nowadays are  also doing more for the elderly population in their society . 
With more emphasis placed on healthcare by governments today and the advancement of  medical technology , people get to live longer .
Cancers are not as deadly as in the past and new vaccines are constantly being developed .
People , including the elderly , are made less vulnerable to  diseases , and in a way , people become biologically stronger .
This also means an increase in the productivity of the aged physically .
McClatchy Newspapers (2008 , October 20) suggested that with the miracle of modern medicine , 60 might be the new 40 .
However , most treatments do not come cheap and chronic illnesses , especially , take a toll on their finances as people live longer .
"One hospitalisation , for example , a stroke can set you back  tens of thousands of dollars ," as stated by Associate Professor Paulin Straughan , sociologist , National University of Singapore in Channel NewsAsia (2009 , August 19) .
In fact , most elderly are not rich and many cannot afford the treatments .
Friedland and Summer highlighted that some segments of the aged population might be overlooked and remain very vulnerable .
For this group of people , most governments intervene to help  subsidise  treatments they genuinely need .
Modern governments promise old age security , which ensures that their citizens can fend for themselves during old age .
The approaches , however , may vary from society to society .
In some like The United Kingdom and Canada , government pensions are distributed to the elderly .
In some others such as Singapore , the people are compelled to provide in advance for their old age  .
Some societies have laws in place to enforce children to take care of elderly parents .
For example , in Singapore , elderly parents may file in  court if their children do not provide for them .
However , there are various financial concerns about these methods .
In the case of government pensions , the heavy spending of public funds on the  aged may take a toll on other areas of the nation's development .
Thus a method that works in one society may not work in another and sometimes , multiple approaches have to be taken .
However , better healthcare and protection from the government result in rising age expectancy , which is a double-edged sword because on one hand , people live longer as shown in the report (Friedland and Summer , 2005 , Fig 1-2) and on the other hand , the proportion of aging population increases if the younger generation are not reproducing enough , This is the trend today in developed nations .
In today's fast-paced society  , there are several factors , such as high living costs and late marriagesthat discourage people from reproducing " .
Peterson has claimed that , "If fertility rates do not rise again , the problem will worsen as the median age in many first-world countries will reach 51 by 2050 ,"  .
As the number of elderly increases , with a great  , there might not be enough young people in the workforce to support the economy and generate enough money for healthcare subsidies and government pensions as mentioned previously .
While there are temporary measures to alleviate this problem , such as rising the retirement age and importing foreign workers , the key is still to increase the fertility rate .
The aging process has been eased with the modernization of our society as better healthcare technology and government welfare are available to serve the elderly .
However , this revolution has generated a rising aging population which may be a problem to all levels of the society .
Governments in developed countries should look beyond temporary solutions to the rising aging population and focus on getting people to reproduce .
While there are initiatives like maternity welfare and the baby bonus to encourage reproduction ,  more can be done  for the better .
Many people have argued that public spending on the aged is a must for countries facing the problem of an aging population as an ageing population has dire social , economical and cultural consequences on the country .
True as it seems , the question posed here is how  should  the government allocate its resources to cope with this problem .
As the saying goes , 'Give the man a fish and feed him for a day , teach the man to fish and feed him for a lifetime' .
Therefore , the use of the country's resources should be well diversified to different areas of the country's development so that no one area is compromised on .
With  elderly care hugely subsidized by the government , the aged will tend to be reliant on the government  providing for their old age .
This has caused the aged to be heavily dependent on the government and thus has developed a negative practice of the aged not saving for their own retirement .
It may be argued that the money which is not saved for retirement can be better spent elsewhere .
Adam Smith argues in his book Wealth of Nations that 'each individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment of whatever capital he can command' .
Although it is argued that the 'extra money' that the elderly possess will be better spent elsewhere , it may not be spent in the most efficient way possible .
Adam Smith also points out that individuals will act in their own advantage , not that of the society .
Therefore , the 'extra money' that the elderly possess at the expense of the government may not result in the most efficient allocation of resources .
With more money from public spending spent on the aged , this also means that there  is less money for the  other areas of development in the country .
Other areas of development that will increase the economic growth of the country will then be compromised .
One justification for economic growth is that with little economic growth , society faces fewer choices on how to care for those who are least able to care for themselves (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
Critics of this position point out that when more money is spent on the aged , it  generates economic growth .
With better and more affordable healthcare services provided for  , the elderly can be healthier and more economically productive .
This will allow the elderly to be able to work for longer  and delay their retirement .
This will then increase the labour force of the country and result in economic growth .
However , this growth is limited .
There is a limit to the economic growth brought about by delaying the retirement age of the elderly .
Therefore , government resources should be allocated to areas of development that will generate potential economic growth which can be sustained .
This includes Research and Development (R&D) where more efficient healthcare methods can be devised .
By designating the role of the caregiver of the elderly to the government , "Asian values" such as filial piety will be eroded as children may shed the responsibility of taking care of their parents to the government .
It may be objected that these values are innate to one's identity and are not easily influenced or changed by other factors .
However , real life scenarios do actually show that these values can be influenced or eroded .
In Singapore , one is compelled to undertake the role of the caregiver and this  is backed up with law of maintenance of parent's act to ensure one fulfills one's filial obligations .
It is true that there are multiple advantages supporting public spending on the aged .
But in view of the many problems that a country would face if large amount of public spending are spent on the aged , it is only wise that the government  diversifies its public spending to other areas of development and strikes a balance among the other priorities .
The growing number of ageing population is an inevitable issue worldwide , especially in developed countries (Peterson , Fall 2001) .
Technological advancement enables humans to live longer .
On the other hand , the younger generation are chasing after 'an individualistic and 'live life to the fullest' lifestyle . .
This new generation would have the perception of enjoying life and not having family and children because they see it as a burden .
In the long run , this will translate into a low fertility rate in the country .
In the case of Singapore , the growing elderly population should not be accompanied by restrictions in public spending on the aged , which may come in the form of pension schemes , medical insurance , healthcare benefits and disability allowance .
This paper recommends that public spending on the elderly should not be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
This is because the current benefits that are provided for the elderly are still inadequate .
In terms of welfare and poverty ,  less than 5% of households in the low income group  are beneficiaries of the state-funded system .
Only 0 .07% received public assistance in 2004 (Asher & Nandy , 2008) .
If public spending on low income groups is limited , there would be fewer elderly who could benefit from government aid .
Therefore , an increase in social disparity and healthcare problems would be an issue for the country .
Although public spending on the elderly is an endless process as they don't generate much productivity to the country , social responsibility as a nation needs to be promoted . .
There are many elderly people who are unable to support themselves and have to take up jobs like road sweeping and toilet cleaning .
Besides that , the elderly were once the people who contributed to the growth of the nation and economy .
Many of these vulnerable beings should not be left with little aid when they are in need of much care and help .
In the context of a developed country like Singapore , which was ranked the third competitive economy in the world (Anand , 2009) , sufficient funds are available for economic growth and other areas of development .
Therefore , thereshould not be a need to divert  public spending on the elderly to other areas of the country's development .
The nation's infrastructure , development and trade are in a desirable condition and the current spending on them is adequate to sustain  economic growth .
Hence , the government should not focus on limiting  public spending but on  ways to spend it wisely .
One example is  means-testing . 
In addition to that , the money that is spent on helping the elderly is partially their money which was deducted through tax payment .
Thus , policy makers have the responsibility to provide the elderly with  .
The aged should be able to enjoy  social security during their later years .
We have to be conscious that even though they are deemed as a liability , they are also part of the nation and should not be neglected .
Stressing filial responsibility and raising more productive children is a way to support the aged , as suggested by Peterson (Fall 2001) .
However , there are certain groups of elderly who are single , child-less , not on good terms with their children or who still need to support their 'parasitic' adult children .
On top of that , the elderly who are disabled and suffering from chronic illnesses need a large sum of money to deal with their condition .
They won't be able to get ample financial support from their children and have to depend on the government to provide this assistance .
Even with the assistance of MediSave and MediShield , elderly people suffering from terminal illnesses will not be able to pay for their high healthcare costs when their bank accounts are exhausted (Channel NewsAsia , 2009) .
Although this will create a sense of dependency on the government , it is an unavoidable situation where the government needs to care for its citizens . 
In summary the government should not limit  public spending on the elderly and divert it to other areas of the country's development .
This is due to the ascending numbers of elderly in the coming years that need to be dealt with (Friedland & Summer , 2005) .
These elderly were once the people who helped in building up the nation and the government should show their compassion and care for this vulnerable group by not restricting public spending on them .
It is vital that the expenditure on the elderly is delegated according to their needs so that wastage can be avoided .
Hence , more elderly people can benefit through this act and it would not be seen as wastage of the country's funds .
The aging processes in Singapore with its ensuing serious impacts , has caught people's attention . .
The aging process requires special attention because due to the low birth rate , Singapore has became an aging country with a large fraction of its population being aged .
The government is currently carrying out research and implementing policies to help to ease the aging process for both the elderly and the country .
Researchers are mainly focusing on healthcare and infrastructure .
The former involves finding out the types of age-related illness that are likely to arise when people reach a certain age and measures that can be taken to reduce the occurrence of the illnesses .
The latter involves developing public facilities that cater to the needs of the elderly who are physically weak .
Besides that , various policies have also been introduced to aid the elderly .
These policies include granting subsidies that help to reduce the high cost of living , various HDB schemes to encourages children to live close to their parents as well as the upgrading of housing estate for the elderly .
The research and policies that have been continuously implemented for the aged in Singapore have worked well because of the pragmatic approach that has been taken .
Research on healthcare and infrastructure has been constantly improving to ease the aging process .
Firstly , the government is currently researching  the possible type of chronic illnesses that are likely to surface at a certain age of life , at the same time as implementing control measures to prevent the occurring  illness .
As the saying goes , prevention is better than cure , thus the government sector such as the health promotion board and the Singapore eye care centre is constantly organizing campaigns to raise the awareness of the elderly regarding the serious consequences associated with the illnesses .
They also provide free medical checkups  the elderly usually aged 50 and above for early detection of the illness .
It is a good approach with some limitations .
This is because for the elderly  , who are illiterate and living alone , may not know that there are such campaigns going on as they are unable to read campaignspublished in newspapers  , or understand  advertisements telecasted over the television as they are mostly in English or Chinese .
Thus the elderly that only understand dialect will not get the message thereby defeating the purpose of the campaign .
Next , improvisation of infrastructure on public transportation and housing estates is another area of research that is being focused on .
For public transport , a portion of seats have been removed leaving a spacious area to suit the needs of the elderly that are wheelchair bound .
In housing estates , the government has upgraded  flats that are relatively old and inconvenient for the elderly .
Examples of upgrading is lifts that are now able to stop at every storey of the flat and within the lift there are handles for the elderly to hold on to for support while taking the lift .
Also all the squat toilets have been converted to seat toilets to avoid accidents of people slipping and falling when squatting and standing up .
This improved infrastructure kills two birds with one stone as it not only provides for the elderly , it also  benefits the handicapped .
Thus this research does not only serve for the elderly , it also servesother purposes as well .
Policies complement the research .
Given the high cost of living in Singapore , the government has provided benefits for the elderly by granting subsidizes on healthcare .
This policy works well because the aged would have their savings used for daily expenses such as food and necessities .
Apart from subsidies , the government have reorganized the healthcare system to cater to the needs of the elderly .
For example , the government have taken a step-down approach by including more community hospitals and nursing homes in the health care sector that are more affordable than staying in the hospital .
This policy is workable as the elderly can recuperate better in a community hospital as they do not have to worry much about the medical fees .
Also , community hospitals provide convenience as they are near the neighborhood thus enabling them to get medical aid soon after they fall sick  .
It also helps to assure their children that there's someone to attend to their sick parents when they are at work .
However , although the cost of healthcare is greatly reduced , there are cases whereby the elderly who are childless and do not have any savings or income  , do not have any medisave to pay for the large amount of medical fee incurred .
Even though there are subsidies , the elderly will still not be able to afford medical expenses .
The next policy that is suggested is to give rebates to those who purchase a house that is close to their parents .
This is  to encourage  children to visit their parents often thus giving them a sense of warmth and security  .
However , this is not always the expected scenario .
Some children will only make use of the reason to get as much subsidy as possible and they might not visit their parents even though they are living very near .
Therefore , although all these approaches have  only provided limited ways of easing the aging process , they still offer a feasible and practical approach  .
Only a small group of the aging population faces these limitations and the government may also come out with other policies to solve these problems so that the approach implemented can be workable without any flaws and limitations .
Besides relying on the government , Singaporeans must also pay attention to the aging issue and help to play a part in reducing elderly dependence on the government .
For instance , they can help to take care of their aged parents ,or be a volunteer to contribute to a society that is gradually aging  .
People must put themselves in elderly people'sshoes and realize that one day they will also be aged and  need the support of their children and others .
It is believed strongly that one will be repaid for their kindness in treating others well .
Likewise , , peoplemay receive the same treatment  .
Demographic trends across both developed and developing countries reflect that the world population is rapidly ageing .
In Singapore ,  increasing life expectancy together with  high-quality healthcare and  declining fertility rates are the causes of the graying population .
In fact , it has been projected that 20% of the population will be over 65 years old by 2030 (Coughlin , 2008) .
Besides slow economic growth , one result of the ageing population in Singapore is the rising pension and healthcare costs , which forces a major increase in  public spending  .
Hence , governments and policy- makers face great challenges  towards the ageing population .
Nevertheless , despite the fact that the ageing population is likely to hurt public finances , it is crucial to recognize the well-being and livelihood of the aged cannot be compromised by investing in other developments for economic gains .
This is because the elderly have not only contributed significantly to the society , but in fact have many important roles to play .
For instance , they represent the  link with our history and tradition which is a crucial source of cultural identity and social stability (Rasheed , 2010) While Singapore strives to develop itself to become a "world-class" and self-sufficient country , it is equally important for its society to be socially stable and secure .
This paper examines the various reasons for allocating more public spending on the aged as the ageing population continues to grow in Singapore .
Singapore was lauded by economists "for avoiding the pitfalls of erecting an expensive welfare state that diverts government funds from economic development(Burton , 2007) ."
This is because over the years , Singaporeans have been encouraged and educated to be financially independent , self-reliant and to plan for their old-age  ,so as not to be overly dependent on the government .
For instance , Singapore established its social security through the Central Provident Fund (CPF) in 1955 , which is a mandatory savings programme that funds pensions and healthcare for citizens (Burton , 2007) .
On the other hand , it was stressed that children should carry out their filial obligations to provide for their ageing parents .
One example is the passing of the Maintenance of Parents Act that allows parents to sue their children for financial support (Wijaya , 2009) .
In other words , public spending on the aged should be limited so that the government can pour in more state funding into other areas of the country's development such as education , research and development (R&D) , urban development and upgrading  public transport and housing . . As a result , these  efforts to invest and develop the nation benefits  future generations of all ages .
Firstly , despite the fact that the CPF is a flexible scheme to enforce savings for individuals , it has shown signs of weakness and has been seen as being insufficient to last for one's retirement years (Tsao , 2008) .
One of the fundamental reasons for insufficient funds in one's CPF is the need of the population to finance their public housing  .
Additionally , it is especially hard for elderly people  ,whose wages were low during the early 60s and 70s , to keep up with the rising cost of living (Burton , 2007) .
Furthermore , the CPF does not protect certain segments of the population who were not able to work and save during their younger days .
For instance ,  housewives were not able to contribute to their Medisave because they had to raise their family and chose not to work as a result .
In fact , Medisave will provide little or no protection for them in the event of illness .
Eventually , this does not only burden the aged with insufficient funds to support their medical expenditures but it also strains the relationship with their children as they need to provide more monetary contributions to their parents .
These reasons continue to urge the government to expand  public spending on the aged so as to sustain the needs and livelihood of the aged within the population .
Secondly , while the government has emphasized the concept of filial obligations in children , the underlying truth is that children are going through a hard time trying to provide for their elderly parents sufficiently throughout their retirement years .
In a survey , it was reported that 66 .0% of senior citizens aged 55 and above were provided with a regular cash contribution from their children .
Additionally , it has been shown that  dependence on children to finance their healthcare expenditure increased with age and only 35 .8% of senior citizens aged 55 and above have a clean bill of health (Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports [MCYS] , 2005) .
In other words , most elderly people are rather dependent on their children to support them , particularly those who suffer from chronic illnesses .
This dependence is coupled with rising health care costs that is taking a toll on their children's finances .
Besides , the decline in the number of children supporting elderly parents due to smaller family sizes ,puts further strain on  children (Wijaya , 2009) .
Therefore , the government ought to increase its public spending to assist and ease the strain of the children supporting their aged parents .
On the whole , as Singapore's population ages rapidly , it accentuates the need to increase  public spending on the aged in order to meet greater healthcare demands and the rising cost of living .
As discussed earlier  ,  rising healthcare costs coupled with longer living parents puts pressure on  cash-strapped children to provide for their elderly parents .
Apart from that , the aged are also burdened by  inadequate funds in their CPF accounts due to various reasons . .
In short , the aged need more financial help from the government so as to ease the strain on the elderly as well as their children .
Nowadays , the aging population is increasing and the problem is  more serious .
In  2008 , the proportion of the elderly in Singapore was 8 .6% and it is estimated that the proportion of the elderly in  2003 will increase to 18 .7% .
From another perspective , an increase in the aging population will lead to an increase in  government spending on the elderly .
According to statistics , the elderly dependency ratio in Singapore is 11 .9 per 100 in 2008 .
However , public spending on  senior citizens should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as taking care of the needy , the unfortunate , the young and infrastructure .
Public money that is saved can be diverted to building infrastructure because it benefits all social classes such as the elderly , the needy , the unfortunate and the young by increasing their social welfare .
In addition , an increase in infrastructure can attract investment from abroad because  facilities are fully equipped .
Furthermore , an increase in infrastructure can attract more tourists to travel to Singapore The building of infrastructure makes tourists feel comfortable and it is convenientt because tourists can travel around the country without barriers .
For instance ,  , Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) , roads , buildings , and resorts are some of the facilities that can be provided to increase social welfare .
Public funds that are saved can be used to develop the economy because economic growth will increase the  standard of living .
However , resources are limited .
The government cannot choose to develop everything because of the scarcity of resources , such as land , funds and workers .
Therefore , the government has to choose the most beneficial areas to invest in .
In addition , the government can also invest in areas where  profit and social welfare can be improved so that the  standard of living will be increased .
For example , investment will bring more job opportunities to the market due to the economic growth .
Therefore ,  citizens have more job options and find it easier to be hired .
Moreover ,  citizens can request  higher salaries as the economy has improved .
Higher salaries will encourage citizens to purchase more goods .
Therefore , the  standard of living will be much better compared to the past .
Accumulated public funds can be used to finance research and development .
Research and development is needed to discover new products and processes or to improve existing ones .
New products and technology will benefit  citizens by giving them satisfaction and convenience .
For example ,  new  medicines for the elderly to improve health , electronic wheelchairs for handicapped people and robots to take care of the children and elderly .
Moreover , some of the research and development is not only beneficial to the economy , but is also environmentally friendly .
Solar power is an example of environmentally friendly technology .
Solar power is an energy source obtainable by converting sunlight into electricity using photocells .
Therefore , environmental pollution can be lessened by reduced fuel usage . .
In conclusion , public spending should not be mainly on the elderly as the money should be used for other areas of the country's development .
By having proper planning , the government can kill two birds with one stone  , since public money that is saved can be diverted to  increase social welfare and the reputation of the country . .
Moreover , the development of the country is a long-term investment and it must be planned properly because it will affect the future of thenext generations .
Senior citizens can contribute to the nation by imparting their knowledge and sharing their experience with the younger generation .
Have you ever asked yourself , How will we live in the old age ?
Who will take care of us ?
Our descendants , ourselves or the government Nowadays , more and more people have to concern themselves with these questions as the fast aging population is becoming a serious problem  which many countries are confronted with .
In my opinion , because there are a lot of effective methods to solve the agingproblem , except for medical and welfare programs , the government should limit spending on the aging population in order to develop other areas .
Firstly , public spending diverted from the aged to other important areas of the country's development can contribute to promote economic growth .
When the economy grows , fewer old persons need to be helped because of the following reasons .
The first point that should be taken into consideration is that the more economic growth there is , the more chances the elderly have to find jobs .
As a result , they can cover their everyday needs by themselves .
Moreover , with sufficient economic growth , more services are supplied to care for the old .
For example , people can invite nurses to their homes to look after their old parents everyday , or the elderly can live in rest homes with creature comforts and a lot of care .
So , to ease the aging problem , economic growth should be accentuated .
It is said that the government should spend a lot of money on the aging population in order to reduce the burden on young people .
This argument goes on to assert that because the expenditure of time and money on caring as well as buying medicine for the elderly is enormous , public spending on the aged will help young people concentrate more on their work and improve their quality of life .
However , increasing public spending on the aged is not  a sustainable long term strategy .
If other  areas of the country's development such as education andthe economy are not  invested in adequately , future generations of older people are likely to be even worse off .
The first reason is that if people are not  educated well in their young days , their lives in  old age will be very vulnerable as people with more education tend to have higher incomes and better health(Friedland & Summer , 2005) . .
Moreover , little economic growth often leads to lower income which makes it impossible for people to save much money for their old age .
Therefore , concentrating on prior areas of the country's development instead of investing significant amounts of money on the aged is likely to ensure better lives for future groups of older people .
Last but not least , reducing public spending on the aged helps to stress filial obligation .
Because few medical and welfare programs are launched when government expenditure on the aging populationdecreases  , many people may have not enough money to send their old parents to rest homes .
They have to spend more time taking care of their parents by themselves .
So , there are more opportunities for descendants to express their love and gratitude to their parents and grandparents .
As a result , family sentiment is enhanced significantly within societyin society
In conclusion , because of enhanced economic growth , ensuring better lives for future generations of older people and stressing filial obligation , limiting public spending on the aged in order to invest in other  areas of the country's development is a good approach to solve the global aging problem .
In order to make the most of the limited budget for the aging population , the government should concentrate on supporting people who really need aid such as older single women .
An aging population is a common situation in many developed countries .
With the number of elderly increasing rapidly there are numerous problems like deterioration of health .
There is a need for governments to focus on these problems , in order to improve the welfare of the aged .
However , this may lead to an issue of whether the governments should limit their public fund on the aged .
One argument is that , instead of limiting spending , it is morally right to spend money on the aged who contributed most of their life to nation building .
Critics may argue that  public funding should be used for cultivating the younger generations , who will be the future pillar of the countr , instead of spending  public funds on the elderly who no longer capable of contributing to society .
Although this argument sounds logical , it is morally incorrect .
The elderly have contributed a lot to society ITherefore , we are able to enjoy our comfortable lives today , because of the elderly who participated in many aspects of nationl building such as education  .
There is an ancient Chinese proverb "remember the source while drinking the water" which can be applied to this case .
The contributions of the elderly should not be forgotten , the need to reward them for their efforts is crucial .
Therefore , the government should not reduce public funding on the elderly .
Instead , the government needs to recognize the efforts contributed by the elderly in nation building .
The public funding spent on the construction of medical infrastructure as well as the building of elderly friendly houses are beneficial to all  human beings .
The reason is that the process of aging occurs to everyone .
It is just a matter of time .
Since there is no way to escape aging , the government needs to pay a lot of pay a lot of attention to the issues relating to aging .
During the Singapore national day rally , Prime Minster Lim Hsien Loong pointed out the need to improve the health care system for the aged .
There is a need to make health care more accessible and affordable to the aged .
Therefore , the government has implemented the three M policies -Medifund , MediShield and Medicsave .
In addition , the government is focusing on  care too .
For example , the co-operation between the Changi general hospital and St Andrew's community health care .
These measures help to reduce expensive medical fees for the aged as well as catering to the needs of the elderly .
These measures will benefit the younger citizens in times to come .
Therefore , it is rather wiser to focus on the aging issue and solve it before it backfires .
In the above paragraph , it was mentioned  that if the government does not target  the health issue of the aged seriously , it may eventually backfire . .
The unhappiness and anger towards the government's willingness to deal with the issue may increase among the aged .
An atmosphere of anger may slowly result in strikes .
Hong Kong is one example .
The elderly went on strike to oppose government for reducing their daily allowance of 60 Hong Kong dollars .
Additionally , the uncaring image of the government will slowly encourage the migration of citizens Therefore , the government needs to pay extra attention to taking care of the aged .
On the other side of the coin , if the needs of the elderly are well taken care off , they will still be capable of contributing to society .
The elderly bring years of knowledge , experiences and business contacts with them .
They are just like encyclopedias which provide wise advice for the younger worker who may not be experienced .
In acting as the role of advisor , they will help the company to progress economically .
For example , Lee Kuan Yew , Minister Mentor of Singapore , is still active in politics by advising young politicians .
The requirement for Mr . Lee to remain active in politics is good health .
Thus , it is crucial for the government to spend more public funds in dealing with medical problems of the aged .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited .
Critics may argue that other areas such as education require public funding as well .
I agree that other areas do need public funding , and indeed money has to be spent on it .
However , a developed country will have the ability to take care of all the areas .
Moreover , by taking care of the aged , it will portray the country to be a gracious and caring nation .
This positive impression will in turns attract foreigners to choose the country as a destination for pleasure .
This will benefit the country economically .
An aging population is a problem affecting many global countries .
With an increasing aging population , countries will face lower productivity and increased social and health care costs .
Therefore , part of public spending should be placed on the interest of the elderly and the rest should be diverted to other areas of the country's development to help boost economic growth .
First and forth most , education is one of the aspects that could greatly help to boost a country's economy .
Though it is a long term investment which takes many years to  help generate income for the country ,  it is definitely worth the investment .
When the government steps in to provide subsidies for eligible students to further their education , the country has a population with higher qualifications as it covers more of those less fortunate families who could not afford the huge amount of school fees  .
Next , research and development is another important aspect that could help boost a country's economy .
For example , the European Commission has contributed 2 billion to ICT research projects as ICT is one of the areas that underpin Europe's economic performance and it is pivotal to its economic growth (Europe's Information Society , 2008) .
It is stated in the article that "it is essential to have continuous investment in research and development when  difficult policy decisions to support the real economy worldwide" (Europe's Information Society , 2008) .
Another example , 2 .4% of Singapore's GDP; amounting to 3 billion euros , is spent on research and development (Gafoor , 2008) .
Nevertheless , Singapore is planning to increase its spending to 6 .8 billion euros by 2010 and targets to spend 3% of their GDP (Gafoor , 2008) .
The main objective of the investment is to build knowledge in three areas; bio-technology , environmental technology , and digital media and information technology , for the rapid growth in Asia .
Last but not least , business opportunities can be created with government effort .
A well constructed environment where visitors enjoy good Internet connectivity and teleconferencing facilities in most hotels , convention halls and exhibition venues , opens up the opportunity to attract local and foreign corporations .
For example , Singapore put a lot of effort inton constructing a place for business travellersOne of their notable examples is the Novotel Clarke Quay Singapore , which is an ideal venue to hold MICE events that had just recently renovated its facilities (Uniquely Singapore , 2006) .
Thus , in  2006 , Singapore won the award of 'The Corporate Meeting of The Year' (Uniquely Singapore , 2006) .
This Award helped to enhance Singapore hotel positioning as a venue for business travellers and MICE events (Uniquely Singapore , 2006) .
Coupled with a good education systemand powerful research and development ,  creating business opportunities is  part of the key to attracting more businesses and foreign talents into a country , as people are always interested in working in a vibrant country .
By doing so , a country's development will be improved as there is circulation of wealth when trading is performed .
On the other hand , if most  public spending is used on easing the aging process , it will slow down economic growth because it's more of a cost than income for the country .
The cost of  more suitable healthcare , infrastructure , transportation , housing , pensions and financial aid for the elderly is necessary to help ease the aging process However , spending should be limited as the  health and economic value of the elderly decline , and emotional and social problems increase .
This is because in the long run , if most money is spent on accommodating the older population , there will be little economic growth , and society will face  fewer choices on how to care for those in need (Robert & Summer , 2005) .
On the other hand , with sufficient economic growth , there will be more choices available to help those in need and there will also be fewer persons in need (Robert & Summer , 2005) .
In addition , governments will be able to ensure the continuation of welfare programmes for the elderly .
In conclusion , public spending is for the good of the country's population and the portion spent on the various areas  However , leaders  must realize that as more money is spent on easing the aging process , future public spending will be limited and this could have a negative impact  on future generations .
Therefore , improving the economy in different areas , such as education , rbusiness opportunities , and research and development opportunities as mentioned earlier , is more important than just focusing on solving one area of  the problem . 
It is widely known that the source of the government's money comes from the citizens .
Where is all the money invested ?
It has always been for the development of Singapore and its people .
However , Singapore is faced with an inevitable crisis: a growing aging population that is affecting the country's economy (Lee , 2008) because of the assistance the government has to render for the elderly .
The elderly have been perceived as the nation's burden .
Should the government pay more attention to a specific group when their children are financially stable and forsake the country's future ?
Hence , it can be argued that the government should limit their expenditure on the elderly so that money can be directed to other aspects of the country's development .
On the contrary , the elderly need the government to support them and the government should do so .
This is because the elderly do not have the capability to work and fend for themselves .
The cost of medical and healthcare is increasing and this causes problems for families especially those earning a low income .
The cost of living in Singapore is high such that children have resorted to abandoning their parents .
It is the responsibility of the government to take care of and ensure that their citizens are not suffering and to ease their plight , especially in times of recession .
The elderly have played their part in their younger days by paying for taxes and it is only reasonable for the government to repay them .
With the inflating cost of health care in Singapore , the government cannot avoid implementing schemes such as Medisave and Medishield .
However , Singapore should not be dependent on the government for fiscal aid .
In the context of the elderly , the reason why the government has to spend a lot of money on them is due to the fact that children nowadays are abandoning their parents either in hospitals or old folk homes .
Why are children doing so ?
Burress (2007) argues that we should care for our parents and shower them with undivided love and attention because we will want the love and care when we are in our golden years .
However , unpleasant and traumatic experiences from childhood may be the reasons that push children to desert their parents .
The children now hold a grudge against the parents and refuse to provide for them now that they are grown up .
However , not all parents are like that .
Children have an unprecedented obligation to care for their own parents .
They have cared for us when we were young .
Looking back and considering living conditions in the past , the sacrifices they made then are no match for anything we would ever do in the present .
The value of filial piety has no significant meaning in Singapore's "individualistic world view ," as mentioned by Assistant Professor Joonmo Son from National University of Singapore (cited in Liew , 2009) .
However , the children have to realise that  not assuming their responsibilities to care for their parents , affects the whole society .
Tax prices may need to be increased to meet the needs of providing financial aid for the aged .
The elderly should also consider ageing actively and with dignity .
They should not be too reliant on the government or their children for help .
Instead , they should look for avenues which allow them to maximise their abilities and talents in their golden years .
For example , the Council for Third Age is an organisation that strives for "an active ageing culture" (Active Ageing , 2009) .
This is achieved through events that allow the elderly to organise activities for themselves .
Additionally , the Council organises Grandparents Day to "celebrate and honour" (Active Ageing , 2009) our grandparents for their significant contributions for us .
With this , hopefully our elderly could regain a positive light in life and have a circle of friends whom they can trust and depend on .
Moreover , they should try and find means of working part-time jobs that are suitable for their age so that they could provide for themselves and also meet new people and make more friends .
This  will help increase  psychological and emotional well being .
In conclusion , public spending on the elderly is necessar .
However to a certain extent ,  the government cannot be relied on as they too have other areas of development to look out for .
Furthermore , not every parent is lucky enough to have children who could love them and fulfil their wants and needs .
Instead of helping them with monetary schemes , the government should implement new initiatives such as psychological and emotional support that encourages the elderly to get out of their misery and age actively .
The fact remains that education helps individuals gain knowledge and insights into life , which is the basis of civilisation and is vital for a nation's political stability in the long run .
Learning from the mistakes of past politicians , current leaders will avoid making the same blunders .
With proper education , leaders will know which policies are good for the country , when they should be implemented and how long the policy should be in place .
In spite of having a world-renowned education system , the leaders should strive to make improvements instead of just being contented with the current situation .
For instance , the government should adopt a more holistic approach so that the skills learned in classrooms can be adapted to the globalising world .
With its well-reputed education system , the focal point of public spending should instead be placed on the elderly .
Prime Minister Lee pointed out in a newspaper report (Mathavan , 2009) that the country should not overlook the issue of caring for the elderly and provide health care subsidies .
Due to the high standards of living , the huge medical expenses incurred by the elderly not only strain their children emotionally , but financially as well .
To address this issue , the government came up with the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (2008) where subsidies are given out accordingly after an income assessment is done .
However , this may be insufficient due to the stringent criteria placed on the Per Capita Income Rate of Subsidy .
The income assessment overlooks details such as a family having more than one elderly person that requires medical attention  .
In this case , they might encounter difficulties in paying for the medical fees as they have more than one elderly person to look after .
As such , the income assessment should be revised to provide a more concise evaluation of a family's financial situation .
In this way , public spending can be used to provide more medical subsidies for the elderly .
The government should aim to provide a better infrastructure for the old as well .
Coming up with the Wellness Programme , "a pilot project to help seniors keep fit mentally and physically" (Soh , 2009) , is the stepping stone for a more elderly-friendly environment .
This programme comprises of health checks , talks on how to engage the elderly socially , as well as  activities that help them adopt healthier lifestyles .
However , this programme is not readily available because it is only set up in 12 constituencies .
In addition , it is only accessible to the elderly in newer estates such as Jurong Central .
This programme is not extended to areas which have a higher concentration of the elderly population , such as Jalan Bukit Merah .
The inculcation of the right values into the elderly would make this programme much more effective .
Instead of enticing the elderly with material benefits such as goody bags for example , motivating the elderly to exercise on their own would sustain interest in the long run .
To maintain elderly people's interest , public spending should ideally be spent on building more facilities island wide so that the elderly need not travel long distances .
The efforts made by our leaders though commendable , are not sufficient to ensure the elderly remain interested More should be done to ensure that they get the appropriate healthcare subsidies and proper facilities for them to stay healthy .
In the future , Singapore may even aim to become one of the best destinations for individuals to retire in .
In this growing society , younger generations are getting more educated .
Unlike in the past , younger generations nowadays are more work oriented .
They are reluctant to start a family and even though they are married , they do not wish to have any children .
They feel that having children will hinder their progress in their careers .
On the other hand , life expectancy  has increased because people have become more affluent .
Thus , the aging population is now an increasing problem globally .
A very good example is Japan .
A case study in 2008 has shown that 20% of the population now in Japan is sixty-five years old and above .
By  2030 , the percentage of the population who is sixty-five years old and above will rise to 38 .1% .
An aging population will be a never ending problem in this modern society .
Increasing  public spending on the aged will not be able to solve this problem .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited and the money should be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Firstly , increasing public spending on the aged will only make the aged dependent on the government .
The government should encourage the aged to extend their service to the workforce .
In Singapore , the government extended the retirement age from 62 years old to 65 years old .
People may think that it is time for the aged to enjoy their life because they have slogged for many decades  , but they do not know that most of the aged are still fit and healthy .
If a person is employed , it is beneficial for their physical well being .
In addition , it will also benefit the country's economy .
This proves that it is not necessary for the government to increase  their budget on the aged if their aged population are able to cope financially .
The money on the other hand can be put to good use by improving on their research and development .
In this competitive society , in order to progress , a country must invest in the research and development industry .
It is true that the quality of lives of the aged will improve but that does not help in boosting the economy of the country .
One good example of a country benefitting from research and development would be Japan .
Statistics have shown that in 1987 , around 33 percent of computer related patents in the United States were Japanese , as were 30 percent of aviation related patents and 26 percent of communication patents .
Not only  does the country economy benefit , it helps the country to keep on developing and moving forward so as to catch up with  Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so as to let the other areas of the country's development advance which will result in animproved economy .
Lastly , policies have been implemented by  countries to help the aged .
In Singapore , the government has enforced individual savings through mandatory Central Provident Funds (CPF) , which mandates that the population saves for old age .
However , people might argue that the aged have their children to depend on  , but this dependence is straining on family ties as average health care costs rise .
Having a saving fund for them would be a better choice .
Hence , by having this CPF scheme , the government is able to cut down on  spending on the aged and  put it to better use by diverting it to  other areas of the country's development , thus improving the country's economyeconomy of the country
In conclusion , public spending should be limited and money diverted to  other areas of a country's development . .
Through research and development and having the correct policies , a country not only will take care of their aged , it will also improve its economy .
This will not only help the current aged , it will also enable the present generation to be able to enjoy healthy and fulfilling lives into their sunset years without putting a heavy burden on their children and grandchildren .
To a large extent , current policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Being one of the top aging populations in Asia , Singapore has to be prepared for the challenges to be faced currently  ,or in the future , when Singapore turns into a prominent ageing society .
In order to take care of the challenges , the Singapore government has implemented several policies  ,such as housing , health and employment policies , to overcome the obstacles of the aging phenomenon as well as to provide  .
One of the policies is the housing policy , which strongly encourages extended families by providing incentives and  elderly-friendly housing for  senior citizens .
A report bythe Government of Singapore 2000 , shows that in the year 2000 , around 9 out of 10 senior citizens who were above sixty-five years old were living together with their children (Government of Singapore 2000) .
This may due to the various housing schemes which resulted in a high rate of elderly staying with their children .
Some of the housing schemes implemented by the Housing Development Board (HDB)  include the Multi-Tier Housing Scheme , the Joint Selection Scheme , and the CPF Housing Grant Scheme (Kalyani K . Mehta , 2002) .
The Multi-Tier Housing Scheme iwas introduced to encourage married children to live together under one roof with their parents or vice versa .
This scheme allows extended-family applicants to be given priority allocation on the flats they want to live in .
The Joint Selection Scheme  allows families to choose the flats in priority order so that  married children and parents can stay in separate HDB flats but close together ,  in the same neighboring town or estate (Kalyani K . Mehta , 2002) .
Finally , the CFP Grant Scheme was also introduced to encourage married children to live near their parents by offering a higher grant if their flat is near their parents' home compared to those who are either staying alone  , or not staying close to their parents .
Apart from these schemes , Singapore is also trying hard to create an elderly-friendly environment by: modifying lifts to stop on every floor;using non-slip floor tiles to minimize the danger of elderly people slipping and falling; having support hand bars in toilets; installing alert alarm systems; and building  ramps and link ways to facilitate wheelchair access .
Housing schemes and building an elderly-friendly environment would definitely allow the elderly to live more comfortably 
Health care policies for the aged have been getting noticed in recent years .
The government has been aggressively promoting awareness of health care issues among the ageing society .
For instance , old people who do not have any health care indemnity have been advised to have  Medishield accounts with support given from the government (Chan , Angelique 2002) .
This account permits individuals to pay for their medical bills .
Besides , the government helps in subsidizing health screening programs for senior citizens .
A person aged over 60 is allowed to perform a basic health-screening test with just S$5 (Kalyani K . Mehta , 2002) .
Despite having various schemes for health care  , there are still numerous  underprivileged senior citizens who cannot afford their medical expenses especially for  prolonged illnesses such as strokes and rheumatism .
Thus the Medifund was established to provide aid for those who are unable to pay for healthcare services (Ministry of Health ,2010) .
Needy patients are hence , able to apply and use this fund to pay for their healthcare services .
In general , healthcare policies have been contributing a lot to meet the needs of the 'aged Singaporeans' .
Last but not least , it is important to make the elderly an asset to Singapore's society by giving senior citizens who are physically capable the opportunity to work .
The government has started to put emphasis on the re- training of the older workers to work more efficiently and productively (Chan , Angelique 2002) .
Not only that , the government has also extended the retirement age of  individuals .
This permits the aged population to continue serving society and also in certain ways helps to build confidence in the elderly .
In conclusion , the Singapore government has seriously looked into the needs of its senior citizens and the challenges faced in terms of aging population by implementing policies to ease the aging process .

Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
There are many aspects in  society that require the country's resources . , for example , spending on Education , Healthcare , Research and Development .
It has been acknowledged that the aging population will require a large portion of a country's budget to support various welfare programmes .
This will in turn be a burden for any country to bear .
Thus  spending on the aged is necessary yet it should be carefully limited so as not to compromise other sectors and overall national interest in the long run .
In any case , a lopsided spending will only compromise progress for other sectors which in turn will lead to other social and economic problems .
First , Education spending is a long term investment that a country cannot neglect .
If the budget over emphasizes on the aged , this will result in insufficient funding for Education  , greatly compromising the academic intelligence of the younger generation .
This will create a huge economic cost to the country .
When the population is less educated , the country's general growth declines , , especially in the area of Research and Development that requires highly educated personnel to function .
The correlation between economic growth and spending on the aged must be understood .
With economic growth , the budget available will increase and the government can afford to spend the same portion of the budget yet providing a larger real sum .
Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer (2005) mentioned that with economic growth , there will be a lower demand for government handouts and there will be more funds made available for elderly welfare programmes .
Thus education , which helps to sustain future economic growth , is an aspect where  spending on the aged must be carefully limited in order to prevent any compromise .
Secondly , Research and Development  engages in tertiary scientific and technical studies and in turn will bring about new discoveries or innovations to current technology .
This will cause the growth of new industries and constantly keep the country's technological level at thecutting edge of innovation .
In Singapore's case it heavily depends on the ever advancing technology to create new industries and job opportunities .
Therefore ,  , Research and Development spending must be guaranteed so as to ensure the country's economic growth in the future . 
Certain objections must of course be considered This point of view seems a logical argument for the government to plunge in more money for the aged .
However , Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer (2005) mentioned that with economic growth , the aged population has more ability to fend for themselves either by getting employment or through children's support .
This information should be treated as a means of relief to the government's handouts .
During good times , if the elderly can fend for themselves , then this would greatly lessen the load on the country's budget .
Taking note that showing appreciation and wholesomely indulging in unrealistic spending are not the same .
To conclude , the role of government in providing assistance to the elderly , either to show its appreciation or simply to those who are in need , cannot be denied .
Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer (2005) , point out that a group of uneducated or single elderly remains vulnerable as they did not have the means to save up for a decent retirement when they were working .
But it should be remembered  that while  sympathy and appreciation for the aged must remain , it must not be overdone because there are more than just the aged to look after .
Thus spending on the aged is necessary  , however , it should be carefully limited so as not to compromise other sectors and overall national interest in the long run .
In this modern era , ageing populations have become a phenomenon in many countries , especially those which hold records of past baby boom and present low fertility rates , like Singapore and Japan .
This rising trend in the median age of the population has drawn much attention to the welfare benefits of the elderly .
While liberals view social welfare as a legitimate function of government and provision of welfare as citizens' rights , it can be argued that the welfare state may end up heading towards a 'bottomless pit'- one which requires relentless public spending , in this case , on the aged and is indifferent to a person's capability in attaining self-sufficiency .
Also , to ensure a nation's continual economic growth and social development , much of the fiscal earnings  should be utilized on other areas like investments and education .
Therefore to maintain a healthy balance between various demands and to reduce dependency , , there should be a boundary set on the public expenditure for care for the elderly .
To begin with ,  the fact that public funding is not infinite must be recognized .
In fact , an ageing population itself will make the matter worse , as there is a "growing number of elderly persons (being) supported by relatively fewer younger persons"  (Peterson , 2001) .
This implies a possible fall in fiscal earnings through taxations .
As such should the government be spending more or even lavishly on building care for the elderly ?This could be significantly depriving other areas for development , for example ,the economic sector due to the shortage of funds for investments , and the social environment due to the limited resources for enhancing the quality of living , to name a few .
Critics  may point out that higher taxation rates will be able to increase fiscal earnings .
Nevertheless , such measures would fend off new immigrants (who are needed to make up the shrinking population) , and may even propel citizens away from their homeland Absence of these talents and labour would keep back potential investments by foreign companies (Peh , 2006) and hence have adverse effects on the economy .
Thus , this is not a pragmatic approach .
In fact , the development of other sectors may bring about economic growth , which could possibly drive higher fiscal earnings to facilitate eldercare policies .
Restrictions should therefore be imposed on  public expenditure on the aged due to competition for funds by other sectors  .
Moreover in today's context , many nations are advocating early preparation for retirement  .
In the case of Singapore , the government implements a compulsory savings scheme , the Central Provident Fund  (CPF) to help its citizens start accumulating assets and savings upon entering the workforce .
Pro-family policies and regulations , like the Maintenance of Parents Act , also help to reinforce social obligations in children to take care of their aged parents  (Peterson , 2001) .
This ensures that the majority , if not all of the aged would be financially independent  Therefore the area that the public sector should take care of is the psychological needs of the elderly upon entering their twilight years .
Facing loneliness and empty-nest syndrome , the elderly  require social support  .
Hence , building of eldercare infrastructure like day-care centres and hospices to deliver special care and attention is vital .
Also , financial aid would only be given to those without family support , through the Public Assistance Scheme .
As compared to a welfare-state that provides pensions indiscriminately to all , such as comprehensive approach would demand less public expenditure on the aged and thus funds allocated should be limited accordingly .
Nevertheless , some may argue that it  one's "entitlement" to receive a pension and other forms of material benefits upon retirement  (Fernandez , 1994) .
To deprive one of his privileges is an inhumane act .
However , this may create an impression that one can rely on the state during old-age , and result in the sapping of  incentives to work and save for retirement  .
Since an ageing population would translate into a growing number of 'beneficiaries' , the figures of public expenditure would thus be expected to multiply and eventually become such a vast amount that it could go beyond the financial capability of the welfare state societies .
To avoid such social repercussions , free-flow expenditure on eldercare that can draw individual dependency on the nation should be prohibited . .
On the whole , public spending on the aged should not be made at the expense of the progress of other sectors .
Also , restrictive expenditure will avert the formation of "welfare dependency" but promote the building of a "compassionate society" through family-centred policies  (Chua , 1993) .
The concept of a welfare-state should be especially avoided in countries with scarce resources like Singapore , because in times of financial difficulties , they will have no resources to tap on but have  to rely solely on themselves (Clasen , 2001) .To be on the safe side , policy-makers should allocate fiscal earnings in a diverse manner , and not solely on maintaining the aged .
It is undeniable that the world population is ageing regardless of how obsessed humans are about the  .
Hence , an ageing population is  In fact , it is a real world phenomenon faced prominently in the twenty-first century by many developed as well as developing countries , with some exceptions in only a few under-developed countries like the Middle East and North Africa where the youth population is bulging (Dhillon , 2008) .
The main reason lies in the advancement of research and technology , which conveys the message of the importance of living a healthier lifestyle by avoiding excess food consumption , smoking , liberal sex .
Therefore , humans tend to live longer and the ageing population is rising at an increasing rate regardless of how developed their nation is .
In the World Population Ageing  report 1950-2050  ,prepared by Population Division of the United Nations ,  it is stated that Europe , a region which comprises mainly of first world countries , has the highest proportion of the aged in the world .
Europe is about to have 37 percent of its population to be 60 years and above by 2050 .
This is certainly a very large demographic number for the governing states to deny support because public spending , on the aged , if limited , will incur more disadvantages than advantages , not only to the aged who will be directly affected , but also to the overall society as a whole due to the fact that  members in  society interact with one another .  
Diversion of public spending to other areas of the country's development , instead of on the aged is a doubtful policy to maintain regional political stability .
Most nations practise democracy that conducts general elections through which a population chooses an individual to hold the formal office (The Indian Express Limited , 2009) .
Firstly , limiting public spending on the aged will definitely cause disparity on the principle of democracy itself , where the aged are denied their freedoms and rights to be supported by the government although they are the rightful citizens who play the role of voting in the government .
because the aged are provoked and  to vote for a ruling government who marginalize them .
Hence , age is a necessary factor for the voters .
Research has shown that young people in India are less likely to vote and the elderly are most likely to vote (Joshi , 2009) .
Additionally , Japan ,where 20 percent of its population is 65 years or older (Reuters , 2007)  Political parties are less likely to ignore this essential category of voters in order for them to succeed in the elections .
Secondly , Mark L . Haas of Duquesne University argues that a disproportionately high number of  young people in a society along with high rates of unemployment creates strong grievances against current political conditions  .
He cited  research showing that population ageing has been a source of political stability and economic development in many regions .
In other words , the world's ageing population has the potential to defuse the war on terrorism .
Diverting funds from the aged to other forms of development will allow growing levels of poverty within the rising ageing population , thus creating shaky grounds for the country's political stability , and also 
Moreover , it is unclear who will truly take care of the aged after the government retreats from providing  There should be some organizations which hold as much capital as the government and willingly play a larger role than the government .
The private sector may be the best alternative to support the aged collectively and to take charge of their economy .
However , it is a form of investment that portrays  forms of risk .
The aged are vulnerable  failed investments and the poorer elderly may not be well protected as they do not possess much capital .
The opportunity to obtain aged care support and services will be  limited if they are provided by the private for profit sectors rather than the private not-for-profit sectors (McIntosh , 2003) .
Apart from this , non-profit organizations like social workers , have lesser incentives to provide  sustainable and constant assistance to the aged  , since their duties diverge to other social groups as well , such as the orphans , homeless teenagers , single mothers and others .
Therefore , the adult children of the aged seem like the most plausible individuals to provide for their parents .
Nevertheless , in a capitalistic society , public goods are getting more expensive due to repeated economic downturns over the years .
The act of depending on a child's filial obligation will instill greater social and financial pressures on them when  Besides , there will also be psychological effects of limiting public spending on the aged too .
Realising that the government will not support the aged in a sustainable way , the younger generation will prefer to save up money for their own means when they get old , rather than spending it on their parents .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited and c .  For example , public spending should be spent on the aged under a better mechanism through more practical efforts like encouraging the aged to be productive if they are still capable of providing their knowledge and wisdom .
Some jobs that the government can monitor to protect our senior citizens from being discriminated against are in agriculture , working from home , consultancy , teaching , making handicrafts , and gardening ,  .
This  helps to increase the country's productivity among the aged and the aged are still able to sustain their basic means of living .
Besides , the 50-plus population of the world is both a production power as a working force and a purchasing power as a consumer force .
The combination of these forces can yield economic growth and not the stagnation that some predict (Novelli , 2003) .
Denying support for them on the other hand , will further result in a nation with social , political and economic disparities .
The aging problem is an important issue that governments areworrying about .
Peterson (2001) even claims that the aging problem will worsen as the median age of the elderly will reach around 50 by 2050 in many first world countries .
This prediction is further supported by a survey conducted by the World Bank ,  .
With the growing population of the elderly , governments have put in a lot of effort , by providing financial assistance and grants for example , in order to ease the issue effectively .
However , some people disagree with the government's policy and claim that there is a need to limit  public spending on the aged so thatt the money is diverted to other areas to attain a balanced  economic and social development .
Moreover , it can also be argued that the government's approach is not a good remedy to cope with the aging problem permanently .
Public spending on the elderly should be limited .
Some people may argue that limited public spending on the elderly  .
The aged have contributed a lot to form and shape  society .
Limiting public spending has a deeper meaning , that the government doesn't acknowledge their contributions to the country .
However , this is not entirely true since spending money on other suitable sectors may be a better and perhaps permanent solution to solve this aging problem .
Education is a good example that helps to solve this issue more effectively .
It ensures that the young generation is well educated , full of knowledge and able to think critically .
This may indirectly help them to think and spend wisely in their future so that they are less dependent on the government as their future is financially secured .
Besides , instilled moral values remind them of the importance of taking up the filial obligation with  their parents .
Moreover , it benefits more citizens rather than the elderly .
For example , it actually helps to ease the poverty problem since the lack of formal education among the poor contributes to the poverty issue directly .
Hence , public spending on the education should be stressed as well since it helps to solve the aging issue more effectively , rather than keeping on spending money on the elderly 
Secondly , public spending on social work professional associations and related organizations should not be neglected .
Social work aims at restructuring society , such that a more balanced society is attained , where no single citizen becomes the victim of  economic development .
It also helps to solve  existing social problems and provides support to the needy .
Without the Singaporean government (Ministry of Community Development and Sport) providing funds and subsidies to these organizations , some of them might not be able to survive and continue operating , especially during the economic downturn which has has badly hit Singapore recently .
Moreover , public spending on this sector has a deeper meaning as well .
It acknowledges the contribution of these organizations and encourages them to keep providing help to those in need so that more people will be beneficial from the programs .
Besides , it helps to solve other social issues than justthe aging problem .
Hence , public spending on this sector should be increased so that a balanced and more structured society is formed and a more rigid social safety net is provided .
With the economic downturn , job opportunities have decreased This is shown in  statistics  from the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore , which state that the unemployment rate has risen by 1 .2% , which was from 3 .6% in December of 2008 to 4 .8% in March 2009 .
Therefore , public spending on industrial and related sectors which provide more job opportunities for people who have been affected during this harsh period should be stressed equally .
Besides , some elderly still wish to continue working as a result of insufficient savings and the increasing cost of living .
More job opportunities may help them indirectly .
Besides , increased unemployment rates contribute to a lot of social problems which may threaten the social security of the country .
Moreover , development in this sector helps to boost the economics of a country and hence public spending is increased directly to involve and help more people in need .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited .
It does not mean that the government doesn't take good care of the elderly or doesn't acknowledge their contributions in the past .
However , from another  perspective , the money diverted to other areas or sectors such as industry , tourism , social work professional associations and education , help to form a more rigid and structured society .
Moreover , public spending on these areas has a wider coverage rather than focusing only on the aged .
Hence , for a better future , public spending on the aged should be limited .
The aging issue  worldwide was not pressing until  the large population of the Baby Boomers generation began to welcome their golden years .
As medical facilities and technologies have continued to evolve , so have the lifespan of  modern mortals prolonged .
Global life expectancy at birth , which is estimated to have risen from 58 years in 1970-1975 to 67 years in 2005-2010 , is expected to keep on rising to reach 75 years in 2045-2050 (United Nations , 2007) .
Demographic changes due to the rapid aging population will post serious consequences on health issues as well as the economy of the country .
In recognition of this problem , current policies as well as research and development that have been implemented has yielded to ease the aging process .
An aging population is often associated with a decline in the workforce and the productivity of the country .
For example , Denton and Spencer (1998) noted that the rate of growth  per capita GDP is certain to fall significantly over the coming decades unless either the immigration rate or the productivity growth rate increases  dramatically .
It is the ageing of the population that lies behind this concern (as cited in Scarth , 2002) .
Therefore , policies such as Angel Policy 1989 , New Angel Policy 1999 and the "Angel Plan , Plus-One" 2003 , have been introduced and implemented in  Japan to increase the birthrate and expand the workforce of the future as to maintain productivity of the country (Cardiosk , 2008)(Devasahayam , Yeoh , 2007)  .
The size of tomorrow's economy and tax base  should be increased by raising more productive children so that the cost burden is spread over a larger and more affluent future generation (Peterson , 2001) .
Another alternative carried out by Japan is to use their advancement in science and technology to curb the aging issues by using robots in their workforce .
Japan has innovatively modified robots to put them in production lines and the service industry  as substitutes for their aging workforce .
These two measures have attempted to reduce the reliance of the workforce on the aging population and to soothe the pressing matter of the aging population .
The health care system has also been given high priority to cater to the needs of the aging population .
For instance in Singapore , besides building new hospitals such as the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun and the Jurong General Hospital , the authorities have taken a big stride by building a link between  hospitals and community hospitals where patients can receive treatment at the  and then recuperate at the community hospital .
In this way , the elderly obtain appropriate care aat the same time as lowering health care and freeing up beds in hospitals for more critical cases which need to be treated ("Healthcare system to be reconstructed" , 2009) .
This scenario maximizes efficiency as government hospitals will be able to deliver high quality medical skills and the community hospitals will be able to tend to patients' psychology and social needs better .
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted in the National Rally Day speech 2009 , that the best way to keep health care costs down is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle .
In the agenda to help the elderly maintain a healthy lifestyle , Wellness Programme was launched in 12 constituencies in 2008 with the aim of allowing senior citizens to undergo health screening , fitness assessments and to participate in physical activities ("Wellness Programme popular" , 2009) .
Wellness Centres organizevarious activities for their elderly members , such as intellectual pursuit , physical activities and also activities to expand their social networking .
Cheerful and happy elderly people , who are satisfied and contented mentally and physically from the activities designed for them , are less susceptible to illnesses , preventing the need for long term care , keeping the cost of healthcare maintenance low and resulting in a happier aging process .
The implementation of the Maintenance of Parents Act in 1995 was said to be against Singapore's Confucianism idealistic norm  and controversial in a filial piety orientated society .
As a matter of fact , according to Kalyani K . Mehta , to meet further challenges of population aging , the Maintenance of Parents Act was implemented to deal with anticipated problems related to the social and health care of older persons .
This social policy imposes a legal obligation on children to maintain their parents to deal with and prevent problems related to the neglect of elderly parents .
Also , the Central Provident Fund of Singapore (CPF)   ,that was first introduced in 1955 , is actually a social security savings plan where the overall scope and benefits of CPF revolve around retirement , healthcare , home ownership , family protection and asset enhancement ("Singapore Central Provident Fund - CPF") .
In the early days , employees could only withdraw money from the Central Provident Fund when they retire however , in 1984 , a new scheme known as the Medisave was introduced , so .
In addition to Medisave , MediShield which is a medical insurance scheme was introduced in  1990 in order to help  members to sustain and pay for long term medical expenses which arise from serious illness .
A new strategy , Eldershield , implemented in September 2002 , is a special insurance scheme that provides coverage for disability , especially in old age due to the lengthening of the life span of Singaporeans (Kalyani K . Mehta) .
All these policies aim to lessen the financial burden on the elderly to provide them with security in their sunset years .
Although  given the support and coordination between the government , Voluntary Welfare Organizations (VWO) , the community and individuals  , the aging process in various countries is believed to be able to be eased , if not overcome .
When life expectancy increases , the the aging population also increases as people live longer .
According to the Top Ten list (Compare Infobase Limited , 2006) on the countries which have the highest life expectancy at Birth Year 2004 , Australia falls in  5th position at 80 .2% , while Singapore moves up to the 4th position at 80 .5% .
Research has shown that improvements in health and welfare increase life expectancy .
Therefore ,  current research and development/policies have helped to ease the  with people living longer as compared to the past .
In the case of Singapore , PM Lee spoke on the National Day Rally 2009 about the need to restructure the health-care system to serve more elderly patients .
The government has taken some measures to deal with the reality of the aging society For example , more   , like the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in the North and the Jurong General Hospital in the West , have been built to cater to more elderly patients .
Building more community hospitals is also vitall to the elderly as community hospitals  can provide lower costs and special care for  elderly patients to recuperate after being discharged from General Hospitals .
The Ren Ci Community Hospital for example , is affiliated to Tan Tock Seng General Hospital , and St . Andrew's Community Hospital is affiliated to Changi General Hospital .
Therefore , elderly patients can go to Ren Ci Hospital or St . Andrew's Hospital to recuperate until they have fully recovered .
The hospital also provides many activities like Karaoke sessions and  performances by volunteers to cheer up the elderly patients to help them in their early recovery .
Other charity organisations like the NKF , TOUCH Community Services , and The Salvation Army are  help the elderly by having different types of programmes or services ranging from rehabilitationto counselling .
A special  trained pool of doctors , nurses , social workers and caregivers are employed to cater to patients special needs
Although hospitals are built to cater for the elderly and medical science is advancing , the most critical issue is still  the high medical cost that patients and families have to worry about .
To tackle this issue , the government has introduced policies  like the CPF which consists of the Ordinary Account , Special Account and the 3Ms , which include Medisave , MediShield and Medifund Account , to prepare the citizens for their retirement .
When the citizens of Singapore turn  55 , they can withdraw their savings from their CPF .
Besides that , the CPF can also be used to buy a house , cover hospital expenses or for  education fees .
Medifund caters more to help the needy in paying for their outstanding medical bills .
As a result , the government sees fewer cases of residents unable to afford healthcare and  social medical workers have reported that Medifund is enough to cover hospital bills . 
Community Centres and Resident Committee Centres have also been built in different areas of Singapore to provide recreational activities and programmes for the elderly to participate in .
Infrastructures such as elderly friendly facilities outside HDB flats or in the parks have also been specially built for the elderly to encourage them to exercise and keep fit .
Although not all elderly people would be willing to use the facilities or take part in activities , the centres advertise the activities through banners and flyers or even the mass media to encourage the elderly to be active and healthy .
Five companies (Philips Applied Technologies , Corventis Inc , Robotronics Land Pte Ltd , >60 Design Centre at Temasek Polytechnic and Eubiq Pte Ltd , and ADT Security Services) have been awarded grants amounting to S$500 ,000 to develop products for the elderly(Wong Siew Ying , CNA , 7 Aug 2008) .
One invention is the Care Alert System which allows the elderly to call for assistance at the press of a button .
Other inventions like robots speaking in the same languages as the elderly , to remind them to take their medications , and robots acting as care-givers to support the elderly are also sold in the market .
Japan has invented robots to help the elderly with their physical and emotional needs .
For example , Paro , a cooing baby harp seal robot fitted with sensors beneath its fur and whiskers , has been developed by Japan's Intelligent System Co , to soothe patients in hospitals and nursing homes (Alan Taylor , 4 March 2009) .
Even though new products like robots have been invented families with lower incomes may not be able to afford these extra luxuries .
However , these are just extra solutions to help the elderly and bring more convenience to families who can afford them .
Another more practical solution is the introduction of housing grants by the HDB for families who want to live near their parents .
It encourages adult married children to live near their parents so that they can take care of them and attend to their parents' needs conveniently .
The government also encourages adult children to take care of their own parents by pushing filial piety values on them , as there is a limit to how much the government can help the elderly because resources like land and workforce are very limited in Singapore .
However in some cases where children are unfilial , the government has introduced the "Parents Maintenance Act Law" , to help solve the problem of unfilial children by making them support their elderly parents in a form of paying them a monthly allowance .
In addition to the fear of  the government also introduced different policies to help  in other areas like ensuring work security in women who are on maternity leave , baby bonuses and children's Edusave education funds .
The WDA has also come up with retraining and upgrading programmes to ensure and encourage people to hold on to their jobs .
However , there is still the problem of a growing aging population due to low birth rates .
In order to deal with this problem , the government has opened up doors to foreign workers to work in Singapore so that they can help increase the workforce productivityCompanies can also employ more care-givers to help the elderly .
Besides attracting foreign workers , the government has also come up with campaigns and more incentives for married couples to give birth to more children so as to help ease the aging process .
From birth to the death , man has experienced huge change continuously which is called the aging process and as a result , our society has became older and older .
Not only man , the world has been changing continuously especially in the economic sector which is the most important part of making a living .
Thanks to  economic growth , people may escape from worries about hunger and poverty but do they feel insecure about their future when they imagine that they are in their 70's or 80's ?
Though the world economy has prospered dramatically for about a century , it doesn't seem to have a place for the old the focus is on achieving hasty economic growth .
Firstly , the fundamental flow of a modern economy is market capitalism in which most of the economic assets and system are owned by the private sector , not the public sectorand government .
The owner of a property always tries to seek profit from that so their basic needs to live are considered as means of making money .
The problem starts from here .
For instance , if  health insurance belongs to an individual for  people should pay a lot more to see a doctor and get a prescription This causes problems for old people as they do not earn after retirement but have to visit hospital more frequently than before (Peterson ,2001) .
As the market economy brings about the private ownership of basic elements for living , the  faces distress .
Secondly , the silver labor market should be considered because OECD(2005) reported that  around 2050 , the old will consist of one sixth of the total population .
However , in reality , it is quite difficult to get a job after retirement and the quality of job is not enough to make a living .
Take Korea as an example ,  its government is trying to create employment for the old .
Although the Korean government is making new jobs for elderly people they tend to be low status jobs like security guards or delivery men .
and the salary for silver labor is too small .
This is because the current economic system looks for a more efficient and competitive work force  and the companies that hire the old don't consider the elderly and try to avoid engaging them .
As a result , the existing alternative plan for  increasing aging population employment is not effective 
Thirdly , it can be argued that people have achieved huge economic growth and the product of that accomplishment results in an upgrading of living standards without uncertainty for the future .
Needless to say , Singapore's GDP shows  economic improvement  every year .
Despite  this progress ,  .
Because the economy always encourages people to spend all of their money on new products and services and not on saving , people are not used to saving something for the future .
A concrete example is credit cards .
To get a drastic expansion of the consumption for economic growth , the market created the credit card which can distribute  current consumption to the future to reduce the present burden .
The aim of this may be good , but this has led to the credit crisis where people suffer from  financial difficulties .
In a nut shell , the economy only cares about profit , people cannot prepare for the future by saving and finally , the old may experience financial hardship .
Definitely , the economy becomes bigger every moment and it offers a lot of advantages , for example , people don't have to worry about starving or a lack of food .
However for some people , this benefit is just  The marginal protection for the old is now  Besides , the old had no chance to prepare for the future by saving .
For these reasons , from the aging population point of view , economic improvement  hasn't eased the aging process .
To ease this process , the economy should consider excluding people , the old of the society and let them know how to prepare for a stable and comfortable future   .
An Ageing population is a problem encountered by many countries today .
To date , elderly aged over 65 constitutes 8 .6% of the total population in Singapore , which will see an expected rise to 18 .7% in  2030 .
Such a significant trend has led many to worry about the problems associated with this phenomenon , hence the government has initiated certain policies and developments aimed at helping the elderly .
Although these initiatives are beneficial for the aged , the government should consider limiting public spending on them to divert money to other areas such as education and development in Singapore .
Spending on the aged should be kept to a smaller proportion as compared to areas such as education .
The younger generations should be the focus and not the aged as they are the ones who will up keep Singapore's standing in the near future .
Prime Minister Lee (2009) at a dialogue with Nanyang Technological University students took the stand  that local students should build networks with the rest of the world and integrate in new environment in order to "push the boundaries" and break new grounds for Singapore .
Hence , plans by the ministry should be made to foster greater interaction between local students and international students .
Money should be given to aid needy students who will then not be deprived of a chance to participate in Exchange programs administered by the institution .
These programs enrich a student's soft skills , which is essential for their ability to lead the country in time to come .
Singapore , having one of the top education systems ,should continue it's reputation , and the government should divert money spent on the aged to  refining students who are the future leaders of Singapore .
Singapore's tourism sector is a lucrative field which has contributed greatly to the country's economic success .Therefore , the the government should divert money on the aged to this thriving industry .
Since 1996 , the number of tourists coming to Singapore has been increasing steadily with an estimated $14 .8 billion tourist received in 2008 .
Tourism has made a significant contribution in creating more jobs for locals and with the upcoming Marina Sands project ,  thousands of jobs for Singaporeans are expected to be created in this period of economic downturn .
Also , the tourism sector has made huge contributions to Singapore's economy , with an estimated $230 billion in 2007 .
All these benefits brought about by tourism must not be underestimated .
Thus , the government has to continue improving on its infrastructure and developments for tourism and tourists so as to remain on a competitive edge with other Asian countries .
Hence , funds spent on the aged should be limited in lieu of spending it on more beneficial areas for the country .
Critics have validated the spending on aged by arguing for the role which the elderly hold in building and molding Singapore to where it is now .
These efforts must not be neglected and hence , government should provide for them now that they have turned economically inactive .
On the contrary , though these elderly have contributed to Singapore's success , focus should be turned to family support and care for the elderly instead .
'Hardware' has been constructed to facilitate the aged in their daily lives; 'heart-ware' should be proliferated instead .
"heart-ware" means giving emotional support to the agedand providing unconditional love and respect for them .
Instead of channeling money to be spent on building hardware for the aged , more should be done to foster closer relationships between the young and old .
Teo (2009) believes  that people should treat the elderly they way that they want to be treated when they are old .
the government cannot coerce 'heart- ware' on the young; instead they can be influenced and taught  in school when they are young .
Therefore , public spending should be limited as 'hardware' has been built for the aged and focus should be placed on the intangible 'heart- ware' for the elderly instead .
The aged still remain as a figure of respect .
However , instead of hanging onto the past , Singaporeans have to look ahead and plan for the future journey .
The government should reduce the proportion of funds spent on aged facilities and divert it to  education and tourism development as these two fields will enable the continual growth for this small nation dependent on it's labor force .
Many countries experience population aging .
In fact , nowadays Singapore's population is aging too and it is one of the fastest aging populations in Asia .
There are several developed countries such as Japan , the US and Singapore predicting that educated aging boomers will have longer life expectancies than the generations that preceded them .
It is estimated that by 2050 , Singapore's median age will move from 36 to 54 , similar to Japan and Italy .
Recent studies have shown that Singapore has a low rate of population growth due to the declination of birth rates .
Many young couples think that having a baby is too expensive in Singapore .
This situation is not getting any better as more of the population ages .
Thus , there will be fewer younger generations to look after aged people in the future .
In addition , an aging population causes a decrease in the workforce .
The decrease will be prominent when the baby boomers reach their retirement age and there will be fewer younger people to replace them .
In such a case , Singapore faces the challenge of developing public policies to accommodate the trend of aging and to gear up for a growing aging population .
Nevertheless , immigration policy is feasible to cope with an aging population .
Immigration policy has helped to ease the aging process .
It has been adopted by many countries especially in Singapore , which faces a serious population challenge .
Notwithstanding  a viable policy , Singapore citizens feel that these new immigrants and foreigners might not benefit them because they will face even more intense competition in the workforce .
However , if Singapore does not adopt immigration  , it will face manpower shortfalls .
As  more elderly people retire from the work field  , this causes a lack of productivity in the workforce as well as a labour shortage .
Subsequently , a labour shortage  will have a negative impact on the economy as it slows the country's economic growth .
In future years , the economic burden will be increased tremendously due to the aging labour force .
Nevertheless , these problems could be eliminated as the influx of foreigners through immigration will satisfy the needs of the labour market and  boost the economy with improved labour productivity .
Immigration is a possible solution to easing the aging process .
It can help to sustain the overall population size .
Admitting more immigrants will help to replenish the country's aging population in the years ahead .
For example , the government of Singapore has introduced several measures to boost the fertility rate .
One of which is immigration  , which has attracted many immigrants mainly from China , India , and Malaysia to integrate into  society and  has helped to raise the fertility rate .
In effect , more productive children will be raised and there will be sufficient numbers of younger generations to replace those of the older generations as they retire .
Moreover , since there are more young people engaged in the workforce , the elderly in later life will  as they will be supported by the younger generations .
Immigration  is a practical solution adopted by developed countries with aging societies , namely , Singapore , the USA and China .
Nonetheless , some countries are exclusively independent without relying upon immigration to sustain population growth .
For instance ,  Japan is facing a population crisis as they have the lowest birth rate in the world .
However , Japan is not yet ready to open the country's door to immigrants and the rigidness of Japan's immigration laws has been seen even until now .
As a result , it will lead to the economic problems associated with its graying population .
The shrinking of the labour force and the lack of vitality for the workforce will happen in the near future .
Therefore , Japan needs to ease up on its immigration laws by allowing more foreigners to immigrate in order to solve the problems .
In conclusion , coping with an aging population will require a long term effort and it is a challenge to a country .
However , this challenge could help to ease the aging process in the long run by adopting immigration  .
Despite it , the government should not only focus on a particular policy in order to resolve the aging problems .
There are others policies that should be taken into consideration , including; family policy , later retirement for the elderly , and promoting healthy life styles for resolving problems posed by aging process .
, the government should encourage older population to live an active aging life .
If they are encouraged to be productive , they can be economic contributors as well .
The elderly , who prepare well and early for old age will be more ready for retirement  , then the present generations of people will be able to enjoy meaningful and happy lives without relying or putting a burden on their children .
The Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports(2009) showed that at least 1 out of the 5 people will be 65 or older in 2030 .
A similar estimation of population is expected to exist in the States .
As for Japan , at least 1 out of 4 people will be 65 and above by 2055(Tiresias ,2009) .
This alarming statistic has rang a bell about the importance of the public to spend their wealth on the needs of the aged .
This essay will address the scope of  which is the appropriate amount of resources that public should spend on the vulnerable group .
Not all the aged need financial help as these people may well be taken care of by their children .
Although aging issues are prevalent in both developed and developing countries , these issues are more pressing in developed countries .
The developing countries , on the other hand , should invest their public spending on areas such as education and law and order before they can address the issue of the aging population .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be maximized in developed countries , while public spending in the developing countries should be utilized to help to reduce societal problems . 
The aged need money to cover  their extensive bills , that range from medical purposes to other basic necessities .
In Singapore , it is not uncommon to see the aged working in sectors that are shunned  by the young .
One significant example is the cleaning industry .
It is true that the aged are able to support themselves by being financially independent .
However , they receive low salaries , which can hardly cover the increasing cost of their medical bills .
Medical technologies have developed to be more advanced and sophisticated over the years .
Thus , the cost of medical treatment is considered as expensive by the aged especially those who hold low-income jobs or who live alone without the support of the family .
This group should be categorized as the vulnerable group .
Therefore , it is timely for the public to spend their wealth on this group .
The vulnerable group should apply for jobs that are registered under the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) in Ministry of Manpower .
Then , a portion of the income tax from the working individuals should be channeled to help this group .
However , those who are not under WIS will not benefit from public spending .
This is to prevent the syndicate schemes that are on the rise today .
Their target is always  this vulnerable group as they believe that it is relatively easy to manipulate them in order to gain sympathy from the public .
The vulnerable group is usually forced to sell tissue packets and other religious symbols .
Hence , it is important to ensure that the group is well-informed of the policy .
Ideally , the policy should be in four different languages to cater to the understanding of residents .
Thus , if public spending is limited , the vulnerable group will be economically disadvantaged .
Aging populations are becoming a very serious and significant problem especially in developed country where the educated and professional continue  .
Public spending should not be limited as the money can be utilized to promote campaigns that encourage the vulnerable to  stay employed .
The group is highly likely to face discrimination from the workforce .
The vulnerable may be deemed as redundant .
Although the vulnerable may be perceived as the ones with vast knowledge and experience , the young is likely not to overlook this matter .
, which is able to work quickly and productively .
Thus , one of the campaigns organized by the United Kingdom is to end the discrimination faced by the aged .
The campaign , called Help the Aged , focuses on the theme: Just Equal Treatment(2009) .
It believes that the vulnerable should be given the right to work and that  companies should abolish the concept of age restriction  .
This is the human right that individuals should be entitled to as long  .
Thus , campaigns will raise the awareness of the public to help the aged to face the discrimination that still prevails within  society .
Hence , a portion of public spending can be ideally used to spend on anti-discrimination campaigns .
Public spending in developing countries , on the other hand , should be well utilized to rectify the social problem .
In Thailand , for instance ,  social problems  need to be addressed as children are involved Chitradub (1999) .
It is crucial to help the children to break out of the vicious circle as children are the future generation to run the country .
However , children in Thailand are involved in the smuggling of drugs .
It is believed smuggling drugs are related to the issue of prostitution among children .
Berger and Glind(1999) from the Thailand Office of the National Commission on Women's Affairs reported that an estimated 40 000 children are involved in the country's lucrative  sex industry .
This is an alarming issue as the vicious circle may  worsen .
The children will shape a perception that it is not morally wrong to be involved in this industry .
Besides , the children believe that this lifestyle is one of the easiest ways to earn an astronomical amount of money .
Public spending is thus needed to rectify the perception shaped by the children , or else the problem will remain unsolved .
The spending should be used in campaigns in order to raise awareness about the importance of  basic education for children .
By doing so , the children will have an aim to excel well in their education and so will not be involved in activities that will degrade their morale values .
Therefore , public spending is needed to bring the children out of the vicious circle .
Thus , it is indeed clear that developed and developing countries have different  issues to address .
The prevailing issue needs to be resolved before the issue gets worse .
Public spending should not be limited on the vulnerable because the ageing population is becoming a worldwide issue .
The issue is similar to a pandemic , which can affect both developed and developing countries .
Although it is true that the ageing population is less severe in developing countries at present , it may not stay true for the future because globalization h The children in the developing countries who have received a quality education , may want to pursue their career in other countries with a stable and high income .
The children may want to migrate to other countries without bringing their parents along .
The social obligation , which has been instilled in the children about the responsibility to care for the parents , will be eroded .
Thus , trends in the developing countries may change in the long run .
As for now , in the developing countries , the ageing population is not much of a problem .
The majority of the people  in these countries , live in villages .
The children , who have been socially ingrained with moral values , are obligated to look after the parents .
Hence , in future , when migration issues becomes a global pandemic , the public should give a helping hand to the aged since the children will no longer take care of their needs .
The public will then need to assist them in order to reduce the burden .
In conclusion , the amount of money utilized to help to ease the burden of the aged should not be limited .
The financial burden and discrimination faced at the workforce are among the problems that the aged are going through .
There should be a level of awareness to help the aged so that they will age with dignity and pride .
This is because everyone , sooner or later will reach  the ageing stage and will want their needs to be taken care of as well .
The problems faced by the aged will be a global phenomenon .
Hence , this is where the role of public spending should come iin to play to address the needs of the aged .
In conclusion ,  public funding should be limited as it may cause the elderly to be over reliant on it .
The money should then be used elsewhere in areas such as public health that are more pressing as well as  on education and economic growth as that will also help to solve theaging population crisis .
By carefully allocating government funds ,  society will benefit as a whole .
In developed countries , problems of aging populations are surfacing and at the same time worsening .
Limitations on public spending on the aged should be warded off .
The main focus of this essay will be on developed countries .
The reason for this is because their aging population problem is much more serious as compared to developing countries .
There is a need to understand that the amount of reliance the aged have on the public is quite significant .
It is also necessary to take into account  the contributions that the aged have made , as well as to recognize the more substantial advancement in  .
Critics have commented that other areas of the country's development such as education need the money to substantiate the advancement of these particular developments so as to bring them to greater heights  .Therefore , limitations on public spending on the aged should be enforced .
However , there is the recognition of the fact that governments in developed countries have already pumped in a huge amount of money to develop the main areas of development like education and national defence .
Thus , these main areas have been well-developed .
In addition , an aging population has not been an area of concern in the past and only recently have the aged formed a significant population in developed countries .
Thus more should be spent on the aged since other areas are already so well developed that there is not really a need to use money to substantiate their advancement .
It is well known that Singapore has a world class education system .
From the past till now , Singapore has been spending a huge sum of money on the other main areas of development so as to build up the economy .
The efforts can be seen clearly as  Singapore is  now an advanced developing country  .
However the most predominant problem arising now is the aging population .
Thus public spending on the aged must not be limited as it is  problem .
Cynics have mentioned that in developed countries , quite a number of the aged are still working and receiving wages so they will have the means to pay for their living expenses and healthcare costs .
Thus public spending on the aged can be limited so that other areas like national defence can have the money to further their advancement .
However even though a significant number of the aged are still in the workforce , most of them are taking up menial jobs like cleaning which only gives them a meagre pay .
This small amount of money is hardly enough to cover their living expenses and healthcare costs as now healthcare costs are increasingly higher .
In addition , the aged are still quite vulnerable to diseases and are weak , thus public spending on the aged should not be limited so as to assist them with their healthcare costs .
The fact that the aged still need to work despite their vulnerability implies that they might be forced to work to meet their own basic needs .
This further infers that there is not enough public spending on the aged .
This is another reason why public spending should not be limited on the aged .
Developed countries are implementing measures to meet the needs of the aged .
For instance in Singapore , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong mentioned in the recent National Day Rally Speech (Goh , 2009 , para 19) that with the population rapidly graying , the Singapore government will put healthcare costs at the front and centre of its agenda .
This is a precise indication that the Singapore's government does not have the intention to limit public spending on the aged .
The main reason for this phenomenon is that money needs to be spent on the aged now so as to ease the aging process  , if not , years down the road , public spending might have to increase significantly as compared to now due to the lack of  spending on the aged .
Thus it is important to spend more now to ease the problems of aging population , if not years later , the problems of an aging population might heap up .
Engelhard (2009) mentioned that the aged are not worth the attention from the public .
They are deemed useless and with low productivity they cannot contribute significantly to society Thus society should limit their spending on the aged and shift their focus onto the young .
In time to come , the young can give back to society unlike the aged .
However  the fact that the aged were young once and  also made contributions to the society also needs to be recognized .
In fact they are the ones who laid the foundations for  the younger generations .
Without their contributions , the country may not be where and what it is now , thus it is society's responsibility to take care of them , regarding this as a repayment back to the aged .
This is like a cycle: in the past when the aged are still working they were the ones who took care of the younger generations , thus now it is the younger generation's responsibility to take care of the aged .
In Japan it is predicted that the median age is expected to increase by a decade , from just over 43 years in 2007 to more than 52 years in 2050 (Smil , 2007 , para 9)  .
This shows that public spending on the aged should not be limited as the percentage of the aged will increase significantly in time to come due to the problems arising from an aging population .
By  2055 many more people will require elderly friendly facilities .
Limitations should not be encouraged as years later the demand for elderly friendly facilities might exceed the supply of them .
Therefore it is important to spend on the aged now to ease the aging process years later .
In a nutshell , the above mentioned arguments and reasons point to the fact that public spending on the aged should not be limited as if it is limited , dire consequences  ,such as the country itself might be seen as neglecting the aged , will surface .
This might lead to foreign corporations being discouraged to invest in Singapore as Singapore might be perceived as not having an effective system .
Therefore it can be concluded that the aged should have a bigger portion of the pie that is the public spending  , while  other areas  will still have their share  
In the middle Ages , most people were lucky if they lived to be 40 years old .
By the end of the 20th century , the average life expectancy had reached the early 70s .
For most of us living today , it is not unusual for us to grow up knowing our grand parents and great-grand parents .
Some people even remember their great-great grand parents .
To a large extent , current research and development have helped to ease the aging process .
There are several reasons for this increased aging situation such as this increase in life expectancy .
Through the use of these specific reasons and examples , this essay will demonstrate why especially in the field of medicine .
Firstly , modern medicine is now able to cure or treat many diseases that were once terminal .
When the first colonists traveled to the New World during the 15th and 16th centuries , they not only carried with them novelty items like horses and guns , they also carried new diseases .
For example , smallpox , from which many Europeans were immune , decimated the native populations of America and the Caribbean because the Indians had no immunity to a disease they had never experienced before .
Today , modern medicine can even prolong the lives of people who have diseases for which this is still no cure ,such as cancer , Parkinson's disease and AIDS .
Secondly , people today are more aware of the effect of healthy living on their life expectancy .
For example , even as late at the 1950s , many people were not aware that eating too many large portions of steak and potatoes and other foods rich in carbohydrates and cholesterol could significantly increase their likelihood of a heart attack .
Also , people were not aware of the links between habits such as alcoholism and cigarette smoking and diseases such as liver disease and cancer .
Today , medical research , both traditional and holistic , stresses the importance of healthy eating and exercise in increasing one's life expectancy .
Over the years , public spending such as in the form of healthcare benefits and subsidies for the aged has increased .
This is due to developed countries having an aging population coupled with a higher cost of living .
However , the money used can be better utilized to develop other areas .
These include  education , technological research and welfare programs for the needy  .
Diverting too much of a country's budget to the aged can prove to be a heavy burden on its economy .
Welfare programs , such as free healthcare services that are introduced in some countries , do improve the quality and lifespan of the aged in those countries .
However , these welfare programs are not necessarily feasible for all countries .
It is especially not effective in small countries with a small economy like Singapore .
Firstly , funds that are needed to support these welfare programs will come from taxes on the working-age adult .
The high cost of healthcare services results in high taxation on citizens These countries like Britain and the United States generally have low Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and high public expenditure , with few exceptions like Sweden .
With a lower GDP , Sweden generates less revenue to divert to other areas of a country's development (Jonathan Eyal , 20 August 2009) .
Studies have shown that Britain's National Health Service , "devours 17 .5 per cent of Britain's annual fiscal budget , almost as much as defence and education combined Providing for the aged will therefore hinder the nation's overall development in other aspects .
The elderly in Singapore are dependent on government subsidies in various areas due to the current high cost of living .
However , public spending on the aged is only a short term solution to the problem of the aging population .
This short term solution poses  a burden to the economy without actually addressing the root of problem of the aging population in the long run .
Public spending will only continue to spiral upwards if the government is committed to healthcare spending on the aged .
The government should look at this problem from an economic perspective in the long run .
The country's budget allocation should place greater emphasis on education for the younger generation .
If the younger generation is well taken care of and educated , in the long run , they will form the working-age population and are more economically productive .
In this way , these working-age adults will form the community where money can be tapped to provide funds for the aged in future .
This long term solution of diverting the country's resources from spending on the aged to education lessens the squeeze on the already fully exploited economy .
If the government places more emphasis on the well-being of the aged instead of nurturing the younger generation , it discourages the younger generation to stay in a particular country .
The country's resources are limited .
Giving more to the elderly means a lesser proportion for the younger generations .
Fewer opportunities , in the form of job security and stability arise from less money being diverted to education and development of the economy .
This will lead to emigration and brain drain from the country , which will in turn lead it to lose/losing its competitive edge , and thus it will be less attractive to investors .
More money should be diverted to education for the development of the younger generation to deal with  .
An example is Singapore providing free education and offering one of the world's best childcare services and facilities .
However , critics may argue that the elderly have contributed their part to nation building and should not be denied access to government funds .
Nonetheless , the younger generation forms the pillar of a country's economyand more attention should be given to nurturing them . 
The issue of an an an aging population has become an increasing important issue in our society today .
The problems caused by an aging population  are increasing and it has placed great pressure on  society .
Hence , the government is paying more attention to solving these problems caused by aging population through various means .
One of them is to increase  public spending on the aged .
However , some may argue that  doing so  may limit the country's development .
Therefore , public spending  on the aged should not be limited because the issue of an aging population has become a major problem in the society .
Some may argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that it will not limit the country's development .
Other areas of the country's development are equally important and hence government funds should also be directed to  areas such as education and health care  , instead of just focusing on the aged .
Education is equally important because the young will determine the country's development in the future since they are the ones who will lead the country .
Without proper education , they will not have the ability to compete with other countries and this will hinder the country's development especially in the economic sector .
Hence , the education sector is equally important .
In addition , the healthcare sector is also very important as it can help increase the standard of living of people .
The health of the people is one of the major considerations when investors chose a country to invest in .
Hence , if the health status of the people is very low , investors may not want to invest in the country and this may affect the economic growth of the country .
Therefore , some may argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that the funds can be diverted to other areas for the country's development .
Nevertheless ,  public spending on the aged should not be limited as some of the elderly are in need of financial aid .
In the future , this problem may worsen .
Some may point out that there are increasingly more people attaining higher levels of education hence they are able to afford the increasingly expensive healthcare services (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
However , there are still a group of people who only have a low level education .
Hence , with lower incomes , they may not be able to afford the increasing healthcare services .
This problem is occurring in Singapore as there is a huge discrepancy in the education levels seen within the baby boomers .
Hence , there will be a group of people who have a lower level education and they will need financial aid in order to afford the healthcare services .
By limiting public spending on the aged , this group of people may not be able to afford the increasingly expensive healthcare services .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited .
In addition , public spending on the aged should not be limited as people have longer life expectancy as compared to the past and as a result will face larger financial health risks (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .
As people live longer , they face more health problems .
They may not be able to afford the increasingly expensive health care services .
Even the existing healthcare policies that help people to cope with the expensive healthcare services may not be sufficient .
In Singapore , the government has come up with policies such as Medisave and Medishield to prepare people by saving a portion of their salary in these accounts .
Hence , when they are ill , they are able to use these accounts to pay for their medical bills .
However , with rising costs of healthcare services , the money in these accounts may be used up quickly and therefore they will not be able to afford any more healthcare services .
Therefore , public spending on aged should not be limited .
In conclusion , even though the issue of an aging population is important ,  other areas that are essential to a country's development cannot be neglected .
Hence , public spending on the aged should not be limited . .
The aging population is one of the major issues Singapore faces in the future and if the problem is not dealt with properly , this may eventually affect the country's development .
Therefore ,  public spending on the aged should not be limited .
In recent years , many countries have begun to face the  issue of ageing demographics and undeniably , Singapore is one of the fastest ageing populations in Asia .
Population ageing will bring about social and economic changes , and such a shift in the age structure means that the government has to make amendments to the public spending on the aged .
While it is important to care for the elderly , other areas of the country's development should also be taken into consideration and not to be neglected , so as to achieve a balance in both the social and economic structure of the country .
According to Friedland and Summer (2005) , an ageing demographic will cause serious fiscal problems for publicly-financed health and welfare packages .
Indeed , money has to be spent to curb ageing problems , but it is society's responsibility to ensure a desirable standard of living for the elderly and to constantly fulfill the varying needs of this group of senior citizens .
The government has to ensure that all the elderly have a permanent roof above their head even after retirement and can also finance their day-to-day living expenses .
Moreover , with longer life expectancy , it is also important to be certain that the country's health care system is well-structured and sophisticated enough to prepare for an influx of sick elderly , and also that the cost of health care expenditure also includes the cost of promoting good health .
t is important to promote preventative measures as it will mean less expenditure on taking care of people who are sick .
However , public funding should also cover other areas of the country's development .
For instance , education is also an important area that should be focused on .
It is a recognized fact that education helps the young to secure a quality job in future and also prepares them with  It is certainly worthy of the public funding to build the best educational facilities and ensure that every child has the chance to receive education .
It important to make sure that education remains affordable in the country and this can be achieved through subsidies by the government .
Moreover , part of public funding should also be spent on re-training schemes for working adults so as to improve their work quality and efficiency , as well as to keep them skilled and valuable for industry .
Education will harvest long term benefits for both individuals and the country as an educated pool of citizens will definitely generate greater economic growth .
With this additional economic revenue generated  , more public funding can be channeled to help the aged .
Research and Development is also another important area of a country's development .
In today's context , industry changes get obsolete very quickly .
It is important to be innovative and constantly produce new ideas in order to stay ahead of competitors and to improve a society's performance .
For example , Research and Development in pharmaceuticals is particularly important as the creation of new drugs will help in the advancement of medical and clinical studies .
More sophisticated health care systems will in turn help to reduce medical spending on the aged and might even help the elderly to sustain good health .
Therefore , it is important to receive incentives and funding from the government to perform Research and Development .
Other than areas in education and Research and Development , the defence force should also have a share  public funding .
Defence not only ensures national security but also maintain peace and stability in the country .
With the increasing threat from terrorism , defence should never be relaxed .
Nothing can be achieved in a chaotic environment , thus it is important to set aside of the public funding to effectively build an army , the navy and the air force .
Many considerations have to be made when it comes to the topic of dividing public funding .
No doubt  it is essential to take care of the elderly who have contributed much to society during their younger days , but the government must still ensure that there is enough funding on other areas of the country's development .
Economic growth must never be sacrificed as the society as a whole must progress and achieve further advancement .
Since Neil Armstrong left the first human footprint on the moon , it has always been a dream for human beings to explore more about the outer space .
As a country possesses over five thousand years of history , China never stops seeking the outer space .
In 1999 , 2001 and 2002 , China successfully launched in succession three experimental unmanned spaceships .
Later on 15th October 2003 , the first manned spaceship was sent to the outer space .
Until now China has already launched 3 manned spaceships and over 30 artificial satellites are working on the earth orbit .
Moreover the Chinese government is proposing a plan that will send spaceships to the moon and build an observation station on the moon .
Currently China has become the third strongest country in terms of the space technology , only after  America and Russia .
But how and why could China achieve these goals as a developing country ?
In this essay , I will explain this issue from two aspects , the economic factors and the military demands .
First  , the development of space technology is a basic need for an economic boost .
China is undergoing a rapid development in economy .
Among all the Hi-tech industries ,  information industry is the most important part .
For a country which has an area of 960million square kilometers , having enough communication satellites is the first security for the information communication , which then provides a good environment for the development of the economy .
For example , until 1994 China had built 8100 telecommunications systems , 11 satellites TV broadcast systems and 30 radio broadcast systems in response to the needs of communication in the remote areas in China , such as  Xinjiang  , Inner Mongolia , and Yunnan (Baidu , 2008) .
Currently 80%  of China is covered with  communication satellites not only for  TV broadcast but also for  world wide webcast(Baidu , 2008) .
The innovation of  space technology is an indirect result of the economic development in China .
Second , the military force of China needs the support of  space technology .
Most of today's military devices need the guide of artificial satellites .
As the deterrence policy and capability to meet the new threat , China has developed several kinds of precision guided weapons and nuclear missiles (XinHua news , 2007) .
All these weapons have to be guided by artificial satellites .
In addition to the use of space technology for building military devices , the natural resources of the outer space are also important for military aims  .
The earlier China lands its spacecraft on the moon , the earlier China can begin to use the natural resources .
The resources of the outer space would be a great support for the continuous development of Chinese military force .
Generally speaking , the development of space technology is an inevitable result of the economic development and military development in China .
With the development of its economics and military forces , the space technology will develop in response to it .
When the space technology has reached a certain level , the economic and military forces will reach a higher goal .
Under such circumstances , Chinese people will finally stand on the place where Neil Armstrong  once stood .
The world is changing continuously because of various kinds of inventions that have been designed and developed .
Design is an act where engineers apply their creative energies in producing products or systems (Seyyed Khandani , Ph .D .  ,2005) .
Mobile phones , bicycles and electric appliances are  examples of the application of  technological creativity .
They fulfill the human needs and have changed the quality of lives .
In designing a product or system , one priority requirement is that the invention should be easy to operate and require less human effort .
To meet this need , engineers should follow the five steps used for solving design problems , which can be found in the "Engineering Design Process" written by Seyyed Khandani (2005) .
When one accepts a new product , the first thing that  comes to mind is "How to use it ?"
The next question that will appear to the mind is "What is the easiest way to operate it ?"
Hence , an invention which is easy to use should be given priority .
Nowadays most people are living in a hectic life .
An invention which is easy to use is very important to help them to reduce the time consumed yet achieve greater efficiency for their work .
For example , a laptop , which is simple to operate , helps the owner to collect lots of the information from the internet just in a short while .
This helps to reduce the time consumed to find the information from  thick books in the library .
An oven , which is also easy to operate , helps humans to cook food in a short time .
If the way to operate a product is complicated , humans will prefer not to use it because the time spent in operating the product is not worth to be wasted .
When the people are not using the designed product , there is no point designing the product .
Therefore , designing a product which is simple to operate is very important .
To design a product which fulfills the human needs mentioned , there are five steps to solve the design problems .
Firstly , define the problem and recognize the needs of the new product .
The main problem now is to create products that are simple to operate .
A clear definition of the problem is important because different problems require different solutions .
Second , gather pertinent information .
All the information has to be collected before going further into the process .
The information resources can be searched from traditional publications , scientific encyclopedia , technical handbook , electronic catalog and the internet .
Next , generate multiple solutions .
This step begins with  generating new ideas that may solve the problem .
Engineers should not be afraid to try new experiences or ideas .
Then , analyze and select a solution .
The solutions that are conceived need to be analyzed and decision has to be made on which solution is the most suitable for implementation .
Finally , test and implement the solution .
Implementation refers to the testing , construction , and manufacturing of the solution to the design problem .
Several methods of implementation as well as distinct activities that occur during implementation must be considered when testing is done .
(Seyyed Khandani , Ph .D . ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS Education Transfer Plan , August 2005)
In conclusion , inventing a product which is easy  to operate is essential .
The five steps in engineering design process should be well followed to produce a good product and fulfill  human needs .
The development of technologies in the context of the innovation-development process may be observed from either a technologically determinist or a socially determinist perspective .
Technology determinism proposes  that technology progresses along its own path , independent of social development .
In other words , technology has an effect on society but society does not affect technology .
Another perspective is social determinism , also known as social constructivism , which supports the view that society influences and shapes technology , and not vice versa .
One important technology which is socially determined is the mobile phone .
There are several factors that have contributed to the shaping of this technological innovation .
The first factor that has shaped the mobile phone technology is the market forces .
Initially when mobile phones were created , the society's demand for them was low .
There are several reasons for this situation .
Early mobile phones were heavy , bulky and expensive with very low coverage .
The demand was still there because there were those who could afford them and mobile phones were important to those who were always on the go .
In the 1990s , the number of mobile phone subscribers was initially almost zero , but it shot up to half a billion people around the world in a very short period of time .
The society had demands for cheaper and more portable mobile phones and thus , innovations came about .
Mobile phones came in more light-weight and smaller sizes .
There were also demands to turn mobile phones into entertainment and portable office tools devices .
Mobile phones now have many funky designs and have added features like music players , cameras and e-mail readers .
Secondly , personal communication is also one of the factors that have shaped this technology .
People want to get connected with the world in the simplest and easiest way , and with mobile phones , they can do so almost anytime , anywhere .
Keeping in touch with friends have become much easier .
Short calls help in bonding relationships as they show that the caller is concerned enough to give a call even on a busy day .
The internet is also an important communication medium and with that , mobile phones can now connect into the internet .
With the internet , people can get instant access to information online by just typing out the keywords and press 'Search' on their touchscreen mobile phones .
Mobile phones can also be used for entertainment purposes .
For example , there are songs and videos available online and they can be downloaded directly into the mobile phone for listening or watching .
Another factor that has shaped the mobile phone technology is personal display .
For some people , the mobile phone is like an extension of their external self and they feel incomplete without one .
The ability to customise one's own mobile phone according to their preferences came from this so that each person could display their selves through their mobile phones .
With this , mobile phones have become more like a fashion accessory and trends have been created .
In Singapore , innovation is one of the key economic drivers .
An innovation is an idea , practice or object that is perceived as new to an individual or another unit of adoption (Roger , 2003) .
Engineers are an important element in the innovation processes as they perform the role of problem solvers by applying their creative energies in production (Kam , 2003) .
This creative act is then translated as design in technical terms .
As we all know , Singapore is a small country with no natural resources , having humans as our only resource .
As such , we face several problems that are not encountered by other nations , like inadequate technologically inclined talents and insufficient support from citizens , resulting in adverse societal attitude towards failure .
These problems will significantly hamper our engineering design processes for innovation .
Singapore , a country with only 4 .4 million population ,  has not enough professionals in the field of technology and science as most technological innovations are created by scientific research (Roger , 2003) .
As manpower is the fundamental element of any process , without sufficient quality manpower , the commencement of processes is already hindered .
In short , this problem will hit hard directly on the first step of innovation , 'needs/problems'(see Figure 1 below) .
As the world becomes more IT savvy , Singapore needs to set her foot onto the technological industries .
The easiest way to recruit technologically inclined talents is attracting foreign professionals .
Singapore does this by giving scholarships to foreign students from IT- savvy countries like India , Bangalore .
This act will effectively increase the quantity of technicians , allowing the kickoff of innovation process temporarily .
However our heavy reliance on foreign talents will put Singapore in a vulnerable position in the long run as the foreigners do not have loyalty towards Singapore .
To reduce this over- reliance , Singapore has been taking careful measures in her education system .
For instance , Singapore implemented her first IT Masterplan for education (MP1) in 1997 (Keng , 2007) ,  ensuring that Singaporeans have sufficient IT skills for future endeavors .
Scarce talents in Singapore is not the only problem we face .
Another crucial worry is our adverse societal attitude towards failure .
Few local citizens have the risk venturing attitude , fearing failure , as when one moves into innovation several sacrifices need to be made , for example , family , current job .
This frame of mind gradually prevents Singaporeans from having the courage to venture into the unknown which is required for innovation .
Thus this worry will affect both the Research and the Development stages , from figure 1 .
As a result we do not have the first mover advantage .
In conclusion , if Singapore is to survive in the high risk volatility of the global economy , more pervasive idea generation skills throughout the population (Lambe , 2002) are required for innovation process to begin .
Education should focus on producing not only 'exam-smart' students but also those who that can react flexibly with the changes and needs of the current society .
At the same time , the society should also give ample supports to those creative thinkers of our civilization .
However , we should know that for these problems to be solved , it will require long term investment and there will certainly be some problems that cannot be completely unraveled .
The main cause for this phenomenon is the ineffectiveness of the current education system in Malaysia .
The education system in Malaysia is typically exam-based .
All students are educated to pass or get high scores in their examinations .
In other words , schools are producing machines that study for the sake of examinations .
They don't know how to apply their knowledge .
They don't know how to improve things that they are taught .
They just receive everything blindly .
Under such circumstances , it is totally not surprising that younger generation usually do not have the ability to cope with problems that they have never faced before .
At most , they can only deal with problems whose solutions have already been identified and proven to work successfully .
Upon facing new problems that they have never encountered , they will just give up and take other short-cuts instead .
That's why the whole process of innovations tends to stop after problems or needs arise .
By chance the process might proceed to the research and development stage but that is where more and more problems and troubles will appear and try to block the way out .
How many of them can survive all the way through the six stages mentioned above ?
Another factor that contributes to Malaysia's failure is the policy made by the government .
In order to gain political advantages , the government or the ruling party has implemented plenty of policies  to constrain the freedom of individuals in giving opinions .
Mass media in Malaysia might be seen to have a lot of freedom in reporting news and views , but the truth is that they are all being controlled behind the veil .
Wondering how all these are connected with innovations ?
There is an invisible link .
If you are the government , what will you do if problems arise in your country ?
What if more and more problems keep on coming out ?
Try to find solutions for all the problems ?
No way !
The solution is most probably trying to conceal the problems from the public .
With most of the mass media under their surveillance , they will try their best to block all the negative issues and scandals that might threaten their position as the ruling party .
Since identifying problems is the first stage of the generation of innovation , the government is actually blocking the entire flow of innovation process .
A country ruled under such a government will certainly enjoy very limited development in terms of creativity and innovation .
Does this make things clear enough now ?
As a conclusion , the government plays an important role in deciding the overall development of innovation and innovative design of a country .
Sadly , my home country , Malaysia , is not a very good example to be followed by others .
Hopefully , Malaysia will become a famous country for its people's innovation and creativity in the future .
The world today has become more sophisticated and problems in our society are created , most of the time , by humans from the results of their innovations and inventions .
However , these inventions do not appear out of nothing; it is the result of bringing together technologies and systems to solve our problems and to improve human needs .
All the products and systems humans are enjoying now are the results of human effort to improve our society .
But one thing is for sure - our Earth's resources are depleting and engineers , being the problem solvers , have to come up with ideas to reduce fuel consumption and the risk of greenhouse effect and global warming .
All these harmful effects bring us to this certain human need that should be given the utmost priority - health .
To address this need , an engineering process has to be developed and this requires a methodology or a process of steps to help us arrive at the solution .
The five step process , developed by Seyyed Khandani (2005) in http://www .iisme .org/etp/HS%20Engineering-%20Engineering .pdf , is essential to help reduce the amount of pollution in our  atmosphere .
The problem has to be clearly defined so that researchers and engineers alike understand the problem and recognize the need for a new product or system .
Although engineers are usually involved in defining the problem , they may not always be the ones who initially recognize the need .
The emission of harmful pollutants into the  atmosphere by motorcars and factories has affected human health and this needs to be rectified .
Systems have to be developed to improve the weather and make the air fresher which will , in turn , improve our health conditions .
There is more than one solution to any engineering problems .
Before further research can be done , collection of data that is related to the problem is needed to narrow the solutions for engineers to work on .
Details such as whether the issue of global warming is real has to be consolidated before ideas , such as replacing our motorcars with hybrid cars , can be generated .
Solutions to engineering design problems do not magically appear .
Ideas are generated when people are free to take risks and make mistakes .
Brainstorming at this stage is often a team effort when people from different backgrounds are involved in generating multiple solutions to the problem .
Questions have to be asked and certain pointers have to be fulfilled and established .
The pros and cons of a solution have to be worked through and analyzed to select the best solution .
The final phase of the design process is implementation , which refers to the testing and manufacturing of the solution to the design problem .
The solution has to be fine-tuned as much as possible .
Products or systems have to go under a real condition test .
Graphs and charts , and information pertaining to the testing have to be recorded and reported to understand what has been created .
The ability to communicate and sell an idea is an critical skill in engineering design .
Last but not least , the solution is implemented and a patent , which protects the idea from copyright infringement , has to be applied to develop an original and novel solution to a design problem .
In conclusion , engineering design process helps to meet human needs by the identification and the analysis of the processes .
Design activity occurs over a period of time and requires a step-by-step methodology .
The solution to a design problem does not appear out of nowhere .
There are as many processes of design as there are engineers .
However , since design problems are usually not defined properly and can have a great number of correct answers , the process may require backtracking and iteration .
To sum it all , it is best that common sense comes into play when certain steps do not play a part in the engineering design process .
First and foremost , renewable fuels are much more environmentally friendly compared with fossil fuels .
Fossil fuels liketheiral and petroleum produces a large amount of carbon-based polluting agents and greenhouse gassourcesch contribute to global warming .
In contrast , agas ,rnative and renewable fuels produce significantly less carbon-based pollutants .
Let us make ethanol an example .
"Ethanol contains 35% oxygen" CITATION Hel09 \l 1033 (Help this high percentage of oxygen , allows for a more complete combustion , thus reducing the harmful emissions .
In fact , ethanol reduces exhaust carbon monoxide and toxic emissions by 30% CITATION Hel09 \l 1033ent ) .
The mankind's battle against climate change is the catalyst that has fueled the search for the renewable sources of energy; it's one of the few positive impacts of the global catastrophe that we are heading to .
The greatest secret to the success of alternative fuels is the fact that is it renewable .
There is an abundant supply of sources of biofuelsrogen fuels .
Unlike alternative fuels , the fossil fuels are finite resource .
They are destined to finish someday .
They take millions of years to replenish and are used up at a strikingly hasty rate .
At the currtake ethanol as an example , all the natural gas and petrol less than 50 years CITATI); this7 \l 1033 (Tan , Chen , Sadlr , & Clare , 2007) .
However , our daily life depends a lot on fossil fuels as a source of energy .
It is impossible to imagine a world without them; this lethical issue to chew-on: is it fair to take away the luxuries of fossil fuels for the future generations ?
Therefore , renble fuels are the key to the sustainability of our future .
onFurthermore , alternative and renewable fuels are less expensive than fossil fuels .
Due to the shortage of petroleum and the ever-increasing dependence on it , the price of crude oil will k continue to go higher .
Iresourcesison with fossil fuels , renewable fuels will be much cheaper and more stable due to their wide availability no freight cost .
Hence , affordability and market stability are other factors that project the usability and usefulness and r
the development of propelLast but not least , alternative fuels do not rely on oil from Middle Eastern , owing to the advanced technology used to make renewable fuels opens up an entire dimension of ethicality .
Thchnology can build country energy independence , and thus regional geo-political stability .
It is an indispensable asset that manavailability withoutongly support and endeavor to adopt .
To conclude , not only are the renewable fuels a lot more eco-fthe Middle Easthey also have are widely and cheaply available .
In additiofuels .
The advanced technology opensnology can help governmentseconomically and politicalla countrye .
Regrettably none of the alternative sources of energy are ready to dispose off fossil fuel at the moment .
Even so it is crystal-clear to the world that alternative renewable fuels' technology is the only way ahead .
After analysing the topic , I understand the main issue is about the problems and obstacles which slow down engineering design processes  for innovations , and the place I will discuss about is my own country China .
I should be able to interpret two  significant problems and analyse their influences on certain stages of the process .
As the aviation industry is a significant symbol of a country's strength and a vital sign of the level of a country's industrialization , I would like to look further into this industry .
The following is the essay:
Do you know when China made its first aircraft ?
The first aircraft that was made all by China was  on 30 July 1923 , 26 years before China became independent .
It was on that very day that China , the "huge dragon" was added the wings .
Furthermore , the aviation industry of China got developed rapidly later on and China is able to produce many kinds of aircraft with high-tech now .
However , things have not always been going well .
In the first place , it is quite a challenge for China to set up its factories to produce planes on a rather big scale because of  lack of resources and equipments; then frequent changes of governments  emerged and pulled back the entire industry dramatically .
In the early 1910s , the government of China started to prepare for setting up aircraft factories .
The engineers tried so hard that they were able to design the first aircraft in 1923 .
However , till 1949 , there were only over a dozen  small factories with shabby devices and few planes were produced .
Worse , the necessary raw materials ,  tools , accessories and advanced equipments were all dependent on imports from other countries , let alone setting up an independent aircraft manufacturing system .
The problem really adversely affected the aviation industry for a while .
After China got independent , under the special care and proper guidance of Chairman Mao and some other leaders of China , the aviation industry started to enjoy a pleasant time .
The government spent a lot of money sending engineers to study advanced technologies and importing experts from abroad; the other various industries of China have all given a great support to the aviation industry , especially by providing resources and funds .
In a few years' time , China's aviation industry grew from small to rather large and became able to produce aircrafts of many kinds .
As the pleasant time moved on , in 1953 China was able to make its first five year plan for its aviation industry .
The government guaranteed a lot of labour , materials and funds for the industry and the engineers and workers showed much initiative and creativity in work .
However , after the great success of the first five year plan , in 1958 a dim and chaotic period of governance arrived .
A three year period of "The Great Leap Forward" took place .
The government began to think that the industries of China had already been developed so well that the government started to require the industries to pursue higher quality , huger plans and greater speed of construction blindly , which in turn led to many serious quality problems .
Worse , taking advantage of this , reactionaries inside the government planed some sabotage in order to achieve their own goals .
As a consequence , a huge loss was caused to the whole industry .
Fortunately , people started to realize how wrong the leadership was and crushed the reactionaries .
The aviation industry started to stick to a solid and standard guideline when producing aircrafts and production gradually recovered .
From then on , some new aircrafts were invented and the industry went on well .
Finally , we could say that the process of  aircraft innovation was quite tortuous .
The lack of resources and equipments in the first place cost China a few decades  .
Then the whole industry went on well for several years as many aircrafts were produced; however the government started to give wrong guidance and became unstable and caused a huge damage to the industry .
Looking back at the whole process , two serious problems came about and hit the industry so hard .
However , they were all resolved through proper guidance and much effort .
With consistent effort , there should be no doubt that China's aviation industry will keep going well .
First of all , in my opinion , the hugest problem throughout all the innovations is lack of certain resources , raw materials , some necessary tools and high-tech devices or equipments .
The next significant one is that the Chinese government used to be unstable and provide bad leadership such that some big loss was caused to the industry .
There are some other problems such as lack of help from some developed countries , lack of engineers with brilliant knowledge and conflicts between conventional Chinese culture and western cultures in terms of some certain designs which are not so essential , so these problems are not discussed in this essay .
I will examine innovative engineering designs in the following industries in China: :
The growth of this technology is unprecedented especially in this new millennium .
All over the world  will see that ttechnologyy devices that use this technology .
It is almost impossible not to find any devices in our homes and offices today that use this technology .
For example , the remote controllers which help us to switch on or off our televisions , lightings , security alarm systems of our cars and homes and the opening and closing our auto-gates use the wireless communication technology .
Besides these , other examples of devices that use this technology are devices that use the Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , Wi-Max , wireless LAN , mobile phones , etc .
Life would not have been as easy and as enjoyable without these devices .
Thanks to the many inventors , researchers , developers and governmental agencies that have helped to make these products available to the general public .
these products have been madeagencies ,The evolution of this technology is somewhat driven by the social needs .
For example , the precursor to W was invented in 1991 by NCR Corporation for its wireless cash registers[1] .
Today , because of the growing demand of high-speed broadband internet connections , in areas where cabling cannot be run such as the outdoto open and close our auto-gates ands and historical buildings the use of Wi-Fi is a good solution .
The use of radio frequency technology to transmit inforion is governed by strict regulations .
In each country , the development , import or sales of these devices are governed by special governmental bodies .
For example , in United States it is governed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) , in Singapory the Info-Communications Development Authorities of Singapore and in Malaysia by the Malaysian Communications & Multimedia Commission .
Many of these wireless devices would not have existed if our governmental policies do not change to encourage innovation .
For example , in 1985[2] , a decision by the FCC of United States to open several bands of wireless spectrum , so-called "garbage bands" (900 - 928 MHz , 2400 - 2483 .5 MHz , 5725 - 5850 MHz bands) without the need for government license has spawned growth in R&D in that area .
Originally , these garbage bands were allocated for equipments that use radio-frequency energy for purposes other than communications (such as microwave ovens which use the radio waves to heat food) .
Due to this decision many "unlicensed" wireless technology products for communication purposes were developed , such as the Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , Wi-Max applications which operated using the spectrum of the garbage band .
Unlicensed wireless devices are devices that emit low power radio frequency energy which are permitted without specific device or user authorization either through registration or grant of a license .
This is because these devices have low probability of causing harmful interference to the users .
Hence , unlicensed devices are free from the usual delay and cost associated with approval of the licensing process .
through eitherdevicesusethe UnitedThis policy has great economics significance .
The chain effect is that it encourages innovation to develop new communication products which help to fill consumers' needs , which in turn helps to generate jobs in manufacturing the Unitedse products , logistic costs for transportation of these products to various countries around the globe and finally sales of these products to the end consumers .
Engineers rarely identify a "need" but rather let the society discover it .
"Need" here refers to a desire or shortage of a commodity , and sometimes this "need" can be considered as a neccessity or a form of luxury .
For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi , an engineer from Toshiba Corporation , saw the need for portable personal computers and came up with the idea of laptop; and as of recently , one of the human needs that have gained unremitting attention would be transportation .
Based on a study in the U .S done by Ecobridge , about 33% of carbon dioxide emission comes from the burning of gasoline in internal-combustion engines of cars and trucks .
As the struggle between man and nature continues to be unabated , it is the engineers' job to design cars that are environmental-friendly to mitigate what has already been done to our environment .
According to Khandani (2005) , the engineering design process can be used to tackle such needs .
First of all , we have to define the problem clearly .
The process of defining a problem involves identifying a need , developing a problem statement and establishing a criterion for success .
It must be clear , concise and unambiguous to avoid any ambiguity .
Subsequently , it would be to generate multiple solutions .
Creativity is one of the biggest emphases in this step in order to generate techincal solutions to the problem .
Team brainstorming sessions are also conducted to develop multiple solutions , reckoning on team dynamics .
Engineers must also be willing to take risks and make mistakes , and not to be afraid of being criticized for their ideas .
For example , the team that invented hydrogen fueled cars faced several setbacks before they could attain their goal .
Lastly , it would be to select a solution and implement it .
Analysis of all possible solutions is to be done and reasons of why the final solution overrides the others must be clear .
In the design of environmental-friendly cars , it must be in such a way that the designed  car would be less polluting than the existing ones , coupled with lower price and better performance .
In conclusion , engineers today now shoulder the responsibility of striking a balance between man and nature .
Greenhouse emissions must be reduced to the lowest level as much as possible .
Designing a car that reduces greenhouse emissions significantly definitely poses a great challenge to them , and they should use engineering design process to help them in designing .
Nonetheless , at the rate of how man has been working on this , one can expect to see a big leap in car designs in the coming years .
"Eureka !"
exclaimed Archimedes , A Greek mathematician and physicist , when he noticed water flowing out of his bath tub as he submerged himself into the tub .
This incident gave him an idea to later formulate the Archimedes principle .
Is the Archimedes principle considered research or serendipitous ?
At times , it can be quite ambiguous .
The Archimedes principle may seem more like a lucky incident which results in the formulation of a grand idea .
However , it was research and experiments that proved the Archimedes principle to be true .
We can define research technology as a technology based on deliberate examinations and careful analysis , and serendipitous technology as a technology found purely by luck .
Despite their differences in definition , a research technology and a serendipitous technology both share a  similarity: the technology is ultimately used to tackle the problems of Man .
In the past before the discovery of the space pen , astronauts had difficulty in writing their discoveries with the normal pens as they resulted in leaks in zero gravity space .
Pencils were also strongly avoided as the lead posed a danger in space .
American industrialist and pen manufacturer Paul C . (Fisher Mariel Bird , 2009) saw that this was a problem and started working on producing a pen that would allow astronauts to be able to write their discoveries in extreme environments and temperatures .
After years of gruelling research and analysis , the space pen was finally produced .
The same goes for Teflon , which was discovered by chemist Roy Plunkett .
As Teflon is considered to be one of the most slippery substances , it is widely used as a lubricant in the manufacturing industry and as a coating for production tubes in the pharmaceutical industry .
The technology is also used as a repellent against spills and dirt for fabrics , and under the brand name Tefal , the product is used in cooking wares , non-stick pots and pans .
However , despite their similarity in resolving problems of Man , the two technologies also share one difference: the process in which it was discovered .
This would define a research technology from a serendipitous one .
As mentioned above , the invention of the space pen occurred because Fisher realised that astronauts were not able to pen their findings with a typical pen or a pencil .
He saw a need to assist Man in this area , and worked towards producing the ultimate pen .
We cannot say the same for Teflon .
Plunkett's initial aim was to produce a refrigerant that has better thermodynamic properties and safety measures .
He had a different goal .
He was not looking at producing a slippery lubricant and saw another set of problems that had nothing to do with Teflon .
To put it simply , he had no aim to discover Teflon .
Plunkett's accidental finding only occurred when he was testing the chemical reactions of gaseous tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) (Roberta Barbalace , 2006) .
;According to Khandani (2005) , the design process consists of five main parts: Defning the haveblem , gathering required information , generating multiple solutions , selecting a solution and testining of the solution .
The problem is obvious .
Crude oil , a fossil fuel , might run out in fifty years .
There are a few alternate energy sources apart from fossil fuels .
A simple search yields the following sources: Solar energy , hydroelectricity and wind energy .
Solar energy is harnessed thtestingtoltaic process when the sunlight hits solar panels .
This process generates electricity .
Hydroelectricity uses moving water to spin turbines , creating energy .
A hydroelectric dam will need to be built to harness this form of energy .
Wind energy utilizes the kinetic energy of moving winds to spin blades .
These blades are connected to a generator which will generate electricity when the blades are spun .
These three sources are the most commonly found alternate energy sources .
simpler , as onlyThe most effective method to harness solar power in Singapore will be to install solar panels on the roofs of all HDB flats .
The majority of housing in Singapore are HDB flats , these flats add up to form a considerable amount of land area .
As all HDB flats are under the jurisdictiwindmills , but Singaporeoard , there is no need to seek approval from individual owners to implement this plan .
In conclusion , the most feasible sustainable energy source for Singapore will be solar energy .
This scheme is highly probably because the government has control over a laflats , and thesef HDB flats , which constitutes to a large land area .
We will need to put this into motion as soon as possible .
Sindesign acentury , the environment has been polluted because of the fast development of industries and economics .
Nowadays , the pollution is very severe and has threatened living condition of human beings .
To have environmentally-friendly product is a human need that has to be given priority , so that the products people use won't be harmful to neither the environment nor health of people .
In the following paragraphs , how engineer design processes can help to achieve the purpose will be discussed .
Since the 19th centuryoblem , three main needs can be identified: firstly , design products that the pollution caused during manufacturing can be minimized .
Secondly , design products witconditionsmentally-friendly material and consuming green enerproductsrdly , design products with minimizing emission pollution .
And the criteria for success of the product should put the level of enthe healthentally-friendly into priority consideration .
After defining the problems , the next step is to gather relevant information .
According tcan minimize the pollution during manufacturinginternet are major source tousingd out information needed .
Since our problem is very academic and needs in depth search , which minimizeoks should be the main soone of the criteriaesearthe successBesides , our prois whether the product is environmentally friendly that are well developed .
diverseareThen is time to generate multiple solutions for the problems .
Now there are a lot of researches done on environmentally-friendly energy and materials , so learning to sourcesse of these rthe informationults can help to solve our problem a lot .
At the same in-depthe creative idea of design to make the product msourcesfectconsultnt for the solution too .
The nit is timep is to analyze and select a solution .
To analysis those design solutions , a lot of factors need to be considered .
Functional analysis , ergonomics and product safety and liability are all important elements to evaluate those solutions .
And all these are for making the decision .
To compare one solution with another , ranking according to the attributes for the solution is necessary for us to see with one the best , in our case , environmentally-friendly should be the major criteria .
Then , analyze each solution against the criteria we have , and rate each solution , in our case .
At last , choose the most scored one for the next process .
rankedhighestThe final process is to test and implement the solutioanalyzeusly , the product needs to be built up for testing and implementing .
Methods such as pergonomics ,  concurrent engineering can be applied for implementation , and we need to know how effective the product is regarding to environmentally-friendly .
During this process , documentation should be done so thaofas can understand the work .
In this prwhichsone is therbest; inith the probeing environmentally friendlyn that case , we need criteriont the design processes to solve problems .
the problemsits environmentally friendly featuresTo sum up , the design processes can help to solve the problem we have effectively , since in each step we do our job based on the problem we want to solve and the efficiency .
New and clever technologies are constantly being developed by people all around the world to tackle problems that they face .
However , the creation of these technologies can be attributed to research or chance .
One example of researching resulting in an invention is a type of wall-mounted bed that can be folded onto the wall when not in use .
It was called the murphy bed and was invented by William L . Murphy to solve space constraints that he faced while living in a small apatment .
An example of an invention attributed to chance discovery is the Telfon .
This is a type of substance discovered by Dr . Roy J Plunkett while he was working on gases being used as refrigerants .
These two types of technology share many similarities and differences .
One of them is that they both exist to address problems that people are facing at that time of creation , but differ in the process in developingdevelop the product .
Another is that both type of technology require people to ultilise a certain amount of creativity and good peception to develop them completely but differ when it comes to the type of people the technologies  usually involve .
Technology , no matter how it is developed , will be used to address problems that people face .
Teflon , for example , is being used in a variety of products as anti-stick or anti-stain coatings .
Cooking utensils coated with Teflon are now easier to clean up since  burnt food no longer stick to it .
Clothes coated in a variety of Telfon became stain resistant , which means less chance of it becoming damaged permanently by tough stains and an easier time washing the dirt off the clothes .
Another example , the murphy bed , also addressed a problem that some people faced .
This problem is the space constraint due to  small living space .
By being foldable , space could be made available for use where the bed would have been .
Ultimately , both  technologies are beneficial to the human population .
The two ways of developing technologies use different processes .
The development of murphy bed , for example , is driven largely by the problem it was trying to solve .
This results in a process where identifying the problem comes first , after which time and effort are put in to solve that one problem .
However , Telfon has seen itself being used as coatings to cloth , coating on cookware , insulations and even as stenotic arteries in medicine .
One reason for this versatility is that the brainstorming is now focused on the various problems where Telfon could be used to solve to great effect .
With a large pool of possible uses for Telfon gathered , the next step would be to modify this new technology so that it may be used for as many  problems as possible .
Ultimately , while the murphy bed and Telfon originated from two differing processes , they still do share some similarities .
By observing this , it could be possible that people would combine some of the key aspects of the processes to create a better model for developing new technology .
Before setting out for possible solutions for our energy problem , rigorously defining the problem itself is indeed necessary so that we could make sure that we are always in the right direction and know what properties the right solutions should posseshumansn energy crisis is the shortagcanenergy accompanied by the fact that now we cannot find enough reliable energy as substitute" is a definition given by Prof . McLaren Hill from the University of Edinburgh .
Fortunately , after decades of painstaking efforts we have already come up with many possible solutions .
Many of them fall in two categorcansearching for new energy sources and implementing energy-saving methods .
For instance , the solar cell as a source of energy for satellites , industries as well as households has proved to be a promising method , while refining the ignsubstitute ," a definition of energy crisisn order to extract the most from every drop of gasoline is what many people are doing in laboratories now .
I have a Nokia N79 and surprisingly I found that when I un-plug the charger cable from the phone , a message saying , "Un-plug the charger from the socket to save energy" will appear on the screen , which is really an innovative way to publicize energy saving .
To sum up , solving the current energy crisis is a very complicated and systematic issue and engineers should act as pioneers in solving it .
By and only by applying the correct energy design process can theygeneration breakthroughs and bring us more good news .
Technologies have been developed since long ago; however , not all of them are planned .
There are many pathways that lead to a technology being created , mainly through serendipitous discovery or through research .
In our everyday life , we stumble across things that are out of the norm .
While most of the events appear to be non-significant , there are some where people actually get ideas from them .
This is what we call serendipitous discovery , when people make discoveries that they did not seek .
One of the examples of technology being discovered from research is the development in automobile safety and a better design of roads in the United States(U .S .) while an example of the technology resulted from serendipitous discovery is the Post-it pads .
The technology created via research has significant differences from technology resulted from serendipitous discovery in several aspects .
One of the major differences is whether there is a need for the technology .
Technologies developed through research are ussually to address a problem that have been identified .
In this case , the development in automobile safety and a better design of roads in U .S . is to reduce the massive casualties from road accidents where the annual vehicle death rate reached 50 ,000 in the early 1960s(statistics taken from Rogers , E . M . (2003) .
The generation of innovations .
In Diffusion of innovations (pp .136-
158) .
New York: Free Press) .
On the contrary , technologies developed through serendipitous discovery are not born from a need for them .
For instance , Post-it pads were developed out of mere coincidence .
Decades ago , the 3M researchers found a new bonding agent during their research but it was not what they had wanted to achieve as the bonding agent did not stick paper very tightly to the surface .
Therefore , it can be said that technologies created from research are due to a need for them while technologies created from serendipitous discovery do not originate from a need .
Another difference is the final usage of the technologies .
Technologies developed through research are used for their intended purpose .
For example , in U .S , the development in automobile safety includes safer cars that come with padded dashboards and stronger bumpers while safer roads are achieved by placing impact attenuators in front of viaduct pillars .
These technologies were developed for their intended purpose , which is to reduce casualties from road accidents .
However , technologies developed from serendipitous discovery are not used for their intended purpose .
For instance , the researchers of 3M found a new bonding agent during their research .
The bonding agent was initially thought as a failure as it did not meet the expectation of the researchers ,which was to stick tightly to the surface of paper .
However , it is later converted into a successful product when it is used to create "Post-its ," the little stick- on squares of colored paper that can be used to attach a note to a letter or other documents  , which is not the intended purpose of this technology .
In a nutshell , technologies created from research will be used for their intended aim while technologies developed from serendipitous discovery might not serve its intended purpose .
Lastly , one final difference between the 2 lies in the background research .
Technologies created from research undeniably have lots of background research .
This is proven just by looking at the amount of research needed before measures are to developed a safer automobile as well as better design of highways .
The research span can be years ,decades or even longer before the technology can be successfully developed .
However , this is different for technologies originated from serendipitous discovery .
There is no background research needed for these technologies , as they are created out of pure coincidence .
With reference to Post-it pads , they were created without any background research .
The researchers simply found a way to utilize the bonding agent years later which led to the product Post- it pads .
Hence ,  it can be said that there is background research for technologies originated from research while there might not be any background research for technologies created from serendipitous discovery .
Despite the differences between the ways by which the technologies are created , they help to improve the life of mankind be it through convenience or through any other means .
In conclusion , there are significant differences between technologies developed from research and serendipitous discovery; however , these differences does not change the fact that both technologies are key to the future for mankind .
The development and advancement in science and technology has brought much convenience to thehuman society today .
With a click of the mouse , one can communicate with another person half a globe away , strike a business deal with foreign entrepreneurs and catch up with the latest happenings all around the world .
Technology is something which is created to help solving the problems we face in our daily life and at the same time , improve the quality of our life .
Generally , most of the technological innovations are created through basic research , followed by applied research , leading finally to development .
(Rogers , E . M . (2003) .
The generation of innovations , para .
7) .
However , there are also some technological inventions which are designed from a serendipitous discovery .
According to Roger , serendipity is the accidental discovery of a new idea .
The differences between these two types of technological inventions can be perceived in terms of their research backgrounds , cost of the invention of the technology , and time consumption .
Technology developed via research and technology  resulted from a serendipitous discovery have different research backgrounds .
Technology based on scientific research requires a wide range of knowledge to conduct the research .
Special skills are also needed to carry out certain experiments and to record the results and data of the experiments .
Many researches also have to be carried out to identify and rectify the problems encountered throughout the experiments .
For example , to create a miniaturized medical submarine which can be injected into human bodies to destroy the blood clot that threatens a human life , there are many technical problems to overcome , such as how to make , power and steer the medical submarine .
(Metin Sitti , (2009) Voyage of the micro robots , para 2) .On the other hand , technology created by serendipitous discovery does not require any knowledge and special skills .
It is an invention by chance while a very different invention is undergoing research and analysis .
For example , DDT is created out of a substance used for protecting wool clothes against moth .
(Rogers , E . M . (2003) .
The generation of innovations , para .
11)Obviously , more research and analysis are needed for technology based on research as compared to technology created by serendipitous discovery .
The technology based on research and the technology created by serendipitous discovery require different amounts of cost to be carried out .
For technology based on research , a large amount of money is needed to purchase materials that are essential for the research and investigations to be conducted .
Moreover , specific apparatus , for instance , machines and robots , which are usually expensive , are also needed in order to carry out certain experiments .
However , for technology created from serendipitous discovery , it actually requires a few cents or even not a single cent as it is a useful "side product" from a different research .
Less cost is required for this technology because it is an unplanned technology discovery .
Apart from that , time consumption for the technology based on research is much different from that for the technology created by serendipitous discovery .
In order to carry out extensive research and analysis , much time has to be spent for the technology to be successfully invented .
For instance , Thomas Edison had spent his whole life to invent a light bulb with almost tens of thousands of failures before he succeeded .
For technology created from serendipitous discovery , less time is as it comes out unexpectedly .
One popular example is penicillin , which turned out to be the first antibiotic because of its property of killing biological materials when it was left in Petri dishes containing biological organisms .
(Rogers , E . M . (2003) .
The generation of innovations , para .11)
To sum up the salient points , technology  via research requires more researches and investigations than technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
Besides , cost of creating a technology created via research is much higher as compared to that of technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
Technology based on scientific research consumes more time than technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery as  many researches and experiments need to be carried out .
Although all technology serves a common purpose , there are many differences between inventions  resulted from research and those resulted from serendipitous discoveries .
Looking at an example of invention that resulted from research - the laptop and an example of serendipitous discovery - the implantable pacemaker , a few distinct differences such as the cause leading to the research , final usage of the technology and the research procedures can be spotted between them .
Firstly , the most distinct difference between an implantable pacemaker and a laptop is the intentions which led to their discovery .
In the case of the laptop , the inventors of the laptop started with the intention of creating a "DynaBook ," which is a concept conceived in 1968 .
The "DynaBook" concept is to make a "personal computer for children of all ages" .
The implantable pacemaker , on the other hand , was initially an attempt to build an oscillator to record the sound of heartbeats .
However , when Wilson Greatbatch , inventor of the implantable pacemaker , inserted a wrong resistor and discovered a different reaction , it led to the invention of the first implantable pacemaker .
Therefore , it is obvious that the cause which led to the invention is very different in that in the case of the laptop , , it was already intended  before its creation whereas in the case of the implantable pacemaker , its creation was never intended .
Another difference is the final usage of the inventions .
In the case of the laptop , the final usages are what the laptop was intended for  during its conceptualisation stage .
However , in the case of the pacemaker , the final usage is not what it was intended to be .
It was intended to be a machine to record the sound of the heartbeats  but ended up as a device to stimulate the heart and to serve as a cure for certain heart problems .
As shown above , in the case of most serendipity discoveries , they will normally not be used for the initial purpose of the experiment that led to its discovery whereas in the case of an invention through research , it will be the used for its intended purposes .
Lastly , the pace of advancement that led to the invention of the laptop and that of the pacemaker is different too .
Normally in the case of a serendipitous discovery , there is a sudden advancement in the progress of the research as it is an accidental discovery during the experimental process .
The experiment that led to the discovery of the implantable pace maker was done in 1958 and within months of its discovery the first implantable pacemaker was being used on a human being .
However , for the laptop , its concept was developed in 1968 and the first "laptop" only came into existence in 1975 .
Despite all the differences , there are undeniably some similarities between serendipitous discoveries and discoveries made through conventional research methods .
In both examples , regardless of their methods of discoveries , both are beneficial to mankind and help to improve the quality of life .
The laptop has simplified human work whereas the pacemaker has helped prolong life of some stricken with life threatening diseases .
In conclusion , though there are many differences between the discovery of the laptop and that of the pacemaker shown above , they both help to propel the human race forward into the future .
The first step in the engineering design process is to identify the problems that our product will face .
Firstly , during the manufacturing of the product , we should be environmentally friendly by reducing the amount of wastes produced and ensure that the wastes produced are properly disposed too .
Secondly , we should also use used materials as the main material for our product and ensure our product is recyclable .
The next step is to gather relevant information that would help make our product a success .
The most convenient way to collect the appropriate information is through the use of internet , as there are always search engines available to help get our sources more accurately and quickly .
There are also traditional ways such as using the library and looking through bookstores to gather more detailed information .
The third step is to generate multiple solutions to solve the problems that are stated in the second paragraph .
For example , we could use filters in gas pipes to reduce air pollution from the factories manufacturing the product .
We could also come out with a standard procedure on how to dispose the waste products so that there would be no chemical leakages that are harmful to the environment .
Through more brainstorming within our group , we would arrive at more solutions .
The fourth step is to analyze and to select the best solution .
The best solution would be chosen from the few ideas that we have thought of during the" generating multiple problems" process .
There will be many criteria that we need to fulfill in order to choose the best solution .
The most important criteria are which solution proves to be the most environmental friendly and whether the product will be able to function properly by using mathematical calculation and scientific theory .
The subsequent criteria will be whether it is safe to implement and if it is cost effective to produce .
The last stage in the engineering design process is to test and implement the solution .
We should come out with a series of tests to prove whether the products work in real life environments .
We should also develop a suitable design for our product that would be warmly welcomed by the public .
Even if one of the tests fails , we could apply the engineering design process to solve the problems that have emerged in the process of the testing .
Human beings have gone through 21 centuries .
In this long time period , technology has developed together with the human society .
Technology has been developed in different ways .
Two main ways are research and serendipitous discovery .
Both research and serendipitous discovery are very important in technology development .
Technology developed via research and technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery differ in some aspects but are similar in some other aspects .
In terms of development process , technology developed via research and technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery are different .
For technology via research , scientists have a clear plan before they start their research .
They know what they want to get or to achieve at the very beginning .
Then they just do what they should do step by step according to their plan .
Finally , they achieve their goal .
The process for the development of technology developed via research is very systematic with a very clear target .
Technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery is different .
Scientists discover a very useful technology unexpectedly .
That means they themselves even do not know they will discover it until they really do .
They do not have the target but they finally stumble upon some new technology .
These two kinds of technology also differ from each other in development inputs .
As an old saying goes , one cannot make bricks without straw .
Technology research is also the same .
From the moment that scientists decide to work on a new technology , scientists have to put in a lot in order to discover a new technology .
These inputs include time , effort , fund , and so on .
Unlike technologies developed via research , technologies resulted from serendipity need almost zero input .
This kind of technology is just like a gift from God .
It is for free .
What is needed is just luck .
Scientists need such luck to get this God's gift .
So , these two kinds of technology need different input .
Consumer domain is another difference between technology resulted from research and technology resulted from serendipitous discovery .
In most circumstances , scientists are clearly aware of consumers of their technology before they start their research .
They develop certain technology which satisfies certain consumer domains; in comparison , scientists usually do not know the use and the specific consumer domains when they  accidentally discover a technology .
In spite of these differences , these two kinds of technology share several important similarities .
Both of them are very useful to the development of our society .
They help make our life easier and more comfortable , thus improving our living standard .
If adapted into industry production , both kinds of technology can bring economic benefit .
To conclude , technology developed via research and technology resulted from serendipitous discovery not only have differences but also share similarities .
Even though these two kinds of technology are developed in different ways , they both can benefit the society and our daily life .
Over the past century , the technological boom has brought about much comfort and convenience through different inventions .
These luxury items , although they bring about a lot of convenience to our lives , are major culprits of destroying our environment .
As such , one of the main human needs would be to restore balance and lengthen the lifetime of our environment .
The process of creating new inventions , also labelled as engineering design process , is able to address this issue .
This can be done by considering the environmental friendliness of inventions as one of its major factors in the five steps of engineering design process , which are as follows: Defining the problem , gathering information , generating solutions , analysing and selecting a solution and implementing the solution .
(Khandani , 2005)
The step of defining the problem is very important .
It sets out the whole purpose of the process in the right direction .
Thus , for new problems defined , the factor of it being environmentally friendly can be factored in .
For example , eco-friendly gym equipment today are able to harness the energy generated during its use to power the machine itself .
This innovation eliminates the need for external power for the gym equipment .
Moreover , new inventions should not be the only products with a "green" factor as old inventions can be re-designed in order to achieve the "green" status .
One such example would be the invention of hybrid cars which are recognised as environmentally friendly automobiles .
The next step is to gather information and generate solutions .
Information gathering is a step which allows the designer to be equipped with background information of the problem before tackling it .
At this step , researching on the various methods in order for the product to be more environmentally friendly should be one of the main concerns .
It also allows them to consider existing solutions , if any , and consider various factors which will determine the success of the product such as its economic viability and its effectiveness .
Thus , solutions generated from these ideas should be able to resolve the problems identified as well as conform to the requirements of the society .
The solutions should be environmentally friendly such as being able to bypass or convert the by-products which are harmful to the environment , such as greenhouse gases or toxic waste .
Moreover , not only should the product solve the initial problem , it should also meet the society's demand in terms of usability , ergonomics and economical concerns .
Thereafter , the next step would be the process of selecting the solution for implementation .
This process selects a solution generated in the previous step that best meets the requirements of the problem .
Each problem is different and unique; thus , they would have different factors to consider for analysis .
Every design is rated based on the consideration of various factors such as functionality , ergonomics , mechanics , manufacturability , safety , cost-effectiveness and compliance with regulations .
(Khandani , 2005) The solutions would then be rated according to different criteria corresponding to the analysis and the best would then be selected .
Since the need for an environmentally friendly product is the emphasis for the invention , its functionality would naturally be a priority for consideration .
After functionality , safety is another area of concern .
Finally , the solution will only be implemented after going through a series of rigorous tests and improvements .
In conclusion , engineering design process is a general process through which ideas can be generated to resolve current issues .
One of the main human needs of the current millennium would be to have a sustainable environment in view of the rapid progression of our technology .
Engineering design process is able to address this issue by encompassing and focusing on the element of environmental friendliness for every invention .
Technological developments are divided into two different categories: the conventional method of developing technology through research or the unusual method of developing technology through serendipitous discovery .
The two technological innovations discussed would be the Laptop Computer and Sildenafil (Viagra) .
Though they are on the opposite spectrum in terms of the field of technology , both have similarities in their own way .
One difference , aside from their uses , is the manner in which they were developed .
The development of the laptop in Toshiba took on a systematic and direct approach towards an apparent goal: to reduce the size of a personal computer so it would be compact enough and portable .
On the other hand , Sildenafil , the compound in Viagra , was synthesised and studied initially for usage in treating hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a heart disease) .
However , clinical trials showed that it did not treat angina but instead , stimulate significant penile erection .
The company , Pfizer , thus decided to manufacture the compound into pills and market it as a drug to treat erectile dysfunction .
Yet , aside from being products of different fields , both technologies were able to be commercialized into products successfully .
Pfizer managed to patent the newly synthesised Sildenafil , incorporate it into pill form before marketing it as an oral treatment for erectile dysfunction .
In 2000 , Viagra sales accounted for 92 percent of the global market for prescribed erectile dysfunction pills .
(Keith A 2000) The laptop was a radically different innovation then; nevertheless , it was marketed furiously and soon had majority market shares in Europe , United States and Japan (Rogers 2003) .
Another similarity between the two technologies was that they had competitors .
Global shares of Viagra dropped to 50 percent due to other erectile dysfunction pill manufacturers like Cialis , Levitra and several counterfeits and clones .
( Berenson , 2005) .
Toshiba , similarly , has seen its fair share of competition with leading names like Dell , Apple and Fujitsu .
Finally , both innovations have helped enrich the lives of people by addressing a need or a problem .
Offices in Japan are crowded and homes are small with no space to install a desktop , giving rise to a need for smaller personal computers .
The problem of male erectile dysfunction was solved by the innovative development of Viagra , though it was a 'coincidence' that the compound Sildenafil causes penile erection .
Transportation is a necessity that humans cannot live without .
The number of cars on the road keep on increasing year by year and so does the pollution that arises from it .
Therefore engineers need to come up with better design of environmentally friendly hybrid cars that run on green energy fuel to replace the current diesel engine cars .
The first step in engineering better hybrid cars is to define the problems of current hybrid cars and to gather information about them .
Current hybrid cars available in the market are not practical and do not appeal to the mass market .
Some of the factors include the lack of recharging stations and the high cost of producing it .
This deters consumers from switching their old diesel powered cars to the more environmentally friendly hybrid cars .
We also need to make a complete market survey on the reasons why hybrid cars are not getting the attention of consumers .
As stated by Khandani in "Engineering Design Process , 2005" , consumers are the one that ultimately establishes the need for a product .
Thus , understanding this need of environmentally friendly hybrid cars is of importance before proceeding to the next step of the design solution .
Next , engineers need to generate multiple solutions for the hybrid cars .
This includes brainstorming sessions to find new alternative fuels and designing a new engine that can run on such fuels .
Engineers also need to make comparison between the latest hybrid cars such as electric cars , hydrogen fuel cell cars and solar powered cars to see which one is more efficient and suitable .
Willingness to take risks and experiment with new alternative fuels is also important so that more creative ideas can be generated .
Lastly , after going through rigorously analyzing and selecting the final design , we need to make a prototype of the hybrid car and test its overall function in real world situations .
This will reveal the weaknesses in the design; hence the engineers can improve on it .
We also need to test and check various criteria so that the hybrid car meets the needs of the consumers .
Documentation and patent on the overall design should be done at this stage .
Then , we need to execute extensive marketing and awareness campaign to get consumers to buy the hybrid car .
To conclude , engineering a new design of environmentally friendly hybrid car helps to reduce pollution by using green fuels such as electric and solar power .
Creative engineering design can produce a paradigm shift for people to start using environmentally friendly cars due to all their positive advantages .
The birth of the battery can be back to several hundreds years ago , but it failed to dominate the energy carrier market since its two obvious weakness , which cannot be improved easily .
Firstly , the battery is limited by its energy capaccoalThe coility of the traditional battery is too small to supply the big machines continuously , especially the cars .
It can only be used in some trivial electric devices such as mp3 player .
The second weakness of battery is its charge time: comparing to the refueling of the fossil fuel , the battery charge takes too much time .
It reduces thcomparedncy of the battery .
These two elements together impede battery to be anis onlytant energy carrier , and finally lead to today's situation of energy carrier market .
Although battery is not widelbe traced backtoday , it is possible to change the situation by innovating .
To enhance the capacitybecause ofhe battery , keep weaknessesew materials is important .
Since the new battery is designed to use in the big machines to replace engines , the capacity will have the priority .
The engineers can try some heavy materials without worrying about the weight and volume .
Additionally , the engineers can also playersgn the energy system of the big machines to cooperatecompared battery to get a best efficiency .
To shorten the charge time , the technicians can get some ideas from the design of small batteries , which can be fully chthe batteryn fifteen minutes .
The last part of the process is to sell the products .
The popularization of battery is not isolated; as an energy carrier , it should be tkeepingher with the innovation of the electrical cars and other engineering prodbe useds to form an industry chain .
The chain will also include the battery charge station , which will replace the refueling station as the popularization of battery .
withTo sum up , the engineering design process can be a good way to innovate new generation of battery .
A process that includes defining , golving and selling will build a wh industry chain of new battery , and finally meet the energy carrier need of the society .
In cities around the world , a large amount of energy is consumed by electrical appliances every day .
By designing better electrical appliances that could perform the same function with less energy used , we could save a large amount of energy .
One example would be designing a fridge that uses less power to run .
With less energy used , costs of living are reduced and the economy would improve with more people having more money to spend .
Another way to improve the economy would be through the designing of new forms of energy sources .
As the natural resources are depleting , the price of using it as source of energy is becoming increasingly high .
One such example would be the price of petrol .
Therefore , through the discovery of new forms of convenient and renewable energy , the price of energy could be more stable .
A more stable price reduces the chance of a big change that could lead to economy problems .
Given the current shaky economy , another big upset would have an adverse effect on our lives .
Therefore , a stable economy is essential for us to progress in technology and having a more reliable source of energy is the key to it .
To sum up , a stable and better economy is the current human need that should be given priority to  .
Engineers could design or discover better transports , electrical appliances and energy to ensure a better and more stable economy .
With a better economy , more energy could be invested into the research sector to discover more inventions to improve our lives , inventions that could save , lengthen lives or make life more enjoyable .
The population of India is rapidly multiplying , increasing from 1 .147 billion in 2008 to 1 .15 billion in 2009 , in a course of just one year .
This makes it difficult to implement innovations , esIndialy in relation to engineering design .
Having a literacy rate of 61 percent , it is quite difficult to introduce new technological innovations , as not all the people in the country would underproblems unclear meaningize the product well .
Another problem is 'Brain Drain' or "human capital flight" (Ramones , n .d .) which began taking away India's brain power at a rapid rate .
This is because the job opportunities are better in foreign countries in comparison with the state of unemployment in India .
"This concept of taking education in a country but earning for another is known as brain drain .
"(Bhargava Tarang , n .d .) The western countries open up more job opportunities as they acquire cheap and hardworking labour .
Problems such as second highest population , vast size , low literacy rate and 'Brain Drain' have made it difficult for India to take a step towards technological innovations in the field of engineering design .
Currently , corruption is wide-spread in India .
"India is ranked 85 out of a 179 countries in {Transparency International}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Transparency_International]'s{Corruption Perceptions Index}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index] , although its score has improved consistently from 2 .7 in 2002 to 3 .4 in 2008 ."
(CNN-IBN , 2007) .
The revenue involved in this waspread mishap is very high , thereby affecting all the facets of the country .
Even the poverty stricken section of the society is forced to bribe the officials for their living .
Right from education every other field in India is flooded withthoseimarily work with a self centered mindset to misappropriate and amass huge amount of money .
These individuals are indifferent to the fact that majority of India's population is below the poverty line .
While the rich get richer , the poor keep gettithe secondrer .
The 'black' money does not get released into the economy for the fear of law and hence hampers the economy , widening the bridge between the 'haves and have nots' , pulling more people under the poverty line .
This multi faceted economic problem poses as the main hindrance to India's technological development and is the mother of all other social and political problems that India faces .
becomesthe majoritya hugeDespite having morbid and influential problems , population and corruption , India is still a fore runner in the economic scenario and has a steady development rate .
The reason for this is its integrity .
Furthermore the young generation is well informed and is taking several initiatives to rectify the previously committed mistakes , thus causing the country to accelerate in a path of new economic revelations .
How do we invent products or systems ?
Do we simply just think of an idea and create a product to try and solve a problem ?
As engineers , most of us will use a process identified as the engineering design process .
The design process is a 5 stage process which includes defining the problem , gathering useful information , finding multiple solutions , narrowing down the solution and testing and implementing the solution(Khandani ,2005) .
The 5 stages are sequential , which means that an interruption in any of the 5 steps can hamper the engineering design process .
In Malaysia , engineering design processes for innovation have not been evolving as much as the government would them to .
The problems that contribute to this are that there are not many quality engineers left in Malaysia and because of the local society's mindset .
The first problem is the lack of quality engineers left in Malaysia .
Most engineers leave for financial reasons .
The value of the ringgit is rather low so engineers tend to favor working overseas as there , the salary is higher and the working environment is much better .
For example , Malaysians who study in Singapore are required to sign a bond which ties them to work in Singapore for a few years .
After working in Singapore , most of them will not return to work in Malaysia as the pay in Singapore is almost double compared to the pay in Malaysia .
In addition , the engineers produced in local universities are not able to fill the gap left by the engineers who leave the country .
The second problem is the society's mindset .
Malaysians have a very conservative way of thinking .
Furthermore , they are not willing to take new risks in terms of design innovation .
Malaysians are easily contented and refuse to improve on existing innovations and technologies .
Malaysians are also uncooperative in their work .
They are not willing to seek help from foreign countries and contract most of the work to unqualified local companies .
Apart from that , it is well known how corrupted the country is .
Corruption can lead to unmotivated work ethics .
The problems listed above can have an impact on all or one of the 5 stages of the engineering design process .
First and foremost , the conventional thinking of Malaysians can affect the first stage of the process of defining the problem .
Their traditional thinking will not be able to identify what the needs of the country are .
The uncooperative nature of the country can influence the design process in terms of generating multiple solutions .
We need to work together with other nations to tackle a problem because other countries may have different views of a problem  .
Most significantly , because of the insufficient number of engineers in the country , we are just not able to get enough manpower to accomplish the design process .
In conclusion , the progress of engineering design is being disrupted by the mindset of the local society and the lack of engineers .
As the rest of the world continues to improve technologically , we can only advance at a slower pace .
There is a need for an attitude change in both the government and the society .
Engineers should remain in the country and not just leave for personal benefits .
They should consider helping to improve the level of design innovation in the country so that we can compete globally .
SCWR as one of the six reactor concepts for Generation IV nuclear fuel , share the same e with all other reactors and some further predominance compared with other reactors .
Generating electricity in a sustainable , economically viable , sadisclosed ,e manner is the basic goals of Generation IV .
Sustainable means that the system should generate power by some natural fuel , at the same time , minimize the emeetental impact .
Economically viable means that the generating cost should be competitive with other energy resources , meanwhile the capital investment should also be low enough to allow access to a large number of countries .
Safe and reliable mainly emphasize that the future reactors should perform bett least as well in terms of the safety and reliability as current ones .

Furthermore , the SCWR  .oSCWRsot require steam separator plates , heat exchangers nor turbines compared with BWR .

The SCWRough SCWR owns lots of benefits , two main concerns about the cost nsharesety limited the population of this reactor .
Opponents way argadvantagescost of nuclear energy is not equivalent to what we have paid .
This means that the electrical power which is generated by nuclear is very costly .
Actually , the cost of nuclear energy can be divided into 4 parts: the construction costwhile atthe operating ominimizingcits of waste disposal and Beingdecommissioning the plant .
For the operating cost , the cost of producing electricity has dwhilefrom 3 .63 cents per KWHr to 1 .68 cent since 1987 .
In the USA , the nuclear power operators are char'Safe and reliable' KW-Hr femphasizessposal of Nuclear Waste and the average decommissioning cost is $300 million .
In fact , these costs are all affordable compared with other kinds of method .

Not only does design entail a magnificent facade or the strange opinion of a maverick , but it also involves pragmatism , cost and efficiency .
All these requirements are fully met  by those who are well educated .
However , while there is a highly increasing demand for engineers with acuity of design , even in the education system of my own country , there are two major setbacks for engineering students getting adequate design skills: the lack of practice in school and the insufficiency of co-curricular activities .
Firstly , students in high schools do not have enough useful practice time in their schedule .
Although the curriculum has  been continually improved to gradually reduce the use of conventional teaching methods ,  .
The reason is that the acquisition of new equipment needed for experiments is not in tandem with the changing of textbooks .
Only in the urban areas can students have opportunities to get access to the required equipment .
For students in other places , they can only see the teacher do a sample experiment in the lecture but cannot try the experiments  themselves .
Even worse in some remote areas , students can only listen to the description of the experiment by the teacher .
According to the Labor Newspaper , in Hung Yen , a southern province of Viet Nam , there are thousands of students  studying without sufficient lab equipment due to the delay in  purchasing new equipment and due to corruption .
In these regions , another factor that breaks the camel's back is the exodus of young lab teachers to cities where they can have a conducive environment to develop their own career and earn a better living .
The residue of this migration is an old generation of teachers who are not very familiar with modern devices in labs .
Consequently , students do not have the chance to gain the priceless pragmatic experience of how to design  .
Secondly , students do not attend enough efficient co-curricular activities in school .
This can be accounted for by the fact that there are few organizations in almost all schools .
There was , in fact , only one organization , namely the Youth Union , in my secondary school .
When I went to high school , luckily we had three organizations: the Youth Union , Harmonica club and PTNK Soccer league .
Though activities held by the above organizations ranged from learning history to acquiring leadership , not many students benefited from them .
That is due to the fact that the number of participants for one activity just covered a small portion of all the students in school .
Moreover , since co-curricular activities are not compulsory in our country , and the studying in other learning centers takes up almost all the time of students , studentstend to drop co-curricular activities in school .
The Youth Newspaper recorded a New Zealand professor saying that Vietnamese students spend so much time on gaining academic knowledge that co-curricular activities have become a luxury .
The two aforementioned issues leave engineering students  .
For one thing , students who are not used to doing lab research usually have just a vague idea of what should be done .
For them , the first step of the design process seems to be far away as they cannot define the problems completely since "people have a natural tendency to attack the current solution to a problem rather than the problem itself" (Khandani , S . , Engineering design process , page 8) .
As a result ,  the rest of the process can be ruined because of the first steps; for example , if the problem statement is not broad enough , the statement will preclude  new thoughts on the issue .
it is arduous to undo the whole process ,  these novice engineers have to accept low-quality products and , consistently , low profit .
Another thing is that without experiments in co-curricular activities , fledgling engineers cannot fulfill the second and the third steps: collecting pertinent information and generating multiple solutions .
This is because they lack confidence in communicating with other colleagues to gather information as well as learning experience , so they can hardly find out the most  information .
Co-curricular activities also help engineering students develop creativity and imagination to come up with many answers to a single question .
If students do not actively join various activities , they will be prone to solely apply rules and theory in school to work .
However , "creativity is much more than just a systematic application of rules and theory to solve a technical problem" .
(Khandani , S . , Engineering design process , page 11) .
Losing creativity and imagination means that they are losing their advantage in  .
As a result , the difficulty in dealing with the first three steps is a veritable hindrance for the whole project .
In brief , what impedes engineering process design for innovation in my country's education system is the lack of practice and co-curricular skills .
However , with efforts to reform the education , I optimistically believe that we can overcome these obstacles to be competitive engineers in the global market .
Design is a must for any product .
If there is no design , there will be no end product .
In Singapore , there are problems that hamper engineering design processes for innovationsuch as problems like lack of creativity and time taken to create a full design .
These problems may impact the market resulting in consequences such as the unavailability of new products , poor design outcome and changing mindsets of potential designers .
First , there is a lack of creativity .
Every individual has a different mindset; some are born lazy , while some are not .
In Singapore , a number of us are of the lazy type , which means we are lazy to design .
Moreover , there are some that are shy to speak up about their ideas .
Another problem would be individuals with fixed mindsets , thinking that designing is not a good path to take .
For example , in Marcelo Ang's (2009) talk , he mentioned that it is always the mental block of an individual that makes everyone think of not going for designing .
Hence there is a need to remove that mental block , so that  individuals will have the opportunity to design and invent what they desire  .
This mindset may cause the market to lose  good designers , who could potentially help boost the design industry .
This will impact the market because there will be an unavailability of new products .
Without people designing new products  , there will be no new products in the market .
This in turn will cause the market to suffer .
In the article "Designing engineers to change the world" , Chan (2009) mentioned that market users always demand  new products which they are fascinated with .
Moreover , when there are no new products , these potential customers are lost , hence causing causing the market to suffer .
Second ,  is due to the time taken to create a full design product .
A design process is not the outcome of one night's work .
It might take days and months to perfect the design so as to ensure that the end product is good .
Thereafter , more problems may arise such as finding and building of the parts and materials that are not readily available in Singapore .
For example , a lot of stress tests had to be done during the process of making NEWater (2008) .
These included tests on humans to confirm that Newater was fit for drinking before it was produced for public consumption .
Those tests were not done in a day or month .
They took more than a year to complete .
leads to other effects and impacts the market .
People tend to go for simpler designs , because of the long time required to create a proper full design .
The reason is that a simple design is much easier to design and time required to produce such a design would be much less .
This results in poor designs being produced in the market .
Hence market users will not be tempted to buy the product , which would cause  sales and the market to be low .
Additionally , this also leads to lost income for designers as they might not earn their production cost back .
Eventually potential designers would have second thoughts and step out of designing .
In conclusion , the lack of creativity and the time to create a design could cause impacts on the market in Singapore .
These problems that may hamper  engineering design would impact the market causing the unavailability of new products , designers taking shortcuts in design and designers' mindsets about design .
In addition , this would lead to a market downturn .
I personally feel that the most common problem originates from every individual's mindset , when they have already made up their mind .
It's hard to change it once it's fixed .
I believe that if an individual takes up the courage to change , and design a proper design , it would resolve the problems that are hampering the design process for innovation .
We humans always dream .
We have never been satisfied with what we want .
We are always out there looking for something better .
It might seem that we are greedy  , but the fact that I am writing this essay sitting comfortably in an air conditioned room is fact enough to validate our greed and curiosity .
If we weren't always greedy for more , just imagine how different the world would have been .
Just an hour without  electricity would make life intolerable for everyone .
The boom of innovation and technology in the past few decades has  been tremendous .
Every country wants to be technologically forward and pumps in enormous amounts of money and resources into leading innovations and research developments .
However , the standard of research and innovation in every country varies to a great deal .
This is influenced by the different prevailing social and economic atmospheres .
Now I am going to talk about the various issues that hamper engineering design and innovations in my own country , India .
The first thing that comes to one's mind when one reads about India is its vast size and a whopping population of over 1 .1 billion (Population Council , 2009) .With such a vast population , the onus on the government to ensure the welfare of the people is tremendous .
With a large part of the population depending on the government for subsidies and food  , most of the annual budget is spent in ensuring that the people are well fed .
With India being a democratic country , the major revenue for the government is taxes paid by the people .
With the standard of living not being quite high , the revenue earned by the government is also quite limited .
Therefore , the amount of money the government can afford to spend on  research projects is quite little compared to other countries .
India spends only 450 million USD per year on research (The Acorn n .d .) .
One of the major responsibilities of the government of any country is providing quality education to the nation's children .
This has always been quite a problem for India .
With its vast size and population a lot of the rural areas still lack proper schools .
Fifty percent of the children living in these rural areas leave school before completing their fifth grade ( The English Argument  , Prashant Mekala  ,December 8  ,1995) .
These children then end up in manual labour .
This is quality human resource lost .
These children may one day have turned into great thinkers and scientists  ,but due to the lack of proper facilities , they drop out of school .
It is no wonder that India lags behind in technological innovations and research .
However , in the cities , the quality of education is world class .
The people educated in the cities are now exposed to the entire world .
They are quite well learned .
Some of them  leave the country in search of better prospects in the developed countries .
The chance of earning huge sums of money and of obtaining a quality lifestyle  makes them leave their country as though they are leaving their house to take a leisurely stroll .
With the government spending huge sums of money on them and these people not even repaying the government by working here and paying taxes here  , their departure is a huge blow for the government .
More than 300 ,000 Indians migrate to the United States and over 75 percent of these people have had tertiary education (Finance and development  , June 1999) .
With such highly educated individuals leaving the country , the scope for leading research becomes quite limited .
Another factor is that a lot of the developed countries attract foreign talent  .
India is not able to do that .
With the standard of living and environment not meeting that of the developed countries we are unable to attract brilliant individuals from different parts of the world .
With all these factors playing a role  , the engineering design and innovation in India is significantly hampered .
Steps have been taken to minimise the effects of these factors  , but there is still a long way to go to see all these factors vanishing altogether .
Several private organisations have started helping the people in what little way they can .
Innovation engineering has been a commonly recurrent phrase in the industries in the recent years .
However , exactly how many engineers fully understand the full meaning and implications behind the simple phrase ?
Furthermore , how many understand the long and exhausting process required for innovative engineering operations to be executed and optimized ?
The process of concept generation , product testing and product implementation requires a lot of resources .
These resources come in the form of time , which translates to financial terms , and experience in the process .
In the Singapore society which is relatively result orientated , people tend to be afraid to try out new ideas as they are afraid they will lose out to the intense competition they face from  others .
Hence , engineers would rather stick to tried and proven methods that are seen to be effective , instead of exploring  alternative methods .
However , these engineers fail to realise that failures are the key to innovation .
Without having gone through failures , new and better processes would not be properly developed , and thus optimisation would not be achieved .
The environment makes it hard for companies to allocate resources for innovation , and at the same time , keep the company's competitive edge in the market .
Due to this problem , fresh ideas would not even have a chance to be developed , not to say move towards the implementation of the idea .
has gradually developed into an inflexible culture , where our workers choose to stick to current beliefs rather than try out new ideas .
Generating new concepts does not just require a single day of effort , as  people believe , but instead requires a longer thought process which may take days or even months .
The culture in Singapore does not even allow our workers to make time for this crucial concept generation process .
Another problem we face in Singapore is the lack of experience our country has in the innovative engineering field .
Compared to developed countries , which have years of experience in the field , our nation has just begun to prosper .
Previously , public policies have guided our nation towards the manufacturing arena .
This has given rise to various government bodies efficient in international operating and manufacturing standards .
However , it has only been in recent years that our government has moved towards research and development .
Therefore , it would take quite some time to gear local engineers towards an innovative mindset .
Engineering processes not only rely on theories , but a lot on the engineer's experience .
Chief engineers who have been in the field for a period of time would be valuable resources .
However , it would take years for a new generation of engineers to be trained in innovative engineering .
Innovative engineering requires the engineer to venture into areas which have yet to be explored , which makes  experience even more vital , as it would allow problems to be identified even before they occur .
Such problems would most probably not have been explored by current engineers .
The majority of Chinese citizens have just received junior middle schooChina still faceshool education as a result of the large population and the developing econoto figure out the lack of knowledge about engineering design which results in the low acceptancprocedures of verification for licensing , there is nearly no such words related to engineering design .
Except the flourishing cities , such as Shanghai and Beijing , in most parts of China , people seldom hear of engineering design , not to mention to understand it .
People do not know how to make use of the new technologies and new products so that it is easy to imagine the situation where engineering design processes for innovations receive not much or little support from the public in China and people .
Sometimes engineering design may interfere some persons'interests in the short run .
For example , when a kind of new technology is being marketed , perhaps some people who earn a living by the old technology or products , like hand embroidery will suffer market competition even huge losses .
Without the proper understanding , people mostly object engineering design , let alone the support .
There is no doubt about the trouble caused by such condition to engineering projects .
In brief , both the low level of enducation and the gap between traditional craftsmen and developers of new technologie lead to the low acceptance of engineering design in China .
Another serious problem for enginonly receivehe complex verification before licensing procedures for engineering projects due to the incomplete law system .
As a developing country , China sunderstandffort to revise the lawon gradual improvement .
However , there are still some problems hampering engineering design to some extent .
In most cases , it costs quite a lot for project managers tin et the licence for n engineering project , not just money and time , but also the interpersonalelationship .
In China , interpersonal relationships are still one of the most important factoto survive successfully in the complexiety like China and one has to put much effort to establish and maintain interpersonal relationships .
In other words , without a healChinese governmental relationship , it is really hard to survive interfere with Taking into account all of the abovetermements , there is no wonder at the high cost in time and labour for a licence of engineering project .
It does not just waste a lot of tie for ana perspectiveon project , but also pascompetition andeeven maked of inspiration for innovation .
Finally , it is most peoplehwould objectoto engineeringke to pronot to saysupport itg for an intricate process owing to the desire for an innovation project .
in the case ofThisan engineeringforto obtainlabour is requiredin terms ofput inafactors necessaryThe problems all above are related to people's attitudes towarverification procedures for licensingsituation for engineering innovations , implying the heavy going improvement of engineering design .
Even though , it is a journey of hardships for Chinese innovations in the field of engineering design , which really suffers quite a lot at the moment , the future for Chinese engineering innovations is still bright with the government striving to achieve the goal for pervision .
In today's world , the significance of nuclear energy cannot be ignored .
In some countries , nuclear energy plays an important role  in power production .
Currently , "nuclear energy supplies about 80% and 30% of the electricity in France and Japan respectively"() .
More prominently , countries are using nuclear energy to make powerful weapons for military purposes .
We know how Iran and North Korea have been using their nuclear 'power' to negotiate with the US .
However , these powerful weapons  were not within scientists' imagination of how nuclear energy would be utilised .
Scientists probably had intended to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes like using it as an alternative source of energy  .
Hence , we shall examine how nuclear energy  and how it is important to the world now and in the near future .
Nuclear energy was discovered in the early 1990s () .
Scientists discovered that a huge amount of energy could be produced from the nuclear fission of the element uranium .
We shall not go down to the details of that process but it was a major scientific discovery as it led to another form of energy production .
Unfortunately , nuclear energy's first real useful application was on Japan's cities where two nuclear bombs landed and caused massive destruction .
While this historical event marked the end of WWII , it presented nuclear energy to the rest of the world .
Soon , countries like Russia and China became nuclear 'powers' as well .
Their governments funded nuclear research and the setting up of more nuclear reactors .
Naturally , nuclear weapons became increasingly sophisticated as nuclear countries reinvented these weapons and vied to be the most powerful nuclear state in the world .
Now , nuclear weapons , from what we know , can be flown to a faraway place to cause massive destruction .
However , the use of nuclear weapons on another country has been non-existent since WWII as countries realize the chaos they could cause .
Moreover , the primary purpose of nuclear energy is to generate electricity .
Unlike energy produced by burning carbon , nuclear energy is clean as no greenhouse gases is produced from nuclear plants , where nuclear energy is made .
Using more nuclear energy and less carbon-generated energy to produce electrical energy could mean a significant decrease in greenhouse gases and a cleaner earth to live on .
Countries like France rely on nuclear power as much as other countries  rely on carbon to generate electricity .
Hence , nuclear energy might become essential in the near future as the world seeks to solve the energy-related problems such as global warming .
At the same time , just like any other forms that could be used to generate electricity , nuclear power is not a perfect source of energy  .
The danger of radioactivity is always imminent as critics often refer to the nuclear accident in Chernobyl that resulted in many deaths and serious repercussions such as unnatural births many years after the accident .
In addition , even if nuclear accidents do not occur , spent nuclear fuel would remain radioactive for decades .
As a result , land space has to be sacrificed to accommodate waste storage .
In conclusion , nuclear energy would probably play an important as the Earth's carbon resources are gradually being depleted .
However , nuclear countries should only encourage research on nuclear energy production for peaceful purposes .
They should not use it as a weopon in war as this could spell the end of the world .
The creation of NEWater , a technology where used water is treated to become potable , is one of the few examples of success in the research of technology in Singapore .
Prior to this achievement , the PUB (Public Utilities Board) faced many obstacles and that included the lack of engineering technology which made the cost of implementation unrealistic .
As a result , this plan was shelved in the 1980s .
Similarly , Singapore is currently facing problems that hamper its ambition of coming up with great innovations .
One of these problems is the rigid education system that is restricting the growth of the minds of young Singaporeans , mainly the teenagers .
At the same time , the comfortable state of living in Singapore poses a challenge to provoking the minds of its people to improve their current state of living .
All these may then lead to the slowdown of  technological advancement in Singapore .
The Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore adopts an academic based education system , where excellent examination results are prioritized over the creativity of one's mind .
Parents and teachers emphasize a lot on obtaining 'A' grades and hence students have a misconception towards education .
They have the impression that doing well in examinations equates to success in their future endeavours .
Moreover , achievingacademic promotion mainly requires students to reproduce their knowledge conservatively without much consideration .
As such , less time is made for attending brain teasing courses which  , in almost all cases ,  are made optional to students and whose importance is not highlighted .
Hence , 'students from Singapore top results in Mathematics and Science among their peers from 41 other countries but when it comes to designing , Singaporeans are way behind their foreign peers' (Boston College , n .d .) .
It is thus evident that Singaporean students are proficient in examination questions yet fail in creativity .
In view of the limited development in creativity of the people here , there is no doubt why the ability to design novel engineering processes is beginning to be seen as an outstanding talent in our society .
The other problem Singapore faces is , ironically , its high standard of living .
More importantly , the efficient system of governance in Singapore lives up to most of the promises made to its people during general elections .
Given the comfortable lifestyle they are enjoying , the idea of bringing about a change is not  the people's priority .
For instance , the government has upgraded the facilities in housing estates through  the implementation of schemes such as the Lift Upgrading Scheme , and this has brought about the 'tardiness' in Singaporeans in thinking about further improvements to their life .
Their focus , instead , is directed at their routine occupational job and their own family matters and therefore , the element of creativity is not part of their daily life .
Consequently , these problems result in the failure to generate creative ideas as a solution or improvement to the people's surroundings .
The scope of their thoughts is relatively narrow and hence they usually fail to come up with innovations that are beyond their imagination .
Surprisingly , what Singaporeans have in mind as the ideal solution may not be in tandem with that of foreigners .
Eventually , without a niche in designing , they will  lose out to the 'brains' from other countries when it comes to employment for 'a designer is a planner with an aesthetic sense' (Bruno Munari , n .d .) .
Not only is knowledge important , but originality too plays an important role when it comes to being a great innovator .
In conclusion , Singapore has to move away from its current mindset and practices in order to succeed in coming up with engineering design processes for innovations .
For example , Singapore needs to , and has already begun to , deviate from its regimental approach of learning .
MOE has been 'moving in recent years towards nurturing young Singaporeans who ask questions , and who are willing to think of new ways to solve new problems ,' (Ministry of Education , n .d .) in an attempt to inculcate the positive mindset of learning at a tender age .
In the meantime , Singapore has also declared that it will increase its investment in research and development (R&D) to 3% of its GDP by 2010 .
(ChannelNewsAsia , 2007) .
The bold decision to invest billions of dollars into R&D will make people realize the importance of innovations to the sustainability of Singapore and no doubt open up more avenues for new discoveries to be made .
All in all , both measures that the Singapore government is taking clearly reflect on its intention to drive Singapore to become one of the leading countries in terms of technology .
"Think outside the box .
"This is the sentence that we have all heard many times before when it comes to innovation .
Singapore , as a young nation with no natural resources , depends heavily on its human resources to survive .
To be able to capture the consumers in the market , we have to be innovative in product design .
However , I think problems like the fixed mindset of the person and the lack of resources may hamper  engineering design processes for innovations .
Firstly , many people have a fixed mindset .
They tend to worry about what others might think and are afraid of criticism by others .
Self-criticism is also another issue that hinders creativity .
Most people believe themselves to be lacking in creativity and think that others will not like their ideas .
Hence , during a presentation , they present their ideas with little or no confidence because they are afraid of making fools of themselves .
Therefore , others will take it that there is a lack of enthusiasm in the idea .
Moreover , if someone receives a negative response , there is a high chance that he will not pursue any innovative attempts anymore .
Sometimes , people have the tendency to make products too complex or are too focused on factors like usability that it results in a design barrier .
Not everyone encourages new ideas .
Often their reaction to new things is negative .
This will also further hinder creativity .
Secondly , since Singapore is small , it is limited in resources .
We often have to import materials from other countries .
As a result , the cost of production will be expensive and people would rather choose to design a simple product instead of investing in  product innovation and research .
In addition , we have a small talent pool of people with innovative ideas .
Hence , most people do not possess the skills that are able to design any innovative products .
As a result of the problems that hamper  the engineering design process for innovation , many fail to identify  unmet needs of the market , causing the market to suffer .
Instead of having new  products in the market to capture the attention of the consumers , the market ends up with many different products having similar features and functions .
Furthermore , as mentioned by Chan in his lecture , many people are willing to pay more for design as well as for new products that they think are simple , practical and useful .
For instance , Apple iPhones were in high demand in the market during its launch because of their design , simplicity and reliability although the features of the iPhones are generally the same as many other smartphones in the market .
In conclusion , it is possible to avoid all aspects which will hamper  engineering design processes for innovations by changing the mindset of the people as well as finding alternative ways to solve the problem of the lack of resources .
We should attempt to make changes to our way of life in order to begin a larger change in our lives .
The engineering design process plays an important role in innovation and creativity .
Since the resources in the world are limited and decreasing , many countries are making efforts to develop the designing process to use the resources more efficiently toimprove the standard of life .
However , in my country there are still some problems that hamper  creativity and design , especially the lack of resources and the behavior of customers .
In this essay , I will discuss  these obstacles and how they affect the design process .
First of all , one of the biggest obstacles that hamper the engineering design process in my country is the lack of resources , which includes both  human resources and natural resources .
Human resources , in this case , refers to the labor force needed to design products with skill and knowledge .
Without knowledge , an engineer cannot start his designing process because he does not know where to begin and what to create .
As a result , the lack of human resource affects the design process at the very first stage .
Another factor that also hampers  creativity is the lack of natural resourcessuch as space , time and materials  for designing .
For example , in my country , many projects have to be postponed because there are not enough materials to make the products .
When waiting for the resources to be imported from other countries , these projects were still on the paper .
Therefore , natural resources are important at the stages of implement the ideas to create the products .
Secondly , the behaviors of the users also cause many problems when putting the products on the market .
Customers are usually afraid of changing the products they are currently usingt to new ones when they think the old ones are satisfactory .
Once they are used to  a current product , it is hard to persuade them to switch to a new one because they have to learn how to use the new device .
This may not be a big matter for the young but with the old people , the problem is much  greater .
For example , my mother will only use the traditional line-phone and not the cell-phone because making a call with the hand-phone is more complex than just picking up the line-phone handset and dialing the number .
Consequently , a new product , although functionally well designed , could be easily refused if it was not friendly to users .
In this situation , the behaviors of the customers are the key factors which directly determine the success of the product in the last stages of the engineering design process: making the product and bringing it to the market .
In conclusion , the two factors of lack of resources and behaviors of the customers cause great problems to the engineering design process in my country .
They affect most stages of the design process as they can postpone the process or even  stop it .
Unfortunately , these problems cannot be solved in the short term; it will require much effort to bring back the knowledge and materials into my country .
Have you ever wondered how many vending machines  the National University of Singapore has ?
Believe it or not , it is reported that there are over 100 vending machines in this university alone (National University of Singapore , 2009) .
Vending machines are available almost everywhere .
We can see them in hospitals , parks and even jungles !
There is no doubt that this invention has influenced our modern life to a great extent .
However , this technology only came on the market in the early 1880s , although the first vending machine was invented by a Greek engineer named Hero of Alexandria many centuries ago around 10 A .D . to 70 A .D . CITATION Eri06 \l 1033 (Jaffe , 2006) .
Various factors have contributed to allow such an invention to be widely adopted in today's world .
The major reason for the popularisation of the vending machine is due to the rising wage cost during the 1880s .
"In the 1880s , common occupations included cobblers , daguerreotypists , nail makers , spinners , watchmakers , candle makers , gaslighters , milliners , washerwomen , tinkers , shoeblacks and glove makers ."
CITATION Pam09 \l 1033 (Schehl , 2009)  Pennsylvania , the southern state which once supported the idea of slavery , abolished its slavery system .
As the overall standard of living of the public began to rise in cities in the following years , most people were unwilling to take up the job of selling items like chewing gum and newspaper .
therefore the chewing gum company , Thomas Adams Gum , decided to build the first commercial vending machine , selling gums on train platforms CITATION Gum08 \l 1033 (Gumballs , 2008) .
This effectively saved the cost of employing a worker and improved the efficiency of the sales .
Ever since the first vending machine appeared , many companies have adopted this idea as the public has welcomed such an invention .
The convenience it has brought has definitely played a big part in its success .
From the consumer's perspective , cumbersome long queues can be avoided when he only needs to have a can of drink .
Furthermore , the simple manipulation of the vending machine and the hygienic storage is widely accepted by the masses .
From the vendor's perspective , the vending machine is favourable because it allows the selling of stocks that have a very long shelf life .
and the reliability of these vending machines is guaranteed .
Practically , they can be placed at any place , including rural locations .
This introduction of vending machines has improved and revolutionized the conventional way of merchandising .
In countries like Japan and Singapore , where there is a lack of space , the need for a condensed merchandiser which improves space efficiency is furthermore amplified .
As time gradually goes by , the population density of many countries increases .
Devices that free up more available spaces are gaining popularity .
In Japan , the available vending items range from instant noodles to cars !
CITATION Nat091 \l 1033 (Nate , 2009) The need to concentrate all stocks in a small space  .
In conclusion , the rising wage costs , demand for a more convenient way of selling certain products and the lack of space have shaped this technological innovation .
In addition , improvements of the vending machine havenot come to a halt as it continues to accommodate more human needs .
In years to come , more improved versions of the vending machine will be introduced to the society and bring more benefits to human kind .
The commercial nuclear power industry witnessed the worst nuclear power plant accident in its history in Chernobyl .
Reports pointed out that the disaster killed 56 people and caused about 336 ,000 people in contaminated areas in Russia , Belarus and Ukraine to evacuate and resettle (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
The accident raised the question about the safety of the nuclear power plant and the ways that people can prevent such accidents in future .
According to an article by Bernhard Wilpert from Technical University of Berlin , Germany , we can see that if psychology had been applied in the design process of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors , the disaster might not have happened .
After the accident , people tried to analyse what were the reasons that caused the malfunctioning of the power plant .
Several theories were proposed , but they mostly concentrated on two issues: the mistakes of the reactor crew and the deficiency in the design of the RBMK  reactor (a high-power channel reactor called reactor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny) (World Nuclear Association ,2007) .
These two factors-- one relating to humans and one relating to machines--can be eliminated by carefully using psychology in the design process .
Firstly , the human reasons for the accident come from various factors: the lack of knowledge of the reactor manager , the subjective points of view while performing unusual activities with the reactor and the weak communications between the workers in the power plant .
Since a nuclear reactor is described as a "complex high hazard systems" (Wilpert ,2007) ,  adequate and clear cognition is very important not only for  but also for all the workers in the manufacturing plant , where their collaboration  plays the key role in the work of the plant .
If the Chernobyl reactor crew had had enough information about the danger caused by the reactor when working in low power settings , they would never have performed the test to determine how long the turbines would spin and  following a loss of main electrical power supply .
Unfortunately , such tests were still carried out despite the instability of the plant under risky circumstances .
If we had applied psychology in the nuclear power plant , the workers would have been trained well and they would have giventhe rightresponses during the accident while running the plant .
However , the operators had broken many important rules of safety just to complete the test quickly: they had diminished the flow of coolant water , disabled the automatic shutdown mechanismsand released the control rods from the machine over the acceptable limit .
These actions resulted in increasing the amount of the energy produced to an uncontrollable level within a very short time and caused the explosions of the reactor .
Once again , the  .
Without proper knowledge and problem-solving skills  ,  and behaved in the wrong way when problems appeared .
Secondly , the other reason  is the flaws in the design of the RBMK reactor , especially the control rods .
Initially , the control rods were designed to slow down the reaction of the nuclear plant .
However , the engineer who had created the rods had not expected the chemical structure inside the rod to actually increase the reactions between the radiation atoms  the  moment they are put into the reactor .
In this case , the minimum requirements in testing the rods were not relevant .
the point is that the designers had  made the rods for working in stable conditions , not for such tests like this .
If the designers had applied psychology in the design process , they would have thought carefully and predicted the unexpected problems which might happen with the rods when using them .
Instead , they neglected the standard criteria just to make them simplerand cheaper but , unfortunately , more dangerous .
In addition , when the disaster happened , another serious mistake in building the nuclear power plant that reflected the weak cognition of the importance of psychology in design is that the wall around the reactor was not tough .
As a result , the wall was  and radioactivity was released freely into the atmosphere , which was extremely dangerous for humans and wildlife within a large area around the plant .
An absolute evidence that proves the necessity of psychological design is a similar accident with the Three Miles Island nuclear reactor in the US .
In this case , the wall of the reactor which had been built with Europe's high standards of safety had prevented the radiation from spreading into the air and no one had to die because of it (Grunwald , 2009) .
These examples show that even  machine errors can be eliminated by carefully designing and applying psychology in the design process to predict all the scenarios that may happen in the future .
Since the horrible accident of Chernobyl , the old technologies used to build the Chernobyl reactor have never been used again .
In addition , people have been doing research to improve the efficiency , the feasibility and  most important the safety of the power plants so that such disasters will never happen again .
It is said that ""(p)sychological methods , theories , and findings are becoming increasingly important to design" ( Benson , 2006) .
With the increasing collaboration between psychology and design ,  engineers have been using  for the design process to make more reliable and stable products .
Therefore , we can minimize the damage caused by accidents or even avoid them and increase the efficiency of  .
There are many social and economical factors in Singapore that are hamprankedg the country's engineering design processes for innovation .
Comparing to other countries , although Singapore do not have much technological constraints , there are a high GDPlot of factors hampering inventions and innovations in Singapore .
Two main problems are Singapore's small economic market and its ulation holding a resistance to change attitude .
Firstly , a small economic economic greatly hinder a country's engineering design process for innovation .
Due to the small geographicalComparedSingapore , its population is only less tdoesn six million people .
As a result , Singapore's economic market is not large .
Most inventions , be it new or improved from previous inventions , takes a vast amount of time and money before it might become an innovation .
Most engineersgners are reluctant to even try inventing or making innovative products as they know that their inventions will most likely not make much profit , or even worse , a loss .
Secondly , Singaporeans' refusal to take risk and their contentment with their current lifestyles are also causes for the hampering of engineering design processes for innovation in Sinthanre .
The mindset of resistances to change in Singaporeans greatly prevents good innovative ideas theyd the acceptance of such ideas .
Most Singaptakes are resistant to changes as they are tthey used to their current lifestyles .
They do not want any changes to what they already had .
Therefore , this will cause them not to expect for anything more or better and thus , not thinking of new ideas on how to immight makewhat they already had .
Furthermore , Singaporeans have strong refusal to tolerate risk .
Most Singaporeans do not dare to try new ideas as they fear of failing , in which most probably results in time and money loss .
Singapore's small economic market and itriskspulation holding a resistance to change attitude will have some bearing on the ena strongiaversiongn processes for innovation .
According to the book by Ullman , David resistancethere are ten building stages in the engineering design processes .
Namely "Identifying a need , Defining the problem , Conducting research , Narrowing the research , Analyzing set criteria , Finding alternative solutions , Analyzing possible solutiohave Mcision , Presenting the product , Commcating and selling the product" .
Singapthinkrefusal to leave their comfort zone will greatly ahavect the very first stage of the engineering design p"Identifying a need" .
It will be very hard for Singapore to discovewhat it stl needsusuallyple are content with what they already had .
On the other hand , Singapore's small economic market is affecting the second and third building stages in the engineering design processes , "Defining the problem and Conducting research" .
A small economic market is preventing engineers and designers from defining problems and conducting research as they fear it will most likely be non-profitable or at a loss .
havecontentedIn conclusion , the two main factors contributing to the hampering of engineering desehaveinnovations in Singapore are caused by Singapore's small economic market and its population holditant to change .
The process of inventing and innovations are crucial to al , namely Imagine a world at night without lights , which was also an invention turned innovation .
According to the Maslow's hierarchy of needs pyramid , physiological need is the most basic tier of the pyramid .
It is viewed as the most important need among the others .
Therefore , I think  medical needs are the one which I should give priority to .
Engineers play a very important role in designing new medical products to suit these human needs .
There are many different medical research areas which engineers could lay their hand on and design products according to stipulated requirements .
The most recent leading medical research areas are medical imaging , tissue engineering , pharmaceutical engineering , stem cell engineering and genetic engineering .
In my opinion , medical imaging is the most important area where we need to spend time and effort .
Medical imaging technology refers to the method or process used to obtain graphic images of the human body structure or organs .
It helps the doctor to diagnose diseases  at an earlier stage .
Throughout the years , various types of medical imaging technologies have been invented .
There are two main types of  medical imaging: invasive and non-invasive .
Invasive imaging includes nuclear medical imaging and X-ray imaging .
The invasive imaging method requires radioactive means to produce medical scanning which would have a possibility of causing harm to the human body but could be used on the majority of human body parts .
On the other hand , non-invasive imaging techniques like MRI and Ultra imaging would do the same job without causing any side effect on the patient .
The only set-back of such techniques is the high operation cost and constraints on the type of human body parts which they can be used on .
The engineering design process could be used on the invention of a new imaging technology .
This new imaging technology must have the advantages of both the non-invasive and invasive imaging .
Furthermore , it has to address the operation cost problem and the type of human body parts where the imaging device can be used on .
Another major concern in the engineering design process of the new imaging technology is providing higher resolution 3D/2D clinical image .
This will help the doctors to analyse a  patient with improved detailed images .
Since modern computers continually increase on processing speed and volume of memory , they will provide a huge support in designing better resolution image devices .
The only portion which engineers would need to figure out is how to lower the operation cost of such an imaging device .
In my opinion , the materials of the films and the simplicity of the devices would be important .
With  the new resolved imaging technology , more humans would be able to make use of such technology since its cost would be reduced .
Better clinical images would also be provided to the doctors; as a result , doctors would be able to provide a clearer diagnosis of the disease/illness of the patient .
Eventually , the average lifespan of a human would be prolonged with such devices since early detection of illness would be easier to treat and cure .
Lastly , engineers should view the medical imaging area as their priority since their innovations could resolve a lot of medical problems existing in the modern world .
Good health is still the most crucial area where everyone would wish to make their achievements in after all .
In order to successfully hold the 29th Olympic Games , the Beijing municipal government did all they could to optimize the transportation system in Beijing .
However ,  it was reported that the time every resident in Beijing spent on transportation per day reached five hours and five minutes in 2008 .
Obviously , nowadays there is nearly no more space for the transportation system to improve but  .
However , the problem is basically that people only make changes  to the traditional system , while in most cases a better system has to be built with the old one totally destroyed .
Therefore a big revolution in transportation has become one of the current human needs , which can be appreciated as one way to save human lives .
Starting from human needs , a new idea obtained by comparison can make  happen possibly in a few seconds .
What exactly is this new type of transportation ?
The following ideas are what I speculate on in terms of transportation in the future: The first step is to store the information of the people , that is , to break up the human body into atom-size particles and rearrangethe particles .
The second is to translate the information  and released , then  .
The third step is to transfer the electrical messages via electromagnetic waves to the destination .
Finally , the signal will be acknowledged at the destination .
Then the same people will be rebuilt there with the accurate human body information .
How did I develop this new idea ?
When facing a problem ,  an Engineering student should go back to the root of the problem .
Apparently , the human needs cause the problem .
, people complain about  time .
Therefore , the problem solver would find out which vehicle can save the most time .
Actually , light belongs to the electromagnetic wave family .
Fortunately , if the frequency is nicely set within a certain range , the wave can hardly be blocked ,  .
Since electromagnetic waves are used as the vehicle for many kinds of information , it is possible to use them to help send human body information as well .
As long as the real body can be translated into a certain kind of information , humans' transportation needs can be perfectly met .
Is this design realistic and feasible ?
Everything is possible .
Honestly , it is impossible to find a person who is willing to risk his whole life rather than waste five hours on the road every day .
However , the fact is that every organic body is made up of finite kinds of elements and every human activity is based on the same chemical foundation .
Therefore , it will be possible to decompose and recompose organs or tissues sooner or later .
As for the problem of energy reduction in transmission , it can be addressed by diversifying and complicating the structure of the body information .
In conclusion , engineering design should be based on human needs , a concept recently called "Human Oriented Design" or "humanization" .
Moreover , creativity stems from the analysisof what we have now , what we need to have in the future and most importantly what the differences between them are .
Actually , all of the above are just the writer's personal point of view .
Though most of them sound like fiction  , the dream is still achievable .
We are now just like our ancestors thousands of years ago thinking that step onto the moon is impossible .
In fact , the idea of travelling by light is like the concept of transporting through time which most scientists are doing research on now .
That is why we should have confidence in our technology and ourselves because nothing is impossible .
Have you ever wondered how many cars there are in the whole world ?
According to the article , "World's Most Congested Cities" ( Malone , 2006) , there are about 750 million vehicles (and counting) in the world , and at least 50 million cars are being manufactured in the world each year .
And out of the 750 million vehicles , 240 million come from the United States of America (USA) , and 850 thousand come from Singapore (US Commercial Service , 2008) .
From the above figures , the ratios of human beings to vehicles are approximately 5:4 , 1:3 and 8:8 respectively .
all these figures are crucial in pointing out that vehicles , gasoline-powered vehicles to be more specific , are important and have blended into our lives .
Although this technology is important , many do not know its history and that the development of the gasoline-powered vehicle was actually heavily influenced by political , economic and social factors .
Firstly , there were the economic factors , and these factors can be seen as "natural" and "man-made" .
The "natural" factor that caused a spike in the number of gasoline-powered vehicles was the declining cost of oil at that point in time , which made gasoline-powered vehicles a stronger competitor over the electric-powered vehicles , which were the more commonly- used vehicle .
In addition to the above-mentioned "natural" factor , there were several "man-made" economic factors , and the man behind these factors was Henry Ford .
Henry Ford was the man who mass produced and mass distributed the gasoline-powered vehicle .
One of the key economic factors that Henry Ford induced was that he collaborated with banks and introduced car insurances and loans (only if people purchased Ford's vehicles) , which actually amplified the effects of the declining cost of oil .
as a result , the gasoline-powered vehicle became even more economically competitive and appealing .
Furthermore , it also became more affordable in the sense that the insurances covered certain repair costs incurred by mishaps; and loans allowed people to pay up slowly because there was no "pay by instalments" scheme back then .
Consequently , by the laws of supply and demand , Ford increased the supply of gasoline-powered vehicles due to an increase in the demand for gasoline-powered vehicles  .
Hence , gasoline-powered vehicles took a huge step forward and got ahead of the electric-powered vehicles in terms of support .
The second set of factors were the political factors , and one of the main factors was the convenience the gasoline-powered vehicle brought about in World War I .
During World War I , the military realised that gasoline- powered vehicles were more convenient to use as compared to electric-powered vehicles because it was difficult to charge the battery of the electric-powered vehicle right in the midst of a battle where there was no electrical source .
This convenience was due to the fact that gasoline was portable and could be brought around on vehicles which allowed vehicles to be re- fueled at any time and place and this could be done very quickly .
Apart from the influence of the military , the government had a part to play as well , because the government implemented biased policies that involved building more gas stations and roads to cater to the gasoline-powered vehicles .
These implementations brought more convenience to users of gasoline-powered vehicles because gasoline was made more available , and places once inaccessible became accessible .
On the contrary , there was no "charging" station and roads were not very ideal for electric-powered vehicles to move on; basically , there was nothing done to cater to the electric-powered vehicles which made it difficult for people to utilise the electric-powered vehicles without having any worries .
As a result , the electric-powered vehicle continued to lose  support , and gasoline- powered vehicles took another point home .
The next set of factors that further developed the gasoline-powered vehicles were the social factors .
the presence of these social factors actually determined the fate of the electric-powered vehicles .
However , these social factors , which were partly caused by the overpowering economic and political factors , "pushed" people to choose the gasoline- powered vehicles .
The people were made to believe that the gasoline-powered vehicle was the "byproduct of market competition and engineering advancement , not a product of compromise and negotiation" (Dr . Sovacool , 28 August 09) , which , in actual fact , was not the case .
Due to meritocracy and freedom , people eventually "chose" the gasoline-powered vehicles  , and brought electric-powered vehicles to eternal rest .
The above factors gave gasoline-powered vehicles their place in the market , even though electric-powered vehicles were better in terms of the technical aspects .
For instance , electric-powered vehicles were cleaner because they did not produce any harmful byproducts from combustion , and they were quieter , more luxurious and safer because they did not deal with any forms of combustion or heat .
Furthermore , electricity was easily available compared to high octane gasoline (and up till today , high octane gasoline is essential for engines to work smoothly) .
Even though electric-powered vehicles were relatively more superior in the technical aspects , due to the factors mentioned above , the technical aspects were  and people were not fazed by the potential problems they might face if they chose the gasoline-powered vehicles .
In conclusion , the development of an innovation does not solely depend on how technically superior it is , it also depends on many other factors , as we can see from the above example of the gasoline-powered vehicle .
These factors may vary in terms of the degree of impact , but there will always be an array of factors that will determine if an innovation succeeds .
The more important and valuable an innovation is to the society , the more impactful are the contributing factors , and the more elaborated the impacts will be .
In this case , if vehicles are not as important , and we do not depend on them to such a large extent , World War I would not have had such a drastic effect on the extinction of the electric-powered vehicle and banks might not have approved the implementation of the insurances and loans .
And who knows ?
All our cars might be plugged in and getting charged now .

"Build a better mousetrap , and the world will beat a path to your door" , said  Ralph Waldo Emerson .
The quote can be used to express the significance of the engineering design processes to generate innovations in making a useful product for society and industry .
Among the developing countries , Vietnam is one of the fastest growing economies in which engineering design processes for innovations is now playing a more and more important role .
There are certain problems which are still obstructing those processes , two of them are the weak law protection of patent registration and the lack of entrepreneurship skills .
First of all , government plawelcomedermining effect on the developmewas of Newater .

Consequently , Singapore needs to import water wasghboring countries such as Malaysia to meet its needs (Lee , 2009) .
These reasons contribute to the development of Newater .
With the pressure of water shortage , having its own water supply system becomes more and more necessary .
That is how the resource shortage leads to the development of Newater .

As time passes  , more and more new technologies are being discovered or created .
These technologies can be classified in two main categories: one is the technologies which are developed by research , the other type is the technologies which result from serendipitous discoveries .
This article will discuss the similarities and differences between these two types of technologies .
I will focus on two common items in our life: Penicillin and the telephone .
The detailed comparison will be discussed in the following paragraphs .
Firstly , "Penicillin is one of the earliest discovered and widely used antibiotic agents , derived from the Penicillium mold" (Bellis , 2009) .
Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming while he "(was observing) that colonies of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus could be destroyed by the mold Penicillium notatum" (Bellis , 2009) .
After Fleming observed that , he paid much attention to Penicillinand discovered that Penicillin could kill many kinds of bacteria .
This important finding , however , was not given a lot attention until the 1940s when " Howard Florey and Ernst Chain isolated the active ingredient and developed a powdery form of the medicine" (Bellis , 2009) .
Penicillin is "the first drug that was effective against many previously serious diseases" (Wikipedia , 2009) .
Although many  bacteria are resistant toward Penicillin now , it is still in wide used .
Secondly , the telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 and "by 1884 , long distance connections were made between Boston , Massachusetts and New York City" (Inventor , 2009) .
Bell was very interested in helping deaf people which led him to invent the telephone .
In addition , "the telephone came as a direct result of his attempts to improve the telegraph" (Bellis , 2009) .
The invention of the telephone was not a coincidence , but the result of long-term research .
nowadays , the telephone plays a very important role in our life , as we can hardly live without them .
From the above paragraphs on Penicillin and while the telephone , we can easily see some similarities and differences between the two .
First of all , both of these two technologies have benefited us and improved our life very much .
Both  have helped us in some aspects: Penicillin has helped us to deal with some diseases which were hard to cure , the telephone has helped us to communicate with others more easily and made the world much smaller .
Secondly , both  technologies have matured after a long time of conscientiousresearch .
Both Penicillin and the telephone were not used for years after they were discovered; many people put a lot of effort to make them more  and more useful .
The only difference between them  is that  Penicillin was found by accident while the telephone was invented with clear aim .
Fleming had not planned to find anything like Penicillin while Bell had a clear purpose and worked on it .
In conclusion , both Penicillin and the telephone help people significantly and both  are the products of hard work and  .
The difference between them is whether the inventor had a clear purpose or not , which Bell had and Fleming had not .
But this difference does not decrease the value of either of these two technologies .
Human needs are always unsatiable .
Centuries ago , providing sufficient food was the most urgent need .
At the same time , health problems also created great needs for advanced medical technologies and facilities .
As years went by , industrialization emerged in many countries to meet various people's needs , like job opportunities and economic growth .
However , the big success of industrialization has created a problem for our modern people: how can we save our fast degrading environment ?
Thus , designing technologies in anenvironmentally friendly manner is one of the greatest necessities in order to protect our living environment and to ensure  sustainable economic development .
After a problem has been defined , which is the first step of engineering design , engineers need to gather pertinent information about the problem .
For example , engineers who focus on designing environmentally friendly transportation tools must have the basic knowledge about the products of different types of fuel combustion and how they affect the environment .
They should also be updated about the latest methods to generate energy in environmentally friendly ways , such as through generating renewable energy like solar energy , tidal energy or wind energy , and their respective advantages and drawbacks .
Engineers can move on to the next step once they are equipped with the necessary knowledge .
The second step of the design process is generating different solutions to  problems .
For example , engineers basically come up with two main ways to make machineries and transportation tools  .
The first way is changing the way energy is generated , such as changing petrol engines which produce carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons to fuel cells which only produce water and oxygen .
This solution can be further  by considering different types of methods to generate energy in less polluting ways .
The other solution is to deal with the polluting products generated along the way .
For example , catalyst convertors are installed in cars to convert the toxicgases carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons produced from incomplete combustion to the non toxic gases carbon dioxide and water .
Although different ways of solutions may be found  , not all are practical , so engineers also need to analyze and select a suitable solution .
For example , both of the two solutions  discussed above are theoretically correct , but today we only see converters being installed in cars .
This is because changing the ways to generate energy is very costly and the safety of such methods is unpredictable .
For example , fuel cells are very expensive , so their cost of production will be so high that they will be unmarketable .
Another example is that of hydro-powered cars , which actually have been produced but not used widely due to the fact that hydrogen is flammable , so there are still big concerns of consumers' safety .
In this step , engineers will also look at other factors like economicand social factors to filter the solutions .
Finally , engineers will test their solutions and make continuous changes to their product .
Although it is difficult to have a perfect solution , engineers are still trying hard to meet our needs to save the environment .
When we look around , we can see the efforts put in by engineersin products such as energy saving light bulbs light bulb , solar water heaters , car catalytic converters and so on .
These products are produced only after a long and complicated designing process .
We should really be grateful to engineers who work so dedicatedly to satisfy our needs .
First of all ,explainsee the definition first .
According to Wikipedia ,"A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission or a combinIndeedfission and fusion ."
Let us recall the Nagasaki and Hiroshima tragedies , both cities were destroyed completely because of this thing .
That was the first nuclear bomb executed on earth .
From that time , nuclear production was gthat technologye popular all the time .
Nowadadoes not only westerthiss , but also Asian countries (China , Japan , North Korea , Taiwan , India , Iran , Iraq , Israel , etc) have nuclear power .
One thing to notice is that this stuff is nuclear weaponspensive .
In "50 Falook atAbout U .S . Nuclear Weapon" , it is stated tha nuclear weaponcost of thweaponttan Project (through August 1945) is 20 ,000 ,000 ,000 USD .
That is just the cost of one project in one country .
You can imagine now how much money we have spent to develop this 'nice' technology .
Although it costs grelook atamount of money , but those nuclear countries ar(a) still improving their nuclear capabilities .
We must be wondering why people want to spend so much money on such things .
Basically I think the first reason is because humans hate to lose .
Usually when you , during whichare creating nuclear power , the main purpose is to make other countries respect and fear you .
This is very useful in militatime onwardsspect .
My former histhas been teacher one day said that "To create peace , we need big power ."
This means that if I have enough power to knock you , your friends and your family down , then it is very logical that you want to have a peace with me because you know that I am capable of doing awful things to you .
That is why people (in this case , countries) want to be strong so that they are wasying to develop something .
something powerfulAs technology is ga greatg better and bettethe way people fight with each other is also improved from time to time .
Somelwonderle fought using woods , rocks , bones , etc .
And then they knew about metals , so they used spears , sword , arrows , etc in their wars .

Finally , we arrive at this nuclear stage .
Everything seems sthat countryool right now , so does ththe militarye do not even have to sweat to declare a wasaid ,country .
As in , we just need to type some commands on our computer and click a button to launch a rocket .

At the same time , sulfur in fossil fuel will become sulfur dioxide which will cause acid rain .
The use of fossil fuel brings up much pollution and even ruins lungs of many kinds of creatures , including human beings .
From and eco-logical stand point , the world should decrease the use of fossil fuel and try to find other ways of creating energy .

As a consequencever , invest inossil fuel pricehas becomecan any country resisurgent andon ?
The answer is no .
During 1970s has beensinvigoratedluenced by excessive industry development , the world's economic cost reached to a high point but at that time , fossil fuel prices were decreasing .
This mad those nuclear power plant which were under construction less attractive .
They just were set aside .
Almost as the same reason in 1973 , France and Japan suffered oil crisis .
Their governments could not pay for such high oil debts and these two countries decided to depend on nuclear technology .
In other words , France and Japan were forced to invest nuclear technology .
What is surprising that today 80% of the electricity in France is supplied by nuclear energy .
In Japan the percentage is also as high as 30% (Sharon Beder , 2006) .
But not all the countries can afford the cost to build up a nuclear power plant .
Take the U .S as an example .
The U .S . is the country having most nuclear power plants , and is well known by their technology in this area .
However in the U .S . , to build up an ordinary nuclear power plant will cost as much as $6~10 billion .
And this does not include the expense of repair and maintenance in the future .
So far , only big countries have their own nuclear power plants .
But it is sure that in the future , nuclear energy will give a strong support to the whole world industry economics .
When all the countries are aware this point , it is only a matter of time to make nuclear energy all over the world .

As many big cities in the world are facing  water crises , as acid rains become increasingly frequent , and as the number of lung cancer patients keeps going up , environmental protection has become one of the most vital needs of humans .
To satisfy humans' need and contribute to protecting the environment , engineers seek to design and invent products in an environmentally friendly way .
Through the engineering design process , we can see how engineers satisfy that need .
According to Khandani (2005) , there are five steps in solving designing problems .
In the steps to get pertinent information and to analyze and select a solution , engineers can make their product more environment-friendly .
To design and produce something more environmentally friendly , engineers should pay more attention to environment-related information when searching for pertinent information to help them in their design .
For example , suppose an engineer is looking for a material for meal boxes of take-away food .
Apart from information about cost , weight , water resistant ability , and so on , he needs to pay extra attention to  environmental information like whether the material can be biodegraded or recycled .
Taking this environment-related information into consideration helps make more environmentally friendly decisions .
The second step is to analyze and select a solution .
Usually , engineers will come up with more than one plan as they design a product .
They need to analyze and evaluate the plans and decide on a final plan .
In the Engineering Design Process , Khandani (2005) shows us how engineers evaluate different plans .
Firstly , they need to decide the criteria  for evaluating design plans .
They need to perform several types of analysis on each design plan .
These types of analysis are the criteria for evaluating the plans .
Next they value each criterion according to its importance , and give a mark representing how important it is .
In this way , they set criteria for evaluating plans .
After that , they evaluate each aspect of the design against the corresponding criterion .
Based on how well that aspectfits the criterion , they give a mark .
Lastly , they calculate the points for each plan and compare them .
Then the mark of each aspect of the plan is multiplied by the number representing the importance of this criterion and the total mark is added up .
By comparing the total mark of the different plans , they decide on the final plan .
For example , suppose an engineer is designing a process of producing a kind of detergent .
There are some factors , such as efficiency of the product and cost , to be taken into consideration for deciding the final plan .
If he can increase the importance of the factors related to environmental protection , he may use a substitute for phosphorus , or cleanse the waste water before discharging it .
Then the process and product would be more environmentally friendly .
If engineers can think more about the environment when designing , the product will become very environment-friendly .
Then our earth will become cleaner and more sustainable .
We will have a more comfortable and healthier environment to live in .
Government Regulations and Public Opinions of the Development of Electric Bicycles in China
One typical image remembered by the world about China is  its astounding number of bicycles on the roads: swarms of people riding bicycles filling the roads which are not really narrow .
since the year  2000 , another phenomenon has occurred on the roads of the cities in China: electric bicycles .
According to data on reliable Chinese websites , in 2004 alone , 6750000 electric bicycles were produced by more than 1000 factories all over China and these numbers are expected to increase by many times by the end of 2010 .
With the maturing of the technologies of electric motors and long-life batteries , multiple types of electric vehicles could have been created .
However ,Previously existing government regulations and public opinions on road safety have played important roles in shaping the electric bicycle in China into what it is today .
previously existing government regulations had a tremendous effects on the development of electric bicycles when it comes to the size and speed of these bicycles .
Before the e-bike(electric bicycle) we see now which is light(lighter than 20kg) and slow(maximum speed is less than 20km/h)  , there are also a number of other kinds of electric vehicles being developed .
They are more like electric motorbikes which are much more powerful and , of course , heavier .
However , because of the government regulations on city transportation under which all means of transportation on the road are grouped as either motor or non-motor and nothing in between , the prototype of the heavy electric bicycles was nipped in the bud as it could not be categorised as either of the two  because of its variety of performance .
The later electric bicycle was then designed to be more like a normal bicycle and was only allowed to be ridden on non-motor roads .
It is light but moves automatically .
People can even ride it just like riding a bicycle when it runs out of power .
Apart from government regulations , public opinions have also hadsignificant effect on the development of the e-bike .
After the e-bike was placed on the market , safety issues related to the e-bike were brought up .
Data on road traffic accidents were collected .
In Hangzhou , the capital city of Zhejiang province , the number of accidents caused by e-bikes increased over three years  Though the number was relatively small compared with those caused by cars and motorbikes , people were becoming more and more concerned about the safety of e-bikes and a series of public discussions were then carried out to discuss how to make the e-bike a safe vehicle on the roads .
Finally , the speed limit was set at 20km/h which is quite at the lower end of what the technology allows the e-bike to do .
Then all the e-bike industries began to improve performance in other areas of the e-bike like battery life and noise rather than speed and loading ability .
In order to meet the requirement of government regulations and public opinions , the development of the e-bike has gone through several changes; therefore it has been shaped to the e-bike we see now .
Hopefully , the next typical image left by China to the world will be that of the e-bike .
the videophoneThen many predicted that videophone would waspopular someday and it wouboth interactants of a video telephoneloved by the public .
However , in recent decades , there was almost no market for the videophonIt wasn't until the 1980sthat ,hone has not emerged in othe IT chipives .
At that timeof the reasons why vithe videophoneould not become popular is that there were technical problems .
Because the communication quality was nhas beenthat good , users could not get clear and the videophonemages .
Bubeen integrated intoom the technical factor , the development of videophone mainly limited by some social and economic factors .
First , the price matterthe videophoneone was very expensive in early times .
Even in today when the technology is so advanced , the price is still quite high .
One videophone roughly ranges in price of S$200 to S$1000 .
In addition , the videophone costs much morthe videophone was mainly phone especially when user takes a long distance call .
Second reason is due to thThe videophoneissues .
People sometwhen it was first launchednt the her side to see their tired face .
When they are talking , they want to be relaxed and feel free .
Videophone users betweenso commandly look at the video screen and not at the video camera , causing the phone to useto take on an unna useral awkward glance , as the camera is usually just positioned away from the screen ("Videophone ,"2009) .
(Videophone , 2009) .The second there was  standard .
For a long time , although there were some companies producing videophones , different kinds of videophone from different companies cat ease not communicate with each other because they did not share a standard .
Another reason may be that people actually desire less fidelity in their communication , as evidenced by the popularity of written covideophones (i .e .
texting and instant messaging , which are commonly available on all video-enabled cell phones and web chat programs)("Videophone ,"2009) .
) (Videophone , 2009) .Nowadays , with the fast development of the internet , more and more people accept to video chat through some internet chatting software .
The necessity of using videophone is becoming lower and lower .
To generate innovation in a comparable short time as mentioned previously , normally skunk works assemble mNormally ,tanding personnel and more capital as opposed to conventional R&D organizations .
Therefore , people highly selected can accomplish the task without much trouble in capital .
One example is the Xerox Corporation , then the world's leading document copier manufacturer , which founded its skunk works Xerox PARC with the investment of $150 million , which generated the mouse and other important personal computing technologies due to its brilliant personnel (Rogers , 2003) .
Although Xerox failed toconventionallyose technologies to the marketplace due to its poor commercial strategies , it is significantly meaningful that in a short time , Xerox PARC attained so many technological breakthroughs that were adopted later .
In a nutshell , on average , skunk works generate technological innovations more effectively and efficiently .
However , it has higher requirements for the personnel and capital , which are difficult for some companies that are organizationsof capital .
Nevertheless , conventional R&D organizations can generate innovations stably and continuously , which is still essential to the development of the company .
The technologieconventionalin both organizations help build a better world .
Prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century , the needs of people were just basic-food , clothing , air and last but not least , shelter .
Now , the needs have just expanded from the basic four needs to other needs such as entertainment , communication , and transportation .
However , the question is which need requires more attention than the others in this modern era ?
The answer would be transportation .
Well , in order to have  better transportation , design processes are needed to fulfill the need .
Transportation which is cheap and safe , environmentally friendly and uses alternative source of energy ,  is most desirable .
One of the eminent challenges faced by  modern transportation is to depend less on fossil fuels .
With the rate of usage of fossil fuels - at three billion barrels per year now - , it will not take long before  fuels get depleted .
According to a presentation made by Osman Chughtai and David Shannon fossil fuels will  run out in 17 years minimum or a maximum of 50 to 70 years .
Nevertheless , other transportation problems like producing too much pollutants such as nitrogen oxides .
Pollutants produced have been proved to have had an enormous effect on the Earth's ozone layer , corroding the ozone layers and exposing humans to  deadly ultraviolet rays .
To add to the problems stated above , the world currently needs  better transportation , in terms of safety and functionalities as well as  cost .
As an example , cars produced must be durable , meaning that the cars must be able to withstand great momentum struck on them .
Besides that , weather must not be an obstacle for good cars .
In addition , cars must be low in cost despite having all the functionalities .
Therefore , in order to counter all the problems , engineers need to go through design processes .
First of all , engineering processes provide the foundation for research to get a new state-of-the-art design .
Engineers have to identify the problems such as producing a transport that does not run on fossil fuel .
Then , they can brainstorm to come up with a new design that meets all the criteria for a better car .
Recently , there was  groundbreaking news stating that engineers found a technology called H2CAR process , a process for producing fuels from plants or what they call the process-biomass .
(Venere  , E . New biofuels process promises to meet all U .S . transportation needs .
Retrieved on 5/09/2009 .http://www .purdue .edu/UNS/x/2007a/070314AgrawalBiomass .html)
Besides research , development processes enable engineers to produce designs that will be tested on real ground .
Effectiveness , durability and functionalities of the designs will be tested .
In this case , transportation like cars must be able to withstand extreme weathers and must be aerodynamically shaped for maneuverability .
Car safety must be included in the blueprint of the car as well .
Previously , engineers managed to come up with a design called catalytic converter with a function to reduce the pollutants released due to combustion .
In a nutshell , design processes are the main essence for a better future transportation , in terms of fuel type , environmentalenvironmental friendliness , functionalities as well as  cost .
This need must be taken seriously in order to secure a brighter future --  a future where people do not need to travel on bicycle or on foot .

Nokiain January As mobile phone is built up by so many parts , there are various ways of innovation .
Of all the aspects of innovation , appearance and function weigh the most .
Appearance means much because people treat mobile phones not only as communication tools bu) .
Tlso was kind beloond toys .
Various functions are important bedifferent plaphonees haveent cnot usingitions .
I phone conquer the whole world but failed to enter Japan's market bphone companies of two reasons: Firsthas witnessedehowe to own a unique stylhave always been but iphone has only one style which would cause embarrassment when Japanese meet the other iphone user .
Second , Japanese phones have many functwrong press as mobile-shop which canInelp them pay bills on their phone .
But iphoneoesnot have them .
does notusersAs the mobilee appearance there are four major designs: straight , flip , slide and rotation .
After rotation , what is going to dominate the market ?
There are new appearances to be designed .
Such as a straight phone with 3-row ,4-collum keyboard .
To protect the fragia kind ofouch screen , the keyboard can act as the cover and leave only a little part of the screen out side when nothas conqueredIt is both cool and convenient to have a camera which can rotate like a transformer to make it easier to take phones for the photo-taker .
Functioeappearancen endless way to go .
Basically a smart phone can have music player , video palyback , camera , GPS , wi-fi and so on .
There are plenty of functions now but the new the better .
A phone can act as a telescopcolumnirdnest during Beijing 2008 Olympic Games by using the camera and its zoom function .
It can also design a diet for its owner outside to lose weight .
A phone can be a weatherperson , an e-pet or whatever .
As technology develops and society changes , more and more functions will be possible and wanted .
Innovative mobile design is important also because designers can harvest both copy right and market .
A new design is protected by its copy right so that for the producer meet slnewert competition entering the market .
To conclude , China mobile inthe Beijingneed to work on innovation of phones' appearance and function .
Problems significantly hamperhamper innovation in engineering design processes for innovations  .
Along with the rise in living standards , people's demands for goods increase .
At the same time , people pay more attention to the quality of the goods .
In order to meet the demands of modern society , we need higher efficiency and more advanced technology .
Thus , the innovations in engineering processes are more and more important .
But in real life  many problems hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
The two  most significant are the state of information communication which is not smooth and  corruption .
In  practical production , only the workers directly use  production equipment .
The senior management and the boss , who have the right to change and introduce new equipment and technologies , seldom care about the real condition of production .
So the only people who know the problems of production are the workers .
They may meet a lot of problems and may want to change the technologies .
But they do not have the power to do so .
And  the state of information communication is not smooth , workers cannot relay the problems that they found in production to the people who have the power to make decisions .
Maybe sometimes the workers come out with good ideas to solve the problems , but they do not have opportunities to put the ideas into practice .
And of course , the workers would not get rewards .
In this case , after a long time the workers lose enthusiasm to think about how to solve the problems , thus the company loses its opportunities to innovate .
At the same time , it loses the opportunity to save costs and increase production efficiency .
Another very important problem in practical production is corruption .
It often causes more serious problems than other problems .
It is a very serious problem that exists in almost every area .
For  leaders in  companies and factorie , if they are corrupt , they  only care about their own benefits and ignore many others .
There are many cases of corrupt leaders leading their whole companies or factories to go bankrupt .
And there are also some cases which are more scary .
Some  set up a company just  to cheat; all their actions  are about cheating for money from consumers or other companies .
For the staffs , if they are corrupt , they would not focus on their jobs any more .
Furthermore , they would envy others who have a higher position or make more money or make greater contributions .
In such case , they may create a lot of bad things , maybe to frame others , in order to receive more benefits for themselves .
For workers , they would only care about how to please their leaders to get more benefits and not care about  production .
The worse influence is for corrupt people to affect the general mood of a company or a factory .
To conclude , there are many existing problems hampering engineering design processes for innovations .
And the state of information communication and corruption are two most serious ones in my home country .
We should seek ways to solve them .
In this era of globalization , engineering design has been emphasized by  governments  all over the world , such as the UnitedStates , Russia and France .
This is because the development of engineering design could bring many advantages to a country's economy and society .
Currently ,  scientists  perceive a future problem and launch some research to overcome it .
If we observe our surroundings , we can see many inventions with technological creativity such as computer , automobile and other electrical appliances .
Nevertheless , there are some problems which significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations in my home country , Malaysia , and impact  certain stages of  engineering design .
Firstly , financial problem is one of the factors which constrains engineering design processes for innovations .
As we all know , if we want to improve our engineering design  , we need to launch much research .
Therefore , Research and Development (R&D) plays a very important part in engineering design processes for innovations .
Subsequently , a lump sum of money  to be used to launch all such research , but our government is not able to invest  much money on all  .
So ,  financial problem arises and constrain  engineering design processes for innovations .
Malaysia is a country which is still developing and not as wealthy as other western developed countries such as the UnitedStates , France and Germany .
Hence , we lack  money to improve our facilities for research such as well-equipped laboratories and other highly technological instruments .
In fact , this will causes the engineering design processes to be interrupted halfway because of  lack of  highly technological instruments .
For instance , if we want to design a race car , we need some highly technological instruments to do research on  car engines and other parts of a car .
And although we have already found  important information through research , we still cannot continue  analyses of design solutions because of  lack of highly technological instruments to be used for investigation .
Other than financial problem , we are also facing the problem of lack of professionals in certain engineering fields such as mechanical engineering , chemical engineering and electrical engineering .
Much of the research  engineering design  carried out in  modern countries  been done successfully .
This is because there are many professionals in their countries .
In fact , the lack of professionals in engineering fields has resulted in the failure of some research .
For instance , some of the automobile research   due to the lack of  professionals .
The stage of analysis of design solution has been constrained because of  limited knowledge and lack of professionals .
Hence , some forums on engineering design should be held between our country and other modern countries  .
For instance , the forum on how to manufacture an eco-car can be held in order to help us exchange our opinions with the professionals from modern countries .
In a nutshell , financial problem and lack of professionals in my home country should be solved as soon as possible to improve our engineering design processes  .
Hence , the private sector , the government and also citizens should work hand in hand in order to encourage more investment in engineering design research and produce more professionals in the field of engineering design in the future .
Firstly , Indonesia lawithture of innovation .
According to the statistics published by UNICEF in 2007 , only fifty percent of Indonesian citizens are urbanized , which means the other half live in rural areas with little exposure to modern world and technology .
People living in traditional videsign-basedvery simple life .
They stick to their ancestors' traditions , and sometimes prefer traditional way of doing things to labor sving modern devices; for example: some farmers prefer buffalo driven ploughs to tractors .
Moreover , the farmers still rely on the government supplies and subsidies , which encounters a lot of logistics problems , instead of innovating their own way of solving problems .
Besides , most universities in Indonesia are more teaching based , less research intensive than those in Japan or The States; that makes Indonesian university students less creative and innovative in problem solving .
As a result , Indonesian engineers usually provide less possibility of solutions in tackling a problem compared to those who are trained abroad .
The second problem that ma cultureer the engineering design pros in Indonesia is due to its both excessive and cheap natural resources , space , and workforces .
As mentioned before , Indonesia hosts more than two hundred and thirty milthe modernitizens , and its unemployment rate is considered high at 9 .1% (Reuters , 2008) .livess , Indokeepeds to create jobs for its people; one way is by dethe traditionals agricultural businesselabor-saving been a hot topic lately dur;ng the presidential cbuffalo-drivenwo Subianto , son of Sumitro Djojdikusumo , former ministof economics for both Indonesia and Malaysrun into his vice logisticalial campaign opposed a solution to current Indonesian problems; he promised to create jobs by developing bio diesel producing palm based andlantation in Indonesia , which may absorb about 6 million workforces .
It's apparent that innovative and labor saving devices will not work in Indonesia; the new invention seemed to be more expensive compared to the traditional way .
labor-savingIt is .
HehaveThe impact of Indonesia's cheap resources on engineering design process is on its implementatstage .
After the invention is patented , there is nobody who is willing to buabovebecause in Ihassia's case it's not cost efficient .
Another effect is demotivation of young engineers from designing new product , because the rewards the society gives them is not equal to their long time hardworking .
long-timeproductsIn conclusion , Indonesia still faces several challenges in developing its design-based technology .
To tackle them , Indonesian government has to work hard in developing innovativ culture in the society , and it iseasing the people's dependability on the government .
According to Khandani's statement "What distinguishes engineers from painters , poets , or sculptors is that engineers apply their creative energies to producing products or systems that meet human needs" , all engineering designs aim to meet human demands  .
Now , when  society develops , people are looking for new designs to satisfy their comfortable lives .
ThThesese new designs may be  demands for entertainment , education or even something beyond our imagination .
However , in my opinion , one of the main concerns in our society is finding a new energy supply to substitute for the old ones which have beendepleted due to  human exploitation .
In order to solve this urgent demand , engineering plays an important role in finding  other alternatives such as nuclear energy , solar energy and geothermal energy .
Evidently , energy has become vital and indispensable in our life , relating to most of everything we deal with .
Because of the influence of energy ,  natural resources have invisibly caused wars and conflicts between many countries over time .
The recent war between the United States and Iraq in 2000 might be considered to be a typical example .
Although the U .S . has been saying that this war is for  anti-terrorism , or more importantly for maintaining peace  the world , it is clear that one of the reasons why American troopers stay in Iraq is the benefits of petroleum .
This is a typical example of  how important energy is since it has a great impact on our daily life .
Due to the non-renewability of  natural "fossil" resources , the more demands  society needs , the more exhausted these resources become .
According to the online newspaper Financial Times (2006) and USA Today news (2004) , the oil reserves in Trinidad and Tobago will run out in the next 20 years and the world oil reserves will become exhausted just in 40 years .
These figures partly show the urgent necessity to find a feasible alternative energy source which will never become exhausted .
The process of finding a new alternative energy source , which is not only renewable but also environmental-friendly , has been undertaken for a long time and regarded as an ultimate goal for engineering .
The most popular energy is nuclear energy .
It is extracted from  usable energy from heavy atomic nuclei (for example Uranium 235) via  of nuclear reactions .
The first nuclear plant was built in Russia in 1984 whose initial electricity production was about 5000KW .
Nowadays , nuclear power is harnessed for many purposes in our daily life .
It may create electricity , equipment or even weapons like the nuclear bomb or nuclear power submarines .
However , the design of nuclear reaction has to meet many rigorous requirements to avoid  nuclear releases as well as to isolate  radiation from  life .
All of these conditions have to be followed strictly ; otherwise it may cause immeasurable consequences .
For instance , one of the most tragic accidents involving radiation release was the Chernobyl disaster which happened in 1986 .
This disastrous accident resulted from  weakness in design  .
Up to now , the neighboring areas still suffer from the radiation .
Another solution is the perpetual resources  known as solar , geothermal energy  , etc .The solar energy is drawn from sunlight's energy by many solar panels which are designed to fit  house roofs .
This energy is converted into electric or thermal energy to serve our life .
Geothermal power takes the thermal calorie in the entrails of the earth and translates into other energies which contribute an important role in operating turbines and machines .
There are three basic types of geothermal energy plants (i .e .
the dry steam plants , flash steam plants and binary power plants) .
Geothermal energy is considered as the most potential alternative for  nonrenewable energy  in the future .
Though the perpetual resources are always there for us , their use may be constrained by the lack of technology for control and delivery , and also by investment and willingness to pay .
Also , these resources may not be applied and used everywhere on earth due to  geographic differences .
In conclusion , I contend that energy problem should be classified as first priority for humans to solve not only because of many huge benefits it provides for people but also because of the critical shortage of energy resources .
In this context , engineering design process meet these urgent needs by finding many feasible solutions such as nuclear energy , solar energy and geothermal energy sources .
Although this process has just had initial achievements , it promises a fully potential energy source in the future which may permanently serve human kind .
Nowadays , the petrol price has fluctuated a lot .
Thus , many countries spend more money and time on developing new resources which can be used as a substitute for petroleum .
Energies such as solar energy have been promoted to fulfill this purpose .
This can be seen through the increase in research and development of  solar cars or other products .
The use of  solar energy-related goods has been highly encouraged by  environmentalists .
So , I would like to discuss  the reasons for innovation in such technology based on economic , governmental and environmental factors .
First of all , as earlier mentioned  ,  petrol price has been fluctuating in recent years .
This makes many factories start to worry about the cost and  profit they can earn .
Most of them feel unsecured because the cost of petrol may lead to low profit or even red deficit .
Thus , they are keen to find out more substitutions .
In the process we can see many firms and companies start to invest in solar energy areas .
As solar power is actually inexhaustible and reproducible , they can use it whenever they want and it is free of charge as well .
However , the start-up cost is pretty high .
It is because of the cost of  batteries .
Presently , there is limitation on the amount of energy the batteries can store as we can only "use solar cells to generate up to 240 watts of electrical power in full sunshine .
As long as we can find a way to increase the amount of  energy the batteries can store , the cost will not be much a problem anymore .
So I think , although they have to spend much more on research now , they can definitely save more in the long run .
Secondly , petrol resources are not evenly distributed around the world .
This means that some countries control more petrol while some may not have it at all .
This results in certain countries feeling unsecured as they are afraid that their potential enemies may use this as a weak point to harm them .
For example , their enemy may cut down the inflow of the petrol  .
Without petrol , the economy in the country will be affected badly .
Lastly , solar energy is free of pollution .
It is commonly known that burning of petroleum will release carbon dioxide , nitrogen and some other gases which will cause air pollution .
This will in turn cause many harmful results including acidic rain or global warming .
On the contrary , solar energy will not lead to such pollution .
And as solar energy comes from the sun , it can be regarded as reproducible and we do not need to worry about if it will be depleted one day .
In conclusion , I think we should decrease the use of petrol-related products and slowly switch towards using the products which need new resources .
Only if we show our interests in and demands for these products ,  researchers can have motivation and more funds to do their projects .
As is known , water is a resource that human canninfluence .
Its uses rangefrom climate regulating , industry application to food processing and daily drinking .
Water is even the sign of life .
Scientists often use it as the first criteria to judge whether there is lneedsoarea new landed planet .
This means that water is probably the first thing creatures need to maintain life .
Therefore , water is also oneforssential need for people to survive .
Back to a hundred years ago , water was never a concern .
While , today it is different .
It's now commonly recognized that fresh water will be the scarcest resource in the follow century .
Some people even assume that the next world war will be fought for the limited fresh water on the earth .
In order to ensure human's survival and the peace of world , engineers should respect the human's need for water most when designing products .
humans'world peacehumans'because ofOne aspect engineer should work on to humanspeople's need of water is to reduce the pollution regulationiand industryss .
Pollution is one main reason for water scarcity .
To be exact , there is never a lack of water on the earth , but pollution damaged most of the available water sources , such as rivers and lacks .
Pollution in water is often caused by waste emission generated in industry processes .
To solve this problem , the best way is to emphasis ennAal friendliness when engineers design machine , wr deelop new procedures for It isstry use .
This can stop pollution to water more thoroughly than government's fifollowingwater pollution .
inIn additionengineersers can design device that can save water .
People are using er everywhere the engineeringer than in industry .
Therefore , if device can avoid wasting water in daily life of each person , it will suy save considerably large amount of water .
Small device like taps , water coolers , washlakesachines , can all be the targets of engineers .
Engineers should attach importance to water-efficiency together with other efficiencies regarding designing device , so that enough water can be conserved to meet people's need .
needsdevicesgiveand washingdevicesTo sum up , engineering should givea deviceity to people's need for water first , as water is necessary for human's survival .
In order to highligha device need , engineers should emphthe dailyon environmental friendliness and water saa considerablygning .
For the next 10 years or more , Singapore  have a high percentage of population consisting of the elderly .
There are a few factors leading to an ageing populationlike low birth rates and increase in the cost of standard of living .
With the increase in the number of elderly , there would be a need for safety areas , thus products or services should be designed to meet this need .
For example , one of the current market products is called "MEMSwear" which is produced by National University of Singapore engineers .
This product is a smart suit that is equipped with an array of microsensors which are able to detect falls suffered by the wearers and to send alerts to their caregivers .
Besides these functions , the engineers have also included an "impact-reduction" system to reduce the damage done on the wearer when he or she falls .
For the product , we have seen that the engineers have made use of  engineering design processes to meet the need .
Firstly , they have defined the problem , which is  ageing population , and they have seen the need to invent a product which could give extra safety protection to the elderly .
Secondly , they have brainstormed on the preliminary criteria for a better design for the product (Khandani , 2005)) .
For example , for the first version of the product , they have not included the "impact-induction" system .
Without this feature , the wearer might suffer a serious accident if he or she falls .
Thus , through the use of engineering design processes , they have come out with a better design of the product .
Next , this is another product which works alike as the previous product .
But other than the features that the "MEMSwear" has , this product has additional functions (Khandani , S . (2005)) .
One of the functions is that upon receiving an alert when the user has a serious fall , it would dial for ambulance immediately .
This would greatly reduce the consequences of the fall if actions are taken within a shorter time .
Another additional function is the implementation of a temperature sensor .
For instance , in the case of a fire , the temperature sensor would be alerted and will send warning alerts to their caregivers or call for Civil Defense Force immediately .
Furthermore , when considering the design of the product , there is a need to make special considerations that are suitable for  elderly use .
Those factors that might need to be taken into consideration when designing the product are inflexible movements and slow response time .
Engineers would have to use the engineering design processes to list out multiple solutions the designing of product (Khandani , S . (2005)) .
For each solution , they would have to analyze and select one of the best solutions that suits most of the criteria listed .
In order to make sure the product works well , engineers have to test it before they launch the product .
In conclusion , we have seen that the problems of ageing population could get more serious in the next few years , thus there is a need to design a product that could help to reduce the risks and impacts faced by the ageing population .
Through examples of these two products , we could see that both of them have made use of  engineering design processes to meet the need .
And thus , they proved that it is really important to go through  engineering design processes when inventing a new product .
Human activities on Earth have depleted Earth's valuable yet limited  natural resources , thus damaging the its environment .
This causes Earth's natural resources to be depleted and modify Earth's environment so much that it is no longer suitable for human life .
Therefore , humans have to give priorities to conserving Earth's natural resources and protecting its environment .
This can be achieved by completely setting aside already available engineering processes , modifying and improving these old processes , or correctly identifying the reasons for the rise of that need .
Firstly , engineering processes that are available now and are widely used can be abolished while new ones can be introduced to perform the functions of their precursors and at the same time fulfil the need .
For instance , humans have always depended on one of Earth's natural resources , fossil fuels , as an important source of energy .
However , due to humans' overuse of it , fossil fuels are expected to be completely depleted in the year 2050 .
Therefore , engineering processes of technologies that extract energy from fossil fuels must be superseded and new ones must be introduced to ensure a constant supply of energy for humans .
For example , western powers like countries in Europe and the United States are planning to construct large scale solar energy farms in areas in Africa like the Sahara desert to replace generating energy from fossil fuels , since solar energy is a renewable source of energy and therefore cannot be depleted .
Furthermore , the burning of fossil fuels produces harmful substances like carbon dioxide and smoke particles that can destroy Earth's environment .
However , clean energy sources like solar energy do not cause these problems .
Therefore , we can see how setting aside old engineering processes and embracing new ones can satisfy that need .
Secondly , instead of removing available engineering processes , they can also be modified so that their original functions are still available but at the same time satisfies the need to preserve natural resources and protect the environment .
For example , transportation systems like cars require fuels like fossil fuels which are processed from a depleting natural resource , fossil fuels .
Furthermore , greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are produced from these cars which  contribute to the notorious greenhouse effect .
To solve this problem , engineering processes like the designing of the car's engine can be changed .
For instance ,  electric cars by General Motors use electricity to power the car's engine instead of fossil fuels .
This satisfy the need as electricity can be generated from renewable sources of energy like solar and wind energy .
Furthermore , greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide will also not be emitted  .
Thus , we can observe how modifying available engineering processes can satisfy the need .
Thirdly , the need can be fulfilled by correctly identifying and analyzing the reason for the rise of that need , so that  correct decisions can be made through engineering processes  .
For example , CFC gases in the past are a by-product of many of our industries .
These gases caused the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer in the atmosphere which caused more harmful ultraviolet , UV rays to penetrate the atmosphere , and consequently health problems like skin cancer to humans due to these UV rays .
Therefore , a worldwide policy was implemented to ban the emission of CFC gases into the atmosphere by industries .
Thus , we can see how making  correct decisions to prevent pollution to the environment can fulfill the need .
In conclusion , to ensure a sufficient supply of natural resources and a healthy environment for us and our future generations to live in , these processes can meet our needs by removing and introducing or modifying available engineering processes and making  correct decisions through engineering processes  .
According to Khandani (2005) , engineers design products or systems that meet human needs .
Out of all the human needs in the world ,  clean water should be given priority compared with others .
Despite the fact that the amount of water on earth is quite large , nevertheless , we can only drink a very small part of it .
It is because most of the water in the world is sea water , which is not potable at all .
In addition , due to  global warming , the sea level rises .
Therefore , some precious sources of drinking water , like underground water ,  are polluted and not drinkable any more , which makes the situation even worse .
In some regions in the world , such as the Middle East and Africa , the shortage of clean drinking water is very serious , which sometimes causes wars .
To solve this problem , there are two ways in which engineers can contribute .
The first way is to design a system to recycle used water .
Water we daily use can be divided into two categories ,  for drinking and not for drinking .
For example , water we use to flush toilets , to irrigate farmland and to wash cars is not necessary to reach the same hygienic level as the drinking water .
Hence , we may use recycled water to do these jobs so that we can save more clean drinking water for people  .
Actually , this idea has already been adopted by many countries to relieve the pressure caused by the shortage of water .
Moreover , some developed countries , such as Singapore , have mastered this technology so well that recycled water can be drunk directly , which really helps a lot to solve the problem of shortage of water .
However , this method may not be suitable for  developing and undeveloped countries because it costs a lot of money , and the technology required is also very high .
The other way to get drinking water is through desalination of sea water .
As mentioned before , the amount of sea water is truly vast; therefore , humans can certainly take sea water as another source of drinking water .
However , the process of desalination of sea water is very difficult .
It requires highly advanced science and technology , and of course , it is very costly .
Another limitation of this method is that it can only be applied in seaside countries , like Singapore , which means that it is not the first choice of many inland countries .
But since it also has its advantage , like the huge and widespread source , it is still worth trying .
According to Khandani (2005) , the net result or purpose of most engineering designs is to produce a product that generates a profit for the company .
Therefore , since the two methods mentioned above are both costly and difficult to apply , they can be restricted by the economic and the market and thus , they may be not able to solve the shortage of water in a short period .
But what is important is that , at least , these two methods give us hope .
It is this kind of hope that motivates humans to develop , to improve , to pursue our dreams , and finally to have such a beautiful world today .
Hope is the most significant contribution which engineers have contributed to the world .
The environment-friendly car is a current human need which should be given priority .
Humans need to travel from one place to another easily .
The current car's technology , the fuel injection , has satisfied that need , but has not satisfied the environment's needs .
Humans need a car which is not only able to transport them easily but also is friendly to the environment .
It is the doctors' job to apply their creative energies in designing a solution which meets humans' need .
First of all , the current car's technology , the fuel injection , has satisfied humans' need to travel .
For example , the time taken to travel from one place to another with a distance of a few hundred kilometres has been reduced from 2-3 days to 2-3 hours; as a result , humans are able to travel instantly .
This  indeed makes humans' means of transportation rising to another level .
Second , in contrast with the benefit  fuel injection has contributed to human life , it has , in fact , polluted the environment .
This is due to  fuel processing in the car .
For example ,  fuel injection is exhausting Carbon Dioxide (CO2) as a result of incomplete burning of fuels .
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps the earth's heat and contributes to global warming .
Third , humans not only need to travel but also need a pollution -free environment to live in .
In  view of this issue , engineers are needed on designing a solution .
According to Khandani (2005) , products or systems are designed by engineers to meet human needs .
For years , engineers have experimented to design a solution to this issue .
For example , Japan's engineers have experimented for about 10 years before they successfully designed an eco-car which makes use of electric energy .
This eco-car has no fuel tank  , therefore , it produces no emissions at all .
On top of that , Japan's eco-car is as fast as the fuel injection car .
Lastly , Japan's engineers had followed engineering design processes Khandani (2005) to design their first eco-car .
They started by defining the problem of the fuel injection system .
They argued that the fuel injection system's problem lies in the fuel it uses .
Therefore , Japan's engineers started to look for alternate fuel for their eco-car .
They gathered information in order to arrive successfully at the right fuel source; subsequently , they decided to use electricity as the fuel .
The road to success is not smooth; likewise , Japan's engineers had gone through a lot of challenges and tests before they arrived at the final prototype of Japan's first eco-car .
Humans need to care about the environment's condition in order to preserve it for the new generation .
The new generation deserves to live in the same environment as we do .
To conclude , by using engineering design processes , engineers can design products that meet human needs .
Healthcare is a basic essential in every country .
It compromises of the people's living condition , availability of medical treatment and prevention of disease .
Emphasis on healthcare services differs from country to country .
For instance in Singapore and Japan , healthcare is emphasized on the elderly due to their aging populations but both execute their policies in different ways .
Hence , we will look at the principle of healthcare of the elderly in respective countries and the solution to the healthcare needs of an aging population .
The aging community has become an eminent issue in Singapore .
With a replacement rate of 1 .5 children to 2 adults and an estimation that by 2030 , 18 .4% of the population will be made up by the elderly , it is no wonder why Singapore government is promoting reproduction in young couples .
As the population ages , the main users of hospital services will be the  elderly .
Therefore , improvement in healthcare services for the elderly is essential .
Mobility of the elderly is a factor as well , as they have problems walking and moving around .
According to a survey in 2004 , Singapore is  one of the unfriendliest countries towards the wheel chair bounded .
Hence , there is a need for us to impove the healthcare services of our older citizens .
In Japan , nearly one quarter of the population is made up of the  elderly .
This is mainly due to the speed of industrialization in Japan .
Being one of the economic giants , Japan industrializes very fast at an early stage .
This causes an imbalance between work and family .
The fast paced society forces citizens to place work as priority over family resulting in a declining population .
In addition , in Japan , pay increases with the age of the workers .
Hence , companies tend to seek younger employees causing the older workers to lose their jobs and their health pension benefits .
Since the number of  elderly is increasing , it is important to cater to their needs in terms of healthcare .
The first concern is the living condition of the  elderly .
Home care facilities such as hospices , day care centres and nursing homes are built to look after the elderly especially when their family members are unable to do so .
For example , in Singapore , one room apartment with specially installed emergency buttons and lifts is catered to the elderly .
These apartments are created in such a way that they minimize the risk of the elderly injuring themselves .
The second concern is the mobility of the elderly .
Shopping malls and other common places should be equipped with more ramps and handicapped -friendly escalators .
Furthermore , on trains in Singapore , certain seats are allocated for the elderly .
Last but not least , health benefits for elderly should be protected .
They should be offered free medical check-ups and treatment if necessary .
In conclusion , healthcare services should not be neglected especially in countries which face an aging population .
More need to be done to improve our healthcare sector so as to achieve a healthier and wealthier society .
Over the past century , numerous research breakthroughs and creative innovations have allowed engineering design processes to meet various human needs .
According to Khandani (2005) , engineering designs are systems that are introduced by humans through combining different technologies and innovations to satisfy a particular human need creating ability for humans to complete a task faster or more efficiently .
To produce these systems , design processes are carried out over a period of time , ranging from months to years , and they are conducted based on a series of steps .
For example , water supply has been a main concern for the Singapore government as Singapore has no natural sources of water .
Consequently , after years of research and design  to alleviate this problem , the NEWater technology was invented .
This technology allows used water to be reusable after undergoing treatment through microfiltration and reverse osmosis .
This is an example of a particular human need which has been satisfied by an engineering design system .
Even though engineering design processes have been aiding humans in meeting many of their needs in the past , many others have yet to be satisfied; and the need to tackle pollution is one of them .
Pollution has been an ongoing problem for the past few decades or so and thus far , little has been done to alleviate this problem .
Global warming , as a result , is becoming more and more an issue of rising concern as little has been done to eliminate or substantially reduce pollution .
Temperature has been increasing due to the excessive release of greenhouse gases; and sea levels have been rising due to the melting of ice caps in the North and South poles .
Time is running out and to protect the sustainability of life on Earth , necessary actions have to be taken immediately , and if not , as soon as possible , and the help of engineering design processes should not be left out .
First and foremost , vehicles have been a main source of pollution and a large contributor to  emission of greenhouse gases .
In the past , vehicles used to emit harmful gases such as carbon monoxide .
Subsequently , engineering design processes have made possible the invention of catalytic converters which convert the harmful gases emitted by vehicles into non-harmful gases .
On the flip side , although the problem of the emission of harmful gases has been  , vehicles today are releasing carbon dioxide , which is a greenhouse gas , instead .
Consequently , a new engineering design process has to be carried out to rectify this problem .
After years of research , then comes the idea of inventing an environmentally-friendly car , also known as an ecocar .
For example , a group of Engineering and Design students from Singapore has invented its first environmentally-friendly car which does not emit any amount of carbon .
This is an example of a great breakthrough of an engineering design process which will be able to tackle the problem of pollution .
Throughout the years , there has always been a debate on whether technology shapes society , a technologically determinist perspective , or  society shapes technology , a socially determinist view .
One such technology that is closely related to this debate is the invention of the automobile .
Without this invention , we would probably still be riding the bicycle to work or school .
Looking back at history , we can see how this important technology has been shaped by societal factors as well as technological factors .
Due to the influence of these factors ,  gasoline-powered cars have won over  electric cars for years .
Firstly , societal factors like the expansion of cities favor  gasoline cars over electric cars .
As cities grow bigger , it becomes impractical to have an electric car for travelling .
For example ,  gasoline-powered cars can travel an average of about 300km on a full tank of petrol as compared to a maximum distance of 150km for a full charge on an electric battery .
In big cities like the United States , travelling to and fro from work can easily surpass 100km .
Also with the expansion of society , time becomes money .
No one is willing to spend 8 hours a day waiting for their car to be charged fully before they can make use of it .
Another societal factor is the increase in individualism among people .
Everyone now wants to own a car for  convenience and for individualism's sake .
In one family , there could be three cars; one for the father , the mother and the son .
Take Dubai for instance .
They now have an average ratio of 571 cars to every 1000 people .
Therefore , this affects  automobiles as people purchase more gasoline-powered cars .
The reason is that car manufacturers , in order to retain their market share of gasoline powered cars , will invest time and money to promote gasoline-powered vehicles over the unproven market of electric cars .
A social stigma that electric cars are only meant to be golf carts or less is hence created , and this leads to people purchasing gasoline powered cars .
Next , technological factors likecurrently available technology and limitation of resources have also helped shaped  automobiles .
With current technology , more hybrid cars are showing up on the market .
Hybrid cars involve either part gasoline and part electric or part gasoline and part compressed natural gas (CNG) .
This is made possible only with the advancement of technology as compared to the past .
For instance , the regenerative brake system has been invented whereby you charge your battery just by braking .
Car manufacturers like Chevrolet are cashing in on this possible new market , and coming up with new models like the Optra Magnum CNG in 2008 .
With a cleaner and efficient hybrid car , more people are opting for the switch .
The gasoline-powered car has finally seen a worthy competitor .
However , technological restraints like limited resources have been a set back for hybrid users .
Looking at Singapore for example , there are only 5 CNG refueling points around the country .
To get your vehicle refueled would be troublesome if the nearest CNG petrol station is far away .
This constraint makes consumers think twice before purchasing a hybrid vehicle .
Also , the fact that hybrid cars are a relatively new technology , car repair shops might not have the knowledge to repair hybrid cars yet , and any repairs must be sent back to the car manufacturer .
This makes it inconvenient if the shop is located far away from the consumer .
In short , these few factors have played an important role in shaping the automobiles that we know today .
Imagine if there are no technological restraints and that we could create a self replenishing battery .
The possibilities are endless , but it proves one point .
Technology and society co-exist and affect one another .
Even until now , we are shaping many other technological inventions .
Only the future can foretell the impact of these factors on technological advancement such as in the automobile industry .
Who knows , hybrid cars might actually manage to successfully dethrone  gasoline-powered  cars in the near future .
Electronics such as lights and cars have become essential to  human beings over the past years .
However , these electronics though wonderful ,  consume a huge amount of energy .
Given that the global price of fuel is on the rise , users of these electronics are incurring higher cost .
One current human need that should be given priority for engineering design is to have cos-saving electronics .
Firstly , the problems with lights is that , in order to save electricity , the user will have to manually turn off the lights upon leaving the area , which is rather impractical in places such as offices , toilets and classrooms which require the lights to be constantly turned on .
The idea of electricity conservation on usage of lights was to have the lights automatically turned off when the area is empty .
As a result , the idea sparked off the concept of integrating motion sensors to lights .
The challenge in having a motion sensor light to automatically turn on and off the lights with the presence of a human being was how to accurately identify the presence of a human being in the area monitored by the sensor .
To overcome the challenge , the motion sensors use infrared energy to detect human beings .
In addition , these sensors are also highly sensitive to human body temperature , therefore resulting in a highly accurate detection .
Today these motion sensor lights are used almost everywhere , in offices , toilets , classrooms and even homes .
Secondly , the recent price hikes in petrol fuel have caused human beings to pay a higher amount of money for their car petrol as compared to previously .
To overcome the price hikes , an alternative to petrol fuel is needed .
The outcome of intensive engineering design was to replace petrol fuel with (CNG) Compressed Natural Gas .
These natural gases are widely available on earth as compared to petrol fuel which is getting limited as  oil reserves get depleted .
In order for a car to be powered using CNG , there are certain modifications that needed to be done .
For example , new fuel storage was introduced , and took the name of Integrated Storage System .
Another example is the modification of the engine .
The natural gas from the storage cylinders flows into a fuel line when the engine is started .
The gas is then ignited by a spark plug , thus powering the car .
In Singapore , public transports such as taxisand buses have converted to CNG .
In addition , according to Channel NewsAsia , there is an increasing number of private cars owners converting their conventional petrol fuel-powered cars to CNG cars .
Engineering designs have improved the designs of lights and cars , which used to consume a huge amount of energy in the past .
To sum up , with the depletion of natural resources and high electricity and fuel cost , engineering designing should be given priority  cost saving electronics .
Engineering design is the process of creating a system or products to meet the desired needs of people .
Usually , engineers face difficulty in designing a product or coming out with ideas  demanded by the public .
An engineer needs to define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate and analyse multiple solutions and finally , test and implement  the solution  .
However , the two most disturbing problems that may hamper engineering design processes for innovations are the inability of engineers to generate multiple solutions to convince their superior to implement their products or ideas and the failure of constantly creating a product that is in demand .
Firstly , in the aspect of generating multiple solutions , engineers often face the problems of lack of funds and inability to convince their superior that their idea is feasible .
In most cases , their design will be rejected because the product or idea is not conventional .
Their idea or product is a totally new concept which people may find  hard to accept because of a traditional idea or product that may have been etched in their mind .
For example , in the Singapore National Service ,  military officers , using their portion of dominant influence , typically make most of the important decisions about innovation .
In addition ,  low ranking cadets usually fail to convince  high ranking officers that their innovative products or ideas may improve the military .
One example is the introduction of unmanned combat air vehicles by the engineers in the military .
This unmanned combat air vehicle might have been potent enough to replace the ubiquitous manned fighter in the near future .
However , due to the higher officer not having enough trust over the air vehicle being piloted by a human , this unmanned combat vehicle project did not succeed in being implemented .
Instances such as the above example will significantly affect the morale of the engineers .
Hence , it is imperative to address the issue of engineers unable to convince their superior to implement their products or ideas .
As engineers , if their ideas or products face constant rejection by their superior , they will stop coming up with new ideas or products as they see no purpose in coming up with new ideas or products and constantly opposing their superiors .
Thus ,  superiority in companies will significantly hamper engineers' morale and their design .
Secondly , the other problem that restricts engineering design is the lack of confidence to implement ideas or products that are in demand .
Although in the initial stage response to their products may be good , when it comes to implementing their ideas or products , the response may be different .
Engineers spend a lot of effort in developing these products , but the final products that they design may not be of popular demand .
Society always strives for useful and economic products .
Products that are not practical and expensive will face rejection .
For instance , in the 1960s , Singapore developed a phone that was able to see the other caller .
This type of phone faced rejection because it was expensive and users found it infringing on their privacy .
As a result ,  sales of these phones were low , affecting the morale of the engineer who designed it .
Facing multiple failures may cause engineers to be disheartened and put them on high alert as they will be more careful when they want to design a product .
They will tend to feel disappointed because they need to solicit a lot of funds , putting in their utmost efforts when developing the products , but only to find out that their products face rejection by the public .
This will seriously restrict their innovation because they may be afraid to face constant failure .
The "best" design solution is always hard to develop because it is one that most completely fulfils a client's requirement .
Therefore , engineers may just stop at gathering pertinent information , and not go into generating multiple solutions as they  worry that their products may not be in demand as expected , which again may hamper their design processes for innovations .
In conclusion , it is usually the lack of ability to convince their superiors and the constant rejection by the public that significantly hamper engineering design for innovations .
Traditional mindsets should be changed and let engineers have a chance to develop their ideas .
Furthermore , engineers should do their research and marketing of their products effectively , such that products that they develop will be of market value .
Scientific technology has been developing rapidly since the first industrial revolution .
Meanwhile , many new kinds of innovative inventions come out almost  every day , thus changing the way people live .
It is a remarkable fact  that  technical innovation is viewed differently by different groups of people .
A wonderful invention to a group of people may be disliked  others  .
In general , the justification of the utility of a specific technology or invention depends on the specific opinionsof different group of people .
Space technology is a good example to explain the existence of different views  .
Space technology is a kind of highly innovative , highly composite and also highly costly technology .
Its aim is to find out  unknown scientific questions and for military use .
The beginning of space technology was in America and Russia .
Then it quickly spread out  all over the world .
Nowadays European countries , China , Japan and India  all have advanced development in space technology .
Toward this new technique ,  two opposite opinions exist nowadays .
Governments  and scientists think it is worth to spend money and people working on thisbecause it will benefit the whole country .
However , many people think that it is a waste of resources which can be used to improve people's living conditions .
If we look a little deeper into the causes that lead to the opposite solution , we will find that the focus that specific groups of people pay attention to is , obviously , quite different from each other .
From the governments' and scientists' point-of-view , space technology is essential because it is the fundamental thing we need to do to protect our countries and fulfill future needs .
They pay much attention to keep technological developdevelopment moving and concentrate more on  huge issues , like military demand , and the future .
That is also the reason why every country tries its best to improve  space technology .
Former President of America Reagan even announced the star wars program , although it was given up at the end .
On the contrary , civilians who state the opposite idea  focus more on current living conditions and the environment .
Whether people can go to the outer space has nothing to do with them .
They simply pay their attention to the surroundings that need improvement to make  better living conditions .
With the high cost of space technology development , they will think government focus on this is a kind of waste .
In their opinion , government should spend these money and resources on  places which  can benefit us .
So , it is not surprising that not all people were satisfied when Chinese Government proudly announced the success of the launching of the Shenzhou-5 spacesuit into the universe . 
In conclusion , judgments of technical innovation or development always  differ because they are made by different groups of people .
All in all , the differences do really derive from  different thinking perspectives .
Because people tend to think about things associated with their own experience and life , different opinions emerge .
Hundreds of years ago , people used to go out riding horses , illuminate the house by candlesand start fire using firewood .
And we now go out by buses , light the house by electric lights , start fire using lightersand so on .
Nowadays , people live in a very convenient world .
But few may notice that we are facing a serious problem behind all these inventions we are using .
To run all these things , we need energy .
And the shortage of petroleum is the most important issue that we must address .
Why is  petroleum very important ?
Petroleum can be extracted and refined to produce fuels including petrol , paraffin , and diesel oil .
Without these extracted products from petroleum , cars cannot run , planes cannot fly , and ships cannot be launched  .
The world may not run any more .
WhatWhat is more , petroleum is a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons which is present in suitable rock strata and is not reproducible for now .
It is said that after 60 years , the world will run out of petroleum .
How are we going to solve this problem ?
There are two ways to solve this problem .
One way is to conserve and save  petroleum .
Engineers have come up with some solutions to saving  petroleum .
The greatest consumption of petroleum is in the transportation operation .
One of the engineer's solutions is to mix  alcohol and petrol together to provide  energy .
This solution is now being tested and implemented  .
In Wuhan , one of the biggest cities in China , all  taxies are operating using this mixed fuel .
Another solution , which is almost the same concept , is the Hybrid-Electric Vehicle .
This kind of vehicles uses both electric power and fuel and is different from the previous version .
It combines  electric power system and fuel system together .
When the vehicle starts , it consumes the electric power .
After the speed of the car reaches a certain range , it will switch to fuel power system .
When using fuel power to start the car , the fuel is not fully burned .
That is why we can smell strong petrol when the car starts .
The concept of power system is to let  fuel fully used in order to save it .
However , conservation alone cannot solve the problem .
The other way is to develop new energy resources to replace petroleum .
Hydrogen fuel cell , solar power and nuclear power are the three hottest topics that have interested engineers most .
Research  on fuel cell on vehicles was started in early 1960s and it has continuously  developed until now .
Most  car makers have come out with their own hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles .
But hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are still in the testing and implementation phase .
There are some prototypes running on the road .
But for the finalized product , the cost should be reduced and the efficiency of the cell should be increased .
Solar and nuclear power are the more advanced technology .
Solar power is in the experimental phase .
The key point in increasing the efficiency of solar power is how to isolate the sunshine .
If this challenge can be solved , the potential of solar power is prodigious .
For nuclear power ,  it is using the power generated by  nuclear fusion .
Nuclear fusion is the same way as the sun in generating its power .
Research on nuclear fusion has been going on for decades , but the progress is not very obvious .
In brief , the energy problem is one of our most serious problems  now .
So we need to work on it step by stepand  follow the right rules to arrive at the best solution to this urgent problem .
We live in an era of great change , an increasingly global society as a result of rapid growth in information and communication technologies .
However , the above only holds through for those who are not stricken with poverty .
The needs of poor  people , most of whom are based in developing countries , are endless .
The need for basic infrastructure ranks high on their priorities .
This is because basic infrastructure is the basis for any country to develop essential facilities like transport , housing and education to help the poor .
The engineering design process is an effective way through which the needs of these people could be met comprehensively .
According to Kandani (2005) , the very first step in any engineering design is to identify the need and to define the problem .
The word 'need' refers to a man's desire for a certain product or system .
This need is usually identified by the society and may vary from society to society .
Thus , needs which are considered a necessity to some might actually be a luxury to others .
For example , infrastructure is a real need for those living in the rural villages in Asia but not for the nomads in Africa , although both groups are affected by poverty .
The nomads would prefer to conserve the forests and wildlife so as to be able to carry on with their nomadic lifestyle .
This example clearly illustrates the importance of establishing the need accurately so that engineers would be able to work effectively towards solving the problem .
The second step of this engineering design process is to gather essential information .
In this step , engineers analyze the existing solutions and pick out the pros and cons .
Economic , environmental and safety factors are also analyzed .
Many developing countries have made big plans on establishing infrastructure in the rural areas in an attempt to bridge the gap in the standard of living between the urban towns and suburban villages .
However , these plans tend to get hit by delays after delays because of various reasons .
So it is vital for engineers to collect as much information as possible so as to not repeat the mistakes and go down the same slippery slope of their predecessors .
The most logical step after coming up with a few solutions is to pick the best one .
This is actually the decision-making process , after studying the various solutions .
For instance , if a school is being built , based on the land available , few designs would have already been thought off .
Certain schools might be able to hold more students while not proving to be as stable as others that hold fewer students but are very much stronger .
So it is in this step that engineers make the decision of which design to adopt while weighing in all the factors to come up with a viable solution .
The final step in the engineering design process is to test and implement the solution .
This step is to essentially win the approval of the consumer as well as picking on possible flaws .
Ironically , this step is one that is followed by most  .
However , they do not bother to pick out flaws , thus in the end the consumer uses a flawed product .
Possible flaws should be identified so that the product can be improved on later .
In conclusion , I would like to recommend the engineering design process because it is very complete in its steps to provide a solution to those in need .
The establishment of basic infrastructure in developing countries through engineering design will give the poor an avenue to successfully escape from the vicious cycle of poverty .
The world today is experiencing global warming which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation .
The solution to this problem is the harnessing of an alternative form of energy called kinetic energy in wind .
An example of a product created for this purpose is the wind turbine and it is created using the three main steps in design process to address the problem which are problem definition , information gathering and testing and implementing of solutions .
The first step in the design process is  problem definition .
Following this procedure helps to generate more solutions to the problem addressed .
Tapping  kinetic energy in wind is a good solution as wind is abundant due to the frequent changes in the atmospheric pressure .
This step announces to  engineers that the Earth is in grave danger , thus giving them more motivation to think of a solution .
For example , by defining the problem as the fast decreasing quantity of fossil fuels ,  engineers gain insight into creating a product which can be used to tap kinetic energy in wind .
Referring to the earlier models of windmills like those built in Sistan , Iran , from the seventh century , which were used to grind rice grains , engineers used the same concept to create wind turbine which converts kinetic energy in wind into electrical energy .
The second step in the design process is the gathering of information .
The credibility of the problem needs to be addressed after it has been defined .
The important factor which determines the efficiency of the wind turbine is the general wind flow in the area where the wind turbine is built .
Since the wind turbine heavily depends on the wind to generate electricity , it is important to study the wind flow pattern before the wind turbine is built .
For this study , past weather forecasts and also the internet play vital roles in providing information needed to improve the efficiency of the wind turbine .
The overall gain in electrical energy needs to be calculated to decide whether the building of wind turbine is worth its value .
The last step in the design process is the testing and implementation of solutions .
The testing and implementation of solutions is closely related to the analysis of the design solution .
The main factor which contributes to the analysis is marketability .
For example , the Matilda built at Goland , Sweden produced a surprisingly high sixty-one gigawatts per hour of electricity in fifteen years which produced more energy than the other typical wind turbines .
However , the Matilda was demolished on June 6 , 2008 .
In conclusion , the main three steps in the design process help to create a guideline for the engineers to follow .
Problem definition requires knowledge of wind and thus making full use of it .
In terms of information gathering , the efficiency of the wind turbine is of paramount importance in determining whether it really solves the problem .
Lastly , the testing and implementation of solutions consists of marketability , ergonomics and safety which serve as a check on whether the product is deemed suitable to solve the problem .
Nowadays , engineering design products are everywhere .
Engineering systems play important roles in all  fields , for example , entertainment , healthcare as well as education .
Although they are essential for all  fields , engineering products and systems in healthcare and medical fields should be given the highest priority since health is the most important thing for all human beings .
Designing of medical products which can make all human beings  healthier  is obviously important .
Moreover , some medical products like "Fall Detection System" and "Posture monitoring system" can even help people save life in some ways .
On the other hand , people normally spend much more time for entertainment than healthcare .
As a result , there are mass products for entertainment because of high demand .
Instead , healthcare products should be widely available and used .
There are many healthcare products which are available in research organizations but not widely available in the current market .
For example , "Fall Detection System"  can detect the fall of persons , especially elder people , and can send instant messages via sms to relatives so that they can get immediate help in critical situations .
As mentioned in the "Global action on aging" website  , the number of senior citizens is rising  taking care of them imperative .
It is also mentioned that since the number of elderly people is increasing , the burden of caring is also increasing for young people .
Hence , engineering should consider this situation  and come out with solutions which will  help the elderly and make youth work without worry .
Although there are R&Ds for healthcare products for monitoring and taking care of the elderly , these devices are not widely used in the market .
So , in order to address this situation , engineers should think about  ways that can make the design process meet the needs of the market  .
One  example of a medical system is "Posture Monitoring System" which can monitor body posture all the time and continuously warning the user to maintain the best posture .
Recently in 2009 , Nanyang Polytechnic won a merit prize in the Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors' Award competition in Singapore through its posture monitoring system  .
There are also research papers and prototypes of posture monitoring system by R&D from other countries but are not widely available in the current market .
One example of engineering products for the disabled which is mentioned in The Straits Times by Grace Chua is a chair that turns sound into vibrations  , invented by NUS PhD student Suranga Nanayakkara This  help deaf people experience music and even aid them in speech therapy .
In order to make engineering design products meet  needs , first of all , a clear and unambiguous definition of the problem should be defined .
Problems should be widely and clearly defined by engineers , the elderly as well as adults so that more innovative products and ideas come out .
Moreover , it is also necessary to make sure that there is enough information to generate clear problem definitions that addresses the real need .
Once alternative solutions come out , engineers need to analyze and decide on the best suited solution to implement  .Governments and organizations are also responsible in supporting the R&D process in order to gather information needed , generate multiple solutions , analyze solutions and test as well as implement solutions which are the necessary steps for the design process .
In conclusion , engineers should try to identify ideal situation in the market for their products , for example , the "Fall Detection System" which can take care of the elderly and the "Posture monitoring system" which can help people of all ages to maintain best posture with the help of government and organizations as well as consumers .
And the goal can also be achieved by developing  suitable design engineering process for healthcare systems and products .
A human need is a necessity that humans need in order to survive .
One main necessity is food .
According to the World Food Program's 2008 report , 25000 people are dying every day due to famine and related issues .
A large portion of the deaths comes from  Third World Countries like Africa and India .
By using the Engineering Design Process introduced by Seyyed Khandani , a professor at Diablo Valley College , we can reduce  famine .
Some factors that contribute to famine famine include political , technological and environmental issues .
The World Food Program (WFP) has been providing food and aid to areas affected by famine  .
By using the engineering design process , the first step is to define the problem .
The definition of the problem is straightforward in the beginning: the people are starving , so they must be provided food .
However , for Malawi , the WFP and the World Bank figured out a solution  , they found out that it is better to donate cash to them; based on their  research and found out that the country has food resources , but the poor cannot afford them .
In the 1990s , the WFP introduced  donation of cash and vouchers  , and one of the pioneer countries that received this  is Malawi .
Thus , providing cash did not only help to solve the famine , it also improved the financial situation of the farmers .
Furthermore , the WFP saved time and cost  collecting  food and delivering it to the affected areas .
In 1970s , the WFP provided food to India to temporarily solve  famine .
During this period , they analyzed the situation to generate other solutions to permanently solve the famine .
According to the design process , the second step is to gather related information , then generate possible solutions .
The first possible solution was to provide genetically modified seeds and fertilizers to  farmers , so that they would obtain higher yield .
Before this solution was implemented , they did a further study , and realized that the solution would not work as the farmers were using traditional farming methods which are not yield efficient .
Hence , the WFP provided machines and farming education to the farmers in the 1980s .
These aids  improved the famine situation as it dropped by about 20% in a WFP 1990s report; On the other hand , these solutions  not applicable to all  lands in India as different areas have different types of lands .
For the dry lands , the WFP had to do further researchresearch on water irrigation methods .
One of the solutions was to construct a drainage system from the Indira Ghandi canal to irrigate the dry lands in the region .
Some events like drought , flood and earthquakes cause famine .
These types of events are unavoidable .
Nevertheless , events like deforestation and overgrazing have also affected fertile lands and caused yields to go down .
Governments spend millions and billions of dollars on entertainment and military expenditure yearly , but ththis large amount of money could have been put to good use in helping their own people .
India has increased  military spending by 50% in 2008 , bringing the amount to 40 billion dollars , although 35% of its people are still affected by famine .
The famine caused by these situations is preventable .
The large amount of money could be invested in the agriculture sector , like using  technology to plant seeds that will grow on dry land which will greatly solve the famine .
In conclusion , the WFP can do more research and analysis , like creating genetic modified seeds that can survive in dry or wet land , or an indoor farming center that will shelter the crops from natural disasters , to resolve the famine issue .
In addition ,  governments can try to allocate more budget to  agriculture and research centers than to the entertainment sector , which is not right when people in their own country are suffering  .
The last step in the design process is to test and implement the solution .
Taking a small step forward will reduce  famine .
Poverty is unavoidable , but famine is preventable .
Thus , we should do more to help the people  are suffering from famine .
Communication is an important part of human development .
It allows ideas and information to be disseminated effectively .
One of the milestones in human communication is the invention of radio which changed the way we communicate in an obvious and physical way .
Radio allows the transmission of data over a distance literally through the air , which is not possible by the conventional cable lines .
Although the primary use of radio when it was first invented was for communication , alternative use of radio have been developed and applied .
Two main driving factors that shaped the innovations of radio are economic and military demands , leading to the usage of radio beyond pure communication .
The value of radio being able to transmit and receive information over a distance wirelessly and cheaply has been the attention of scientists and inventors .
The first radio set was able to transmit only simple signals , but still it was valuable enough to be used by in maritime work .
Due to its simplicity , Morse code was adopted as the preferred language used on radio then .
By sending Morse code sailors were able to communicate with other sailors or to controlling towers on land when they were out in the open sea .
Hence , safety of sailors had improved as they would be able to signal for help during emergency .
An example would be the sending of by the Titanic to the nearest ship requesting  assistance  before it sank .
It illustrated the usefulness of radio as a tool for communication in situations where line communication  not possible .
Sending of Morse code via radio set was further popularised by  telegraphy which transformed the use of radio into a service much like the postal service .
Telegraphy flourished as it was relatively reliable and much faster than postal service , encouraging more resources to be channelled into the development and research of radio technology .
Another value of radio was its ability to perform mass communication .
As the average cost of production declined steadily , the radio set was mass produced leading to the birth of radio broadcasting .
Broadcasting allows single directional flow of communication where important information can be disseminated to the mass quickly and effectively .
Warnings and announcements regarding weather or disaster evacuation  made via broadcasting will greatly help in minimising the casualty rate in a disaster as the masses can receive vital and timely information and instruction even when the cable lines are damaged .
The other factors that have influenced the development of radio will be military demands .
The need for communication between joined military operations across forces and formations lead to the development of powerful signal set .
To prevent enemies from tapping on their communications or disrupting their signals , technology such as "anti-jamming" was developed by the military .
Besides improving on communication , military demands had also led to the invention of radar which uses radio wave in detecting distant objects and getting information such as their location and movement .
The technology of radar was soon transferred to civil usage such as by the commercial planes and ships due to its usefulness in navigation .
Another development of radio by military is guided weapon which arises from the need to raise accuracy of weapon in decreasing the chances of damaging and injuring civilian or allied forces .
In conclusion , radio is an important technology that is still being developed and improved continuously .
From its communication values to other discovered usages , economic  and military factors have played a positive role in its overall development .
The invention and development of radio have bettered the society in numerous ways .
A need refers to what is required in order to do something or achieve some state of being .
'Human needs' , for example , have been taken to describe requirements which must be satisfied if harm to an agent is to be avoided .
Overpopulation is one of the current human needs or challenges that should be given priority .
Size or density of the population affects  overpopulation .
In the world where  human populations are growing , we should focus on solving the problem of insufficient land to maintain  life on earth .
Houses today are stronger , and some of them can withstand natural disaster .
For example in Japan , a country where earthquakes happen often , their engineers try to solve the problem of constructing buildings that can withstand earthquakes .
By using the Khandani Principle ,  engineers gather pertinent information about earthquakes and manage to implement a solution after several tests have been conducted , called Seismic retrofitting method , where Seismic retrofitting is the changing of an existing building to a structure that is more resistant to ground motion and soil failure due to earthquakes or seismic activity .
Engineers try to solve overpopulation by combining many houses into one building , thus building multi-unit housing , or also known as attached dwellings , has been initiated .
Apartments , barracks , tenements and terrace houses are good examples of multi-unit housing .
Engineers applied the Khandani principle that time; they defined the problem and gathered enough information to make sure the buildings would not collapse .
For example , in Singapore , where  land is very small , engineers built a lot of condominiums and apartments to solve the problem of insufficient houses and managed to save some of the land for other purposes .
However , in the future , the population will further increase , and  building more multi-unit housing cannot solve the problem effectively .
In my opinion , engineeengineers should focus on upgrading the buildings .
They should build multiple level basements for multi-unit housing and building since we do not really use a lot of the underground space .
Building multiple level basements may cause some other potential problems and engineers should try to solve these .
Engineers have to analyze every possible problem that may occur like water seepage , internal condensation , underground virus and bad acoustics when in building more underground levels .
That is why building more underground level , we need to use the Khandani principle (2005)that requires engineers to gather a lot of pertinent information from any sources available before implementing it .
In addition , engineers can also improve the stability of buildings so that more levels can be built above them .
The stability  depends on the wideness of the base level , the material of the structure and the method of building the structure .
Engineers can increase the width of the base of the structure to support an extra level of building built on it .
Engineers can improve the structures by using stronger material like diamonds , gold ,  etc .
and finding more suitable methods for building a structure .
Nobody can create a perfect solution with just one try .
Engineers need to test the solution before they start to use it .
Hidden problems can be found out by testing them under real conditions (Khandani , 2005) .
In conclusion , with Khandani's the such process , engineers can generate a perfect solution to solve overpopulation .
If we compare the house 10000 BC to the modern house today , engineering design process is apparent .
If in the world we do not have engineering design process , engineers may generate solutions that are ineffective or  may cause harm to other life forms .
There are many human needs in the world and the engineering design process can help to meet those needs in a better way .
The issue of the depletion of earth's natural resources has been raised repeatedly throughout recent times .
The earth's natural resources are not well distributed across the globe , and hence some countries faces the problem of the lack of certain natural resources .
Singapore , due to its small land size area , also face the problem of the lack of natural resources .
In particular , the issue of the lack of water has been the headlines for many times .
In order for Singapore to be self-reliant on water , there is a need for Singapore to create portable water resources for its people .
Singapore had tried a number of ways in its bid to shift towards self-reliance on water .
This includes desalination and damping up of rivers to form water catchment areas .
However , these methods are still short of providing for the growing need of water by its people .
In recent years , the nation's engineers have come up with a purification process which can purify waste water into portable water for use .
The product  is called New water .
New water is treated waste water that has undergone stringent purification processes using advanced dual membrane and ultraviolet technology .
The product can be bottled for consumption , or be mixed with reservoir water and will then go through the usual water treatment to produce drinkable water .
Currently , New water is supplying Singapore with 15% of its water demands .
There are plans to scale up the project to contribute 30% of the water supply by 2010 .
The quality of the product is even assured by many international experts .
This is indeed a product of a system which is engineered to meet the human need for natural resources .
The design process of the system has undergone 5 design process stages as illustrated by Khandani in his Engineering Design process paper .
Firstly , the team of engineers working on the New water project identified the problem which is the lack of water resources for Singapore .
Singapore has been buying water from Malaysia , its neighbouring country , in order to supplement its own water supply .
However , the water agreements with Malaysia are expiring soon in 2011 & 2061 .
The agreements have been providing for 40% of the country needs .
Therefore , the engineers identified the need for Singapore to shift towards self-sustainability in terms of water resources .
Secondly , they gathered pertinent information on the technologies and usage of water that is purified from waste water .
However , the first masterplan was shelved because of the great cost and unreliability of the process .
The cost incurred will offset the benefit that it may bring .
Hence , the team decided to wait for further technological advancement before building its first plant .
They eventually built its first plant after the technology of dual membrane purification  matured and the production cost came down .
Thirdly , prior to the implementation of the New Water technology , there were also multiple solutions to the problem of lack of water resources in Singapore .
Solutions included desalination of sea water and damping up more rivers to increase the water catchment area .
The desalination of seawater would require large amount of fossil fuel to run which is another natural resource that Singapore does not have .
Furthermore , the desalination plants would also leave a larger carbon footprint .
Despite these , a desalination plant was still built because of the growing demand .
The damping up of rivers to form water catchment areas was in fact being implemented .
Marina barrage , the newest kid on the block , was formed by damping the marina channel to form a large water catchment area capable of meeting 10% of Singapore's need .
However , as Singapore has limited land , we could not go on forever creating water catchment areas from our land .
Therefore , New Water was decided as a solution needed to meet the need for water of the nation .
Finally , in May 2000 , the first New Water plant was completed .
Currently there are 4 New Water plant in Singapore with a fifth on its way .
Together , they will be able to meet 30% of Singapore's need .
Bottled New Water was also given out during National events , promoting its use  in our daily life .
In conclusion , New Water has been an engineering design which was designed to meet the human need for water  particularly in Singapore .
Throughout  human history , there are a lot of successful products which have great effect on human life ,  like television , the cell and so on .
It is not only their high level technology that makes them so successful , but also the fact that they meet the needs of the people .
The electric car , which was first invented by General Motors Company (GM) , is such an interesting case .
The invention of electric cars is both a success and failure .
We can analyse it in both social and technological aspects .
The electric car is the product of social reasons .
As we know , an ordinary car's fuel is gas which has been used since the first car was been produced .
While there exists a problem that the burning of gas gives off poisonous gases and a large amount of carbon dioxide which causes serious air pollution .
Furthermore , as it is mineral resource , the supply of gas is becoming less and less which directly leads to the rise of the price .
Because of the reasons stated above , people want to invent a kind of vehicle which can use cleaner and cheaper energy instead of gas .
That is why the electric cars came into being .
Another direct  social reason is that in the early 1990s , the California and Arizona state governments had raised a policy which said at least 10 percent of the cars produced in the automobile companies should be environmental friendly , in other words , nonpolluting .
This promoted the research into electric cars .
In the mean time , GM also wanted to use this opportunity to restore their position in the automobile world .
These are the social reasons that did favor to electric car .
It is commonly known thalobal warming is caused by frequently industrial activities these years; in detail , it is due to the emisparticipate inen house gas (GHG) .
However , this idea is not acceptable for somey consider the climate change as the natural phenomenon .
Actually , if we refer to the figure of "Temperature VS CO2 Emission" , we cMother Earthraway reach a conclusion .
We can surprisingly find that the two curves matcach other , in other words , it implies that the growth of temperature has somkengineersndency toward the growth of the emission of CO2 .
So , it is hard to say that there is no relationship between these two issues .
In recent years , due to much more frequent industrial activities , the curve of emission of CO2 consequently jumps to a very high point , so does the curve of temperature .
Nowadays , the rising temperature has been paid much more attention because of some sudden , striking surprise , for instance , the melting ice in Antarctica , the rising sea level .

We have only one Earth Mother , we will never lose her .
As our society progresses human beings get stuck in a dilemma of energy .
On one hand , the energy resources we use now , which are mainly fossil fuels , will be exhausted soon if we continue to consume at the current rate while the use of fossil fuels triggers  a series of environmental problems .
On the other hand , the development of society calls for larger and larger amounts of energy , which makes us in desperate need of energy .
In order to develop our society without exhausting all the fossil fuels or sacrificing our environment , we have to find new energy resources to take the place of traditional fossil fuels .
In this case , solar energy stands out as our first choice .
Engineering design plays a significant role in the use of solar energy , especially in  solar heating .
In the first stage , engineering design mainly contributes by clearly defining the problem and gathering pertinent information .
In fact , humans had begun to utilize solar energy to heat water as early as 3000 years ago .
However , the efficiency of solar energy was very slow .
The question of how to make an efficient and effective solar heating system is addressed by engineers .
In order to find the solution , engineers spend large amount of time to collect the relevant information , from which they can generate iinspiration , while drawing lessons from the previous work .
Though this preliminary stage appears simple , actually it not only takes a lot of time and calls for patience , but also is the crucial fundamental stage of  the solution .
Then engineers come in at core step , that is , the generation of solutions .
First , engineers will decide to make a solar collector which can effectively collect solar energy from the surroundings Because of the efficient heat conductibility of metal , engineers use a huge piece of metal which is painted black to collect the solar energy .
After that , they build the circulation equipment to make water flow below the metal so that the metal can transmit the heat to water and then people can use the heated water .
Using this solar heating system , engineers also designed certain products widely used in our daily life , such as the solar water heater .
That is not the end of engineering design .
What engineers will do next is  test the system and make possible improvements .
Although solar energy has certain advantages compared to other kinds of energy , it has an inevitable disadvantage .
The solar energy is limited by various natural conditions , such as day and night , seasons , and places .
It is not stable enough , so  people may not be able to use solar energy to heat water whenever they need .
To improve the solar heating system , engineers have added accessorial energy equipment to it such as an  heater .
This improvement makes it possible for people to get hot water fast and conveniently even when there is not enough sunlight .
That is the end of the engineering design in the the solar heating system .
To make an efficient and effective solar heating system , engineers carefully define the problem and collect important information about this issue .
Then they generate all the possible solutions .
Finally they test the solutions and make changes to improve the solution .
Besides solar heating system , engineering design is also used in other fields  .
With the help of engineering design , the wish to get out of the current energy dilemma will no longer be a dream .
Earth ,and thereCurrently ,h of solar energy can be traced back to the year of 1900 .
Allivesgh at thstimulatesthey only focused on solar power plant .
Later , because of the decrease of petroleum and natural gas , the scientists paid attention to solar energy again .
Until today , the process of solar energy research is stoll quite difficult .
However , because of the severe pollution problem , we have tohe development of solar energy .
Nowadays , there are already vaplants kinds of solar energy product ininhe market .
For example , peopuse solar energy converter to heat up water , which save amazing amount of energy acquired from other ways .
Besides , the usage of solar panel should become more and more important in the future .
It is said that if we can cover a place of 40 ,000 square miles with solar panel , the demand for electricity of the whole world will be satisfied .
Also , solar energy is inexhaustible and we can use it without worrying about polluting the atmosphere , which really solved the problem brought by the consumption of fossil fuels .
pBecause the world , people are accepting solar energy product such as solar energy converter as they think that it is fashionable and pollution-free .
Forproductse , in rural and pastoral Tibet , solar energy converteconverterseplaced conventional pollutionsave an amazing But in cities such as Guanthroughg and ShangDong provinces in China , peoplpanels not so willing to install solar energy converter though the government forced some buildings to install the converters to save panelsy and reduce carbon emission .
As for the solar energy panel , the situation is better .
Some residents in America covered their roof with solar energy panel and hopes those panels will solvese 50 percent causedercent of power consumption in their house .
Moreoverplacesce the price are solar energy panel is decreasing productsy , more and more consuconverters think about the usathey of solar energy panel .
In the 1980s and 1990s , the research of solar energy fell into the low tide because that the price of petroleum fell down and the solar energy product was too expensive and there was no important breakthrough about the development of solar eneconvertersct .
However , since the has forcednmental pollution has become one of the most important topics in the world nowadays , we also should pay more attention to clean energy such as solar energy .
The usage of solar energroofsoduct will not onlypanels largunt of energy and solve the prf energy crisis but also give us a clean worlhousesh little pollution .
With the development of the society , our demand for the various commodities keeps increasing .
We want to make our lives more comfortable and convenient .
However , without enough energy to manufacture the products , how can our desire be satisfied ?
Therefore , the current human need to find endless energy source is becoming more and more urgent , so  it should be given priority .
To satisfy the current human need , we should use Roger's Engineering design process to work out a  solution .
This process contains five steps: define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , test and implement the solution .
As we know , most of the energy we are consuming is fossil energy such as coal and oil , which is limited .
If we just depend  on fossil energy  , how can we live on after hundreds of yearsyears ?
Just a few years ago , America declared  war against Iraq with the justification that there were bio-chemical weapons in Iraq .
Obviously , it wanted the oil in Iraq .
This war warns us that if we do not solve the energy problems , more wars may be declared in the future .
That is really disastrous and horrible .
However , there are many other kinds of energy sources on the earth such as nuclear power , water power and solar power .
Now the problem is how to use these power sources assubstitutes for the fossil energy , which means how to convert these power into the energy that can be used by us such as electrical power .
To solve this problem , building electrical powerhouses may be the best choice .
The reason is that  electrical power is clean , easily transported and easily stored .
Therefore , different places can share the energy source .
The problems brought by the unbalanced energy source distribution are solved .
Although making use of nuclear power , water power and solar power seems feasible , there are some reasons that make solar power  the most appropriate .
Nuclear power can be very clean and can generate large quantities of electrical power .
Nevertheless , it can generate such huge power that it is very unsafe .
For instance , in 1986 , a nuclear powerhouse in Soviet Union exploded , which destroyed many buildings and claimed many people's lives .
The strong radiation of the explosion even influenced all of the North Hemisphere .
What a tragedy it was !
We cannot guarantee there will be no such kind of explosion any longer if we rely on nuclear power .
Using water power can just slightly reduce the pressure on the energy .
That is because the consuption of energy is so large nowadays that even though we make full use of water power , it is still far less than the consumption .
Undeniably , the technology of solar power conversion today is still not perfect .
Many improvements should be made to increase the conversion rate and lower the cost of the equipment so it can be utilised .
Nevertheless , this does not affect solar power to be the most ideal energy for the future .
Compared to other sources , solar power has three big advantages .
The first is that it is very clean .
Actually , the sunlight is electramagnetic waves .
During the convertion to electrical power , there is no emission of poisonous gas or water .
The second is that soalr power is very safe .
Unlike the nuclear power or water power , we never need to worry about the explosion of the powerhouse nor the collapse of dams caused by the strong water stream .
we already have built some solar powerhouses but we have never heard anything unfortunate happen .
Last but most importantly , solar power seems endless .
Only if the sun disappears will the soalr power be used up .
However , as we know , the life of the sun is more than billions of years .
Therefore , for the three advantages above , we can find it really meaningful to develop the solar power technology
Furthermore , during the development of solar power technology ,  .
This means that we will apply the technolgy to every household so that most solar power shining on the earth can be converted .
Lowering the cost of the application is also very important , otherwise nobody will be  willing to adopt this technology .
In conclusion , to maintain the sustainable development of our society , we should give priority to the current human need to develop more energy from various  of human society .
Among the diverse energy sources , solar power has the brightest prospect for its non-pollution , safety and infinitude .
Hence , it is really worthwhile to develop solar power to make our society development sustainable .
Moreover , during the development of solar power technology , we should try to increase the efficiency of the power convertion and lower the price of the products .
From a luxurious entertaining appliance in the early stage of development , television has become an indispensable and ubiquitous thing within every household nowadays .
With millions of viewers around the world , it is used for various purposes not only by broadcasters and institutions but also businesses .
Television had to go through a very long way of development with reciprocal influences on society .
Advertising has become the most effective way of promoting sales of products .
The use of them is the most influential factor contributing to the development of television .
The cost of a television commercial depends upon the popularity of the channel and the time when it is broadcast .
These costs are the financial backing of broadcasters' programming .
Another way is to weave advertisements into shows .
This practice has begun in film .
For instance , a character may be driving a particular type of automobile , wearing a certain kind of clothes , or eating at a particular restaurant chain .
A brand or trademark is sometimes used .
I strongly believe that the benefits television brings to our society are undeniable .
Meyrowitz , a professor of communications at the department of Communication at the University of New Hampshire in Durham , deduced that television is the "secret-exposing machine" , and it opens up the "biggest secret of all , 'the secret of secrecy'" to children .
It is even claimed that television has replaced printing to become the main way to access information .
Researchers suggest that children who were exposed to educational programs , positive models preferred reading books , were more artistic and got higher grades .
Nowadays virtually all the broadcasters have at least an educational program of  their own .
That's because of the high demand from parents , institutions and educationists .
However , television also has more negative influences on our society than  positive ones .
A lot of findings showed that people tend to imitate the language and behavior which are inappropriate in society .
Children addicted to television are associated with obesity , passiveness , health problems and sometimes bad grades .
Inappropriate contents are deemed as another type of danger to the youth .
Violence , sex , drugs abuse , nonsense comics , etc .
cause a lot of controversies over the right age of watching them; and the youth are subject to parental television control , especially when it influences their self-esteem and body image .
With concerned parents , a child can greatly benefit from television programsprograms , whereas the child may encounter inappropriate contents if the parents let him or her freely use television .
Adults who spend too much time on TV viewing seem to be  dissatisfied people because they try to look for happiness in those programs after a hard struggling day .
However it is usually short lived happiness .
In addition to this , broadcasters often have some shows and programs addressing women in the new century .
Television played a vital role in the feminist movement .
It is disputable whether television has been changing the norms of society .
In conclusion , television has obviously contributed a lot to determine and shape our society , owing to the strong links between its development history and the human's  .
That is the reason why we always have to improve it , to nurture it .
We have to balance the pros and cons as well as the relationship of television to our present and future generations .
In the 21st century when people around the world get more opportunities to interact with each other , the ability to speak and understand other languages has become more and more important .
Most people choose to hire a translator .
However ,  well-trained ones are hard to find and they are not always available at times when you need them immediately .
Moreover , some people feel that their privacy is not safeguarded with a translator involved .
Thus , we have initiated this product called "N-in-1 Auto- translator" which can help solve all those problems mentioned above .
In the following paragraphs , the design process of our product will be illustrated to show how we fulfill people's need to communicate with others speaking different languages .
First of all , in the engineering process of this Auto-translator , we will keep modifying and upgrading until it fully serves its purposes .
According to Khandani , in the final testing and implementing process , we will make sure that it can translate exactly and clearly right on the spot .
For the after-sale services , we would establish an official website for the customers to acquire necessary information and post their feedback For instance , we will upload different language packages online so that customers speaking specific languages can install the software in their Auto-translators and make use of them .
Though we cannot have all languages , we have the ones that the majority is requesting .
We will keep upgrading and modifying our software until our customers are satisfied .
Having talked about the modifications , we have made efforts to minimize the cost , change the charging method and improve the portability .
As a brand new product which people do not have much faith in , it has been made reasonably affordable .
As batteries are not environmental friendly , we have made use of the DC chargers instead .
This is very convenient for the customers and they do not have to change batteries all the time as the lifetime of the chargeable battery is purposely made longer .
In addition , we have made the device more portable by minimizing the size and weight .
For example , our device has many components consisting of a scanner ,  speaker ,  printer and  recorder .
This allows our product to be multi-functional in contrast with an electronic dictionary which has many limitations .
Customers do not have to bring them all .
Instead , they can just selectively plug-in any component they need in order to make it much more portable .
From this example , we can see that we engineers always think from the customer's  point of view and try our best to fulfill their needs .
Moreover , we should also take care of the interests of small groups of people .
Our target customers are businessman , travelers , international school teachers and students and other people who have needs to understand other languages .
However , after reviewing all the feedback feedback on our official website , we found that the blind also need it .
After numerous research , we found that they recognize things by touching , smelling and hearing .
Thus we made modifications on our device such as the Braille-mini- printer .
This mini-printer can print in Braille so that they can understand by touching the paper after they scan the documents in other languages .
We can see that just a little change can benefit a large number of people .
To sum-up all the points mentioned above , we would conclude that engineering design processes can meet people's needs by qualified products and services , continuous modifications and the attitude to think for customers .
There is an old saying which goes "The customerr is  god ."
We totally agree with it .
We engineers must always keep ourselves upgraded and think for the customers all the time so that we can make upgrades and modifications to meet their needs .
While one is looking for A , he may discover B accidentally along the way , and this process is called the serendipitous discovery .
It is very different from the normal technologies we have , which  resulted from developments aiming to solve specific questions .
They are also different from each other in terms of level of success and how well they  solve a problem .
Nonetheless , despite so many differences , they are also similar in  that they are both important and can only be discovered by prepared minds .
One obvious difference is how each technology is discovered .
normal technology is found and developed by following certain procedures .
For example , a problem or need is always first identified , and then people start to brainstorm and think of solutions to the problem .
They always have a clear purpose or goal in mind which leads them in a certain direction to resolve the puzzle .
However , for technologies found through serendipitous discovery , they show complete randomness .
They are absolutely unexpected .
While one is solving some physics question , he may derive a solution for a biological problem in an approach which no one has thought of before .
There is nothing like a plan or preparation for this .
Hence , the two technologies differ from each other greatly in the ways  they are discovered .
Another difference between them may be the desirability .
Most of the time , serendipitously discovered technologies gain more recognition and greater success in terms of economic or scientific aspects , compared to the average normally developed technologies .
This is just like what Lawren Block said , the thing one found while looking for something else , usually suited his needs more .
The reason behind this is that serendipitous discoveries cater to solve the problems in more ingenious ways , as they may be the result of some unknown happenings , and they are produced by following some rules of  nature we have yet to gain an understanding of  , which are mysterious but also powerful .
A simple example would be the success of Dichloro- diphenyl-trichloroethane(DDT) , compared to other insecticides .
Nonetheless , apart from the differences , there are also similarities between these two kinds of technologies .
One major similarity they share is that both can only be discovered by prepared personnel .
As  Louis Pasteur  said , in the arena of observation , opportunities favor only the prepared minds .
This is indeed very true .
When people see some new products or discoveries , especially those close to our daily lives , sometimes they cannot help but ask themselves why , when they  experienced some similar things , they failed to turn them into innovations or products .
In our daily lives , it is true that we may experience this or that kind of things , but it is only those careful ones , prepared ones , those who always pay more attention to tiny things happening around them and treat these things seriously , come up with ingenious discoveries .
One needs to be prepared to identify a potential serendipitous discovery , as well as to develop a normal technology , so that one does not miss out any important details and gains success in the end .
All in all , technologies discovered through conventional means and those discovered by chance are quite different in the aspects of how they are discovered and the general impacts they have .
However , they also share some similarities like they can only be found by prepared individuals .
In the end , though they may be so different , it is quite obvious that they are equally important and necessary for our lives and even the progress of mankind .
Thus , we should always be on the lookout , and think more about things around us .
Always be prepared .
Engineering is a field of specialization where new products are being invented or where old products are being upgraded or modified .
However , it is always a tough path to undertake as there will be problems arising during the design process .
The main processes during an innovation's design involves identifying the problem , researching  new methodology , developing  the new or upgraded product and finally  promoting  sales of the product .
In fact , problems often occur during the two most critical parts of the designing process which lie during the research and development sections .
In Singapore , innovations and inventions due to engineering are still currently in the early stages .
The main involvement in the designing process for innovations includes modifying and upgrading  existing products .
The improvement of the reverse osmosis process that created NeWater and the development of the 'eco-friendly' vehicles are  examples These ideas and products came from other countries and Singapore merely took the products and took it to suit her own needs .
For  instance , the weapons and equipment used by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) originated from countries like Germany and the United Kingdom .
The possible reasons that Singapore lacked the initiative to come out with a brand new product could lie in the lack of resources support and the general mindset of Singaporeans .
Firstly , the lack of resources support could significantly hamper the research and development process in engineering design for innovations .
Singapore is a small country in terms of resources and technology capabilities .
As a result , during the research stage of an engineering process , a lack of materials and funding could cause the designing process to fall through .
Funding and materials are crucial during an engineering design process as trials and equipment are required to gauge and judge the progress  and outcome of a development .
Often , some engineering processes lie within a thin line away from some juristic rules .
These rules and regulations are especially strict in Singapore .
As a result engineering is often  restricted by these limitations which could hamper some bold yet useful innovation ideas .
For example , although Singapore is ranked among the first few countries in development of products in Asia , nevertheless engineers in Singapore have to regularly keep track of the new technologies by discussing with their counterpart from leading countries like Japan and the United States of America .
The lack of knowledge prevents engineers in Singapore from coming out with brand new ideas for innovations .
The other problem faced by Singapore is the lack of courage for Singapore engineers to come out with a creative and new innovation .
This problem can be attributed to the upbringing of Singaporean kids .
Children in Singapore are brought up in a very 'safe' and stable environment where everything is provided for .
Instructions on every single detail are given .
As a result , Singapore kids are deprived of the chance to think independently .
As they are brought up in such an environment , they naturally will develop a mindset that it is better to follow rules as it will be much more stable and fool-proof rather than trying to think out of the box and create or do something bold .
This is an underlying problem as these kids who will grow up to be engineers will not be able to come up with exciting innovations .
In conclusion , these two main problems basically hamper the research and development areas of engineering design process , Singapore engineers can only at the moment upgrade or modifies existing innovations .
Thus they are the reasons why local Singaporean engineers have failed to come out with a stunning innovation yet .
A serendipity find is defined as accidently and unexpectedly discovering something fortunate .
One technology that was discovered by serendipity is the sound-powered telephone .
Unlike  a serendipity invention , a product or system that is created or developed , not coming from accidents , but through a series of engineering design processes is a research invention , and a technology developed via research is the mobile phone .
Firstly , compare the usages for both the sound-powered telephone and the mobile phone .They are similar in  that both are used for communication .
However , the ways they are  used are different .
The sound-powered telephone is now widely used in naval vessels , and also in emergency communication systems for high-rise buildings , airports and ski lifts etc , whereas a mobile phone is designed for calling contacts .
Unlike  a sound-powered telephone , extra functions are included in a mobile phone , such as games , music and a camera for use .
Secondly , the sound-powered telephone differs from the mobile phone in power supplies  needed The speaker's voice , through its microphone unit , supplies necessary power for operating the sound-powered telephone .
Batteries or power connections are not required .The circuit is always live , thus a user simply begins speaking rather than dialing another station .
On the contrary , the mobile phone cannot operate without the use of an external power .
Normally a battery must be included and charged , so that the mobile phone can be switched on .
Thirdly , in terms of communication efficiency after the connection is established , the mobile phone provides better efficiency than the sound- powered telephone .
on a sound powered phone system , only one person can speak at a time or the signal will become hopelessly garbled .
However , a mobile phone's system allows both sides to input analog signals into the circuits at the same time .
Lastly , for engineers , designing a safe product is a big concern .
The mobile phone emits electromagnetic radiation , which may harm one's health if used  for long period of time .
However , the sound-powered telephone does not pose any health risks to human beings due to its relatively simpler circuits compared to the mobile phone .
In conclusion , both technologies are electronic devices .
Their main function is the same , that is , to provide people a way to communicate .
Although the sound-powered telephone is less efficient than the mobile phone after the connection is established , it functions as an emergency communication device more often than the mobile phone because it does not require an power source in order to operate it .
The mobile phone has more sophisticated structures and theories than the sound-powered telephone .
Hence , the mobile phone emits harmful radiation to users .
In any case , both technologies have greatly improved the convenience in communication  in our life .
For the past few centuries , engineers and scientists have been working together , resulting in numerous great discoveries and inventions benefiting mankind in various aspects .
However , as science and technology evolved , they  also brought  numerous problems .
In this essay , I will be focusing on the environmental issues that were brought about by the improvement of science and technology and how engineering design processes can meet the need
From the late 19th to early 20th century , there was an outburst of great discoveries and inventions , coupled with worldwide expansion of industrialisation , creating many machines to aid human needs , and wants .
The sudden out-break of these events  caused several negative impacts on Earth .
One of the most prominent examples is global warming , a result of the existence of greenhouse gases .
Global warming causes an increase in the average temperature of Earth , which results in major problems such as melting ice caps at both poles , rising sea levels , heat waves and depleting ozone layer .
During the golden period of invention of machinery and industrialisation , machines running primarily on fossil fuels emitted large quantity of greenhouse gases during incomplete combustion of fuels .
These harmful gases have resulted in the vast pollution of the globe .
And , the situation continues to worsen .
It was not until the late 20th century that the environmentalists discovered that the greenhouse gases were harmful and had resulted in adverse conditions on Earth and started countering the pollution .
The Kyoto Protocol , a treaty signed among the countries to lower the emission of greenhouse gases to the environment which started in the 1990's , was quite a success .
However , even though there was a decrease in the percentage of the greenhouse gases emitted worldwide , the greenhouse gases still exist in our atmosphere , depleting our ozone layer .
Engineers , on the other hand , invented a product called the catalytic converter that helps to convert the harmful gases to gases that are less harmful to our environment before releasing them out to the environment .
This was a better solution to the problem .
Currently , as engineers , we should work on an advanced model of the catalytic converter , with a higher efficiency and better compatibility with different models of engines which may emit harmful gases .
Even though the process might be time-consuming and expensive , the improved version of the converter will be very useful to us .
Alternatively , we can look into the possible problems that might arise before the release of the product .
During the brainstorming stage , engineers should look at the product from various angles; the possibilities of doing harm to the environment while creating and testing the productproduct; the ways to dispose of any toxic or radioactive wastes , and the possibility of exploitation 
In conclusion , engineering design processes can meet the need of solving global warming by the improvement of catalytic converters and execution of cautious planning before any other procedures .
Prevention is always better than cure .
Safety is a primary need for all inventions even to this date .
However , safety has been overlooked or neglected on many occasions and this has  harm to its users .
One example would be the injuries caused by can openers .
In order to overcome such injuries and keep users out of harm's way , we need a logical design process to design a can opener of high safety standards .
According to Khandani (2005) 'Engineering design process' is a sequence of steps to design a product in a systematic order .
The five main steps are to define the problem , gather information , generate multiple solutions and analyze and select a solution and finally it .
To help achieve the objective of designing a safe can opener , engineering design process can be used to analyse the problems of existing can openers , and discover areas of improvement .
Existing can openers include lever type can opener , rotating wheel can opener and butterfly opener .
After analysing alternative solutions , the most suitable product has to be chosen .
Design process uses the decision process to select the best solution .
Firstly , the desirable attributes such as safety , function ability , marketability and ergonomics are ranked in order of importance .
Followed by this , a value factor is assigned to each attribute .
For instance , in this case , the success of safety is twice as important as the success of market analysis , a value factor of 20 will be given to safety and 10 to market analysis .
Value factors are assigned on a of 0 to 100 relative to the importance of other criteria for success .
Next , a rating factor is assigned to each new solution .
This will indicate how well the proposed product satisfies the particular criteria .
For example , if a product satisfies the criteria of safety to the maximum it will be given a rating factor of ten and if it satisfies the criteria of marketing by only half , it is given a rating of 5 .
Substantial knowledge of the product and its users will allow engineers to make an accurate evaluation which involves rating safety factors and value factors .
The final stage in design process is to implement the solution .
This would include prototyping , concurrent engineering , documenting and applying for patents .
These procedures would have already been done by existing products .
The new product for opening cans will have these four processes before it is introduced to the market .
One such product currently in the market which is safe for opening cans , handy , environmentally friendly and ergonomically stable is the one touch can opener .
It leaves the lid of opened cans without any sharp edges .
It is battery operated and uses a magnet to attach on to the lid  while cutting the edges away using an ultra fine blade .
Unfortunately , it is not very affordable and hence not marketable enough .
Future inventions would have to give more importance to the marketing aspect of it .
It can be seen that the design process is tedious , time consuming and sometimes even never ending .
No effort will be futile if executed in the right direction .
Design process suggests a safe path for engineers to take to achieve success .
The never ending need for safety to humans is an obligation for engineers of tomorrow to fulfill .
Increased confidence in consumers is seen whenever safety is enhanced for products .
In the case of can openers , making opening of cans hazard free will be able to draw a large consumer audience .
Constantly placing an emphasis on safety will serve as a reminder for all other manufacturers to meet and will in turn benefit mankind as whole .
The first stage of designing a product would be to define the problem using three key points .
They are to identify and establish a need , develop a problem statement and establish criteria for success .
The first two points have already been looked into by previous manufacturers .
However , the criteria of success has to be relooked at for a safer product .
A new can opener has to be safe , light , environmentally friendly and cheap .
After defining the problem , the data relevant to the need , safety in this case , has to be gathered .
statistical research to find out how many are affected , on which part of the user the injuries occur , when do injuries normally occur and who are the affected has to be done to get a better idea of the situation .
Besides that , material research has to be done to understand to what extent can the material harm the user and what alternative materials are .
For example ,  the lever type can opener is made of cast iron , which makes it bulky for users who end up injuring themselves in an effort to use it .
In addition , interviews on affected users can be done to understand how the injuries occur .
Manufacturers should also be interviewed to explain their reasons for overlooking the safety aspect if they had done it knowingly .
Once all the information has been collated , the third stage of design process would be to generate multiple solutions .
Multiple solutions can be from the users as well as manufacturers .
In design process , existing ideas are torn apart to find the fault in them .
For instance , in the lever type , its unprotected knife-like sickle is too dangerous for domestic use .
As for the rotating wheel , the necessity to pierce the can first is a nuisance for users and the butterfly opener produces sharp edges on the lid .
Thereafter , new ideas , tools and methods are combined to propose a new solution .
Such synthesis will seek to improve the weakness of previous solutions .
After  brainstorming and gathering ideas , the fourth and most crucial step of design process would be to analyse and select a solution .
The evaluation of proposed designs would be an overlap of the suggestion given by users and manufacturers and the information gathered .
Four main analyses are used for  designing  a safer product .
They are functional analysis , ergonomics , safety analysis and market analysis .
The third analysis , safety analysis , would determine which product has a leading edge over the other products .
The human need of safety is still not addressed in many can openers .
The lever type opener has a sharp edge which exposes the user to potential hazard and the other two openers leave sharp edges on the lids of cans which are threat to safety .
The new product has be devoid of sharp parts as well as be able to not leave any sharp edges on the lid .
In design process , engineers have to keep records of calculations and methods used and foresee other ways people could use the product .
As a result , safety considerations must be included in the manual of the new product .
Description of inherent dangers should also be displayed on warning labels .
To make profits , market analysis has to be done .
Just like the existing openers , future products have to be evaluated against criteria such as sales features , cost of manufacturing and advertising .
Failure to do this will results in unpopular products like the wall-mounted electric model mentioned earlier .
When you go shopping , do you usually see the same kind of products which almost have the same functions or even same appearances ?
According to the research done by U .S . Customs and Border Protection , in 2004 the total amount of illegally copied products is 1 .39 million and 63% of products come from China .
In China now , a huge amount of products do not contain any innovative elements and the manufacturing companies just copy the existing patterns .
As these companies manufacture products which  copy the basic design from others , the product design process is no longer present for innovations .
There must be some reason .
Obviously , copying ideas and reducing manufacturing cost should hamper the innovative design process .
Some companies in China usually copy basic ideas from others and make use of them for themselves .
In recent years , lots of small companies have appeared in southern China .
These companies found their own brands and manufacture all kinds of products such as IT products .
However , all these companies do not do innovation design .
They imitate world -famous companies .
For example , some cellphone companies in GuangDong province imitate famous mobile phone such as Nokia and Apple .
In 2008 , the production of this kind of phones was more than 80 million in China .
These phones have the exact  appearance designs as big names .
Even Even if you look at them for the first time you cannot identify which are produced by NOKIA and which are copied .
The negative consequences are obvious .
Because of copying basic ideas from others , the first stage for design is no longer for innovations .
Secondly , reducing manufacturing cost hampers the innovative design process as well .
In order to reduce input and gain more benefits , some companies pay very little attention to design process because that design process always costs lots of money .
Therefore , they have to simplify their products or just copy them from others .
Even though there is an innovation idea , designers will not consider it .
As a result , design process just follows the previous pattern and no innovation is created during the design process stage .
As mentioned above , innovation design process will be hampered if companies copy ideas from others to reduce manufacturing costs In some sense , innovation helps humankind to move forward .
It is so important that innovation design should be present anywhere .
In today's global competitive market , a product's functionality is not the only thing customers are looking out for .
Products must not only serve their functions but must look good on the surface .
No doubt there are products with solely excellent functions out on the market .
These products are appreciated by few .
It does not take long for one to realize that products must have their own unique design in order to be relevant in the market .
According to Khandani (2005) , the purpose of designing is to generate profits .
Afterall , who will want to waste their efforts on something that does not reap benefits ?
This is one of the reasons why engineering design process is not all that easy in Singapore .
With only a population of 4 million , Singapore has a relatively small market .
The remuneration is simply not enough to lure players into the market to produce and design their products .
Engineers will often find themselves limited by the consumers' needs .
In addition , engineering design process in Singapore is often faced with Singaporeans' preferences for foreign goods .
Firstly , foreign goods are often established brands which appeal to the local market .
Secondly , certain goods , especially technological products , are much cheaper when imported from overseas .
In recent years , with the explosive number of online shops emerging and the increasing popularity of B2C (business-to-consumer) websites such as Amazon .com , it is not difficult to purchase foreign goods .
This has resulted in the low demand for locally designed products and often discourages engineers to continue in their innovations .
Before the product is implemented , it is important that the product is  tested first .
Singapore , a small country has only 650 square kilometers of land area .
Much of the landscape is covered by skyscrapers and public housings .
The lacks of land area to build suitable facilities to test products is an obstruction to engineers .
Since 2004 , the National University of Singapore's (NUS) , School of Engineering's Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) has been building racing cars and representing Singapore in competitions against other universities from other countries .
Associate Professor Seah Kar Heng commented that one of the difficulties faced by the team is the lack of a suitable venue to test drive the cars .
Beside the lack of facilities , engineers are constrained by the strict regulations imposed by the Governement .
The team from FSAE could only test- drive their cars within NUS' compounds and in the United States where competitions were held .
Currently , there are only laws governing the use of conventional cars on public roads .
The team from FASE will have to seek approval from different agencies which is often very time-consuming .
In conclusion , Engineering Process Design is a comprehensive guide for engineers who have no idea about how to go about designing a new product .
However , in Singapore , engineers will find that they will meet  some problems that may hamper the design process .
Due to the small market in Singapore and Singaporeans' preference for foreign goods , many may give up their innovations eventually .
For those who successfully designed their products , they are met with another problem-- the lack of facilities to test their products and the inflexibility of the Government's regulations .
Engineering design process is a tedious one and by analysing the problems that hamper it , one may be able to make the process a smoother one .
Firstly , scientists and engineers have been focusing using wind and solar power for decades of years .
Many solutions have been tested and implementline .
However ,well known examples may be the solar water heater and wind power electrical generator .
These two inventions can not only meet our daily needs , but also protect the environput anotherave the existing resources like coal and petroleum .
To put it more specifically , solar water heater can take place of other is a sourceeaters basedfor coal gas .
So besides the reasons above , it is also very cheap to use these renewable resources so users can get a lot of economical benefits from that .
Secondly , some of the technologies are stillfocusing on using .
Engineers are trying to generatee solutions to some problems .
And these problems are mainly caused by restriction and immature technology of wind and spoweredpower .
For example , scientists and engineers have found that the wind speed and hours of sunshine are not steady so that the generating energy is also not very steady .
These two resources are restrithe solarby the geographical posthe place and climate .
Besides , the efficirun ononverting wSo ,d power is very low .
So the focus of engineers is to design and test new technology .
For instance , car is one of the most important transportations in the world; however , new research has proved that the existing extra petroleum can only be used for another eighty to ninety years .
Engineers are trying to solve the problem that what we shall use after the petroleum run out .
Thus a new kind of solar-powered car has been invented .
But even engineers have reached certain success; the solar-powered car they can produce is still far from the standard of civil transports .
So engineers still have a long way to go to test and find solutions to make better use of wind and solar energy .

They have the plan to build a power house in the air space because it is easier to get more solar energy and convert them in to electricity in a better efficiency .
They are still gathering the pertinent information .
With their great efforts I will not be surprised to see a total different world in the future .

"The world is coming to an end in the 2100s (22th century) !"
Is this statement a false prophesy or a reality that has yet to come true ?
Natural resources around the world are being depleted at an alarming rate which has led to numerous debates and interventions by environmentalists , in a bid to reduce the amount of resources extracted and employed by mankind .
However , not all readily available natural resources can be used directly from their raw form .
One such example is the purification of water to make it potable .
Water is an essential part of human life .
Everyone needs it for survival and also for many other applications such as industrial usage .
Even though water is readily available , however , the process of purification to make it portable is tedious , technologically intensive and most importantly , expensive .
According to statistical figures from a United Nations Organisation (UNO) publication , the global population consumes approximately 3000 cubic metres of water daily .
As a result , there is an increasing need for newer , greener and more cost-effective purification methods so as to provide massive amounts of clean and affordable drinking water for all parts of the world , especially in less-developed countries .
Hence , the ever-increasing need for cheap portable water should be given high priority in global research and development initiatives .
The following case study illustrates the importance of modern technology and engineering design in water purification process , especially in countries that do not have self-sustainable water supplies .
Engineering design and modern technology assists these countries by first identifying the specific problem and in the process of doing so , possible solutions will be generated .
The final stage of the design process involves the testing and implementation of a particular chosen solution .
For example in Singapore , the government recognised that she has to be more self-reliant and self-dependent on her water supplies so as to mitigate any difficulties faced in times of contingency and emergency .
In addition , being a small 'island' country surrounded by close neighbours , the idea of desalination of sea-water to meet her water demands is not a viable long-term option .
As a result , NEWater , a sewage treatment plant , was set up a few years back to look into the possibility of converting 'used' or sewage water into clean drinking water via reverse osmosis technology .
As such , large emphasis and investments have been invested into this initiative since then .
Through the application of the engineering design framework and modern technology , purifying sewage water seems to be highly viable and successful .
According to statistics from the Public Utilities Board (PUB) , NEWater will meet 30% of Singapore's current water needs by 2010 .
This example shows that through the proper implementation of engineering design framework and application of modern technology , the current human need for securing clean and cheap drinking water can be achieved with a high degree of success .
In conclusion , engineering design process and modern technology will no doubt aid in solving and realising various human needs such as that of water purification .
However , prudent and appropriate usage of the world's natural resources still has to be practised religiously and conscientiously as engineering solutions do not guarantee complete success in any application .
As a result , both human and technology have an important role to play in the quest of satisfying human needs .
According to E .M . Rogers , writer of "Diffusion of innovations" , in general , there are six stages of innovation-development process .
They are awareness of the needs or problems , basic and applied research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and finally consequences (Rogers 2003) .
During the process , there are many factors that would affect the outcome of the development project .
Some of them are determined by the technology perspective or social factors , whereas some include government involvement .
One important technology that Rogers mentioned is the innovation of the refrigerator in 1930 for electric and gas refrigerators .
When people did a comparison on both types , the latter has a better advantage over the first .and they were expecting  the gas refrigerator .
But it did not capture  the consumer market .
The main reason for this was because of the investment , consideration and decision made by the corporations involved in this project .
They believed that they would make more profits from electric refrigerators and thus marketed it to the public .
As a result , it turned out that technology in electric refrigerator was available to the consumer instead of the consumer's choice .
Another example of a social problem leading to government and scientist involvement is the safety issue with automobiles in the United States .
In 1960 , the annual fatality due to vehicles reached 50 ,000 and drew the government's attention to the safety ie on the transport system .
A survey was conducted between the specialized researchers' and public's view of the traffic safety problem .
It was found  that the research team didn't agree with the public view and claimed that it was an individual-blame perspective .
As a conclusion from conducting researchers , professors , government officials and insurance company executives , the research on safety measure became due to system-blame perspective and thus engineers redesigned auto vehicles and restructured highways .
As a consequence ofboth the above cases , , the technology did not become the way the consumers expected and the solution for solving social problems was redirected .
It did not follow the stages mentioned above for the successful completion of the process .
Most of them  varied along the process due to several factors and thus led to a different type of innovation .
From my point of view , no matter what the sequence of innovation-development process , as long as there is a new invention , it was invented to benefit all  mankind .
Technology has improved so rapidly in the past century that men have tread into outer space andharvested enormous amounts of energy from minute quantities of nuclear material .
Yet there still exists the problem of food shortage .
This problem is very serious in many Third World countries in Africa as well as Asia .
For example , in countries like Sierra Leone and East Timor , one person and one child die every five seconds due to starvation .
With such worrying statistics , food shortage is definitely a problem which should be addressed as soon as possible .
However , as food has to be consumed by the human body , there are very strict restrictions and quality control on food or animals that undergo genetic modification .
As such , with many factors to consider , the process of modifying the genes is not easy .
Engineering design processes are able to meet the challenges of this job .
A part of engineering design processes is to constantly generate new ideas to improve on current ones .
Like what Seyyed Khandani said , "You start with existing solutions to the problem and then tear them apart-find out what is wrong with those solutions and focus on how to improve their weaknesses" (2005 ,p11) By constantly improving on the process ,  gene modificationmodification  can be improved to the extent of meeting the strict requirements for human consumption .
Engineering design processes also involves branching into different areas of study and combining existing technology to create new ones .
In fact , Food Science and Bio-Engineering was developed by combining ideas from the science and engineering sectors .
Seyyed Khandani mentioned  a process called synthesis , which is to integrate ideas , equipment and processes to create new solutions (2005 , p11) The benefits of new technology to increase food production through genetic modification are endless .
New technology could increase the variety of food capable of being genetically modified , replace existing gene modification methods with cheaper alternatives and even allow vast improvements on food yield from current processes .
In spite of the increase of research and development in recent years ,  a significant amount of discoveries and innovation are still being made by people outside of laboratories .
These kind of unconventional environments are commonly referred to as skunkworks environment .
However , we would define it more broadly to include all research done without  external aid .
Though the environments are very different , there are also many similarities between them .
Conventionally generated technologies are conservative while innovations created in a skunkworks environment are revolutionary .
As mentioned by E .M . Rogers in his article The Birth of the Laptop Computer at Toshiba , Tetsuya Mizoguchi  ,who came up with the idea of developing a mobile computer , had to go "underground" after his proposal was rejected by his superiors .
As his idea was unconventional , his company did not want to allocate resources to this unknown territory .
In order to continue his research , he secretly used money from his company and transferred engineers from other projects to carry out his research .
After 2 years of research , they created their first prototype that progressed to change how computers around the world were used Indeed , the huge impact brought about by Mizoguchi is shown by IDC's forecast that laptops would represent 66 percent of corporate purchases , with 71 percent of consumers opting for a notebook instead of a tower by 2011 .

In contrast , conventionally generated technology such as NEWATER progressed much slowly .
The research on NEWATER started in 1998 as a joint initiative between the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) .
(http://www .pub .gov .sg/NEWater) Its aim was to find a way to provide a sustainable means of providing water for industrial use and consumption for places where water is scarce .
This research took very long to carry out and commercialise as it has to go through a long corporate structure for approval .
Also , care was taken to ensure all the  water treatment procedures were widely acceptable .
Although it has resulted in a resounding success , the technology has not been widely implemented due to patents of the technology being filed by the parent companies .
On the other hand , neither conventionally generated technologies nor discoveries made in skunkworks have an absolute success rate .
For example , the engineers of General Motor's (GM) R&D unit in Detroit were able to create aesthetically pleasing and highly efficient automobiles that ran entirely on battery power (Rogers 2003) .
However , limitations of the technology and failures of publicity resulted in a weak adoption of the new technology .
Similarly , bio fuel studies made  independently by many researchers found that it could be used to replace fossil fuels .
One of the techniques involved in developing fast-growing trees that can grow to full size in just 10 years to generate the bio fuel .
({http://biofuelguide .net/}[HYPERLINK: http://biofuelguide .net/]) Similarly , lack of publicity and technological constrains prevented it from becoming a popular technology .
In conclusion , in spite of the various inherent differences of conventionally generated technologies and innovations from skunkworks ,  revolutionary or conservative , both share various similarities such as providing possible but not definite solutions to our problems .
It is by complementing each research's advantages that we may be able to discover ways to solve future problems .
The Innovation-Development Process , as defined by E .M . Rogers , essentially 'consist of all the decision , activities and their impacts that occur from recognition of a need or a problem through research , development and commercialization of an innovation' (Rogers , 2003) This process is further broken down into 2 perspectives , technologically or socially determined .
One good example of a social construction of technology would be the video call function of a phone .
AT&T picture phone in the late 1960s was invented and marketed as an additional function on top of voice call capabilities of a telephone .
It allowed user to 'see' each other as they talked .
This innovation was not one that had been thoroughly surveyed before the Research began , and users' feedback was that it was bulky , controls too unfriendly and picture too small ({http://www .corp .att .com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/70picture .html}[HYPERLINK: http://www .corp .att .com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/70picture .html]) .
The society could not accept the new product of the market due to several socio-economical and governmental factors .
Firstly , the picture phone aimed to allow both users on the phone to feel closer to one another , as they could now see each other over the phone .
However , it was this very concept which backfired , as users of the phone felt privacy intrusion to their way of life .
The concept was not easily accepted by the more conservative society back in 1960s and hence it failed its primary purpose .
Secondly , it was not economical to own such a phone , as data transmission was not as developed as it is today .
It was far more expensive to own and upkeep such a phone , and even with the monetary ability to own such a machine , technology at that time did not allow for a smooth transmission of data to the phone , as pictures were transmitted once every 2 seconds .
This generally played a part in the decline in product demand in the market and hence less consumers were willing to fork out the money for the phone .
Thirdly , the governmental priorities were not on the development of Information Technology (I .T .)
in the 1960s , when the majority of the world's super powers were still in the production and manufacturing industry .
This resulted in little government funding during that era and thus little improvement in the I .T .
front .
It was not until the 1990s that governments across the world poured in vast amounts of resources into researching faster and better broadband networks .
This in turn saw the sharpest rise in broadband speed and decline in cost of becoming a broadband user .
In a broad sense , the shift of governmental focus  allowed for the booming of video calls function as it is now much affordable .
In conclusion , the world today is better equipped with the relevant infrastructure and network to facilitate the use of such a device , a 'picture phone' .
This spin off effect from such development has proved to us that social determinants have definitely been playing a huge role in moulding the development of our technology .
In modern society , what we can see and hear surrounding us is always about technology and science .
Humankind has been inventing more effective and useful equipment by applying advanced techniques .
For example , since the first airplane successfully flew in the sky , people have been master of the theory of flight which makes the dream that people can fly come true .
Then , in the following years , many better planes were produced to satisfy peoples' requirements .
According to Rogers(2003) , technology is defined as a design for an instrumental action that reduces uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships with achieving an advantage or useful result .
In fact , the majority of these technological innovations cannot be reliable without human creativity and research .
However , some technologies were invented serendipitously .
Generally speaking , intended research to pursue development is similar to serendipitous discovery in terms of the aim and contribution to  human society .
The main difference between the two kinds of invention is the process and the effort .
First of all , the aim  technology which was developed with research is to explore some useful things and attempt to reach the unknown scientific area in order to solve the problems in the real world .
For example , people have spent a great amount of money to reach Mars to explore the mysterious outer space even though the probability of  helping make improvements for the Earth is low .
However , this is doing research for improving human's standard of living and making life more convenient and comfortable .
Similarly ,  serendipity is the effect by which one accidentally discovers something fortunate , especially while looking for something entirely different .
Hence , the result of serendipitous discovery also helps explore  unknown things and places .
In addition , both of technology that was discovered by research and serendipitous discovery contribute to the human society .
However , in terms of process and effort , the research to develop new technology is different from the serendipitous discovery .
Specifically , the majority of technological innovations are developed by scientific research  based on knowledge , research and application in practice .
Achievement requires a lot of work and thus  would take a long time .
Even so the result is still unpredictable .
In contrast , serendipitous discovery seems very fortunate because people receive unexpected things which are always beneficial for human society .
For example , Sir Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic penicillin when he was doing research on  biological materials  .
Similarly , DDT was  discovered by accident in the 1930s , when a Swiss chemist , Paul Muller , was trying to find a way to protect woollen clothes against moths .
Hence , serendipitous discovery is more convenient and fortunate but it is much more difficult than doing research to develop innovations .
In conclusion , people always try their best to make inventions to solve problems encountered in real world .
Continually doing research on different scientific areas is one main aspect to discover what humankind desires .
However , it is true that people sometimes find new things or make inventions unexpectedly , which is considered as serendipitous discovery .
Both fulfill useful functions in human society .
For instance , DDT was widely used as a mosquito killer during World War II .
Truly speaking , people may prefer  serendipitous discovery for its convenience  , though it is more difficult to achieve .
Innovations are made every single day and we keep progressing .
But the most interesting part of innovation of technologies often turns out to be the set of events/situations which leads to the innovation .
Innovations may be planned to meet a purpose or to complete an objective .
These are the conventionally planned research based innovations .
Few technologies get innovated serendipitously .
They happen through work of wisdom combined with blind luck .
Comparison and contrast of two technologies innovated in these two different ways gives us many interesting features of innovations to ponder over .
A classical example for a technology invented serendipitously is the discovery of Warfarin , the most effective rat poison in the world In the 1930s , many farmers in the U .S made their cows feed partly on sweet clover hay for it was regarded as vital for sweetening acidic soils and preventing erosion .
In due time , it was found that the cattle herds were dying rapidly .
When the cattle blood was analyzed in the lab , a hemorrhaging agent called Coumarin was isolated .
Further experiments and tests helped the bioscientists to discover the beneficial effects of this agent for surgery and other purposes .
The ultimate result was obtained when renowned professor Link discovered another use of it as a rodenticide .
It proved to be very effective against rats and became a huge success .
The main aim was to find the cause of death of the cows but it ended up resulting in the discovery of an efficient rodenticide(Rogers ,2003) .
The incident which we recall when we think of a research oriented innovation is the issue of automobile safety in the United states .
In this case , the issue gained high priority in  Congress , thanks to the help of Ralph Nader's "Unsafe at Any speeds" .
The policy makers blamed something or the other for the increasing number of accidents and deaths .
The research people tried to refine the system instead .
They formed new public policies and federal law was passed against the issue which forced car manufacturers to build safer cars and highways authorities to ensure safer roads .
In this case the innovation was preplanned .
Every detail of the bill passed was carefully constructed , keeping in mind the status quo(Rogers ,2003) .
When we look at these two technologies which were innovated differently we find that research based innovations are according to the famous proverb "Necessity is the mother of invention" .
The driving force becomes the desperate need for solving a problem .
However in the case of the serendipitous innovations , there is no exact driving force .
Sets of experiments accidentally yield results which prove to be significant .
Who would have thought that an apple would be enough for a man to develop the concept of mechanics and gravitation ?
The technologies innovated in this fashion were never meant to be innovated .
But today , without them , our survival seems questionable .
It is hard to conclude which type of innovation outshines the other .Infact it makes no sense as both are special in their own ways .
But it is important for us to acknowledge these innovations , respect them and strive to do many more things to make life better ! .
Engineers have been designing products or systems to improve our daily lives life .
The process that they used is called the engineering design process .
The process has constantly  developed new technology that helped to solve problems of human like making travel to countries faster and comfortable by planes .
Engineers have been trying to solve a human problem for many years .
That problem is to make drinkable fresh water available to everyone in the third world countries .
The engineering process involves defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting solutions and testing and implementing the solution , as quoted from Kandani (2005) .
First , we will look at how the problem should be defined in the engineering process .
Water covers 71% of the earth's surface and water from the oceans take up 97% of  the total percentage of surface water ( Wikipedia) .
Even though water seems to be everywhere , only a very small percentage of water is drinkable  .
There are also many places in the third world countries where drinkable water is not available due to lack of rainfall and pollution in the water sources .
These places which face water shortage for a long time will face dehydration , diseases due to lack of fresh water and infertile soil for plantation .
Second , in the design process is to gather pertinent information on why the problem still exists as stated by Khandani .
Third world countries' governments know that there is a need to solve the water shortage problem .
However , developing new and clean water technology needs large amounts of money .
This money can be put to better use like getting medication for their people .
Another possible reason for the problem  could be pollution from industries .
Inland water sources are being polluted by factories which dump chemical waste products into the water sources , which make the water source unfit for drinking .
Third , is to generate and select possible solutions in the engineering design process .
Since inland water sources are being polluted and not fit for drinking , oceans , which cover a large area on earth are another possible option .
However , seawater is not drinkable as it contains a very high level of sea salt and impurities .
Therefore , to make seawater into drinkable water , engineers decided to use desalination .
Desalination is a process that collects extracted water from sea salt and impurities through boiling .
The extracted will be furthered purified for usage .
In order to make the extracted water  fit for drinking water standards set by World Health organization (WHO) , engineers will include a process that add nutrients into it .
Another possible solution can be creating more water catchment areas by planting more trees and building reservoirs .
However , this solution can only help to solve the problem in the long run if only the water catchment areas are free from pollution .
The result might not be an immediate effect , as it takes time for natural rainfall to fill up the reservoirs .
As a result , building desalination plants near the sea can help to solve the shortage of water immediately .
Lastly , Engineers can do some testing on desalinating seawater into drinkable water after they have drafted  a cheap and affordable desalination process for the third world countries to purchase .
The results from the testing will be sent to WHO for approval for desalination plant to be built for producing drinkable water in the area .
If the technology is newer than the previous old desalination process , the engineers might be able to get it patented so the price for this new technology will be affordable to everyone .
In conclusion , the engineering design process aids engineers in developing newer technology to help meet the needs or solve the problem of the global population .
This process is applicable to  producing clean water from seawater , which helps solve water shortage problems in certain countries .
The process is able to identify the problem , understand why it is still not solved , produce solutions to it and get it work in an engineering way .
In the context of the innovation development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view , also referred to as the social construction of technology (Rogers , 2003) .
The construction of technology believes that the innovation of technologies is limited and controlled by social factors .
One technology that was socially shaped was the invention of automobile cars .
Automobile vehicles played an important role in this modern world as humans rely heavily on them as a main type of transport for travelling .
This technology is shaped by various groups of engineers according to social constraints .
Firstly , the rise of the automobile industry started as early as the nineteenth century and the First World War acted as a catalyst to speed up the research and development processes of automobile vehicles .
This was so as during the war , there was a rise in demand for automobile vehicles to transport soldiers and supplies to the front line .
It was also used for combat purposes .
Funding and incentives were given to companies to improve automobile technology as whichever countries with the more advanced technologies had a higher chance of winning the war .
As a result , faster , more durable and improved energy efficient vehicles were developed during the war period due to the demands from the military .
Secondly , the development of automobiles vehicles were encouraged and limited by government policies and regulations .
As more roads were constructed over the years globally , it benefited the automobile industries .
Most places are accessible by roads .
This in term boosted the sales of automobiles  .
With the rising sales of cars , consumers had more demands; manufacturers spent more money on research and development so as to give their customers more choices .
Besides constructing roads , governments gave tax rebates to companies that were heavily involved in research and development projects .
Speed limits and safety regulations set by governments are also factors to be considered when designing and developing new technologies .
Automobiles manufacturers took advantage of these situations and limitations to evolve their products technologies to another level .
Finally , all the research and developments of technology depend on economic factors .
This is so that no investor would be willing to fund a project that does not make money .
Hence , when engineers make improvements to enhance the technological aspect of automobile vehicles , they have to consider the interests of the company .
The technical aspects of cars depend heavily on production costs .
If the production cost increases , carmakers would either see a reduction in profit or potential buyers of the product would see an increase in the price .
These two scenarios are not desired and this is the reason that cars are still running on petrol rather than powered by electricity or natural gases despite the fact that they are cleaner energies .
In conclusion , the research and developments of technology depends on social constraints such as economic factors , military demands or government policies .
Hence , technology is actually a product of society and is influenced by the norms and values of the social system .
The greatest priority of companies is to ensure that projects that they are involved in have great profit potential .
The first example is the engineer olaptopsiba who wanted to create a laptop (pp .144- 146 Rogers , (2003)) .
Altthe laptophwas not supportedhe eagerly need of smaller and portable cotime ?r in Japan .
However , at that time , Toshiba'which wererketing situatskunkworks good and the company did not want to risk forwerenew concept of product .
Fortunately , our hero Mizoguchi did not give up .
Otherwise , our laptop may not be as good as now .
Moreover , he diverted funds and found engineers himself to fulfill his idea of creating laptop .
After two years of hard work , they finally worked out their laptop .
However , Toshiba still did not accept the laptop because they did not think it could have good market share .
The good thing is that after all his hard work , he finally proven to Toshiba that his invention very useful and sells very good .
After that , he became one of the chief of Toshiba .
On the other hand , for a conventionally generated technology , like the development of electric cars in California and Arizona , it is regulated by government (Rogers , (2003) pp .
87-89) .
Company had to do research on how to manufacture it and make it be loved by consumers .
Although the whole process of making the car is very tough , the engineers were supported by company , government , and society all the way .
the governmentcompaniesthemthemCompanies(Rogers , 2003 , pp 87-89)waschiefswell .soldwas veryprovedwasAfter briefly know the cases of both situations , differences of them come f( Rogers , 2003 , pp 144-146) that engineers worked in a urgentords eofironment did not have much supportJapan , howver ,r organizations , while conventionally generated technology received a lot of help from society acompany .
The second difference between t cases is that the idea of innovate laptop laptopsme out with the inventothey are now .imself while the electric car issue is a requirement by government .

No matter what difficulty they have faced , they companiesir best to deal with it and finally solve it .
In conclusion , the first differences between a skunk works environmentd a conventionally generated environment are the differences between financial , technology , equipment , resource and people's attitdide towards them .
The second difference the source of the idea .
The similaes are those innovations all promoted the development of society and they do their best for the creation of their product and dream .
With the spirit of innovation and passion for innovation , our life will become better and better .
In Singapore , innovations in engineering design have been in the cold when compared to leading countries like Germany or Japan .
In my opinion , there are two problems that have led to this situation: Our education structure as well as the shallow engineering heritage that we have .
Firstly , the education structure in Singapore is too rigid and does not promote the creativity of students .
The majority of our Singaporean kids will go through primary school and graduate with a PSLE certificatecertificate , follow that up with a secondary school education in either the express , normal academic or normal technical stream .
This streaming systemhowever , however , was largely based on the students' abilities to cope with the standard subjects on language , math , science and humanities instead of the interest of the students in terms of arts , science or other humanities like literature .
As a result , there was an unhealthy emphasis on the children's results in the standard subjects which they learned .
Parents wanted their children to score well in order to advance to university and have a bright future .
In their eyes , creative students who want to make it into the arts stream were just rotten apples who couldn't do well in their standard subjects .
Indeed , this was very discouraging for the young minds .
As a result , creativity , which is the key to innovation , isn't developed since young for many Singaporeans .
Secondly , we have a shallow engineering culture in Singapore .
Aside from having many labor intensive industries during the 1970s , our focus of engineering was more towards money making opportunities rather than research and development .
Germany has been famous for their innovative and precise engineering in their automotive industries since the 1920s .
Japan on the other hand , is famous for its creative and remarkable ideas for anything that it manufactures Singapore , however , is famous for our clean and green country , which was basically the work of blue-collared workers cleaning up the streets during the early hours .
Singapore's emphasis on commercial gains rather than innovations was largely influenced by the fact that we were a trading hub since British rule .
Chinese merchants , Indian spice traders and Malay rubber traders involved in the trading market were the backbone of our country's growth .
On the other hand , the Europeans had the Romans who created the wheel while the Japanese made the Katana for their Samurai .
Therefore , we cannot blame our forefathers for not being innovative when it comes to engineering .
Our innovations came in the way that they tense business instead .
In conclusion , even if  we are able to solve the education structure problem , it will still take a few more generations of Singaporeans before we can start to see results for our engineering innovations .
We are after all , a very young nation when compared to the rest of the world .
Perhaps in future , there will be Singaporeans who can create engineering wonders to revolutionize the world .
We will then be able to catch up with countries like Germany or Japan and be labeled as a country with innovative engineering .
During the 1930's two types of refrigerators were at the prototype stage , one the electric refrigerator and the other the gas refrigerator .
The gas refrigerator was superior to the electricrefrigeratorin several ways .
The gas refrigerator uses an ammonia refrigerant which is vaporized by heating with a gas flame .
Then therefrigerantdissolves in water , hence cooling the refrigerator .
On the other hand , an electric refrigerator has a compressor that condenses the liquidrefrigerant and releases the heat , which wasabsorbedby therefrigerantwhen itvaporized , into the outside surrounding .
(Rogers 2003)
Although my home country , China , has been developing very fast and achieved tremendous success since theto practice open and reform policy , especially in the field of engineering design processes of innovations , there are still a lot of problems or obstacles lying on the way to further success .
Among all the problems , corruption and education rank as first and second .
According to the Oxford Dictionary , corruption means that dishonest or immoral behavior of activities .
Inimplementationcountry , a large number of great ideas or inventions are made almost every day , but few of them are made into practice and benefit us .
What is the reason ?
Corruption .
In some cases , when a research group comes up with a new plan or idea , he has to report to his boss to ask for fund to develop the idea .
Then the boss has to report further to a boss on a higher level , then all the way up .
Finally , the report reaches the "super boss" , but if corruption exists , the standard for the "super boss" to judge whether this idea should or should not be developed further is whether it can benefit himself , instead of the majority of people .
If the research group is lucky enough to get the fund , the money has to be passed all the way down to the group through a lot of institutions in between .
As the money is passed from one to another , it will become less and less , the other goes to the bosses' own pockets .
Finally , the research group gets the money , but no use anymore , because the remaining money is not enough or the arrival time of money is too late .
When such things happen again and again , people will have no desire to innovate because they know they will not succeed .
Just in this way , corruption hampers the execution stage of engineering design processes for Innovation , killing numerous of engineering design processes for innovation .
The other problem which hampers the engineering design processes for Innovation is the education system .
As we all know , China has the largest population in the world , so students suffer a lot in order to get into put into practice totitution .
They are forced to focus on how to get high marks , but not care about the creation .
PRC students are said to be "full marks , less ability" .
They just repeat what other has done before , and have little idea what innovation is about .
Of course , repetition cannot lead us to innovation .
This is the big problem that hampers the thinking stage of engineering design processes for Innovation .
Although the government is try to improve it , so far the result is not satisfied .
satisfactoryIn a nutshell , the two main problems what hamper the engineering desigotherschavees for Innovation in my home country are corruption , which will probably kill the innovation on the process of execution , and education , which makes the youth less creative that their peers in other countries .
These two problems are very difficult to solve in a short time , but we can improve a lot and make the engineering design processes for Innovation better and better .
Human need is something that is necessary for humans to live a healthy , convenient and comfortable life .
Are the needs that meet/fulfilled human need come from no way ?
The answer is No !
Have you ever observed your surroundings , for examples telephones , computers , fans , iPods etc .
Those  all came into being through the creative application of technology , and do not appear from nowhere .
The majority of the engineering designs are categorized as inventions-devices or systems .they didn't  exist before or are the improvements over existing devices or systems .
Those inventions or designs are processing under a term called: Design activity .
The solution to the design problem requires step-by step methodology , and normally the activity is  an iterative process .
Next I will illustrate more in detail how engineering design processes can meet that need by using one of a current human need that should be given priority - Eco Car .
Collecting information is the next thing we are focusing on .
We need to collect all the information that relevant to the problem .
In this stage , developing a problem statement is necessary .
A broad definition will help in the sense of allowing you to look at alternative solutions .
We should keep asking ourselves  questions , in order to discover mistakes and  also to help in redefining of the problem , such as: is the hydrogen is only the material we need to consider ?
What are the existing solutions to the problem ?
etc .
Searching for information resources for examples , using internet , electronic catalog or indexes will also broaden your view on your design problem .
When it comesanalyzing and selecting solution , here we need to decide which solution is  best suited for implementation to the problem .
Analyzing the best solution is essential before deciding which design solution to implement .
For examples , functional analysis .
We need to ensure the given solution will function the way it should .
Even even though it meets all the criteria but fails at one of them , it is still considered a failure .
Product safety and liability , we also need to consider the Eco car that we design doesn't cause injury to humans , property damage and environmental damage from the use of your design .
Besides that , economic and market analysis , to analyze how people feel in this Eco car , are they willing to pay for a car the top speed of which is only 40km/h ?Lastly is the decision making and give rating to each design alternative against the stated criteria .
For examples , safety: 30 percent , efficiency: 30 percent etc .
Now we've reached the final stage - test and implement the solution .
There are several considerations  to be considered , such as prototyping , concurrent engineering and the distinct activities that might happen during implementation like , documentation , applying for patents .
Finally testing and verification , you have to test all steps in the process work .
Because without having a proper testing at all stages in the process , you may find yourself in trouble later on .
As a conclusion , follow the engineering design process is an important guidance as it can guides your design into more details of implementing ideas , more effective way of problem solving .
Design activity is cyclic and iterative , it will continually repeat to the five step processes , until the best design has appeared .
Firstly , definition of the problem .
Before we can develop a problem , we need to recognize the need for a new product , system , or machine .
We all know that the vehicles are running by the petroleum fuel , because of the rapidly increasing of the petroleum prices due to lacking of the material , and it is predicted will running out in few decades , this issue leads us to look for a new material to replace petroleum has become enthusiastic among the engineering fields .
Besides , establish criteria for success is important as well .
We should consider the preliminary criteria before move into next stage .
For examples , the design must be low cost; the design must be user friendly etc .
Furthermore , funding is required to apply for patents .
pursuing patents is  not easy as they take  a long time period of time to process , requiring large amount of money .
The engineers have to be confident about their innovations and understand the improvements their work will have on society .
(Khandani 22) .
Technology and inventions are not strangers in this fast developing world .
Things that people had never imagined 2 centuries ago have become a normality nowadays .
In 1876 , Alexander Graham Bell invented a telephone .
Today , we cannot live without a hand phone whereas people from 1900s did not have one for their own .
Furthermore , sharing of information has never been easier with the invention of Internet after another century , in 2000s .
All these inventions have been contributed by a lot of people of different expertises .
Most of the time , new technology and innovations are being developed based on existing technology while some individual or group may discover technology serendipitously .
There are certain similarities and differences between those two methods of discovery .
We will discuss computer technology compared to the discovery of penicillin which is a serendipitous discovery .
For every discovery or technology to be accepted by consumers , it has to meet the demands of users .
This is the same for both technology via research or a serendipitous discovery .
An example of this is the discovery of penicillin in 1928 which was one of the earliest antibiotics available in the market .
The use of penicillin extended from killing disease-causing bacteria to saving lives in the battlefield during the World War II .
Therefore , this discovery was a success and used by people all around the world .
This fact illustrates that not only the discovery has to be successful but also it has to be accepted by society .
In conclusion , technology , whether it is discovered accidentally or purposely , is the main ingredient of new innovations and products .
We have to make the technology useful to society because they are the main users of the end-products .
In the end , a serendipitous discovery will be just as good as echnology discovered by research as long as it serves the purpose of contributing to the society and making lives better .
Although some countries are still keeping up with the rapid increasing of energy demands , there is still a need for other alternatives to prepare for the future .
Some possible solutions will be utilizing sun energy , wind , coal , geothermic and bio energy , which in principle are renewable .
However , among all this possible solutions , most of them are not suitable to be implemented due to high cost and the availability in large scale .
For example , coal is cheap but it causes pollution .
Extra work has to be done in order to reduce the amount of pollution produced to the minimum (Khalid Chandio  ,2009) .
Several design considerations have to be well-planned such that low design cost , design safety and preventing harm to the environment .
Analysis is the key to process design .
Among all the suggested solutions , it is crucial to analyse all the solutions before making a decision .
After brainstorming all the possible solutions , solar energy stands out as the best solution .
According to an article by Musse Mohamud Ahmed (2003) , he says that solar energy is world-wide recognised renewable energy sources , cost free and clean energy .
Environment impacts are also negligible .
However , one problem that may hinder this invention is the use of costly equipment and the selection of the wrong peak sunshine data .
Therefore , exact calculations for the solar power production are very important before any actual implementation of solar energy scheme to ensure proper performance and reduce cost .
Cost depends heavily on the size of solar power system .
Weather conditions are important for high performance as solar energy depends largely on the sun .
Cloudy weathers will produce lesser power as compared to sunny weathers .
Engineers need to calculate the required solar panels needed for certain hours use of energy .
Selection of solar energy components is another issue that engineers need to take into consideration when using solar energy .
Although our common education system is generally sufficient , it still contains some shortcomings that spread out all over the world .
In developing countries , education is even a far-away concept though a lot of governments' and outside donors' have been made .
As a glance: "In sub-Saharan Africa , for example , the average student-teacher ratio in primary school is 47 to 1 , compared with 17 to 1 in developed countries .
And that masks even worse conditions in the early grades , where this ratio can be as high as 100 to 1 .
As a result , too few of these new students are mastering the basic skills necessary to begin lifting themselves out of poverty" (Hewlett Foundation) .
The education issue also involves the cost of schooling , "Even when schooling is ostensibly 'free' studies have shown that parents incur other direct costs such as activity fees , uniforms , paper and pens (including texts and excise books) , transport , lunches , expenses for boarding and others which often result in the exclusion of poor children from school" (Chimombo , 2005) .
Other problems are equity and gender issue , cultural and religious attitudes , efficiency and quality .
In developed countries , the cost of study and also the efficiency of education are the main points which considerably need observing .
"Another observation in the report that we find is those with college degrees are facing the highest unemployment in two decades since records started being kept .
With college costs going through the roof and in many cases , costing nearly $50 ,000 a year at private schools many are asking whether some college degrees are even worth pursuing" (Mybudget360 , 2009) .
In short , the education shortcomings mainly focus on the equipment and management issues .
Firstly , Examination-styled education cuts down children's creativity .
Due to the huge population in China , Chinese education system has to select talented people by setting one universal examination which is called GaoKao for candidates all over China each year .
According to the ministry of Education of PRC , all together more than 10 million candidates will have to attend Gaokao for the entry to universities every year .
However , China has only 720 higher education institutes offering degree aspectsm (MOEPRC , 2006) , which means that those 10 million candidates have to fiercely compete for the deficient universities in terms of their marks in exam .
Secondly , mae and more talented designing engineers leave China behind .
The policy of reformation and opening pushes China into a new global position she has never met before .
The designing engineering can get touch with foreign developed companies which may provide attractive remuneration .
Chinese government also does not take measure to keep resources of human talents .
As a result , approaching 600 thousand studentsmethodsone out overseas for further study since 1980s .
But only a quarter of them come back to serve China in economic development (Pan , 2006) .
In the same way , China lost lots of design engineers which may contribute innovative ideas about construction either on specific field like civil engineering , or on the entire development of Chinese economy .
However , only minority of the experts can make efforts on design process in China .
Thus , the acceleration of enhancement of engineering will be reduced at a large scale .
Additionally , every country nowadays is trying its best to protect human resources as well as technology and design ideas .
Less highly educated people staying in China will be a disadvantage on this protection .
Good designing ideas may be lost from China , or even not created in this country .
a minorityIn conclusion , my home country China now faces two challenging troubles .
Examination-styled education kills children's creativity .
And , Chinese government does not manage well on resources of human talents .
Both problems will sharply hamper the design process of innovation of China .
Obviously , it will be an extremely heavy load on our generation and hopefully , we can handle this issue and change the situation .
First and foremost , the  in China is not conducive enough to cultivate students' ability of innovation .
Especially for engineerings , hands-on , practical ability and independent thinking are the most important capabilities .
However , the education evaluation system in China is based on examination .
Using examinations to recruit the most outstanding students results in that a large proportion of engineering students are only good at rote memorization but not innovative thinking .
This has caused the shortage of talents in both quantity and quality .
Based on statistics on 2004 , the number of researchers per million is 708 in China , while it is 3750 in developed countries (Education Economic Indicators of Countries in the World , 2009) .
Engineering creation and innovation can not go without talents .
Moreover , to create a new product needs the cooperation of many people .
If there is not enough talents , the design process can even hardly be started .
So the problems in education system is the main obstacle to the engineering design process .
In this new era of globalization , design and innovation plays an important role in changing the world into a better place to live .
From the  until this modern world of technology , many inventions and innovations have been made so as to suit our lifestyle .
For example , mobile phones have become smaller and lighter with the miniaturization of digital components and the development of more sophisticated batteries .
Inventors realized the risk of not taking a risk and dare to challenge an outdated product .
However , in my home country- Malaysia , there are some obstacles that hold back engineering design processes for innovation .
The first problem is the current economic model for one off development .
In our country , we are unable to achieve commercially significant levels of reuse beyond platform .
This is because the engineers design and develop most products as individuals in isolation from other products .
Eventually , all the products such as computer software  more or less have the same functions , it is just that return on investment in product development would be far higher if multiple versions or multiple products were taken into account .
Hence , organizations rarely make commercially significant investments in identifying and harvesting the reusable assets , unless it is explicitly planned in advance .
This problem causes us to fail to recognize the opportunity to convert resources optimally so as to meet our objective , which is to meet desired needs of the public .
And of course , this need can sometimes be considered a necessity to some people but a luxury for others .
But the most important reason is , when engineers do not investigate a reusable product , they will eventually create the same structural product without improving its properties .
Thus , these products do not fulfill different needs of the public .
The second matter that significantly hampers engineering design processes for innovations in my home country is the limitation of human resources for designing new products .
Human resources are an important factor for a country to come up with lots of creative innovation .
For instance , the younger generation dares to challenge themselves and think out of the box to generate new ideas .
They have the initiative and determination to turn their dreams and imaginations into reality .
Unfortunately , this expertise tends to work in other countries instead of staying back after graduation .
This is because foreign companies are willing to offer them higher position and satisfying salary compared to local companies .
Consequently , there is no new blood in research and development prospects .
The lack of human resources brings great impact on our country's economic growth .
This is because outdated products will be eliminated from the market and when there is no invention of new products , sooner or later other countries will stop importing products from us and head towards those with higher technologies .
As a result , our country will fall into inflation and recession will occur .
In conclusion , engineering design process for innovations plays a crucial role in our society .
It is very important for a country to sustain its products' marketability by enhancing its design and functions .
Hence , the  economic model for one off development and limitation of human resources should not be obstacles for our country's progress .
Don't multitask , multithink instead .
Think out of the box and be creative so as we can keep on path with the fast paces of life .
Firstly , engineers should design all buildings in accordance with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) green mark scheme .
The scheme would provide advice on how a green building should be built and what additional features should be included .
All these guidelines will save electricity  and reduce environmental impact as well .
For example , although the air conditioning system in a library cannot be switched off at night due to the moisture content in the atmosphere , they can be set to a higher temperature or part of the units can be switched off automatically at night .
Hence , it will help in decreasing the Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gases emitted which harms the ozone layer .
In short , engineers should adopt the green mark scheme for all the buildings they design in the future to reduce the environmental impacts that are harmful to the earth .
Secondly , engineers can dedicate more green areas to future plans on redeveloping Singapore .
Some of the emission of negative gases that affect the ozone layer are beyond our control , certain plans to recycle the harmful gases should be considered .
For example , trees and plants can be planted at strategic locations of Singapore as they will reduce pollution by photosynthesising and producing oxygen in return .
This is an ideal method which can be adopted especially in congested cities like Singapore .
Other than dedicating land area for greens , gardens can also be built on the balconies , facades and even the roofs of buildings !
The multi-tier idea will definitely increase the intensity of green areas , thus reducing pollution and help to recycle cleaner air for our atmosphere .
To sum up , there should be gardens in every town and parks in every estate to allow a good ratio of renewing air supply in the atmosphere .
Nowadays , the living standards of human beings has been improved due to the changes in time .
Everything has changed drastically from the past untill now .
Therefore , the requirements of people in terms of technology has increased .
For example , in the past mobile phone has been designed to the size of a brick , and now mobile phone has been designed into a small and stylish design with high technology function , such as touch screen function .
However , the engineering design process for innovation has been hampered in my home country , Malaysia .
According to the The 6th International Malaysian Studies Conference 2008 , "it is true that Malaysian SMEs do not see innovation as part of their business" .
In my home country , I feel that the 2 main problems that hamper the engineering design processes for innovation  are the lack of government support in engineering innovative design area and social problem .
These 2 problems may lead to some of the future local talented people give up on pursuing their interest in engineering design processes for innovation .
Some may seek  other solutions such as for those who can afford the  fees will go overseas for better education , and work there , as theywill have more exposure and opportunity to  in design .
According to the Australian Education International , "There were almost 21 ,000 Malaysian student enrolments in Australia as at the end of October 2008 .
This is 1 ,000 more enrolments than the same period last year , and represents almost 7% growth" .
Whereas for those who could not afford to study  overseas for higher education , may end up in give up their ambition .
Besides that , the export rate of Malaysia's products would also be heavily affected , such as the automobile sector , as it would slowly be outclassed by other innovative products from other countries .
In conclusion , innovative designing doesn't come into consideration in designing a product for most engineers in my home country and their main target is to meet their client requirement .
With this , if nothing has been done to solve it , in future the engineering sector in Malaysia would be seriously affected , compared  to other more advance country .
First , education is a big issue a countryt government should improve to make citizens more talented and creative .
Exam-oriented education is the main education system in China .
It inherits traditional education from thousands years ago: "life depends on one examination" , which pushes a lot of pressure on shas becomes .
China is a cimplementry with limited jobs .
The only wayeffort a good job is to enter a good university , which makes the exam becomes more and more difficult in order to find most talented students .
However , students lose their creativity and innovation since they have soaked in the exam paper for a long time .
Moreover , teachers and parents only care about t exam results instead of their talent , which will make students only good at exam .
Furthermore , the education in university is not good .
Some universities want to increase their popularity , so they approve more master degrees and PHD degrees , which decrease the level of master degree students .
In recent news , there is no difference between the employment ratios of graduate students and masters .
This will bury a lot of talented people .
Finally , many student choose to go oversea to finish their education or start their careers , which made China lost many talents .
In short , the education system in china killed talent of innovation .
Beside the education problem , the lacthe government for design projects is also a big problem .
As President Hu (2007) writes in his NPC report scientific development should depend on the situation of country development .
Overall saying , the productively level in China is not high , and the socialist market economy has established initially .
However , the gap between rich and poor tend to increase .
Government has spent lots of money on urban and rural development .
Moreover , as China become more open to the world , she faces constant intensifying international competition .
Comparing to some developed countries which have advantage in economic scientific , we will suffer more predictable and unpredictable risk .
(Seventh National People's Congress , 2007) Because of the limited money for research , many people have to do their experiments in a small place with crude equipments .
All of these make the development of engineering design stuck in a difficult situation .
comparedIn conclusion , education problems and economy problems hinder the development of design technology .
Government should advocate the education for all-round development to all the schools , and put more money into scientific devnt .
Thproductivityease people's independent innovation ability , and make the country more prosperous .
Being a country with a relatively small market dominated by large companies and a low spending consumer base , it is extremely difficult for new products to penetrate into the market and capture consumer attention without insufficient financing .
Thus , government financing on such new ventures is essential for its survival .
However , there has been a lack of government support for  such projects mainly due to defense expenses .
Over the past three decades Sri Lanka has witnessed the longest civil war in the country .
Billions of dollars was spent every year for purchasing weaponry , rehabilitating refugees and for wages of defense personnel .
A record USD 1 .82 billion was spent in the year 2008 only on new weaponry which is a twenty percent increase from the previous year (Note 1) .
Although decades long war finally came to an end last June , estimated 280 ,000 refugees have to be relocated , 30 ,000 disabled soldiers have to be looked after and a 6000 families of dead army cadres have to be compensated(Note 2) .
All these require financing which the government aims to gain mainly through taxation which makes it even difficult for new products to survive .
The second reason that I feel makes it difficult for new engineering innovations to be successful is  the large number of professionally qualified Sri Lankans migrating to other countries .
Sri Lanka has the highest literacy rate in South East Asia with over 96% population being able to read or write , this is mainly due to a free education system introduced in the late 1940 s (Note 3) .
All Sri Lankans enjoy a free education up to university level thus , a large proportion of the population gain high professional qualifications which are recognized all over the world .
However , there is no proper system such as the MOE grant system in Singapore to retain these individuals with in Sri Lanka resulting in most of these professionals leaving the country for better paid employment opportunities .
Reports show that over 8000 Sri Lankans have migrated to India from January 2009 to August 2009 (Note 5) and over 100 ,000 Sri Lankans are currently residing in Australia making them the 16th largest ethnic group in Australia (Note 6) .
These numbers show the magnitude of the seriousness of this problem .
First problem that significantly hampers engineering design processes for innovations in Malaysia is financial issues .
Due to the global economic crisis , currently Malaysia is under economic downturn .
This economic downturn led to great decline in the engineering sector field especially in engineering design process .
In the past few years , Malaysia's company was dismissed their worker in order to reduce their labour cost .
The workers they have dismissed are not  just just the  the operators , part of them are research engineers .
In addition , to reducing their expenses they even temporarily suspended all the research and develop process .
The employee may think research and development is a costly investment and a lot of uncertainty process .
For example The Bakun Dam project was suspended due to lack of the fund in 2001 .
The second problem that hampers engineering design in Malaysia is lack of technology systems .
In Malaysia there are many small enterprise companies which are lack in technology systems for their manufacturing process .
Due to the lack of technology systems in their factories they do not have a good exhaust for the waste gases .
Most of the waste gases  contain a lot unhealthy chemical compounds that harm for human body and pollute the air quality .
As a result , their factories were not allowed to continue  the manufacture process .
The process involve can be either manufacturing process or an experiment process .
Furthermore due to lack of the technology system in my country a lot high technology research have to be postponed .
They need to wait for few months to few years to import the new system form other country to continue the research process .
The effect of the financial problem on engineering process for innovation will result engineering process stuck at the research stage .
Due to the lack offunds there is money to hire research engineering , research equipment and materials on experiment .
In addition , the lack of fund also will affect the initial stage identify the need of the consumers there is no fund for conduct survey .
Besides the effect on financial problem , outdated technology systems used in Malaysia also will cause the research process either defer for a long period or stuck there .
In summary , financial problem and lack in technology was two major engineering design problems in Malaysia .
Engineering design will affect the development in Malaysia , thus government should to pay close attention to this issue and find out the possible solutions .
Such as they can conduct workshop to help small enterprise company on improve their technology system .
Ever wondered why some brilliant engineering creations are not as important in our life compared to creation like the microwave oven ?
The microwave oven changed our way of living for the better better , providing us with so much convenience , with just a click of a button plus a considerably short waiting time , we could stir up a dish with no mess and no hassle .
Innovation is the word for creations which have made it this far , widely adopted and used by the public .
Next  , solar cells are what make up the solar panel and it is not surprising that this new technology is of high market value .
The initial cost of this type of vehicle is very high compared to what it can offer in return , which is also why patrons are discouraged and rather decide on the conventional gasoline vehicle .
Since the cells are of high value , and as long in Singapore's context is concern , most vehicles are parked in the open and not in a garage; the solar panels on the vehicle are very prone to thievery for personal benefits or vandalism for self satisfaction .
Additionally ,  , solar cells are of delicate piece of engineering , environmental pollutions can degrade the solar cells and the lifespan of these cells are of no better , they can be very random from few months due to loose connections or two decades if properly taken care of .
To sum it up , solar cells are of high market value due to its scarcity , incurring a high cost in every aspect , such as , repairing because mechanics with knowledge of solar cells are limited and the infrastructure for this product is not widely available commercially , thus the high cost .
The first main problem in India which inhabits the engineering design process is political corruption .
When one submits a design process for innovations to their higher authorities for approval , the project proposal will not be processed immediately .
The proposal report will be stacked on the higher authority's table for months .
The project proposal will only get processed fast enough when bribing is used .
A 2005 study done by Transparency International in India found that more than 50% of the people had first hand experience of paying bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a public office (Wikipedia , n .d .) .
Road infrastructures projects are one of the engineering projects that would get hamper the most .
The road systems in many villages and cities in India are either incomplete or done to  dissatisfaction .
Many state-funded construction activities in India , such as road building , are dominated by construction mafias , which are grouping of corrupt public works officials , material suppliers , politicians and construction contractors (Wikipedia , n .d .) .
The effects of the problem are mostly on the people .
When the political parties in Karnataka & Tamil Nadu does not come up with plans to solve the water issue , the public starts riot to solve their water demands .
When there is a riot , the normal routing life of the public are affected .
Innocent people & children get hurt in the riots and even die .
Engineers cannot carry on with their water projects to solve the problem because different political parties have different views & comments on the projects .
Hence , engineers are unable to continue their work .
In conclusion , the political corruption & political parties' problems in India are highly affecting the work of an engineer .
When an engineer works hard to create an innovative or creative design projects , their works are delayed or rejected due to political corruption & misunderstanding between political parties .
The dream of an engineer is destroyed as there is no one voice to lead the country .
Engineers cannot provide good services to the public when corruption is involved .
Innocent people get affected by these problems too .
The public cannot get better living standard because of political corruption & political parties as they stop the engineer's projects & ideas for better living lifestyle .
To solve these problems , India has to form a good & strong politics .
The current political parties are mostly occupied by senior citizens & uneducated members .
Young & educated members should join the politics to lend the country in the right path .
In that way , most of the engineer's hard work & innovative ideas will be fulfilled .
The disapproval of ideas due to fiscal reasons is one of the problems .
The primary objective of having a business is to earn profit .
Therefore , if a given idea is not believed to produce substantial earnings , the management of the profit driven companies would tend not to approve it as the funds could be channelled to some other more profitable ideas .
Hence , the development of the idea will be stuck at the research stage as resources such as manpower , raw materials and financial support are not allocated .
If the engineer is passionate enough , he might be able to implement the idea using his own time and expenses .
However , this would also mean that the duration of the implementation will be increased relative to one with sufficient support from the management .
One such example would be how Tetsuya Mizoguchi , a brilliant engineer in the 1980s , managed to see through his idea of compacting a desktop sized personal computer into in the form of a laptop which was highly condemned by his management (Rogers , 2003) .
Firstly , the problem of the system of education has always been  an obstacle for many aspects , especially in Engineering where creativity and innovation should be privileged , where the personal and original opinion should be highly respected , that is why we have to analyze to its core .
In Viet Nam , the traditional ways of teaching and learning which are still currently applied in every establishments are too passive: teachers read out loud or write on the board and students copy , all information must be memorized exactly the same in the manuals , the syllabus for teachers must be 100% respected , etc , . . . thus there are no creative ideas , no new thing to teach , no spontaneous students and no active classes where personal opinions could be freely express .
Therefore , real engineers hardly glow from that kind of environment .
So how can this outdated system still survive until this moment ?
Whose fault is it ?
Many scholars when analyzing and criticizing the weakness and lag of the current system of education often compare or justify by saying: "In the past , our time were this .were that .
but now  . . . " however they forget that comparison has already become outdated"(Vietnamnet , 29/09/2008) .Now we know , the whole system has been outdated from the past to the present , because of that mind set , no one seems to like the idea of changing , no innovations could slip in that traditional-so-called system of education .
Moreover , the quality of material for the studying environment is also degrading , which in fact is another factor that hampers the overall development of innovation in design engineering process of Viet Nam .
Among the latest series of newspaper with many comments about the system of education in Vietnam , including the Chronicle of Higher Education of USA who commented that the slow progress of the system of universities in Viet Nam is no different than the one from 20-30 years ago .
This specialized in education newspaper said: "Economists indicate that Vietnam does not even have one university which is considered having the international quality ."
(MYE forum , 08/06/2006 , para .1) .The quality of infra-structure and education serving tools are that low .
The same goes for the quality of teaching , but the main point here is the ones who have the right to change and improve that entire thing hardly taking a concern .
As a result , the bad effects seems to outweigh all: the source of workers flows to foreign countries where they can find an ideal environment for studies and works , most never come back to mother country; it is too easy to hold 2 or 3 degrees/diplomas/certificates but in fact the holders have no professional knowledge and experiences; not only lack of professional workers but the their quality has also gone down .
That is the reason why the outdated system of education in Viet Nam plays an "essential" role in destroying potential and talented engineers .
If we only change the educational system , it is not sufficient enough to solve the growth retardation in technical design and innovations of Viet Nam .
Indeed , the slow development in engineering design process of Viet Nam is also seriously affected by the weak management of government .
Although Viet Nam is rich in natural resources but its government does not have suitable methods to impulse the development of business and economy .
For instance , the strategy of Viet Nam to attract the investment from foreign and local companies is not really effective .
According to a statistics of World Bank (WB) organization on "Doing business in 2010" , Viet Nam has dropped down two levels due to the complicated procedure of export and import duties , in which it costs too much time to complete the whole formalities (Tri Duong , GeographyIQ , cited in PHP news in Viet Nam 2009 , para .9) .
Besides , the statistics show no reduction in the number of times a company in Viet Nam has to pay taxes , which can reach up to 32 times per year (Tri Duong , GeographyIQ , cited in PHP news in Viet Nam 2009 , para .10) .
The complication in the official procedure causes the hesitance of investors , and it subsequently affects the development of design process and innovations of engineers , who need investment to execute their projects .
In addition , the weakness in governmental management is also reflected in the brain-drain problem of Viet Nam .
This problem has happened for a long time due to the lack of investment of Government in young-manpower .
From a website discussion on the quality of education in Singapore , Vietnamese students studying in NUS insisted "Innovation and creativity of young human resources has made Singapore become a very strong country in both commerce and technology; Singapore always consider attracting the talent manpower as top priority , while government of Viet Nam does not focus on encouraging creativity and intelligence to speed up the development of whole country" (Doan Xuan Loc , BBC Viet Nam , 2009 , part 3) .
Therefore , developing innovation and creativity in young manpower is also the main factor which affects the design process of engineering .
From all the analyses above , we can see through the direct causes which influence the engineering design processes and innovations are the weakness in the administration of education system and governmental structure .
As a Vietnamese student who is studying abroad and receiving the advanced education of Singapore , I myself realize that for Viet Nam to be able to catch up the World's developing pace , we must find a wise way to reform and improve considerately also uniformly in every domain .
The privileged goal is to renovate the system of education and government; because these are the essential elements which can help Viet Nam achieving certain breakthroughs in science-technology , from that found a powerful and prosperous country .
There is a common catch phrase in the Singapore educational system - think out of the box .
Essentially the concept of 'thinking out of the box' revolves around the idea of innovativeness .
Some people find it difficult to do so and interestingly enough , they even take courses to learn to be creative .
Little do these people know that they are already embedded with this ability ever since they were born .
Indeed , we unknowingly use our innovativeness to fill ourselves with excuses for doing or not doing something .
In engineering context , engineers use their creativity to create new products and according to Khandani (2005) , "What distinguishes engineers from painters , poets , or sculptors is that engineers apply their creative energies to producing products or systems that meet human needs .
This creative act is called design ."
Nevertheless it is often easier said than done , as there are always factors hampering creativity .
Once such obstacles are overcome , it becomes easier for one to innovate .
The first problem that a prospective innovator will face is actually his ability to accept failure positively .
This is because the process of creating a new product often requires the innovator to continuously modifying it .
It also implies that an engineering design often requires many failed attempts before a breakthrough is obtained .
In the process of doing so , the innovator may at times , needs to challenge the conventional way of doing things in order to obtain a new approach in solving a problem .
As such , some risks need to be taken .
Unfortunately in Singapore , many of us do not have this mindset in the first place .
Probably due to the fact that we are overly result orientated that we do not like the idea of risk taking .
Risk taking is often seen as undesirable as it does not guarantee a result that we expect it to be .
A successful inventor will at some point of time , take some calculated risk to make their idea a reality and if every risk is minimized , it may not be possible to do so .
For instance , the Wright Brothers risk their reputation to fly the world's first aircraft .
If they were to think like a Singaporean , it would be unlikely that we have the airbus flying in our skies .
The result of being so negative about risk taking is that many plausible ideas may not have taken flight .
As such , the chances of getting another Singaporean innovator like Sim Wong Hoo , is low .
This does not borne well especially when our economy is heading towards being knowledge based .
Hence if we were to change our attitude towards innovation and risk taking , perhaps , we might see a new technology conglomerate originating from Singapore someday .
Undoubtedly , China has emerged as the world's technological and industrial giant in the last two decades .
Engineering professionals and scientists have definitely contributed significantly to the country's advancement .
Even though the country recognises the importance of such progress , there are still some problems that significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
Firstly , the rigid education system in China is one of the main obstacles which hinder engineering innovations .
Education is one of the crucial factors which determine a country's might .
The education system in every country plays a key role in moulding the future of the country .
The rigid education system in most parts of China , however , places more emphasis on books and academic results , rather than promoting creativity in the classrooms .
There are millions of students in the country and it is therefore very competitive to stand out among all .
Perhaps , the only best way to distinguish one is through a series of examinations .
Due to such reason , there is simply no room for creativity and innovation in the class .
Students or rather the young generations grow up with the mindset that achieving excellent results is much more important than being innovative .
As a result , without promoting and inculcating the significance of being creative , engineering design processes will be  hampered from the beginning  .
In addition , raising enough funds for engineering design purposes has always been a problem .
Even if  passionate engineers get together and plan to launch a project , it is very difficult to get sponsorship .
Most of the time , the designing processes may require sophisticated equipments and materials which may not be easily available within the country .
Sometimes , the engineers have to import the necessary resources overseas .
If the project would be carried out over a few years , the funds would be running low very fast .
Therefore , the engineering design processes may most likely end half way due to the lack of funding .
Moreover , there is  lack of role models for young engineers in China .
The country has just started her technological and industrial progress in the recent decades .
Unlike the US and the European countries , China does not have a long historical record of her own engineering precedence .
For example , China has become the one of the largest semiconductor industry in the world .
However , those semiconductors are still not as good as those in Silicon Valley .
A group of computer engineers created the powerful search engine Baidu which is another modification of Google .
Thus , there is a lack of the originality of the idea during the designing processes .
The first problem , is , would be our lack of experience and development in engineering and innovation .
Although Singapore is a developed nation with a developed education system and economy , our development is very recent in comparison to Europe and the United States .
Thirty years ago , our industry was still predominantly based on manufacturing .
The engineering sector only took off in the 1990s , along with the initial conceptualization for the KBE .
Therefore , although our students in colleges , polytechnics and universities are equipped with critical thinking skills for design invention and innovation , we do not have any experience and still remain as 'Engineers on paper' .
True knowledge is epistemic and empirical in nature; and according to Khandani , expertise in the Engineering Design Process requires an iterative critical inquiry on practical problems and solutions (paraphrased from Khandani 2005) .
Indeed , Singapore recognizes this problem , and is currently focusing on further development in the Research and Development sector .
Also , our leaders encourage creativity and entrepreneurship in our people .
Yet , this ideal will not be realized for the time being .
And in the meantime , our lack of experience and development in engineering and innovation continues to pose a problem for aspiring engineers , as well as design processes for innovations .
Why is the ideal for practical development not going to be realized in the near future ?
A very plausible reason would be due to the Social mindset of Singaporeans , and it is also this very factor that hampers the Engineering Design Process for Innovations .
As Singapore is an Asian country , many Singaporeans tend to adopt Asian values and mindsets- which advocate adhering to social norms and not go against convention or 'the textbook' .
Also , the value of family before self results in many Singaporeans not wanting to risk themselves for a breakthrough in personal achievement .
Fuelled by the recent economic crises , many Singaporeans prefer to 'play it safe'- to stick to stable , routine and high paying jobs; than to get creative , take risks and be curious of the unknown .
It is from this reason we have the aphorism: 'stick to the iron-rice-bowl' .
While such mindsets ensure a relatively stable life for us and our families , they promote contentment and impede self-improvement .
We know that the Engineering Design Process requires the continuous process of construction and tearing down of existing schemas .
To do so requires great flexibility of mind , as well as a certain zest for personal breakthrough and risk taking .
It is in this respect our mindsets greatly impede on the philosophy of Engineering , and hence pose a problem on the designing process for innovations .
In Singapore , there are various problems that may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
These problems comprise  , insufficient funds , insufficient resources , design may not be aesthetically pleasing to be selected and copyright infringement .
Of these four identified problems , I will highlight two of them and the effects that they had on certain stages of the process .
The lackof funds can lead to the disruption of the progress of an engineering design process .
The engineering design process will be disturbed when there is not enough money to buy relevant resources required .
Insufficient funds may not allow the engineering design process to proceed .
For example , the innovation design of the race car from National University of Singapore may not have been so successful without sufficient financial support from the school .
Therefore , shortage of funds and financial help may hinder to the progress of the engineering process , as in the case of , the Marina Sands Integrated Resort and also prevent an engineering process to begin , as in the race car example .
Another problem that might hamper engineering design processes for innovations would be insufficient resources .
Insufficient resources would mean , not having enough raw materials or materials needed for the engineering innovation design process .
Resources need not be mainly on materials , but also manpower or labour .
For example , in the case of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort , there was a shortage of materials such as sand and steel .
There was sand ban on sand exports and contractors could not get sand that was needed from the fabrication of concrete .
Secondly , there was a lack of manpower and the construction process was slowed down as a result .
These two main factors , lacking in manpower and materials had hindered to the progress of the engineering design process .
In conclusion , as illustrated in the case of the marina sands integrated resort and the engineering innovation design of the race car , we can see that lacking in funds and resources are two obstacles that engineers had to consider .
The impact that each problems had , can affect gravely on the progress of the engineering innovative design and they should be well- planned .
During innovation development process , there are two groups of people; they are technologicallydeterministic and socially deterministic .
Which one should we accept ?
The development of telephone tells us that it was socially was determined rather than society being technologically determined .
Engineering design process may be defined as the process where engineers apply their creative thinking to produce products or systems that meet human needs .
In the process of engineering design for innovation , there is no doubt that a lot of problems and difficulties will be faced .
Although there are problems and obstacles , the development in engineering design for innovations is crucial and essential .
My home country , Malaysia , also try to develop it but several problems are met .
Among these problems , the two major problems are financial problems and technical problems .
Without adequate amount of capital , development of engineering design becomes very difficult and inefficient .
Advanced technologies used in foreign country cannot be introduced into Malaysia because of insufficient capital .
Maintaining and repairing the high-technology machines and devices require high costs , too .
Furthermore , talented people are hard to be attracted as there is no good working environment and no sufficient capital for those skilled people to carry out their researches .
Moreover , it costs a lot to build a modern working environment and high-tech facilities .
The next problem is technical problem .
Malaysia has not reached the high-technology level to design an engineering product and there is no working environment culture for engineering design .
There are too few technicians or people who are specialized in engineering design .
The education  system in Malaysia shows too little concern for the engineering design academia .
People lack  knowledge and information in engineering design , thus they are not able to deal with current and future practical problems .
Also , technologies in Malaysia still need improvement , as most of the technologies are introduced from foreign countries .
The facilities for experiment and researches have not met the basic level of performing .
The lack of technical skills has brought much effect on the development of engineering design in Malaysia .
On one hand , the facilities and devices used are not excellent enough to perform good experiments , resulting in inaccurate results with more errors .
On the other hand , Malaysia lacks  skillful labor and this has resulted in an inefficient production of creative innovations .
Both low accuracy experiment results and inefficient production cannot be solved easily .
These technical problems have caused slow progression of development of engineering design .
The next  step of defining the problem involves developing a problem statement which allows us to specifically address and successfully meet the need to have sufficient food .
In this case , it would be to increase food production by designing a crop that is able to withstand adverse environmental conditions so that more land can be used to grow crops and a crop that can be harvested all year round so that the amount of food produced is not limited by seasons .
The crop designed must be low cost so that even farmers living in poverty can also afford to buy the seeds of the crop .
Moreover , the crop should not rely heavily on the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in order to grow well as this will have detrimental effects on the environment .
What determines a technology to be good or bad ?
Well , technologies are there to supposedly to improve our way of life .
We assume technologies are constantly changing for the better .
However , this may not always be true .
A technology that looks seemingly practical and useful to our everyday lives may not function well in the society .
In other words , technology is a product of the society .
It may be technically sound but may not be well received by the end users .
We have to understand that technologies not only have to be shaped around technical factors but also around social and economical ones .
One important technology that was shaped as such was the electric refrigerator .
Firstly , the constant adoption of electric refrigerators was greatly influenced by economic factors .
According to an article on diffusion of innovations by Rogers E .M . , large companies like General Electric and General Motors had an economic advantage over smaller companies that produce gas refrigerators .
For example , Kelvinator , a large electric refrigerator production company had a budget that was 33 times more than the Common Sense Company , which was a smaller gas refrigerator production company .
As a result , these larger companies can afford to pour huge amounts of funding into electric refrigerators as they had earlier decided that larger profits could be made from them .
Moreover , with economic advantage , these larger companies can afford to spend a huge sum of money to intensively promote their electric refrigerators to gain better advertising .
Smaller companies were unable to match these giants and thus remained stagnant .
With the lack of advertising , their products were poorly accepted in the market .
Besides companies are  influenced by potential profitability and having gained access to better funding , social factors also play a part .
Better advertising by larger companies has led consumers to believe that electric refrigerators are still the product of choice .
This is an example of how larger companies socially shaped the product .
In addition , consumers also have an issue with gas refrigerators .
Most gas refrigerators use ammonia as coolants .
These coolants are not used by electric refrigerators .
Consumers did not like the idea of storing their food products in gas refrigerators as they thought the harmful coolant might contaminate their food .
As a result , gas refrigerators were not favourable among consumers and that led to an increase in sales of electric refrigerators instead .
In this new era of globalization , we must not deny the importance of implementation of design in the engineering problem solving processes .
These two are strongly related and without a designing mind , engineers definitely can not solve a problem based on engineering knowledge .
In fact , engineers are taught to consider engineering design during their tertiary education .
Nowadays , people have a misconception that design is just simply the planning that lays the physical shape and pattern of every object or system .
But the truth is that engineering design is the decision-making process , in which the basic sciences , mathematics , and engineering sciences are applied to converge resources optimally to meet a stated objective .
For instance , in designing a car , internal combustion engines are specifically configured to work optimally and therefore the design of components such as cooling system and piston engine valves should be taken into consideration .
However , in our very own country , Malaysia , some problems have arisen  which significantly hamper the engineering design processes for innovation and these have resulted in severe impact on certain stages of the process .
The most common factor which contributes to the failing of the process is the insufficient fund provided to complete the whole process  the process includes the definition of problems , narrowing of research , finding of several alternative solutions , determination of the most possible solution and lastly the making of the decision .
If no fund is provided , such a process  can not be completed .
This can be explained because in order to determine the most possible solution in engineering design process , we have to conduct many experiments and these experiments require materials for which money must be injected into the project .
For example , over in Malaysia , we have our own national car corporation , which is known as Proton .
However the selling of their cars simply could not overtake the sales of other imported cars such as Honda and Mitshibitsu .
This is simply due to the fact that it is not efficient and well designed enough to compete among all cars , which is the cruel truth that is recognised by every Malaysian .
This is based on  the fact it reflects the insufficient investment by Proton's shareholder in Malaysia compared to total equity owned by big corporation .
With the money big corporations possess , they are able to conduct Research and Development of their own product and at last launch  the product which is efficient and generates greater revenue compared to other smaller competitors .
Another root problem that hampers engineering design process is the lack of education for engineers about engineering design knowledge during their tertiary education .
Universities play an undoubtedly significant role to educate future engineers to execute engineering design process in future while at work .
Unfortunately in Malaysia , design-centric knowledge is not given much emphasis .
Knowledge taught during lecture is not enough to develop students to think creatively and determine alternative solutions from problems that  arise .
Furthermore there is none or simply only a few research laboratories that are set up on campus to encourage undergraduates to determine  during experiment .
Therefore exposure to definition of problems is not extensive enough to allow students to find other possible problems by themselves .
In conclusion , the engineering design process  is important to meet complex challenges in the world such as global warming and all types of pollution .
Fund must be injected into projects in order to execute the process .
Lastly , the education system  must be reviewed in order to solve such challenges and bring us a new generation of engineers who are able to devise innovations guided by the perspectives of a true designer .
However , there are still numerous factors years , along the innovation of engineering design in my country .
For example , the lack of fund and talents .
But , I would like to unveil two essential factors , which are the Instead , of sthave switchedn entrepreneurs and the lack of intellectual property protection .
Regarding to the first problem , it is of high importance that we investigate the background of leaders in state-run entrepreneurs .
The leaders are directly appointed by central government .
Interestingly , the criteria is not about how well marketing experience or managerial ability the person has .
It is about whether the person is loyal to the government .
Thus , many importance positions in an entrepreneur belong to government officers , which as a result , makes the entrepreneur like government .
The bureaucratic style in a company will create rigidity during the process of management and production .
In this way , innovation of engineering design will be affected .
In addition to the problem of leadership in state-run entrepreneurs , the problem created by the monopolistic status of state-run entrepreneurs also can not be neglected .
As far as I am concerned , monopolism is prevailed among state-run companies .
Many of them fully control a certain type of resource .
In this way , they are not subject to fierce competition in a markect .
As a result , many state-run companies do not have incentive mechanism or the mechanism of selection through competition .
The consequence is that a large number of the employees treats theirs jobs as "iron rice bowl" , which means a job is secure .
There is no worry for being kicked out due to laziness .
In this way , the whole company corrupts and becomes obsolete .
hard workregisteredofIn conclusion , the factors that hamper the innovation of eneraising design come from both inside and ouside of the entrepreneurs in China .
From the inside , we need to change the criteria of leadership appointment and raise the awareness of protecting intellectual properties .
Similarly , from the outside , China has to create a competie environment and a legal system which helps innovation of engineering design prosper .
The development of technologies may be viewed differently .
Traditional analysis of technology has been looking at the past to analyze the present .
The social science system approach challenges the way we look at technology .
It suggests that acceptance of a new technology depends not only on the technical factors but also on the economic , political and social ones .
We have to understand the system as a whole and not look only at one aspect of the system to try to understand it .
In the past ,  solar energy was not readily accepted because of its technical challenges such as , weight of the integrated chip , expensive research , lack of technology know how , shortage of device as some devices had to be imported .
However , it is safer , cleaner and considered more environment friendly .
With the increase of oil prices , there are many technologies that have been created  to solve the climbing of black gold .
There is a need to look for alternative resources .
The discovery and the development of solar technology have become an agenda in most countries .
Governments have been encouraging and giving away incentives to companies to develop the alternative energy efficient products like solar technology .
However , when the oil prices drop , governments and companies slowly stop to pursue the alternative as they can continue their business with cheaper oil .
With cheaper oil , companies reduce research funding for innovation and development .
Economic challenges have moved the shift from solar technology to the cost of building it .
Companies have  been trying to get the market share by pricing their solar cell at an extremely low price .
In order to survive , another company cuts their price for the same technology product .
In the cut throat competition , less revenue is generated and less funding is chanelled to  research .
This will slow the development of solar technology and the innovation of it .
In contrast , if there is no competition within each other , large companies will monopolize the market .
They will suppress new technologies and only start  research and development on alternatives under government pressure .
In addition , some companies have created solar technology advancement on military weapons and are working greatly with the governments .
This technology are for military demand and do not bring any improvement to life .
Instead , it is used to destroy human and bring misery to certain people .
Socially , we have been conditioned to believe that the innovation is the inevitable product of market competition and engineering advancement , not a product of compromise and negotiation . 
Intertwined with the social issue of AIDS , the economical situation also hurdled the idea of using broadcast to educate people .
Different from other continents in the world , many people in Africa are still struggling for food , having no access whomelectricity .
In this case , engineers were challenged to design a special kind of radio that would not need to plug in sockets or batteries for electricity .
These special needs finally led to the innovative combination of a small transistor radio , an electric motor from a toy car and the clockwork mechanism from a music box to form the original prototype of the wind-up radio .
Because of the low cost , it was possible to collect enough funding for mass production which finally gave the African people free access a wind-up radioabout AIDthe ideahe cost controlling process of producing the wind-up radio was a great success .
Putting aside the original social objective andeconomicl constraints , designing the wind-up radiobroadcastinguired to solve severUnlikeethe situation in other continents  .
First , the charging up process should be stable enough to avoid damage to the components of the radio .
Second , the output current must be very stable and enduring for avoiding distortion of theto be pluggeds .
Last but not least , the charging-up process should be efficient .
Unless the charging-up process can be done within seconds , the annoying process of charging up would finally hinder users from frequent use .
preventingThrough the invention of wind-up radio , it is cleconomicn that engineering is not all about solving technical prthe solution ofDuring the process of conceiving and designing a new engineering product , it is very like that mapreventcial and economical factors would eventually become the shaping or determining force .
In Singapore , there are actually many issues to consider for an engineer in the engineering design processes for innovations .
The two issues I feel are the most important are  economic and technical challenges .
Economic challenges will affect the process of engineering design because we need to consider the financial status for the majority of the people .
The products being made must not be too expensive .
Otherwise , people will tend to think twice before they decide to purchase the products .
The economic downturn also prevents consumers from buying things that they think are not essential .
The manufacturing industry suffers the most from this recession .
Due to the financial constraint , consumers will go towards buying pirated products instead of purchasing the original .
This causes a decrease in demand for it .
They do not mind the products  not being able to perform as well as the original .
To them , it is worth it since it is cheaper .
Even if consumers do not go for pirated products , they will still go for second hand products .
This is because the products are still usable despite some minor wear and tear .
The budget given by the company may cause engineers to think of ways to cut down costs in the production so as to gain extra profits for the company .
As a result , the products may not last long enough and they have to be changed  quite regularly .
It must be useful to the majority of the consumers .
We must also cater to the needs of the different age groups .
It must also provide comfort and convenience to the people .
For example , hand phones , computers , mp3 and cameras have made communication between people in a distance easier simply just by a click or a press of the button .
Information and data can be transmitted easily by the use of the Internet .
This was definitely not possible in the past .
Engineers also need to consider whether the consumers will be able to accept the products being designed .
They also need to consider the commercialization of the products .
This is because the way of commercializing will affect the sales of it .
As a result , engineers will be forced to come up with the modification of the products in a short period of time .
This will cause the products to be less effective because there is a lack of testing .
Although the gadgets have included more functions , it is less durable .
For example , hand phones nowadays are prone to damage when it is accidentally dropped on the floor .
Firstly , in China , the designing and innovating processes are always hampered by some political factors .
And these factors always result in some management problems .
In China , nearly all the research institutes and universities are state-owned and controlled by the ruling communist party .
Therefore , it is difficult for academic institutes to escape from acting like a government department .
For instance , the head of research groups and the presidents of universities are all assigned by their superiors in the party .
So in the selectionprocess , the academic achievement of candidate is not the priority to be considered but their loyalty to the party .
Therefore , in some institutes , the head tends to know nothing or have little knowledge of the field which he is in charge of , which will certainly misguide the research directions and disturb the atmosphere of researching and studying .
Further , the rules of regulating institutes are mandated in a dogmatic and  way .
All the boffins are required to attain some academic targets per year .
For example , they need to apply and get a project of a certain amount of money per year , or a certain number of  essays they should publish in public scientific journals , and so on .
If they cannot meet the requirements , they will not get promoted or get enough salary they are supposed to get .
However , in such a short term , it seems  impossible to discover significant results .
Hence , many researchers have to 'make up' essays on their own  , or simply plagiarize other's works .
In addition , in most  institutes , the funds of science are given by seniority .
As for some young but creative engineers or scientists , it may be very hard for them to get financial support to carry on their own research , which will stifle their creativity and give them no place to fulfill their potentials .
Secondly , some social reasons also exert detrimental influence upon the designing and innovating process in China .
To start with , it seems to have become a consensus that China does little on the protection of intellectual properties and patents .
What is worse , in China , nearly all the people have formed a habit of buying pirated discs and illegally downloading from the Internet .
From a research by BSA , about 93% software used in china are pirated , which costs 3 .6billion dollars loss every year .
And according to Microsoft , about 29% of computers in China are illegally installed with windows system in 2008; especially 5% are computers for government use .
Moreover , the protection is also inadequate in terms of patents .
According to the statistical figures , about 30 percent of patents are illegally used without authorization .
But it is very hard for the victim to prosecute the infringers .
According to China's law , it will take about 3 years to finish the lawsuit; and it will consume more time and money to execute the verdict after they win the case , especially because most of trespassers , who are usually in small business or manufacturing their illegal products in a family workshop , it is even harder to trace and penalize them .
Lastly , the designing and the process of innovation are sometimes detrimentally affected by economic mode in China .
the High GDP index , the government sometimes only cares about how many investments they can attract from overseas and other places; And Most of the enterprises in China only focus on manufacturing , processing , and exporting goods .
What they need to do is just transferring the raw materials to finished goods .
So there is no need for them to invest a multitude of money to establish research and development groups to design or invent new technologies and sciences .
At the same time , they also assert that designs and innovations are not their business but  or other countries instead of China whose enterprises not only lack  funds but also core technology .
And now most of the enterprises are quite satisfied with this economic growth mode and think that it is not necessary to change the industrial structures .
So when some original designs and innovations come out in China , it is more likely for them to be ignored and discarded .
So in this way , the impetus for designing and processing innovations has been greatly encumbered .
The environment for research is bad in China is because at first , there is not enough capital given to do researches .
According to China Research Environment Report , Science Observation (2006 .
2) , the average funds for national researchers are less than 100 ,000 RMB (near 20 ,000 SGD) a year , to say nothing of other researchers .
Without enough capital , how can researchers buy the necessary equipments and do the necessary experiments to make science and engineering progresses !
Another fact is that the talent in China waste a lot of time doing things that irrelevant to research .
One significant phenomenon is that and graduate students in university call their tutors 'boss' , which is because instead of teaching them new knowledge or doing researches , tutors often ask students do tasks from companies to make money .
Furthermore , many administration jobs in universities and science institutes are done by scientists and engineers who are not good in administration in deed .
Because of the good treatment of administration jobs , a lot of talented scientists and engineers waste time competing to get them , leaving the research jobs behind .
To move the distractions , it needs to apply certain regulars to retain the talent in their positions and also , improve the treatment of research jobs .
termsregulationstermsAccording to an essay in Sina .com ({http://ne .sina .comfirstly07-06-20/111513271455 .shtml}[HYPERLINK: htresearchsina .com .cn/c/2007-06-20/111513271455 .shtml]) , China has sent 1060 ,000 students to study overseas but only 275 ,000 of them have come back and contribute to their motherland .
The rate of brain drain is near 70% .
It is astonishing .
As known to all , students who manage to get the chances of studying overseas are usually the top students .
They are the ones who ca ?
make great contribution to engineering design progresses and other kinds othat are irrelevant Losing these top students means losing engines that can promote the country to a new height .
To solve the problem , again we should cgood environment for study , research , work and living to researche talent overseas to come bato do .
I believe the current human need that should be given priority is the need to reduce traffic congestion as it has always been a problem left unresolved for many decades .
With the help of engineering design process , many of such problems that we face in this present world can be minimized and resolved .
Engineering design process flows through these stages of defining the problem , gathering information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and finally testing and implementing of the solution .
Firstly , on defining the problem of traffic congestion and also gathering vital information on this human need .
The problem of traffic congestion is constantly happening throughout the world everyday and it is affecting the way we carry out our daily routines .
This problem leads to the loss of precious time that could be put to good use and it also affects the progression of work and major projects .
With this loss of precious time , we often have to make use of extra time to make up for the time lost in traffic congestion .
Thus it will also create an impact in the financial losses and holding back economic growth throughout the world .
Secondly is the generating of multiple related solutions , analyzing and selecting of a suitable solution .
One of the solutions that I came up with is to have a signboard attached to all traffic lights; this will indicate to all the drivers whether they should avoid travelling on certain roads that may have traffic congestion .
Although there are radio stations to report on traffic congestion ,  some drivers may not tune in to radio stations or may not know of other alternative ways to redirect their paths .
This results in accumulating the length of traffic congestions as the number of cars keeps piling up after it occurs .
This solution of indication can prove to be very useful , when an accident or traffic congestion occurs .
The sign board will have the three arrows mainly representing , left , straight and right directions .
For example in an event of traffic congestion , the central transport system will be notified in the shortest possible time .
Signboards that are in the area of traffic congestion and other possible affected areas would be updated and give suggestions to the drivers to redirect them away from the traffic congestion .
This central transport system would also provide an update for the traffic police; so that they may go down to rectify the situation .
Lastly is the testing and implementing of the solution .
With this idea of the solution , I would build a 3D replica of this system to test on the effectiveness in reducing traffic congestion .
I would continue to improve on the design with more stringent tests and experiments which will give me the most suitable configuration for a specific area on the island .
As we advanced into dramatic change of technology , the world has made a breakthrough in science and achieved a milestone of success .
It is  that engineers are those who are playing a crucial role in the society while the world is expanding unremittingly .
This is because engineers are quintessential in designing products that meet human needs .
They utilize their knowledge to come up with new innovations which will give a fresh impetus to enhance the development .
In my opinion , current human need that should be given priority is having electric vehicles that operate entirely on battery power .
As we all know , petrol is a non renewable natural resource and hence changes of its price have a big influence on the world economy as all main transportations are using it as fuel .
Therefore , it is necessary to design vehicles that move by low cost electricity .
Electric vehicles can receive their power from a number of renewable sources that is transmitted into the vehicle through the use of electrical cable and stored in battery .
Through this , the dependence on  crude oil can be minimized gradually .
In addition , air pollution is worsening nowadays .
By using environment friendly electric vehicles , the pollution problem can be alleviated by decreasing the smog level .
Furthermore , electric vehicles typically have less{noise pollution}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Noise_pollution] .
According to Seyyed Khandani , Ph .D . , there are 5 steps for solving design problems so that the process meets the need .
Firstly , engineers must recognize the need and define the designing problems such as how far the driving range of a fully charged electric vehicle is and etcetera by gathering enough information , running experiments and performing computation .
After that , engineers should start gathering pertinent information to reveal  facts about the problem .
This step is quintessential as it makes sure that their efforts and time  are not wasted at the wrong place .
Then , engineers will use creativity to generate ideas that solve the problem by starting with existing solutions then trying to figure out and improve the weakness in those solutions .
Later on , engineers will combine their new ideas and tools into the existing solutions and finally unique solutions will be formed .
At this stage , engineers might have multiple solutions .
Hence , they have to analyzing their solutions and select the solution which is best suited for implementation .
The last step is to test and implement the solution that involves testing , construction and manufacturing of the solution to the design problem .
If the car passes all the tests , a new electric car is finally formed and will definitely meet the need .
Besides , engineers need to consider  the electric car's safety , cost and effects on the environment so that this engineering design meets the need .
For instance , ifthe electric car  design's cost is over budget , engineers might rather design combination electric-gasoline vehicles to cut down the cost .
In addition , safety of the car should be given priority in order for the design process to meet that need .
Thus , engineers have to confirm that the car is safe to be driven by running a few tests before the cars are supplied in the market place .
Engineers also have to run experiments on the emission from the electric carso as to make sure the car is  environment friendly .
To drive home the point , the engineering design processes will definitely meet that need if engineers persevere stoically whenever they meet failures during the process .
Engineers have a constant need to upgrade current technologies to keep up with the ever-evolving world .
Being a problem solver only means that they will constantly face a slew of problems that abound in the world .
Changes in the climate in recent times show that the Earth is embroiled in what is called global warming .
The need for more sophisticated technologies to reverse this damage caused to our environment has set engineers racing against the clock .
The war on terror never ceases as well .
The need for state-of-the-art weaponry and stealth vehicles has posed a tough problem to engineers as well .
However one human need that is most prevalent and disconcerting is widespread hunger .
The need for engineers to come up with food technologies that may fill the stomachs of hungry children is overwhelming .
Indeed , we have to solve this pressing problem before it becomes too late .
Starvation is a big issue around the world .
From Asia to Africa , Europe to America , it is ever present , though varying in severity .
Since this problem is so widespread , it is essential it be given priority over  others , the delay of which could lead to more human fatalities .
In Africa especially , where there is a higher percentage of the population that are malnourished , an engineering solution is needed .
In fact , this presents the world's inefficient use of resources .
Here , people in developed countries are gorging down heaps of food and getting obese while some in Africa are starving to death .
If we were able to close the food gap between them , maybe the problem could be improved .
One way in which engineering design processes can help alleviate hunger around the world is to increase food production .
Though the developed world has too much of it to the point of wastage , it is impossible to "transfer the leftovers" to the developing nations and it is ethically wrong to do so .
Thus , equipping the world with an abundance of food can help solve this issue .
Increasing food output starts at the plantations and fields .
Droughts due to erratic weather can cause disruptions in the food supply .
Therefore , maintaining good irrigation can ensure food supply remains consistent .
Dams are built to control the flow of river water .
This is one engineering marvel that prevents floods and helps generate energy in the process .
Complex irrigation networks are built so the crops are watered sufficiently .
Another way to increase food production is to engineer grains and seeds so they produce more within a shorter timeframe .
They are genetically modified with desirable qualities to meet the needs and conditions of the place they are grown .
Crops are more robust and can withstand harsher conditions like strong winds , while carrying more grains atop their stem .
By genetically engineering many of our foods , we can actually increase food yield from the same plot of land in a shorter amount of time .
However , Khandani mentions that the solution is not perfect and we should keep revising and "going back to the drawing board" .
Our solutions are not one off .
We need to constantly modify them even as they bring about more problems .
Global warming is an exceptionally severe problem facing the world today .
It is a process whereby the Earth's temperature increases , which is attributable to the use of fossil fuels , and industrial or agricultural processes .
Man-made emissions release a great amount  of carbon dioxide which causes a large buildup of "greenhouse gases" .
One factor which contributes to the buildup is from power plants or factories .
Another major factor will be the carbon dioxide emitted from cars .
Though it may only contribute a small percentage to the buildup in the gases ,  as time goes by , the increase in the utility of cars will become a big contributor to global warming .
Thus a group of students from NUS came up with an idea of creating an eco-friendly urban concept car with zero carbon emission .
This group consists of students from the School of Design and Environment and also the school of Engineering .
This car was built from scratch with its body designed and manufactured by the students themselves .
It runs on a hydrogen fuel cell that drives the electric wheel hub motor .
In this way , it will achieve twice the energy efficiency compared to the burning of gasoline in the internal-combustion engines .
In addition , with the design of the eco-car , mechanics will have easier access to the components for trouble-shooting .
With such attractive advantages installed in the eco-car , it might slowly be introduced to the society as a form of transport so as to solve the problem of global warming .
Because the eco-car runs on hydrogen gas , this will lead to the reduction in the usage of petroleum and thus save the natural resources for better usage .
However , there will also be disadvantages with regards to the creation of the eco-car .
Though the eco-car may seem to be the perfect solution to solve the problem of gasoline combustion cars , it will cause conflicts with many car manufacturers such as Toyota or Nissan .
With this invention , the governments will strongly recommend civilians to replace their current vehicle with the eco-car .
As a result , there will be a negative impact on the sales for the current car manufacturers .
When all of these happen , it will also affect the economy and also the jobs of the sales personnel .
Another disadvantage of the eco-car will be the resources that it uses .
Take gasoline combustion cars as an example; when it is running low of fuels , the driver can easily top up his vehicle at any petrol station nearby .
But as for the eco-car , the resources it uses may not be readily available , so it will not be very convenient .
Most of the products today are created using a conventionally generated technology but there are a few products which were invented in a skunkworks environment .
For example , the first laptop computer was produced in a skunkworks environment because Toshiba , a Japanese electronics company , had suffered huge losses with its failure in the desktop computers' market in the 1980s .
So , the company refused to invest in the research and development of the laptop computer (Rogers) .
Even though conventionally generated technology is more popular nowadays , both ways of production have their own advantages and disadvantages .
Both ways of production are similar in their motive .
The intention of the teams is to research and develop their product hoping to come up with a new invention  or make the existing products better .
For example , a research and development team with financial support from the company research on the company's product and try to improve the existing products and create new products for the company .
It is almost the same for the team working in skunkworks environment .
They believe that the products they are working on will be a success even though they are not supported by company .
However , there are differences between the two of them .
Firstly , they differ in financial aspect which is the main aspect .
Productions using conventionally generated technology have full financial support from the company .
With the financial support from the company , the research and development team can have a comfortable and productive workspace .
On the other hand , there are no or very little financial support for the team working in skunkworks environment .
Therefore , skunkworks environment usually is not comfortable to work in .
Besides what is mentioned  above , the team using conventionally generated technology can afford state of the art devices which will increase the efficiency of research .
In contrast , the team working in skunkworks environment not only do not have those devices , but they have to bring their own equipment to work .
The second difference between productions using a conventionally generated technology with those from skunkworks environment is the creativity of the team members .
The main problem of the team in skunkworks environment is the financial problem as mentioned earlier .
The lack of money causes them to consider other options when inventing a product .
For example , they might look for used items to be use as inputs for their production .
In contrast , the team with full financial support do not really need to consider the cost of research; therefore they most probably could not come up with products which are more cost efficient .
Finally , after comparing both  ways of production , we will realize that both also have their pros and cons but in my perspective , production in the skunkworks environment is better mainly because of the freedom in inventing new things .
Without the supervision and control from the sponsor company , team members are able to explore new ideas that might not be parallel to the company's main objective .
That is why there is a significant number of people who are willing to work in the skunkworks environment despite the problems they face .
This is because these people believe that their inventions will benefit mankind .
Helen Keller made her miraculous breakthrough as she spelled W-A-T-E-R when water ran over her hand .
The importance of water lies in the fact that  it comprises 70% of a person .
Without food , one can still live for a few days .
However , without water , life will be shortened to one day .
No doubt water is the basis of life on this planet .
In the Maslow's Hierarchy of needs , water , together with breathing , food , sex , sleep , homeostasis and excretion are the ground basic of human needs .
Therefore it should be given priority as a current human need .
Khandani , a professor of engineering in California has derived an engineering design processes model , which can be applied in meeting the need of countering water scarcity .
In the first stage , the problem of water scarcity is identified as a global issue .
Secondly , information pertaining to water scarcity should be gathered , including the severity of the problem on a global scale , limitations of current methodologies , underlying reasons and so on .
Next , engineers , scientists should get together to discuss how the problem can be solved , suggesting means of cutting down wastage , encouraging recycling , inventing industrial process with less water and so on .
By exchanging expertise , multiple solutions may be generated , for example , how some countries with limited water resource , like Singapore and Israel , manage to sustain the water supply .
After presentation of solutions , different institutions/government bodies may select one of the them and investigate on .
The last stage of the process will be the testing and implementation of the particular solution .
As for drinking water , it is crucial to ensure the safety of the public when a new technology is adopted .
However , in real life , a problem may not be solved as expected by implementing a standardized model .
For example , for an idea of water conservation to be developed further , scientists need the financial support from government/corporations .
Self-funded projects are usually carried out in skunkworks environment where researchers have to bear the consequence of failure .
Furthermore , the whole process in the model which Khandani has proposed may take many years to be completed , making self-funded projects less viable if there is still no support along the way .
Another kink in the process is the selection of solutions .
Corporate bodies tend to look for solutions with maximum profitable returns .
Government entities also need to justify themselves if they opt for more expensive solutions which may/may not generate returns .
For example , compared to the water transfer project from another location with more abundant water supply , distillation of sea water will be a more expensive solution though it has the potential of solving the problem in the long run .
Many things that surround us today make our lives a lot easier .
From kitchen appliances like refrigerator to home entertainment systems , these are things which we often take  for granted .
They also did not appear at our homes overnight like Christmas presents .
All the many inventions at our homes were developed by engineers over a long time .
It started from identifying the needs of people , followed by coming up with various solutions and then implementing them .
This is called Design Process  which engineers use to approach problems .
According to Khandani , there are five basic steps used in a design process .
This five basic steps can also be applied to problem solving .
The first step is to identify the problem , which usually involves the process of knowing what the customer wants and what problems they are encountering with existing products .
Secondly we need to gather more information , like previous failed attempts at solving similar problems , whether a need for a new solution is needed or not and the problem with existing solutions .
Lastly testing and implementation is done on the solution .
All the steps are important as safety , reliability and economic factors are included and may have a huge impact on many peoples' lives .
Currently , there are many engineers in our society  .
They solve solutions to needs of people , for example an army general wanting a better and a faster tank for his army .
But more priority should be given to things like health care .
In the past , people who wanted to see a doctor had to wait in long queues .
More often than not , those people who were waiting in the line were in urgent need of medical attention .
Time is often wasted in the administrative part of the process .
Nurses in a clinic had to flip through archives for a patient's information manually .
Therefore a more efficient way of allowing people to see doctors is needed .
Engineering process can be applied to meet the needs of people and solve the problem .
After the problem is being identified , more information needs to be gathered .
Khandani said that inexperienced designers will skip this step and proceed to finding solutions , but efforts spent in gathering information will pay out later in the design process .
Engineers found out that in clinics , human errors of the nurse is present , resulting in longer queues .
So solutions like computerizing all administrative work and the processing of patient's medication is being implemented .
In this way , human error is eliminated and people can see the doctor and get their medication in a faster way .
There are many problems than can be solved systemically using the five design process that Khandani mentioned .
Health care is only one of the many pressing needs for engineers to solve .
much useful feed back is needed in order for more problems to be identified .
the heartnumbersisinthreatendiseasesWhat is a heart pacemaker ?
Basically , it is a medical device which uses electrical impulses , delivered by electrodes contacting the heart muscles , to regulatebeating of the heart .
With the help of pacemaker , patients whose heart rate are too high or too low can maintain an adequate heart rate .
According to classification , Heart pacemaker belongs to ergonomics which is a study of how people interact with machines .
As an ergonomical design , the primary requirement is safety .
Because the heart pa pacemakershould be implanted into patient's body before it can work well , it asks for higher safety requirement .
The material used to make a pacemaker is silicon , titanium steel and special artificial plastic , both of them is quite friendly to patients' internal environment and will not cause injury or other diseases to humans .
What's more , nowadays , the heart pacemaker is quite small with thickness only 10mm and weight only 40 grams .
Such kind of little size ensures a low possibility of hurting the human organs .
All in all , proper material and suitable size make the pacemaker much safer to use .
The second important requirement of an ergonomical design is reliability .
An engineer should seriously consider that the pacemaker is used to save patient's life , if it suddenly breaks down , the patient will face the risk of losing lifethe patient'sor problem in reliability for the callst pacemaker is how to keep a stable power supply to the pacemaker and defibrillator .
Originally , the battery of the heart pacemaker is made uparef mercury-zinc whicthe patients' can only work for 2-3years .
Such short using age of the battery together with some other reasons leaded to a few cases of patients' death because of running out of energy in advance .
Nowadays , the engineers adopt lithium cell which has great advantage over the older one for it can last for 10 years and is much lighter .
The success of applying lithium battery into heart pacemaker brings a substantial increase in reliability .
the heart pacemaker the lithium batterya great advantage the lithium cell because of the battery running out leadlifespanLast but not least , the price of an ergonomical design should be reasonable .
Since the main purpose of heart pacemaker is to save people who have hthe patient'salife .
If it ce cannot be too high to afford .
Thanks to the advancemenlosing his lifenufacturing process and cheaper material , the price ($5000-$15000) of normal heart pacemakers is much more acceptable compared with that of those produced in early time .
Reasonablwasprice promotes the wider use of heart pacemaker around the world .
the heart pacemaker Overview , the coming out of the heart pacemaker makes a tremendous contribution to the patients who sufthe heart pacemaker art attack .
We have to say it is really a commendable achievement among all the engineering designs .
Let's expect the prospective heart pacemaker can be more convenience and more powerful features at lower price .
I'm sure it will be fantastic news for the whole human beings .
Technical innovations are essential to the development of a nation .
However , making innovations is not just as simple as thinking about new ideas and carrying them out , but something requiring complex engineering design processes .
According to Khandani , the process of solving design problems can be generalized to five steps: "define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , and test and implement the solution" .
In most cases , it is not easy to go through all these steps successfully due to the hindrances from various sources .
In this essay , I will talk about two problems which have been greatly hindering such engineering design processes in China .
One is the brain drain problem and the other is the capital problem .
Since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy in 1978 , countless promising students have gone abroad for further study .
China has spent a lot of resources to educate them and expects them to reward the society after further education .
Unfortunately , lots of these talents are unwilling to return to their motherland because of the much  superior conditions in developed countries , which causes the brain drain problem .
As we can see , the five steps of engineering design processes for innovations given above all involve qualified well-educated people .
Such a brain drain makes China fall into a severe shortage of talents who are necessary for the implementation of any stage of the process .
Since there are not enough people for engineering design processes , China is not capable of making enough innovations for higher living standards in a short time .
As a result , more educated people will go abroad , which aggravates the brain drain problem in turn and exerts a greater negative effect on the process .
Secondly , China is still struggling to meet its people's basic living needs as a developing country .
Every year China has to spend most of its revenue on fundamental infrastructure and national defense , etc .
Therefore , unlike US and developed European countries , not much capital can be spared for engineering design processes for innovations , which causes the capital problem .
As we all know , it is often costly to gather sufficient valuable information in this information age and carry out a new policy in today's materialistic society .
Thus in the course of engineering design , one usually needs much money for getting pertinent information and testing and implementing the solution .
Without enough useful information , people cannot come up with best solutions .
Even if they have made it , testing and implementing it is still impossible without sufficient capital .
Besides , when people are aware that not much capital is available , they may not choose the most efficient but more costly solution in the course of 'analyzing and selecting a solution' , which may bring about bad effects in the long run .
Therefore , the capital problem hampers engineering design processes to a very great extent .
Einstein once noted that"the god doesn't play dice ."
From his perspective , since every natural event happens as a result of a cause or collective causes , I am not sure if it is proper to refer to the discovery of LSD , short term of Lysergic acid diethylamide , as an accident .
At least it is not an intentional consequence like the discovery of risperidone , a medicine for mentally disordered people .
In the following paragraphs , I shall touch on the similarities and differences of their pharmaceutical effects , controllabilities and consuming groups .
Firstly , despite the fact that they focus on different aspects pharmaceutically , LSD and risperidone actually share some similarities on medical effects .
They both have strong corrective influence on mental disorder .
In 1993 , risperidone was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ,  for the treatment of schizophrenia , and bipolar disorder in 2007 .
Especially for pupils with age 13-18 , risperidone is the only approved drug agent in America .
On another hand , LSD was once widely used for treatments of mental disorder as well before  , which would be illustrated in the second paragraph .
However , LSD affects people in alcoholism in a positive way which is unachievable  for risperidone .
Secondly , the controllability of both the  short term and long term  effects of LSD and risperidone vary greatly .
Risperidone always gives a constant performance .
Beside its expected medical effects , the side-effects are also predictable .
The most common side effects include severe anxiety , akathisia , sedation , dysphoria , insomnia , sexual dysfunction , low blood pressure , muscle stiffness , muscle pain , tremors , increased salivation , and stuffy nose .
But for LSD , the physical and psychological effect vary greatly from one to the other , and is highly dependent on the amount of dosage , consumer's personality , mood , the surrounding environment and other variable factors .
Most importantly , the social issues arising from consumption of LSD are unexpected .
The typical physical effects are dilated pupils , higher body temperature , increased heart rate and blood pressure , sweating , loss of appetite , sleeplessness , dry mouth , and tremors .
Apart from physical and psychological effects , LSD also triggers intense spiritual experience which leads consumers to illusory images and feelings .
There is a great number of people who believe that LSD serve as a divine vehicle  which transports the consumers to the outer-space where the gods live .
There were several cases of suicide before the United States government banned LSD in 1966 .
Lastly , the consuming groups of LSD and risperidone consist of different people with different purpose , resulting in different social problems .
Normally , the consumers of risperidone are psychological patients who are seeking effective treatment .
However for LSD , it was mainly regarded as a means to get high by the American hippies .
Even the poets , painters and musicians tried to seek inspiration by consuming  LSD .
As a result , the consuming group of LSD is more complicated than that of risperidone .
According to the above , even though riperidone and LSD share some similarities in their pharmaceutical effects to a certain extent , they are different from each other in terms of controlability of side effects and their consuming groups .
we know , ligaments do not have the same ability of ration as bones .
It is almost impossible for ligaments to regrow if it has been raptured .
The classic method to solve the problem(ACL injury) is that remove a ligament from the patient itself such as patellar tendons .
But this method has some disadvantages .
First , it harms the healthy part of the patient , which means the patiehappens most oftengain at ainjureder place .
Second , it has been proved that this method could cause pains and patellar tendIt could even the human need , scientists are looking for the new method .
The new one iso use artificial lmatters .
ashownTo make the artificial ligament meet the need , scientists considered it in many aspects .
First , the artificial ligaments should they haveuse rerupturedreaction  .Second , it should be very strong  ,flexible and to abrasive  ,so that it can ensure thahimselfpatient can play sports in the normal level .
Third  ,it should have the ability to grow and combine with the reptured ligament .
After a few years research , an artificial one called LARS ligaments came out .
The LARS ligament is made of industrial strength polyester fibers .
The polyester fibers and the original design of the knit have been tested for rupture , stretching and wear .
The result has showed atat the LARS ligament is extremely resistant to flexion , traction , torsion , and resrupturedretching .
Also , the design has biocompatible properties to human beings tissues , because the intra-articular longitudinal fibers allow for tissue in growth .
Compared with the human ligaments , the LARS ligament is much more tensile .
Futhermore , if we use LARS ligaments in the reconstruction of cruciate ligament , the time of recovery can be reduce a lot .
The professional player who uses LARS ligaments can return to the courshown or 4 months after the surgery while the classic method will cost 6 to 12 months to recover .
This technology shows its advantages with the classic method .
And the invention of it gives the players and sports enthusiasts a better choice when they suffer the injury .
At the same reducedthere is also a pitfall about the artificial ligaments .
Because it appeared less than 20 years and we can not predict what could happen after 30 or 40 years , which artificial ligaments have been used for .
I think as it improves a lot in the future , it can take possession of the classic method finally .
Firstly , the demand for a convenient and cheap computer grew rapidly at the beginning of 1980s .
At that time , there were very few people owning a personal computer at home , as the price of a computer was much higher than what the workers could afford .
Most of the computers were offered by the compathe laptops office supplies .
Problems rose as the worthe twentieth centuryin the company to finish the work that cannot be done without a comfirstAs a result , the efficiency of work was lowered .
Meanwhile , the regular work time was affected negatively .
In order to solve these problems , a new kind of computer was in demand .
Under such condition , the idea of laptop had been inspired .
wasthe laptopconditionsSecondly , the man power that provides technological support plays an essential rule to the innovation of laptop .
The idea of designing laptop was first not approved by Toshiba  , while Mizoguchi , the chief designer of laptop did not give up .
He organized a group of talented engineers who were selected from the military projects witharoseong professional skills and knowledge and started the research secretly .
After 24 months of hard work and thousands of times of practice , the first laptop was born .
The support of technical stuff brought a successful step towards the final goal of promoting and producing laptops .
Lastly , but nomainhe least , the source of funding made the production and sales roleainops possible .
Thougthe laptopresearch team has made ta laptopa of laptop came true , the laptop woubutt be finally put into production wthe laptop a large amount of money .
To the disappointment , the plan of producing the laptops had again been rejected due to the small potential market estimated by the company .
A new obstacle was in the way of Mizoguchi's laptop plan .
Fortunately , the potential of this innovation drew the attention of Nishida , anstaffrt at marketing .
With his cooperation , the sales of laptop had been guaranteed and the production was finally executed .
Last but not least of laptop cannot be separated with the three main factors .
The demand of customers inspired the deshaders , the support othe laptopnical stuff put the idea into practice , and finally , the source of funding ensure the sales .
Withouttheiry of these three factors , the dream of owning a laptop will be still a dream now .

First of all , Edison and Percy made the two considerable discoveries in two completely different ways .
Edison achieved this unbelievable task by the lightbulb of various experiments .
To choose the suitable filament for the lightbulb , Edison tried more than 1600 kinds of materials with different heat-resisting .
The result showed that platinumthe microwave ovenmaterial to be used as filaments , which was not satisfying due to its hmanyce .
After many setdifferencesson decided to use carbon to make filament .
Nevertheless , Percy lighted on microwave energy by pure coincidence .
When he did somea microwave ovencusing on radar waves , the melt of a candy barthe lightbulbocket excite the surprise of him .
After deeper research , Percy concluded that microwave heating could raise the internal temperature of many foods far more rapidly than a conventional oven .
In addition , Edison did not 'invent' the lightbulb actually , while Percy is the first person who discover the microwave energy and invented microwave oven .
Indifferentst to conventional belief , Edison just improved upon an old idea which had been thought out 50 years ago .
Since he was interested inresistance appliance , he picked up this idea and made several improvements to it through various experiments .
After improving the vacuum inside the globe , he produced a long-lasting and reliable lithe filamentceOn the other hand , there chancedody who discovered the energy of microwave before Percy .
After he found out this big secret and went through careful trials , Percy desurprised into practical eventually .
Thus , he is definitely the inventor of microwave oven .

Both of the microwave ovenrkable inventions help us to lead a much better life now .
Because of lightbulb , the big world becomes brighter and more colorful .
Also , we can read , writapplianceslots of things in the night .
Lightbulb has brought us easier and more convenient life .
In the same manner , microwave oven has become one of the many modern conveniences nowadays .

The U .S .wouldmightwonEven till now , whether the invention of nuclear weapons for peace or war is still discussed all over the world .
We cannot deny that the two bombs dropped in Japan finally bthe famous equation ck to people in the world .
However , the catastrophe it caused to Japanese was really serious .
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were thoroughly destroyed and most residents were killed by the unimaginable power and heat from thsourceicould bring today , nuclear crisis in North Korea and Iran still againstreatens the stabilization of world .
If there was no E=mc2 or World War Two , nuclear weapons was for peace  be invented .
But everything also seems very natural and has its inevitability .
This is history .
Maybe for the nuclear technology itself , utilizing it to make weapons is unfair , but weforuthe Japanese that it is the social needs , or specifically the military demands , and government priorities at that time that decide the direction of this innovation .
Just like everythe nuclear crisis elebrate the "Victory in the Pacific Day" , there should be some others memorizing the nuclear weapons .
An example of such technology is the Global Positioning System (GPS) .
The technology consists of numerous satellites that orbit around the Earth that provide its users with various functions ranging from navigation to prediction of weather , thus , widely used in transportation industries .
The military also uses GPS in various methods from missile guidance to enemy tracking .
Besides that , the public has also benefited from this technology as it can be used for search and rescue purposes and also as a navigation aid .
Numerous factors have brought about the development of the GPS: mainly the government , military and public demands .
First , the government had a great part to play in the development of the GPS .
In 1983 , the U .S . President Ronald Reagan decided that the GPS will be made available for civilian use after the Soviet Union shot down a commercial airliner which had navigational difficulty , bringing about the death of more than 200 passengers .
Since then , the government realised that the GPS is the key to providing a dependable way of navigation and thus , pushed for its development .
Currently , the GPS is widely used in the aviation and maritime industry so that similar incidents can be prevented .
Next , the public demands have pushed the benefits of the GPS further when gadgets are integrated with GPS to provide constant relative motion and time coordination .
Using such products , users are capable of navigating in any part of the world .
As such , even the user's estimated time of arrival can be calculated .
Such products have saved lives when rescuers tracked the GPS signals from their gadgets to locate the victim's whereabouts , bringing the success rate of search and rescue mission to a higher level .
the Internetdeterminedthe laptopthe laptopthe laptophaveThe laptopsharedthe laptopIn the process of inventing a laptop , the design team was lack of human resoresearchoney .
At first , the idea of designing laptop was disappthe microscopehe Toshiba Company , which at that time has just suffered fmattere loss in the businesresearchnal computers .
(Rogers , 2003)Corporate leaders of the company then were no longer interested in computer-related businesses and thus refused to provide fund and experts to the designing team .
Although the team survived due to the insistence of Mizogushi and finally came up with the first laptop in the world , lack of resources has had an impact on the design team , which made the team 'stressful' (Rogthe laptop003) in the designing process .
hadAfter the laptop was invented , it was forbidden to be soldlacking inan since the company was not optimistic about the market of its new product .
(Rogers , 2003)Thus , the designers decided to prehadt their production ia huge lossfirst , where they had a great success .
After that , laptops were introduced to all parts of the world and had brought convenience to people .
Alexander Fleming was a British bacteriologist (also a pharmacologist) who served as a captain in an army medical corps during World War I .
He had been searching for antibiotic substances that can attack a variety of bacteria since his graduatiomanyhe served in the army , he noticed that a lot of soldiers died from simple infections caused by small wounds .
In fact , at that time doctors had no cure for infections .
Every day hospitals were filled with patients who only got infections from a small cut or a scratch and more seriously those who were contracted with pneumonia or tuberculosis .
However , doctors and nurses could do little to save their life .
Fleming spared no efpharmacology is perhaps  experiments and fieldch in this area , hoping that he could find a cure for such simple but lethal infections .
In September 1928 , having returned from his vacation , Fleming continued with the work in his lab immediately .
Before leaving for the holiday , he stacked a pile of staphylococcus cultures in the lab .
After he came back , he began to sort through the dishes containing those cultures in the sinkmany surprise he suddenly found that there was a dot on one culture around which the colonies of the bacteria were damaged , while those colonies further away were normal .
It was a mould growing there , which was supposed to happen because Fleming's lab wcontracted .ever , the major difference was that the bacteria he had been growing on those dishes were staphylococci , which can cause infections in human body .
With a sharp scientifically trained mind , Fleming realized that there must be something inside the fungus or released by it killing the bacteria around it .
He examined the mould and identified that it belongs to the penicillium family .
The mould released some kind of "mould juice" that can stop the bacteria's growth .
After several months he named the substance Penicillin .
Following some subsequent investigations , he published his findings in a medical journal , with prediction of this new substance's potential use in medication .
It is quite interesting that penicillin was once discovered by a scientist cultivateusly .
However , what would have happened if Fleming had never been concerned about the search for the cure or he had had no interest in this area at all ?
What would have happened if Fleming had ignored the contamination and just dropped it into the cleaning mixture ?
The whole world would have waited for more decades to see the discovery of penicillin .
It is just because Flmanys intriguedliveshis research that he could notice the mould contamination on the bacteria culture and stretch out further reflection on it , while others couldn't .
Hard work finally pays off .
Serendipity only favours those with high aspirations and determination who whole-heartedly dedicated themselves to their beloved career .
benefit themselvesalways tend bearnot-so-high anhaveWorse stilldecrease in numberlacking innot dareAll in all , it is the low level of technological base and the lack of excellent researchersstableificantly hamper the whole process for innovation .
To improve the present situation , it is better for the companies to pump in more money to the process and attract more talents to contribute to the technology progress .
Additionally , companies should import the advanced ideas and skills from the developed world to improve the world , since l skill of themselves .
Only in this way can we expect a better environment for innovation and more significant scientific and technological progress .
Source refers to human capital and financial support .
Actually , decentralization of human capital and delayed financial support hamper the stage of research and development to a quite large extent .
Compared to other deveinping countries , China does not have a standard innovation centre where a lot of talented scientists and engineers can discuss and develop a creative project .
Take Silicon Valley as an example , a lotresources technological products are developed and promising companies are founded there every year , which is a result of the cooperation of many talents .
But China does not have such a base for technology development .
Chinese talents are spreading all over the world .
How to call up them and work out some big projects is a tough task for our government .
Lack of financial support is another problem faced by some existing research departments .
Every year , China raises a large quantity of money to support technology development .
However , if the financial support is divided into small parts , these departments will not get enough money to do a large scale research .
What's more , some research projects must wait several months for financial support , during which time scientists may lose heart and give up .
As a result , research and development , which are the first steps of innovation , becomes more and more difficult .
China should try hard to solve the problem of source .
resourcebecomeFurthermorereceiveResourcer problem is the lagging of technology transfer , which is a headache for a lot of research departments .
As we all know , technology was born to meet human's needs .
Therefoquite a large ing technology into human lives is significant for an innovation .
Some new technologies may be born as wmanyie in laboratories as a result of lagging of technology transfer .
Take computer as an example: it is saidexample .eManyment speed of the computer is quite fast .
Maybe it takes about a few years to generate a new generation .
But can most of us change our computers every few years ?
Impossible !
What's more , as China does not have a system to link these new techniques with manufacturing depacall them backhink most manufacturing factories cannot make full use of these innovations .
Therefore , we'd better to build a sound system to do the technology transfer .
buildwe hadBesidesAs far as I am concerned , the two problems are crucial as one refers to the beginning of innovation and the other determines the destiny of this innovation .
I think there are some ways to solve these problems .
Firstly , we'd better develop some technical centre to bring talents together and do research .
Secondly , we must develop a comlagyinem for technology transformation .
If we can overcome these problem , I believe the design process of innovation in China Perhapsdevelop farther more .
First comes the improper education model in China .
Chinese students are very diligent , but sometimes they focus too much on theory knowledge and the exams , while overlook the importance of cultivating their own innovative ability .
Many engineering students only care about passing exams , believing passing exam is everything .
So when they become engineers , what they can do is only follow others' steps and cannot put forward new ideastosides the cognition problem , some universities do not pay much attention on students' hands-on abilities .
Experiment classes , which aim to help students develop their applying and innovative ability , are often deleted from the schedule or are conducted without experimental materials .
For technologies , experiencing personally is the best way to learn .
Being taught in this way , many students can analyze theoretical questions deeply but can do nothing about practical problems .
What's more , we know it is hard for a person to come up with new ideas continuously but this process becomes much easier when several people exchange their thoughts about this issue .
This is the function of communication .
But teamwork sometimes is also overlooked .
There is no project , no lab report , no design assignments , how can students learn to work with others ?
Hence , some engineers cannot communicate , do not know how to allocate workload; do not know how to deal with difficulties and conflicts .
This greatly increases the difficulties to be innovative .
workload , and they dothey docommunicate;If there is no projectAnother hamper is the unsatisfying society conditions for engineers to carry out their knowledge and thoughts .
When I compartheoreticalometown university engineering goverlooking with their peers in NUS , I find those from NUS have more opportunities to have internships in institutes , to do experiments in team , to communicate with researchers and professors .
This is the problem of experimental condition .
Aparand they cannot s , China does not attach as much attention on technology innovations as many othgivecountries .
For etomple , in Singapore , there are many awards for engineers in various engineering fields while applicatione only a few which are quite hard to achieve .
Some engineers cannot do experiments only because they cannot get entechnologyThpersonal experiencenancial condition .
Besides the above two problems , lack of communication in engineering society also discourage the innovative ideas to come out .
There aFurthermore conferences on engineering topics which can let engineers and scientists to exchange ideas and learn from each other .
This is the problem of communication condition .
allowthe generation of innovative ideasdiscouragesAfter alobstacleabove , wunsatisfactoryesocialer model and the unsatisfyingdeveloponditions really act as obstacles to innovative engineering designs .
This may be a reason that China's technology is still behind many countries in certain fields .
However , we must also see things are changing .
As Chinteams carrying out education reform in a large scale and putting more emphasis on technology innovations , we can predict China's techngivehas a good perspecttoe .
Consumeolden desire for convenient usage mainly consists ofmplicity of camera functions and the accessibility of photo sharing .
these requests stimulate the DC tandddeveloppment in respective ways .
Since most non-specialists don't possess sufficient photography knowlhave witnessedean aoping user-friendly functions is ess .
Theial to enable these people to take ghotos .
Relevant innovations include ththe nonace detection technology by Sony Company , which was developed in response to the increasing popularity of portrait taking (Cheung , K . M . , 2007) .
Other tecof the cameranologies like the anti-blink function and the Smile the Dhutter function which automatically capture the best facial expressions are also developed in the need for simpler photo taking (Sony Unveils World's First Wi-Fi Digital Camera with Web Browser , 2009) .
Photo sharing ability is another feature consumers value .
In the past , photos could only be printed on paper , which confined the sharing of photos .
However , modern DC technology effectively solves this problem by involving web access .
Users can upload photos to the Internet and share the photos with more people .
A case in point is the development of Wi-Fi cameras .
With a web browser installed , this camera can get access to any hotspot , allowing users to upload their photos immediately after shooting (Sony Unveils World's First Wi-Fi Digital Camera with Web Browser , 2009) .
installed within it , as in the case of ontos ,n ,Another development ththe ct improves thee of the cameracincludeis the portability .
This is achieved by reducing the size of a DC .
The technology of compact DC has made this development particularly proare generally less than 20mm thick , with a weight of approximately 150 grams .
Thus , they can be put in pockets and easily carried .
The improvement in portability also reoI people's ilikeng demand for easy casual shootings .
Consumers' pursuit of better phodo quality also drives the innovation advanced DC technology .
The quality of a photo is mainly determined by the resolution of a camera .
To improve resolution , a company needs to conduct a considerable amount of research , including generation of new ideas , technology breakthroughs and reinsidetitive experiments .
carried aroundcess is hard , but companies are shas also resulted to sacrifice their time and labor for the development , since the better the resolution , the more customers will be attracted , and the more profit the companies will make .
Original digital cameras had a very low resolution .
For example , the first commercial DC , Dycam Model 1 , provided only 90 ,000 pixels (Kamps , 2008) .
After half a decade , the number changed to 1 ,000 ,000 .
The most advanced DCs today support more than 12 million pixels , which is over 100 times that of the original ones .
Such remarkable improvement shows the strong impact of consumers' requirement on pushing forward the DC technology .
in .
This is becauseThe innovation and development of DC technohas also drivenaped by the need of the market .
Consumers' desire for better photo-taking experience stimulates companies to develop their technology and provide better products to compete for customers .

the mobileFirst the telephonehe post-war economic recovery demanded a better way of communication in ordethe  expand the network of free trade between different countries .
The need of communicatithe mobilealways vital , especially for business .
In 1946 soviet engineers Sha , whichand Zaharchenko CITATION Spe90 \l 2052 (Special History Ihe first radio telephone which was equipped inside a car and could connect to local telephone network within the range of 20 kilometers .
Besides , as water transportation was developed rapidly during that period , radiotelephony service was introduced to harbor and coastal vessels CITATION Spe90 \l 2052 (Special History the masse , 1990)elephony was the only way to cadvancementto telephone service when people were mobile .
Hence , the demands to achievetechnology forward in the early days .
forSecondly , the development of mobile telecommunication was inspired by achievements in other fields .
Donald H . Ring came up with tamong of e ,ellular network in 1947 CITATION Tom07 \l 2052 (Farley , 2007) .
However , the idea was not applied to mobile phones because of the lack that time .
With the advance in computing technology in 1980s , a cellular network on mobile phones called Groupe Special Mobile was developed and this made mobile communication start to boom CITATION Tom07 \l 2052 (Farley , 2007) .
Similarly , the development of necessary technologies such as semi-conductors , transistors ans also contributed to the development of mobile telecommunications .
Therefore , progress in othe telephoneds can promote the innovations of mobile technology .
Last but not the least , the increasing number of mobile users requires digitized mobile phones with special features .
After the born of GSM , mobile phones started tousers .
Unlike the business usage , private users demand a user-friendly environment to communicate with friends and family as well as some additional entertainment features .
Such demands by the public encouraged mobile developers to create new functions for cell phones such as delivering ring tones , ATION Wei05 \l 2052 (Wei , 2005) .
Besides , mobile phones became digitized at the beginning of this century , which brought a revolutionhave alsomobile telecommunication .
Mobile phone today is no longer a phone that was mobile; it can be a MP3 player , a game player and eventhe ma personal computer .
Thus , consumers' demands motivate the development of mobile telecommunication in the digital age .
anisinon ay ,Within the context of a society , mobile telecommunicate was shaped by economic factors , other inventions and consumers' demands .birth as GSM eading technology , mobile telecommunication will continue to bfit both individuals and organizations in the future .
The technology of nanorobotics (nanobots) is a modern invention that deals with the making of robots at  atomic level .
The development of nanobots came from the advancement in nanotechnology , and the idea of nanotechnology was proposed by physicist Richard Feynman in a speech in 1959 .
Nanobots are programmed to do specific tasks , and they are small enough to enter a human body .
These tasks are increasingly needed to improve the level of technology in medical treatments today .
Research in nanobots is intensively carried out in this area .
Hence , development in the technology of nanobots today is largely shaped by the demands of patients with illnesses that require better treatments .
Another important factor that is changing the landscape of nanobots is economy .
Our economy is greatly dependent on energy and raw materials .
Nanobots would be helpful in making materials that are efficient in storing energy and converting energy sources .
There are many benefits in developing nanobots .
They can be used to create a system that is affordable , fast , and compact .
Nanotechnology has ventured even further recently .
It is described as a new and important way of solving the problem of storage system and energy crisis .
According to an article , $20 million was granted to Stanford - one of 46 Energy Frontier Research Centres - to help the engineers to find energy  at the nano-scale .
In Conclusion , the technology of nanobots is a modern innovation that allows human to process tasks that are beyond what our beareye can see .
This technology is largely applied in the field of medical treatment today .
With  continuous development , nanobots would improve the lives of millions in the near future .
In Singapore , there are many creative ideas to solve the problems that are encountered in daily lives .
However , only limited number of the creative ideas have successfully completed their engineering design processes and hence launched in the market .
A large number of the creative ideas have failed in their engineering design processes because there are some problems in Singapore which may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
The main problem , however , is time constraint and this problem can be seen to significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations in companies , such as Creative Technology .
In Creative Technology , time constraint has significantly hampered its engineering design processes for innovations .
This time constraint is caused by competition from other companies which sell similar products and they may also be in the midst of designing similar new products as Creative Technology .
Therefore , Creative Technology has to work against time to complete its engineering design processes for innovations so that it can launch its new products earlier than the other competitors and hence , earn the rights to claim that the innovations belong to it .
Mr Sim Wong Hoo , chairman and CEO of Creative Technology , commented that being awarded the ZEN Patent to Creative Technology had helped it to protect its invention  in portable media players .
He then further commented that in order to be awarded the ZEN Patent , it had taken a major investment of time and effort by a group of its research and development engineers (Creative Technology , 2005) .
It can be seen that because of time constraint , the research and development engineers from Creative Technology had to sacrifice most of their time just to focus on the engineering design processes for their new product , ZEN , so that it can be completed as soon as possible .
Furthermore , because of time constraints , certain processes in the engineering design processes may be compromised  .
Therefore , time constraint is the main problem that may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
Another problem is that the designing process must  keep up with the rapid developments in technology , for otherwise by the time it is completed , it may already been rendered as obsolete .
According to St . James Press (2004)   , Creative Technology began manufacturing its own CD-ROM drives when it could not keep up with the rapid developments in drive technology; however , it was forced to abandon the effort , dumping its inventory and taking a loss of more than $30 million in 1995 .
From here , we can see that the Engineering design processes must be constantly  updated , for otherwise more problems may occur  that may significantly hamper engineering design process for innovations .
In conclusion , the two problems discussed   may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
That is the reason why it is never simple to have many innovations in Singapore .
However ,  there are many people who overcame the difficulties and successfully completed the engineering design processes for innovations , and I hope more people can learn from their experiences .
Since the 1970s , communication technology has made great advances , offering capabilities that are unthinkable a decade earlier .
The last decade of the 20th century saw a flood of new communication technologies entering the marketfor both the office  and home , according to the Central Statistical office .
This is the result of a better  understanding of people's needs and what technology they really want to use .
One of such technology is the mobile phone .
In the past , communication was slow and unreliable  .
In  most  cases ,  information would not even reach the desired destination .
As a result , people wanted a form of communication that was fast and reliable .
This  changed dramatically with the introduction of the telephone .
Firstly , it took away the necessity of having acommunication medium  , which made it more reliable .
Secondly , the telephone used electricity , which was literally accessible to every household and this helped messages to be passed around more quickly .
However , this was still not enough .
People then saw the need to be able to communicate on the go .
The society wanted to be able to communicate at anywhere and anytime and with anyone it wished .
This resulted in the invention of wireless telephony , commonly referred to as the mobile phone .
The introduction of the mobile phone allowed people  the ability to pass messages to one another quickly and accurately whenever they wished .
This meant that office workers were able to speed up communication and circulate information faster to allow new ideas to be spread quickly .
Being able to do this would  benefit the company and  have a positive impact on the economy .
Furthermore , even the military has benefited from this wireless telephony .
Through the use of wireless communication , soldiers were able to communicate with one another swiftly and with 100% accuracy when information was being passed around .
Due to the convenience of having a mobile phone , the number of mobile phone users has increased drastically over the years .
By 2002 , Japan had 55 million mobile phone users (out of 122 million) , China had over 200 million mobile phone users (out of 1 .3 billion) and about 90% of Finland's population had a mobile phone , according to the BBC in 2003 .
The mobile phone underwent further developments to enhance its features to suit its consumers .
As a result , by 2003 , the mobile phone was presented as more than just a tool for calling someone .
By integrating a variety of functions in a single handset , the mobile phone became a multimedia information processor fitted with an array of conveniences .
In 2003 , Nokia had a vision that the mobile phone will become a life management tool for business , work and leisure .
It will also take on the roles of  being digital navigator and a lifestyle accessory that will help individuals control and enrich their lives (Nokia , 2002) .
Looking back at the evolution of communication , the mobile phone is one that has been shaped by social factors .
Constant demands from the society caused mobile phone companies to continue developing newer phones that would satisfy their consumers and allow them to bridge space and time to such an extent that people can communicate more efficiently .
Recently , there was an outbreak of a pandemic flu that started in Mexico and  spread rampantly around the world  , instilling  fear in people .
This flu virus is known as H1N1 or the swine flu .
Experts  estimate that more than 2 billion people worldwide will contact the flu (Scheirer Micheal and Harrell Eben .
2009) .
As such , the health ministers of various countries are very concerned .
Thus , this leads to the development of the vaccine for H1N1  .
Besides the governments ,  H1N1 patients and the general public are also very concerned with the development of the vaccine for H1N1 .
The health ministers of various countries have shaped the development of the new vaccine .
The virus is very contagious  , and thus this leads to its spread in  society .
There is a large demand for the vaccine by  various government bodies .
This could be seen  when for the governments of France , Belgium and Finland intended to purchase 50 million , 12 .6 million and 5 .3 million doses respectively (Cormac Sheridan , 2009) .
Another reason the government bodies to be concerned with the development of the new vaccine is the fear of mutation .
As  many more are going to contract the diseases , there is a higher  chance that the virus will mutate into a stronger strain .
The health ministers around the world are  developing  a vaccine  for the virus before it spreads too widely or mutates .
The public and the H1N1 patients are the other groups that shaped the development of the vaccine for the H1N1 virus .
Although figures from the WHO (World Health Organisation) have shown that out of the 160 ,000 cases only 1 .200 cases are fatal , people continued to be in fear .
This is due to a previous outbreak of another flu virus which has taken many lives .
Due to  fear  , there is a high demand for the vaccine , and as a result the pharmaceutical companies are given plenty of  business opportunitties .
Thus they became very concerned with the development of the vaccine .
Besides the large demand , any new development would also bring about a rise in the  pharmaceutical companies' share prices .
For example , on April 30 2009 , when Lipoxenpharmaceutical company announced the positive preclinical results for  an enhanced influenza vaccineand added that the technology should also work against the new swine flu strain , Lipoxen's share price went up from  6 .62 ($10 .11) to  21 .75 ($33 .23) (Brady Huggett , 2009) .
Health ministries of the world  , patients  , as well as the public have shaped the development of the H1N1 vaccine in various ways .
The government needed the vaccine to help control the spread of H1N1 and also  to cure the disease before it mutates into a more deadly virus .
As for the patients and the public  , their concern is that they need the vaccine  . 
The first factor which accelerated the development of the camera phone is the great usingket demand .
Before the camera photransfer the imagesout , the digital  camera phone is a comeshave changedof the sincethe videophone which  , and when compareditoes and save the picture in digital form freely at anywhere and anytime as a digital camera and transfer tthe cameratures or videos to others as a videt that time , digital camera and videophone have already become a  peoplght really want a tool which can let people take pictures freely and transfer them wirelessly .
This kind of need of the combination of two technologies eventually bring out the camera phone .
Thus , at 2000 , Sharp launch the world first camera phone J-SH04 which has a 110 ,000-pixel CMOS image sensor for taking digital photos .
("Sharp history 2000: mobile phone share increased" , 2003) .
This innovation make sharp achieve a great success .
Just 2 years later , Sharp announced that they had sold more than 5 million camera phones , and they had 12 .5 million subscribers (Long , 2005) .
We can easily see that the great sales ensured the development of this technology .
More and more companies began to realize this great market demand and start researching in camera phones .
onstartedhave begunhave ensuredAfter integratingthatimage sensor into the mobile phone , the quality of tes taken by the cmera phones which onlyappeared in the marketndreds of thousands of pixel sensor cannot satisfy the need of the consumers .
The pictures taken by the camera phone are very blurred at that time .

Since the introduction of Iphone on June 29 2007 , it has become the best- selling smart phone in the world1 .
After a series of hardware and software development , we can now enjoy the latest 3GS Iphone with a lot of improvementsthat include Internet , 3G , music , video and photos .
In the Iphone's development process , we cannot deny that the user's demands for new functions  have a great influence in changing the Iphone .
First of all , users' demand for the Iphone  , which has more features and utilities to combine everything in a phone , forces Apple to continue developing Iphone .
Compared to the 1st generation of Iphone , the latest one (3GS) is very different .
Initially , the Iphone  only supported the EDGE network , 802 .11b wireless standard , and 4GB internal storage .
Now the Iphone 3GS supports 3G network , video call , 802 .11n wireless standard , and up to 32GB internal storage .
Moreover , in order to fully control the Iphone , users want to have more applications to fulfill their needs .
To satisfy users' demand for new applications , themes , software and utilities ,  Apple finally released the Iphone SDK on March 6 2008 (Apple , 2008) .
The Iphone SDK provides a platform in which the programmer can build and develop software  , from the simple to the very complicated .
In other words , Apple had given away their private tools to build an application in order to develop their products .
The second factor that affects the Iphone is the user's budget during the economic crisis .
During the crisis , the sale of the smart phone in general decreases because people do not want to spend money on unnecessary things .
Worldwide sales of hi-tech "smartphones" grew at their slowest pace  in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the financial crisis hit demand , according to a research firm2 .
There is no way for Apple to encourage people to buy their products except to make them more valuable .
In 2009 summer , Apple introduces the new version of Iphone , the 3GS , at the same price as the older version .
The new one has higher core speed and bigger RAM , which allows the Iphone to run faster  , and it can even display a high definition movie .
Apple also reduces the price of the 3G version to make it  affordable to more users .
The result is "California-based Apple was the third-biggest player with iPhone sales of 11 .42 million units , more than triple the 3 .3 million sold when it launched the device in 2007 " (citation) .
Therefore ,   the user's demand for advanced technology has contributed to the development of the Iphone through several years .
the Iphone  can serve many functions , such as  entertainment and  video conference .
Although the Iphone is the best smart phone in the market at the moment ,  it  have to be developed further and be offered at a lower price to satisfy the customers .
Both the military and civil demand for precise navigation promote the development of the Global Positioning System
Nowadays , almost everybody knows about GPS (Global Positioning System)  , and it has made a significant difference in our daily lives  ,  from guiding family hiking to airline navigation .
However , a lot of people may  not know that it is  a seemingly  new and advanced technology that has already  existed for more than forty years (Lowry , 2006) .
It is the military and civil demand for precise navigation that stimulates the development of the GPS technology  to what  it is today .
After the WW (full name) . , the US military realized the weakness of navigating by the stars and the radio signals and started to seek for a more precise positioning system to guide their fighters and warships globally (Lowry , 2006) .
In the late nineteen fifties , the scientists in USA realized the possibility of accurate positioning by satellites and finally in 1960 , a satellite navigation system called "Transit" was tested in the USA navy  .
This is to meet its intense requirement for precise navigation to avoid unnecessary shipwreck .
Since then , in order to grasp the information of the precise positions of its armed forces all over the world , the United States Department of Defense allotted millions of dollars in the GPS R&D  , which eventually resulted in a complete Global Positioning System with the operation of two dozen of polar orbiting satellites (Yogendra , 2002)
Besides  military demand ,  public appeal for a safe civil navigation has also promoted the development of the GPS .
In 1983 , a US civilian airliner KAL 007 was shot down by the Soviet Union Air Force by mistake when it lost its way and flew into the airspace of the Soviet Union without authorization .
Thus ,  the US civilians  blamed the government for its ignorance in the safety of civil navigation .
In order to calm the masses and avoid such disasters in future , the then president Ronald Regan promised to apply GPS to civilian users as well as military once it was completed (Lawry , 2006) . . And due to the immense pressure of the public , the US government turned off the SA (Selective Available) in May 2000 .
This leads the the GPS to develop from a critically military supplied technology to a  system for both civilian and military use(Gibbon Media& Research LLC , 2007)
The idea of GPS is first put forward in the nineteen forties .
Since then , both the military and the public have demanded for precise navigation  , which promoted  the further development of GPS and make it into what we see today -a precise dual-use global positioning system for both the civilians and the military forces .
Technology is the practical application of knowledge  , especially in a specific area .
Many technologies were developed via research or the interplay between scientific investigations and practical problems while some were serendipitously invented(Rogers ,2003) .
This essay will compare and contrast the discovery of penicillin and the development of embryonic stem cells  , in terms of impetus of the invention , involvement of the researchers in the innovation development and the of the inventions on society .
The impetus of these technologies  comes from the needs of society .
The embryonic stem cells technologyhas developed rapidly during  a short period because  society needs a new way of  transplantation .
Similarly , because the society needed a new medicine to treat some diseases like pneumonia , penicillin was discovered .
But there are significant differences between these two technologies .
The discovery of penicillin is by accident and after a long time , it was  used as medicine .
The impetus of these technologies is society needs  .
Obviously , almost all the researchers involved are scientists and engineers and that is the similarities between these two technologies .
However , there are slight differences between these two technologies in terms of researchers involved .
For  technology that is developed via research , like the stem cells  , it tends to involve a large group of researchers and even researchers from different countries .
However , for the serendipitous discovery , it seems to involve a smaller group of people , and sometimes only individual .
Researchers involved in these two kinds of technologies are almost the same  , with slight differences between them .
Last but not least , their effects on  society also have similarities and differences .
Both promote social development  .
If doctors use organs which are obtained by stem cells , many technical problems can be solved , like rejection reaction and organ shortage  .
Similarly , after penicillin was widely used by doctors , millions of people were saved by it .
The differences lie in the length of time taken for it to be widely used by  majority of people .
Technology developed via research will take  a shorter time to be accepted by the majority of the people  , while technology developed via serendipitous discovery may be rejected by people  . 
There are similarities and differences between technologies developed via research and  serendipitous discovery  .
In  future , more and more useful technologies will be developed and they can give us a lot of benefits .
Invention !
The mere word stirs the blood and quickens the pulse .
Inventions are exciting and very thrilling .
Invention is the process of creating something new which is useful to the society in one way or another .
The world has become much  richer and more complete with inventions or innovations .
Comprehending the problems would encourage one to come up with new ideas to find a solution .
Putting these ideas into actions and facing obstacles that come along the way leads to technological innovation .
During this process , technological innovation is affected by economical and social factors which  shaped the innovation .
One of the many innovations that help to make our lives convenient is "Refrigeration" .
This is a technology that is shaped by a society in the past which was desperate to preserve its food .
They used blocks of ice as cooling aids to preserve their food .
Ice from mountains or snowy areas were transported to warmer regions where they were wrapped in cloth and placed in cellas .
The ice box was made  of a metal linked box insulated with cork or snow dust with one compartment to put the ice and another to store the perishables .
However , this system was not very efficient and was inadequate .
The civil war in the US interrupted the ice trade .
Successive warm winter for a period of time created severe ice shortages leading to an unprecedented demand for new methods .
The desperate need for a way to preserve food as well as the idea of cooling to prevent the food from spoiling helped to shape the technological innovation of refrigeration .
The idea of refrigeration is built based on the principle that when  liquid changes to  gas , it absorbs heat as it expands in a self contained cycle , and  air or other fluid surrounding the device can be reduced in temperature .
Using this principle ,  the gas refrigerator and the electric refrigerator were built  .
Gas refrigerators use ammonia or the compression refrigerant  .
The gas refrigerator did not comprise  any moving parts and therefore it would not  break down easily .
Electric refrigerators use an electric motor to pump the coolant or the refrigerant around the enclosed system .
Unlike  gas refrigerators ,  electric refrigerators are noisy and a disruption in the supply of electricity would mean that the refrigerator would stop working . 
When  gas refrigerations develop a leak , the gas releasedis irritating and slightly corrosive .
Since the gases used in a gas refrigerators are usually poisonous and flammable , people are not very comfortable with having  such gases in their houses  .
Therefore ,  safety concerns outweigh the advantages of gas refrigerators and make the situation favourable for electric refrigators .
Economic factors have also contributed to the success of manufacturing the electric refrigerators .
Since  greater economic profits could be gained from electric refrigerators as compared to gas refrigerators , large firms started to invest huge amount of research ad development (R&D) funding into producing the electric refrigerators  , as well  as to promote it aggressively .
Therefore , small firms producing gas refrigerators could not compete with the strong competition  .
With insufficient resources for R & D , further developments of the refrigerator were not possible and it was also difficult to keep the prices of gas refrigerators competitive  .
The gas refrigerators were forced to go out of sales and the sales of electric refrigerator continued to boom .
Therefore , economic profit gained from the product would also affect  technological innovation .
In conclusion , the path of  technological innovation is  shaped by many factors .
In the case of refrigeration , gas refrigeration was invented first but due to corporate profitability , R &D fundings were provided for the electric refrigerations  .
It was then developed further to meet the various demands of  people and brought into use widely around the world .
The production of gas refrigerations on the other hand , was forced to close down due to the lack of R & D funding .
Safety has also been a main concern in this technological innovation .
As the gases used in the gas refrigerator were not safe , it was not popular among the consumers .
Therefore , factors such as safety concerns and corporate profitability have played a part in shaping the technological innovationof  refrigeration .

It is a "weapon the mainass destruction" but still intoous .
Its quick develthe mpment and adapta nbility in battle field is incomparable .
It is the main role in land battle in modern war .
The success of a technology not only depends on how well it resolves the targeted need but also the social considerations it incurs when being introduced to the consumer market .
"The network of power" , a book by Thomas Hughes ,  addresses one pertinent problem on the way we view technology .
We tend to be blinded by the benefits of a technology and overlook the importance of understanding it as an entire system .
By looking at the development of automobiles , from electric vehicles to gasoline-powered cars , we are able to understand how economic factors have influenced oil magnates , car manufacturers and the government  , which ultimately shaped this technological innovation .
Oil companies are one of the most lucrative business in today's world and a key player in the automobile industry .
With the rise of an alternate fuel source ,  oil companies may suffer a loss in profits and  the possibility of being put out of business  .
In order to guarantee their survival , they have to collaborate with the car companies .
They may even resort to underhanded means like spreading false information about the new technology .
For instance , doubts were cast on the ability of batteries delivering 100km per charge .
In fact , with the current lithium ion battery technology , an electric car can deliver a range of up to 300 miles per charge .
In other words , profitable organisations like the oil industry are always financially motivated .
Even if there is a more environmentally friendly fuel , they would resist to develop it  .
Car manufacturers are the next immediate culprit culpable for the continued devlopment of gasoline-powered vehicles  , rather than focusing on the environmentally friendly electric car .
They know that their core group of customers are a group of non-risk takers who are still uncertain about the new technology .
In addition , the electric cars are definitely more expensive than their gasoline counterparts despite the fact that they offer lesser range .
From a consumer point of view , it does not offer good value for the money spent .
The road users would not pay more for an underpowered vehicle or to be environmenenvironmentally friendly .
Furthermore , carmakers have tried to promote cars using the hydrogen technology  , which may still require years of development  .
This smokescreen failed to hide the truth that they  are afraid to lose the customers . 
The government is another deciding factor in shaping the automobile technology .
For example , in 1998 the Carlifornia Air Resource Board mandated that any car company capable of producing electric cars must ensure that 2 percent of their sales are emission-free cars .
However , despite 5000 electric cars being manufactured , 4000 were scraped after major car dealers pressured the government to cancel the mandate .
In other words , the governemnt takes into account  the collapse of the automobile and oil industries and the consequences that will ensue , such as the loss of jobsand the increase in unemployment .
Thus , the country's economy will eventually take the final blow .
To sum up , oil companies , car manufacturers and the government have considered issues from the economic point of view and realised that the consequences of making electric cars  are too drastic .
The oil and automobile industries are too lucrative and at the same time crucial to the overall economy  , so much so that issues regarding pollution and environment are secondary to it .
Hence , the automobile technology is ultimately shaped by oil magnates , car companies and the government  .
In Singapore , there are problems which could hamper the local engineering design process for innovations .
The two problems are attitude and funding  , which have severe impact on the local engineering process for innovations .
The engineering design process for innovations can be broken down into 3 stages:  creativity ,  process and  materialization .
The two problems will be elaborated on how they impact the engineering process for innovations .
The first problem that will hamper the local engineering process is attitude .
According to "Singapore's innovation journey" an article by Patrick Lambe , Singaporeans cannot innovate because they are conditioned to be followers rather than creative idea generators .
This could be  due to personal and  social attitude towards innovation .
We shall begin with the individual attitude and examine it hampers the local engineering process for innovations .
Singaporeans tend to be prudent and stable .
Being prudent , Singaporeans tend to be less adventurous when compared to their western counterparts .
One common scenario would be for parents to advise their children , especially those with tertiary education , to get a decent job and contribute to the family's expenditure .
If their children want to go into the research and development profession  , such as to become  a researcher in a university , they will be discouraged .
Children who later grow up into adults do not do not utilize their creativity  , which may be helpful in the engineering design process .
The second part would be the society's attitude in seeking to hamper the engineering process for innovations .
An example would be Paddy Tan , the creator who came up with the unique service  that allows owners who have lost their mobile phones to track them down .
When he initially launched his software  , the response was lukewarm .
He had to bring his product overseas  before his product became popular .
The local society does not have a positive attitude in accepting new engineering innovations and this could affect the materialization stage of the engineering process for innovation .
If  no one wants to accept a new  product , it will be hard for it to exist in the market and this will also deter people from participating in the engineering design process for innovations .
The second problem that could hamper the local engineering design process is funding .
Often , inventors who use their engineering talents to come up with innovative products fail to secure funding .
A good example is the formula racing car of the National University Of Singapore (NUS) .
The initial stages required the professor and his students to each come up with three hundred dollars to purchase the necessary parts .
However not all inventors have the luck of achieving initial success and thus receiving funding .
Funding affects all the three stages of engineering process for innovations .
Failure to secure funding will turn away inventors with engineering flair
Innovations can come about through serendipity or research .
Serendipity is the accidental discovery of a new idea , and the 3M post-it pad is one of such example .
On 4 July 2009 , The Straits Times reported the development of a new product to help the deaf experience sound , the Haptic Chair , by researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS)  .
Both innovations bring benefit to the lives of people .
A case of serendipity occurred a few decades ago when researchers from 3M laboratories discovered a new bonding agent .
The bonding agent did not stick paper very tightly to another surface , and the researchers decided that it was "worthless" .
This "worthless" substance was then used by a 3M researcher to create a temporary "post-it" stick-on note .
Soon he found the note useful as it was able to be attached to other documents without leaving any adhesive marks .
Next , he distributed pads of the post-it notes to 3M's president's executive secretary , who also found them useful .
Eventually , the post-it pads were further distributed to different companies , leading up to its big marketing success today (Rogers , 2003) .
On 4 July 2009 , The Straits Times newspaper reported that researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) .
invented a chair that turns sounds into vibrations to help the deaf experience music .
This was done as a result of NUS PhD student Suranga Nanayakkara recognising the need for the deaf to experience sound .
The Haptic Chair , which comes with back cushions and a footrest , is embedded with speakers that amplify vibrations caused by sound waves .
The product is made with the understanding that sound waves , apart from travelling through air , can also travel through solid matter (Grace , 2009)
The difference between  serendipitous discoveries and  researched technologies are the types of resources invested in their development .
A serendipitous discovery happens by chance , and has no pre-allocated funds or project timeframe to  adhere to .
The post-it pads came about because the 3M researcher happened to have some non-permanent adhesive , and he decided to come out with a new product on his own .
Before he gave the post-it pads to others , no funds or expertise were assigned to him for the post-it's development .
In the case of The Haptic Chair , a team of researchers had worked together with Suranga Nanayakkara .
A lot of time and effort were put in by the team before it could actually come out with the product .
How we consider each of the mentioned technology to be successful is different .
The post-it pads were only found to be successful after they were given to the 3M president's executive secretary  , who found them useful and mass-distributed them to various companies .
The general public is required to see the item as something useful before it was deemed to be successful .
In the case of the Haptic Chair , the invention was intended specifically for the deaf and the partially deaf .
Therefore , as long as the invention serves the needs of its targeted consumer , it will be considered a successful technology .
In The Straits Times article , it was reported that partially deaf musicians like teen piano prodigy Azariah Tan found various aspects of the invention intriguing (Rogers , 2003 and  Grace , 2009)
Research technology and serendipitous discoveries , despite being different , share certain similarities .
Both are by-products of people being able to recognize human needs .
For the 3M researcher , he has has identified the need to stick notes on paper without leaving adhesive stains to damage original documents; for the NUS student , he identified the need to create a product to aid those with hearing problems .
Both technologies benefit the lives of people , and have potentials for profit .
In conclusion , we have come to learn that new technologies can come about via research and  via serendipitous discoveries  .
What we do need to bear in mind is this: technologies of both natures serve different groups of people in different ways , and they ultimately bring benefits to the lives of people .
Innovation occurs when there is a need for a new product or service  .
When someone faces a problem and motivates people to find  ways to solve it  , new ideas are generated .
Technology is very much related with innovation , as we need  equipment to solve problem .
Many technological innovations are made via scientific research or  the interaction of scientific investigations and applying them on practical needs and problems .
A new idea is created  from the rigorous process of research .
Others may be serendipitously invented .
Serendipity means unexpected discoveries  or   inventions .
These findings are often unpredictable  .
Serendipitous discovery can happen to anyone as well as in any fields .
Technology which started from research usually begins with identifying a problem or need .
This stimulates development and research to create something in order to solve the problem or fulfill a need .
For example , General Motor's electric car was developed because of the need to meet the requirements of environmentally friendly cars .
Besides that , General Motor wishes to reposition itself as an innovative company  .
These are the two factors that drive it to initiate the research and develop the electric car .
When asked to investigate the death of a farmer's cow , a professor  found  that an anticoagulation agent called coumarin was the cause  when the hay stem punctured the cow's stomach .
Years later he experimented it as a rat killer , and found that it was a very effective rodenticide .
The process of discovering the rat killer is very shocking and has never been predicted .
The professor began the research with sweet clover disease and ended up inventing a very effective rat killer .
The main contrast between technology created via research and technology created serendipitously is that the former  has a clear direction  and the latter is created while in the process of researching  something which is totally unrelated .
With the use of  findings through basic research and investigations , they are able to discover and  develop  new tools to solve problems .
However , the latter does not have a specific objective , the discovery is purely unpredictable .
In conclusion , innovation occurs at anywhere and anytime .
The exchange of ideas and information plays a very crucial part in the process of generating new ideas .
Through constant exchanges of information about  problems , human needs and wants , we can come up with better ideas to solve problems and make our world a better place to live in .
Technology has made our life easier .
Rogers (2003) defines  technology as a design for instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome .
Most of the inventions were developed by application of scientific research on practical problems or needs .
However , some unpredicted technologies were invented by accident  .
For instance , the stove was invented via research and the microwave oven was serendipitously discovered .
Both the stove and the microwave oven are used to cook our daily meal at home but they were discovered in two different ways .
We will use these stages to compare and contrast the two different technologies .
Recognizing a problem or need is the very first stage of the process .
In the past , people used fire , coal , or heat from the sun to cook .
the stove was invented because people need to cookby applying heat to  the food .
In contrast , the microwave oven that we are using today was a side product of the microwave radio signal in radar for military purpose .
Dr . Percy Spencer discovered the microwave technology by serendipity when he found  that the candy bar in his pouch  melted when he was experimenting with his new magnetron .
The history of the stove and microwave shows that serendipity and researched technology have come from  very different beginnings .
Serendipity comes from a branch of a problem or need , while research technology comes straight from the problem or needs .
Subsequently ,  technology  on  basic application needs to be researched further .
The stove has undergone a very long history and it has been tested and improved over the centuries .
Similarly , the   basic application of the microwave oven is progressively being improvised from the  technology of the microwave radio signal radar .
Thus , we can see that both  technologies refer  to their basic  applications for further research .
Next , when the basic and application research  are established , the development of the product will begin .
The first known stove was built on the ground with sticks forming a tripod to hold the cooking pot above the heat source .
After years of innovations and experiments , the stove nowadays is safer to use and more convenient .
Likewise , the very first microwave oven was very big and bulky .
Today , it has become very compact and light , and features like the automatic functions  allow users to cook with just pressing a button .
Therefore we can see that both the technologies share the similar development path .
In conclusion , we have compared and contrasted the serendipitous and research technology using the three  stages of innovation-development process .
The results show that both technologies were developed in two very different ways--- research technology is  created via recognition of problems and need , while serendipitous technology is discovered by pure accident and has no purpose at the beginning .
However , the two technologies are similar in the  stages   on basic  application and development  . 
One similarity between both categories is achieving the aim of improving the quality of life for  people .
The Bionic eyes are being developed as engineers thought of ways to improve visual displays in various fields , such as gaming and  the aviation industry .
They hope to develop lenses  that  will allow players to be entirely immersed in the game  , and  to move without any constraints .
For the aviation industry , it is hope that through the new technology , pilots will be able to know the speed of the plane almost immediately .
The  3M's Post-its come in very handy when people want to remind themselves of various events or when people want to comment on essays without  writing on them .
It is convenient to use as it can stick to almost any surfaces and be peeled off easily without leaving any marks .
In addition , both technologies have gone through numerous trials before they become what they are now .
In the case of the Bionic eyes , the challenges were to choose materials that are harmless to the body and  to put circuit boards in contact lenses which are  tiny in size .
They also had to consider how to create  slim layers of circuit boards to be placed inside the contact lenses .
As for the invention of  Post-its , the researchers  were initially looking for a bonding agent that allows paper to bond  .
But along the way , another type of bonding agent was discovered  , and it  was deemed  useless at first because it did not achieve its original aim .
However , there are also differences between the two categories .
One of the differences is how the technologies came about .
For the Bionic eyes , it was done via research after it was seen in a movie called 'Terminator' , where a woman is able to zoom into places that are far away .
This gave the engineers the idea of turning what they see in  movies into  realities .
So , they worked towards this goal and developed Bionic eyes .
Post-its was discovered accidentally by researches who were trying to find bonding agents that can be used to bind papers firmly to a surface .
It was a by-product of what the researcherswere trying to achieve .
It was once deemed  "worthless" until people found uses for it and it has become one of the most commonly used products in our daily life and one of the products that make the most revenue for 3M .
For the Bionic eyes , it is easier for the public to accept it as this was done with the aim of developing lenses that will help improve the quality of life .
It will also be  easier  to find people to help market this product .
Post-its was initially  seen as a 'failure product'  .
It is only accepted and marketed by the company after someone started sending samples out to the Fortune 500 companies  to test the product  .
It may have  been abandoned and 3M may not be making such so much revenue out of it each year .
In conclusion , both technologies , be it developed via research or  from a serendipitous discovery ,  have achieved the aim of improving the lives of people .
Initial acceptance of the two technologies may be different ,which in turn  depends on the mindset of the public  .
One of the earliest inventions  was the wheel .
We continued to push for technological advances in different aspects of our lives so as to enjoy a better standard of living .
Over the past  decade , a new term "skunkworks" has surfaced .
This term describes the existence of a small groups of researchers who are not bound by corporate rules and politics , whereas conventionally generated technologies tend to require ensuring the survivability of the head company .
There are several similarities and differences between the technologies generated by  "skunkworks"  and  conventionally generated technologies .
Products generated by each environment may appear similar  , but they actually differ in many ways  .
The  environment plays an important part in shaping their distinctive features .
The first similarity that conventionally generated technologies and "skunkworks"  generated technologies share is the ability to produce cutting-edge technology .
These technologies are designed to have a huge impact on the world .
For example , the IMPACT car developed by General Motors (GM)  was conventionally generated by GM  to change the fate of automobiles .
Just as the IMPACT car was the pioneer of electric cars , the Toshiba laptop was the first of its kind .
Thus it is clear that both environments are capable of producing cutting-edge technologies
The second similarity is that for both environments , generally large amount of money and support has to be put in by the head company .
This is simply because in order to produce cutting-edge technology , large amount of research has to be done .
Hence , long hours are required before any results are visible .
A few examples include GM developing the first electric car named IMPACT , Apple developing their first Macintosh computer and Xerox's attempt at developing the world's first personal computer .
Thus , it is evident that huge amount of financing and support is generally required in both environments .
However there are instances where "skunkworks" environments have little financing and support from the head company .
An appropriate example would be the Toshiba laptop .
The development of the laptop was not well received by the company's top-brass and hence very little financing , manpower and resources have been allocated for the project .
As a result , the Toshiba laptop has received very little marketing as compared to the IMPACT car by GM .
The second difference between the two environments is the working environment presented to the engineers and researchers .
This has resulted in very different products being developed in each environment .
The "skunkworks" environment has been able to provide the developers with the  flexibility and freedom required to break traditional barriers and develop cutting-edge technologies .
Furthermore , "skunkworks" environment is very stressful as compared to the traditional corporate environment due to the lack of financing and hence , the room for error becomes much smaller .
The last and perhaps the most significant difference in the environments has to be the difference in the features of technologies developed by each environment .
The "skunkworks" environment has generally been able to develop technologies which are well received by the public and continue to bring success to the head company .
An example of such a difference is again present in the IMPACT car and the Toshiba laptop .
Under the stressful skunkworks environment , the researchers from Toshiba are able to think critically and design a product to meet the needs of the society .
On the other hand , the researchers from GM have failed to realize that the public and society were not ready for their invention .
The limitation of their product also meant that it was only open to a small market .
In conclusion , it is clear that the technology churned out by a "skunkworks" environment differs greatly from that of a conventionally generated technology .
The features and characteristics of the "skunkworks" technology set it apart from conventionally generated technology .
m vInnovations no way similarly ialized .
Generally , one technology that is developed thriesugh research often begins with the need for practical uses oA certain type of a social problem .
The electrical car is not an exception .
As the situation of the  , while anothers are exhausting , the need for inventing nonpolluexamples- saving cars is urgent .
Some government encourages automobile companies to produce environmentally friendlthe W cars .
Engibeing discoveredivation to design electric cars is obvious .
However , the discovery of Warfarin similaritieslin theent .
It is discovered by chance .
Nobody knew that the chemical in spoiled sweet clover key that led to cattle hemorrhage could actually be used as rat poison until the scientist Link accidentally found it .
He did not do it on purpose at all .
Even he himself was surprised when he found this chemical was highly lethal to rats .
In fact , the general belief that all technologies are initialized with a lot of effort is not quite true .
The solution to a completely irrelevant problem may hide behind the undergoing research , and eventually some great discovery is accidentally made .
tsthey bringthe publicway thatthat are developedTthey are not completed without confirmations from lab work and data .To sum up , technologies devethat existsvia research and from serendipitous discovery are quite differently initialized .
However , they are similar in the sense that they have to undergo thriments and research , and both can be very successful and bring benefit to the whole society .
During the process of developing innovations , regarcannotery little detailstraightawayd never letting go any chance discovery are most important .
Hopefully , successful technologies are produced by both means .
There are numerous problems that are faced by the world today .
Governments of different countries may have different agenda lists; however ,  aging population is definitely an issue present in the list .
Singapore makes it her top priority to create a safer environment for the elderly to live in .
Engineers play a huge role in assisting the government to achieve the aim of creating a better and safer environment for the elderly to live in .
With a safer environment , the welfare of the elderly will be improved and less social problems will occur .
Some examplesxamples of such engineering design are the building of ramps at the main entrance of the flats ,  handrails at the side of the stairs and providing buses for the wheelchair bound .
The pressing issue is to build a conducive environment for the old .
For example , the Housing Development Board (HDB) had implemented several designs to improve the convenience of the elderly , such as installing lifts on every storey and building wider internal corridors and hallways .
The designs had  proven to be useful for the flat holders  when the HDB first implemented them .
Thus , the government had implemented the Lift Upgrading Programme in 2001 , so that the owners have direct access to the lift at every floor .
According to Khandani (2005) , after each solution is generated , it must be tested and implemented to see the effects brought on by the solution .
In this case , there are positive effects associated with the engineering designs made for the HDB flats , and thus the government had implemented the solution throughout Singapore .
Many different countries have come up with many different innovative designs to facilitate the objective .
One of such designs is the wheelchair bound busprovided by the  Singapore SMRT Corporation Ltd (SMRT)  This wheelchair bound bus was first implemented in the European countries , and people  have found that the design is  innovative , and  it benefits the elderly and  the handicap .
There is an engineering design process  mentioned by Khandani (2005) which states that when engineers are thinking of the solution to the problem , they should actually research for more information on the relevant issue and observe how the others approach the problem .
From all the relevant information found , many observations and evaluations can be made .
Hence , in this case , SMRT has observed the good response from the other countries that had implemented this form of transport , and has decided to try out the transport in Singapore .
Generally , the engineering design process consists mainly of the five procedures mentioned by Khandani (2005) which includes defining the problem , gathering the relevant information , thinking of solutions to the problem , analyzing  and selecting one solution , and testing it out by implementing it .
Although all the steps mentioned by Khandani(2005) are crucial for designing a good engineering product , the most important step is to test  the solution and see  the public would response to it .
This is because every engineering product is designed to serve the people and  to bring a greater convenience to their lives .
In conclusion , engineering design is a never ending process , and it is the duty of the engineers to keep  coming up with solutions to solve the pressing issue of creating better products for the aging population .
An increasing  death rate due to traffic accidents has become a major problem in many countries .
The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that traffic accidents are in the ninth position among the reasons which lead to death .
When considering the European Union , 1 .3 million road traffic accidents occur each year , resulting in 1 .7 million injuries and over 40000 death annually( International Journal of Health Geographic) .
Even Singapore which implements strong traffic laws and regulations has also been affected by this traffic accident problem .
The accident rate per 10 ,000 vehicles has increased from 2 .34 in 2006 to 2 .60 in 2007 in Singapore ( Singapore Police Force) .
So , to reduce and solve the problem of traffic accidents , a new traffic system should be formed and it should be the current human need that should be given priority .
The engineering design process will be able to meet the need to form a new traffic system .
The  three important features in the engineering design process will cater to the need to form a new traffic system .
Firstly , a feature in the design process is the identification of the problem and to gather pertinent information .
This step will allow us to identify the reasons for  traffic accidents  from different angles .
It will help us to identify  problems  in the current system by doing various studies of the current traffic system .
The studies  include the gathering of relevant information  to analyse the situation .
For example , doing traffic counts , area-wide surveys and  parking surveys , as well as identifying the speed  of moving vehicles could help  to gain a better understanding of the problem .
For instance  , the Times of India states that there was a survey taken in India to measure the percentage of vehicles on the road and the percentage of people taking public transports(citation)  .
This survey has really helped people to understand which cities have high rates of traffic jams and the reasons for them .
So , identifying the problem is a very important process in creating a new traffic system .
Another important feature is the idea generation process .
This is a very important process as it is the point where we will be able to come up with solutions to the problems .
In the process , we will be able to analyse the statistics/surveys that we have obtained and generate new ideas to solve the problem .
These solutions may include devices to identify speeding vehicles and  to make sure that there is sufficient spacing between vehicles .
The Netherlands was the first country to implement such road safety devices and they prove to be helpful as  road accident rates dropped by 25% in 2000 as compared to accident rates in 1985(citation) .
Gordon Walls states that the purpose of traffic planning is to provide a safe , convenient and economic movement of vehicles .
From this we can understand that it is essential to come up with a system which is useful in various ways .
So it is important to come up with ideas which will be  useful and economical  .
Thirdly , analysing and select the solutions will be the next step .
It is the point where we will  selecting the solution which best suits the current situation  .
The solution is then implemented and continuously reviewed .
To conclude , it is very clear that engineering design process will be a useful method in solving the current  traffic problem .
The three important features mentionedare problem identification  , solution analysis and selection .
They are the key features of the design process which will be really useful in solving the problem .
There are many pressing issues that need to be addressed in the current world .
They are problems like global warming and  aging population .
We need to solve these problems as soon as possible .
The  need for better health care  should be the given  priority  since it  affects us directly  .
Hence , many health care products are created and modelled by engineers to meet this need .
The thermometer and the wheelchair are examples of these products .
In recent years , there were two viral outbreaks that affected us badlyand they are caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Influenza A (H1N1) virus .
These viruses are very contagious and their victims show a common symptom--- fever .
The engineers have  come up with new thermometers that can help to contain the spread .
In the process of developing them , engineers can follow the engineering design processes described by Khandani (2005) .
Firstly , by understanding what they need ,  , or "designing the problem" , engineers will know that the new thermometer has to minimise contact between users to prevent the spreading of  virus .
Other than that , engineers will also need to go through the process of "analysing and selecting a solution" to make sure that the new product is fairly safe before releasing it into the market and  it will not cause any health problem to the user  .
As a result , the ear thermometer was introduced ,  which is safe and fast to use .
It also minimises with the ear by using a plastic cover on the detector that will be disposed after use .
Since then , this thermometer has replaced the conventional oral thermometer .
Besides the thermometer , another example is the wheelchair .
The wheelchair has been serving those who have mobility problems for quite some time now .
From the original design that requires manual operation  to being moved with the touch of  single button , the wheelchair has undergone many changes .
Every change is made possible not by chance , but by following a set of engineering design processes  , like the set mentioned in Khandani (2005) .
Ever since the first wheelchair is being made , it has benefitted many people .
However , engineers were not satisfied because they felt that it can be improved further  , after looking at how the users used it .
They started the process of creating an automated wheelchair by  "defining the problem" that some users do not have enough strength to push the wheelchair .
After that , engineers have to "gather pertinent information" to make sure that this problem is real by doing a survey on the users  , so that they will not waste time designing something that the market does not need .
And when they have the ideas on how to solve this problem , they need to ensure that they select the idea that is achievable with the current technology by "analysing the solutions" .
Finally , when the new product is out , they must "test and implement the solution" by conducting a trial on the new wheelchair .
Some wheelchair users will try it  and  find  if it has met criteria like user-friendliness , before it is released into the market .
In conclusion , the two examples we mentioned have shown that engineering processes can play a big part in the designing phrase of a product .
Thus , we can see that engineering design processes can help to meet the health care need since they allow engineers to work faster and better with a proper set of steps to follow .
And most importantly , they help the engineers to take note of important points in the process of designing a product , which may be forgotten if a set of engineering processes is not used .
In the field of information technology , there is a clear boundary between conventionally generated and skunkwork developed technologies .
Specifically , in the operating system (OS) market , there are two well-known examples--- the Mac OS developed by Apple and the free open-source Linux OS .
These two OS reflect the obvious difference between the two ways of developing technology in their hardware platform: interface and price .
The first main difference is their hardware platform .
While the Linux OS is simply no more than a software and runs on PC platform machines , the Mac OS is exclusively designed for the Mac platform manufactured by Apple .
Since Apple designs the hardware for Mac , it makes the operating system perfectly compatible with the machine .
That is one of the reasons why Mac OS has always been praised by art designers for its smooth performance and high definition graphics .
Meanwhile , Linux , coded in the skunkwork environment , does not have that much funds and ability to compare with Mac at that level .
However , Linux has its own advantage .
The second difference between Mac and Linux lies in their structures .
As an open source operating system , Linux' users are free to explore and modify the systems .
Mac users , on the other hand , are restricted from the entering the system files .
This makes the Linux OS more popular among computer programmers and others who work in the field of information technology .
According to Forbes , Linux is currently the most popular operating system for supercomputers .
It is agreed by programmers from largest IT corporations such as IBM and Sun Microsystems that Linux has so far the most suitable environment for high-performance computing .
Finally , there is the problem of security .
This is what Mac and Linux have in common .
Despite their different structures and platforms , the two operating systems are quite secured .
By not allowing modification of system files , a third party cannot hack into a Mac .
As for Linux , open-source only means users can read its source file .
With its secured configuration , it is still extremely hard to penetrate a Linux server .
On the other hand , the sociology aspect has to be considered as well .
Being a skunkwork project , Linux  has the advantage of price .
It is actually the only free operating system available .
However , this does not guarantee its popularity .
The requirement of a high level of computing  knowledge makes Linux not popular among the average computer users .
Mac , in contrast , was designed for  entertainment and it is easy to use .
Apple is also very efficient at advertising their product worldwide , and so even when Mac and its software are much more expensive than for a normal OS , they are still one of the most wanted .
Furthermore , with the  coming price drop , Mac is expected to be the operating system of choice for education and business .
Environmental problems surrounding car production and usage are becoming an increasing threat to our world today .
According to Nieuwenhuis and Wells (1994) , "In the early 1900s , when gasoline cars starting gaining popularity , resources like gasoline and steel could still be found in abundance" (p .53) .
An increase in the number of cars on the road will mean an increase in the amount of oil burned , which in turn contributes to more air pollution .
Globally , transportation produces a quarter of all emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) , the primary green house gas , with some 10000 billion cubic metres of exhaust fumeapproachingleased annually (Nieuwenhuis & Wells , 1994) .
Every time a car is driven on the road , it is actually draining the world'scausestional petroleum onsources , and contributes more to global warming .
Materials like iron , steel , plastic , and glass , are mined from the Earth and are used in the construction of cars (Nieuwenhuis & Wells , 1994) .
At the end of the car's lifespan , those materials that cannot be reused are then thrown in a scrap pile , contributing to land pollution .
Hybrid cars solve part of these problems by using more reusable material like plastic , as well as making them lighter and rely more on electricity to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions (Berman , 2006) .
relyingBesides the environmental factors , cars can affect our economy negatively .
With the depletion of natural resources , funds have to be diverted into researchingia cheaper alternative to gasoline as a fuel .
Cars drain our Earth's natural resources , thus inciting political skirmishes over oil , and overwhelming the roads of today's cities (Sperling & Gordon , 2009) .
Countries with few natural resources have to spend increasing amounts of money to import gasoline and other crude oils for these cars .
According to research on gasoline prices (Energy Information Administration , 2009) , the price of a gallon of gasoline was about US$150 in 2000 .
By the end of 2009 , the price for a gallon is expbeing drivento increase to abdrainsin the solution presents itself in the form of hybrid cars that run more on electricity that can be harnessed from the sun or produced in man-made power stations and cost less than gasoline .
While the damage done by our continued reliance on cars and gasoline is severe , it is still not too late to do anything about it .
In order to prevent more serious economic and environmental damatic reductions in oil use and carbon emissions have to be made within the next decade .
Policy makers and carmakers need to change the vehicles they design and the energy and transport systems they are embedded in .
Relying on hybrid cars might just be one of the most feasible solutions we can look at to save our planet .
When a new virus or bacteria is introduced and the human population has no immunity , a pandemic will occur , causing widespread mortality .
In each century , influenza pandemics have occurred around 3 times , when a new strain of the influenza virus caused simultaneous deaths worldwide (Roche , 2006) .
Therefore , it is crucial to come up with solutions to prevent the spread of diseases .
For example , Penicillin , which was discovered serendipitously , helps to prevent one from getting bacterial diseases .
Furthermore , during the recent outbreak of the Swine flu , Tamiflu has been developed to treat it .
Both Tamiflu and Penicillin benefit the human population though they work on different micro-organisms .
Most  bacteria have  rigid cell walls , which prevent them from bursting when they are placed in solutions of lower salt concentration  .
Penicillin inhibits the formation of cell wall , which is essential for the survival of bacteria , and thus kills them off .
However ,  viruses do not have cell walls and thus Penicillin has no effect with them .
In contrast , Tamiflu works well on the influenza viruses .
An influenza virus is able to infect a host cell due to the presence of a neuraminidase .
Tamiflu is  neuraminidase inhibitor ,  and thus the virus is unable to exit the host cell and dies (Roche , 2006) .
Moreover , the virus is also unable to spread and infect other cells in the body .
Due to the distinct difference in the structures of virus and bacteria , Tamiflu and Penicillin perform differently on them .
Ever since the introduction of Penicillin , deaths from infectious diseases are very rare .
Nowadays , majority of the people die from circulatory diseases and respiratory diseases (World Health Organization , 2003) .
Penicillin  has the ability to cure people who are from the once-fatal bacterial diseases .
Similarly , Tamiflu has also proven to be effective in the treatment and  prevention of influenza in adults and in children .
Roche announced that two new observational studies had shown that influenza patients treated with Tamiflu had significantly higher survival rates than untreated patients and the analyzed outcomes targeted on two different groups -adults and children diagnosed with the highly pathogenic A (H5N1) avian influenza and adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza ("Two New Studies ," 2009) .
The human population has indeed benefited from both Penicillin and Tamiflu as the survival rates from bacterial diseases and influenza viruses have increased ever since they are introduced .
Regardless of whether the technology is developed via research or discovered serendipitously , it  hascontributed significantly to mankind .
New discoveries and creations are essential for the progress of mankind .
For instance , there is always a need for new and better anti-flu drugs as virus  mutate very easily and will soon acquire resistance to Tamiflu .
Resistance to Tamiflu has been detected in a patient in Singapore who was down with the pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) bug and similar cases have also emerged in Hong Kong , China , Japan , Canada , the United States and Denmark (Andy , 2009) .
Perhaps in a few years' time , the real cure for influenza virus will be discovered serendipitously and till that day , influenza virus will continue to be a threat to us .
A skunkworks is an especially enriched environment that is intended to help a small group of individuals design a new idea by escaping routine organizational procedures (Rogers , 2003) .
The 5th most influential man of this century and president of Apple Computer , Steve Jobs , created one of the most famous and successful skunkworks .
The fruit of this skunkworks is the popular Macintosh computer , which is in great demand worldwide till date .
According to Macworld , the iMac , i .e .
desktop version of the Macintosh computer , has become the biggest-selling personal computer of all time within three years of its launch (MacWorld , 8/15/01) .
In fact , Apple is the number one computer company in both Australia and Japan .
Obviously , there must be a reason behind the popularity of the Macintosh computer as compared to a conventionally generated innovation such as the Sony personal computer .
It would be most appropriate to explain this phenomenon by comparing the key features of the two different types .
The first key feature is the vision of a skunkworks as compared to the conventional way .
In order to appeal to the consumers , the idea or innovation created must be modern , creative , and refreshing as customers are always on a look out for new and up-to-date technology products .
Therefore , it is important for engineers to think ahead , speculate the upcoming problems and expectations of the consumers , and provide practical solutions .
For instant , the engineers of the Macbook Pro , i .e .
laptop version of the Macintosh computer , knew that the consumers were looking for a laptop that has a longer battery life .
As a result , they came up with a built-in battery life of 7 hours and did so without increasing the size of the laptop (Apple , 2009) .
Furthermore , the sleek design of the Macbook Pro satisfies the need for a trendy laptop .
Although the Macbook Pro is not created in a skunkworks , the engineers responsible for the Macbook Pro have similar vision of a skunkworks , that is to look ahead , and provide feasible solutions and ideas in advance .
In contrast , the Sony VAIO AR , a laptop for Sony that is created in a conventional environment , has a battery life of 2 .5 hours  .
Hence it is not as popular as the Macbook Pro .
Thus , it is safe to say that the vision of a skunkworks ensures that the products have the ability to satisfy the needs of the consumers for the time being and also in the near future .
Also , the next key feature would be the working conditions of a skunkworks as compared to a conventional environment .
About fifty highly dedicated young computer designers worked day and night at a secret lab that was located behind the Good Earth Restaurant in Cupertino (Rogers , 2003) .
The young computer designers did not require any permission or papers to go ahead with the procedures .
All of them were committed and goal-orientated .
With the leadership skills from Steve Jobs and resources provided to the skunkworks , the Macintosh computer was introduced in 1984 .
It only took 4 years for the skunkworks project to be completed .
Therefore , the skunkworks was hugely credited for its success .
However , in a conventional environment , there are restrictions and standard procedures to follow closely .
This will cause distractions and time wastage during the course of production .
The two technologies vary in many aspects .
One such aspect is the support that these technologies receive among people .
In the case of the smog eating cement , the technology received some negative feedback due to its serendipitous background .
Thomas Cahill who is an atmospheric scientist at the University Of California , Davis , criticized that the final outcome of this discovery is uncertain .
He also said that the advantages of this technology are only applicable in some situations (Miller , 2007) .
This shows that people question the validity of the serendipitously discovered technologies .
This is because these technologies are invented accidentally , in other words , by luck .
Majority of people look at serendipitous discovery with distrust as the technology was not invented via research .
Technology discovered through research is the norm and serendipitous discovery deviate from the norm .
Most people think that serendipitous discovery was not well analyzed and hence the inventors might not know the side effects that the technology might cause in future .
However , the case is different for the carbon-dioxide eating cement .
It was positively accepted by most people .
In fact , this technology was accepted by cement industries and environmentalists incorrect in-text citation .This clearly illustrates that a well researched technology gathers more support as it is perceived that a technology that has solid proof (via experimentations and research) has lesser unexpected outcomes in future , compared to a serendipitously discovered invention .
The two technologies also differ from the support they receive from private and government sectors .
The industry which produced the carbon-dioxide eating cement , Novacem , has Carbon Trust investing on them .
Furthermore , the company plans on building a pilot plant .
The interesting fact is that this project is funded by the government-backed Technology Strategy Board (Jha , ECO worldly , 2009) .
Moreover the company's chairman , Stuart Evans , mentioned that the pilot plant would also receive funding from Imperial Innovations (IVO .l) , the Royal Society enterprise fund and the London technology fund (Hirschler , 2009) .
Also , currently Rio Tinto (RIO .L) has been providing raw materials for Novacem (Hirschler , 2009) .
From these examples , it can be seen that the well researched technology is backed up by both private and government sectors .
This is because the research done by the company boosts the confidence of investors to invest in their technology .
The extensive research done by the company also showcases the invention as a promising one .
Hence , both government and private organizations are willing to fund this project as it seems worthwhile .
However , the smog-eating cement , did not receive as much aid from the government or any other private sector as the carbon-dioxide eating cement .
In fact , the only help that Italcementi received was from PICADA( photo catalytic innovative coverings application for depollution assessments) .
PICADA is a European Union study .
PICADA aided Italcementi to verify the fact (which was discovered serendipitously) that the titanium dioxide in cement helps to reduce smog in the atmosphere (Povoledo , 2006) .
Hence , a well researched technology receives a wider range of funding than a serendipitously discovered technology .
To sum it all , a well researched technology receives a lot more support among people than a serendipitously discovered technology .
Furthermore , it also has a wider range of funding partners than the serendipitous discovery .
Although they differ in some aspects , they are similar in their goal: To improve the air quality .
In my opinion , serendipitously discovered technology faces problems when it comes to gathering support and marketing while a well researched technology faces problems during the research and development stage .
Therefore , technologies discovered in both ways face problems in different areas .
There is no advantage whatsoever for either technologies .
Societal structure plays an important role in determining the evolution of a new innovation .
Norms and values from a social system will often heavily influence the technological design process .
This part of the development process is crucial to ensure that the innovation will be readily accepted by society .
The online video sharing website , Youtube , for example managed to grasp this concept and gained immense popularity within six months , hitting a peak of 4000 from 200 daily page views per million in May(Anderson , 2006) .
Youtube founders targeted the problems that most people faced; difficulty in sharing videos online and came out with many innovative solutions .
This resulted in a platform that enables web surfers to upload and play their videos online easily .
Being community-oriented , quickly catapults it to become the most popular video sharing site on the net .
In this present age , prevalent use of internet in many societies gave rise to a new "N-generation" .
Society's fast paced environmental and working conditions constantly mould the N-generation .
As such its behavioural pattern is one that expects fast efficiency and convenience as a norm .
One important feature of Youtube pertains to this idea and also contributes greatly to jumpstart its success .
The website is developed to integrate Macromedia flash player software tool that enable internet users to view youtube videos from their web browsers directly , without having to download it to their computers and view it with secondary video playing programs such as window media player (incorrect in-text citation) .
Thus , the time and computer hardware space needed to view a video is effectively  shortened to provide greater convenience .
This convenience and ease of use , appeals to many internet users who do not have very fast and stable internet connections by allowing them to watch their videos online as it downloads .
Also to incorporate efficiency into their design further , Youtube uses a standard video format that delivers reasonable video quality while minimizing download data size so that users will not experience choppy video pauses during video streaming .
Greater accessibility unfortunately , also has a downside to it .
Since anyone can upload any video on to Youtube and allow anyone on Youtube to view it , many uploaded videos containing inappropriate content are easily accessible to minors .
For many societies , this is especially intolerable since it will violate their moral standing , conservative culture , religion and law .
Consequently , Youtube was faced with much criticism from the web community but it dealt with this problem promptly via introducing its content censorship policy .
Firstly , its terms of service forbid the uploading of offensive materials .
Secondly , adult web users are required to log in to verify their identity to view content classified as inappropriate for minors .
Lastly , it also relies on users to flag videos containing inappropriate content online which will activate a 24 hour review team to deal with it (James & Nicole , 2008) .
The three prong approach effectively clams down any users that try to violate the rules .
There is also another problem which stems from importance of copyright in society .
The exclusive right granted to the orginal original author to be credited for his work is valued to the extent that it  . . . became a law in many societies .
However , a huge amount of videos posted online consist of television shows , music videos , movies and animes that were without the permission of their creators .
This entangled Youtube in a series of pressing legal lawsuits from major media companies such as Viacom , Mediaset and EPL in an effort to protect their copyright material (BBC , 2008) .
Subsequently , this forced Youtube to introduce its "Video ID" system which will check uploaded videos with a database of copyrighted material and deny any uploading if it finds a match (Youtube , 2009) .
In summary , Youtube has managed to attain its dominant position on the net due to its ability to conform to the taste of its mainstream community web users while at the same time adhering to legal regulations .
It is also intensively consumer focused and very flexibleand is  able to adapt to the needs and demands of internet users quickly .
In addition , regular novel upgrades to its website continue to entice more webs surfers as well as generate more internet traffic to their website .
More advertising sponsors will be attracted to employ their services , and hence , sustain YouTube's continual success .
Youtube has grown so much that it became part of many people's media entertainment and web surfing experience .
With its huge influence on the cyber community , it might even become a platform which in turn will help shape our society in the future .
In reality , there are many problems faced by researchers when they are developing innovations .
These problems may occur at various stages of the innovation process (Rogers , 2003) .
In this essay , we will discuss an innovation of a Bluetooth communication system for cyclists , one of the problems that the Bluetooth innovation faces and the impacts the problem has on certain stages of the process .
This Bluetooth communication system (bike bug) encounters the challenge of a lack of market demand which affects  the commercialization process  of it launched into the market .
There are many sub-factors that cause the shortage of market demand .
First , it is the usefulness of bike bug to cyclists .
Although , the number of cyclists who ride in large groups has risen over the years , the number of official members of "joyriders" stood at 120 in May 2007 (JoyRiders , 2006) .
Compared to Singapore's population of 4 .84 million people in June 2008 (Singapore Government , 1871) , the number of cyclists that cycle in groups are insignificant .
Therefore , this indicates that the demand is low as cyclists who travel alone , in pairs , or in small groups and those people who do not cycle do not require nor have the need for the bike plural .
Second , it is the design of the bike bug .
The structure of the bike bug's earpiece does not  fit snuggly into the cyclist's ear .
Therefore , there is the possibility of the cyclist incurring extra cost to replace the lost earpiece , especially after the earpiece is drenched by the cyclist's perspiration .
The extra replacement cost is incurred because if the cyclist speeds , the moist earpiece with minimal grip is likely to drop off .
Third , it is the  acceptance level of consumers .
Although , hands-free and Bluetooth devices for headsets are in abundance in the current market , its sales record is not so promising as Compared to other Bluetooth gadgets for mobile phone , cars  , and computers .
Even though 33 million of Bluetooth headsets were shipped in  , the figure is expected to increase to over 55 million in (Bluetooth special interest group , 2006) .
compared to the world population of 6 ,808 ,515 ,373 people (Geohive , 2009) ,  who use Bluetooth  ,this is  considered the minority .
This denotes that Bluetooth headsets are still not used by the majority .
Hence , as the bike bug is a Bluetooth headset gadget , I predict a dim future for its sales record .
With this two sub-factors plus the slow acceptance of Bluetooth headset compared to other Bluetooth devices , potential manufacturers of the bike bug are deterred as it is not economically practical to mass produce the bikebikebugs .
It is therefore shown that for bike bugs to be successfully launched into society , much is needed to raise the bikebug's popularity among the public .
In 1982 , Compaq was trying to model the IBM's BIOS System as it was the most popular system in the past (Sysops , 2003) .
Being one of the manufacturers who wanted to outwit IBM , the inventors of Compaq pondered how to develop laptop computers that were faster ,  superior in qualities , and offered additional features to please consumers .
For this case , Compaq was in the mainstream of developing portable computers , but exceeded what IBM had to offer to consumers with  an awesome BIOS System .
In contrast , the problems of inventing the Toshiba laptop computer were not just about excelling in the laptop computer market .
When Tetsuya Mizoguchi , the inventor of Toshiba laptop computer envisioned developing a product which was compatible to an IBM system , he was obstructed by the fact that corporate leaders at Toshiba deemed the development of such a product as difficult (Rogers , 2003) .
Moreover , the company at that time suffered huge losses in marketing their personal computers .
With strong disagreement from the company , Mizoguchi could not realize his dreams of making laptop computers .
Another difference is how Compaq and Mizoguchi solved their problems .
Compaq thought of an ingenious way to develop its very own BIOS System (Sysops , 2003) .
18 engineers examined IBM's BIOS system and figured the development on their  own by reverse engineering .
The engineers were divided into 2  .
One group on analyzing the original codes , another on making notes on how it exactly functioned .
The latter group then wrote their own BIOS which functioned similarly to IBM without risking themselves from a lawsuit with IBM .
On the contrary , Mizoguchi had a different set of problems .
He had to develop his laptop computer by going 'underground' in the Toshiba's Ome factory (Rogers , 2003) .
He channelled funds secretly and shifted 10 engineers from a military project to work on the laptop computer .
The development process was so stressful that the engineers had to make a prototype whereby the components were tightly packed in it .
Eventually , both Compaq and Mizoguchi had successfully built up the laptop computer and generated good sales results .
Though Compaq and Toshiba took different approaches in developing laptop computers , they had the same motive of creating great laptop computers and took part in the big pie in the market .
Initially , BlackBerry smartphones were introduced for  plural , politicians and lawyers (McKenna , Waldie , & Avery , 2009) .
Therefore , the emphasized function of the smartphones at that time was to receive and send emails .
Consequently , BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) was also released to help  businessmen keep track of their works and keep in touch with their employees .
As the demand of the 'so'called normal users increased , RIM had to evolve .
In fact , according to Dabrowski , the majority of subscribers in the three months which 'ended' on February 29th was "non-enterprise" users (Dabrowski , 2009) .
BlackBerry smartphones were made to become more accessible to the users by increasing the memory and embedding entertaining features such as music player , integrated camera , and 65 ,000-color display instead of monochrome display .
However , the launch of iPhone "was a boon for RIM as the touchscreen handset raised the public's awareness" (Peel , 2009) .
In 2008 , RIM introduced Storm , its first touchscreen device instead of a physical keyboard .
The release of Storm marked a milestone for RIM when it gave up its well-known QWERTY keyboard to give way for a new trend .
Sarcastically , BlackBerry Storm did not yield the expected outcome .
Its SurePress touchscreen was a hindrance to fast typing .
It seemed that RIM realized its failure in providing the users with a convenient experience using the touchscreen device .
The latter BlackBerry smartphones were equipped with fully-support QWERTY keyboard , a preferable feature by BlackBerry users .
In recent years , many new technologies which make use of high temperature to produce moderately hard outer coatings for materials have been developed .
It's part of the effort to reduce production cost , improve the durability and increase the forms of applications .
Most of these developments have to go through intensive research with technologies while a minor portion resulted due to serendipitous discovery .
In August 2009 , a most renowned non-profit organisation on applied research in United States known as  , Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) was awarded the 2009 R&D 100 Award for developing a Plasma Enhanced Magnetron Sputter (PEMS) technology that is particularly meant for coating .
On the other hand , the largest independent research university in the state of Ohio , Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) developed a technology for new applications in packaging via accidental discovery Although both technologies are based on the coating of material , the purpose , the methodologies and the final applications for the both developments are different .
Lastly , the application for SwRI technology includes (SwRI , 2009b) aero-engine components , land-based turbine blades , helicopter rotor blades , military weaponry componentsand oil and gas productions . 
Firstly , search-and-rescue is a crucial mission that is better performed by robots than the combat medics during times of war .
One of the reasons is the way military robots are built and configured .
For example , robots such as BEAR are built to be more robust than a human being to carry wounded soldiers over long distances and are configured to be capable of overcoming obstacles such as stairs or rough bumpy grounds during the rescue (Atwood & Klein , 2007) .
Another reason is that it reduces the risk of losing a human's life .
For instance , in situations where robots are not used , wounded soldiers will have to depend on their medics to search for them .
During the search , the movement of the medics might draw the enemy's attention and trigger them to attack .
On the other hand , if the robots are used and they are attacked by the enemy , the military team can  simply deploy new robots at strategic locations where the robots can avoid any chance of encountering the enemy .
The usage of miniature UAVs in the military are common today with the Lockheed Martin and Aerovironment being the two main competitors .
The Lockheed Martin (Lockheed Martin , 2009) has been proactive with skunkwork invention ever since  , pioneered by L .Kelly Johnson .
On the other hand , the Aerovironment adopts conventional processes for invention .
Recent years have shown that the Desert Hawk created under the skunkwork environment has not been performing as well as the Raven made by the Aerovironment .
Apart from the similar roles , the Aerovironment is able to stand out with their functions .
As the UAV o operate on all types of terrain , conventional landing method was not used .
However ,  has adopted two different ways to land .
The Desert Hawk was designed for crush landing (Staff Sgt .
C . Todd Lopez , 2004) .
This was not very popular among the users as it will affect the durability of the machines .
In contrast , the Raven  use of  advance programming to aid landing by making the UAV to experience deep stalling mode (Army Technology , 2009) to greatly reduce speed and impact for landing .
This function helps the user to reduce cost on maintenance .
Both UAVs are able to operate where the user will plot the route prior to the flight via GPS system installed in it .
The Desert Hawk is only able to operate in this mode (Defense Update , 2006) .
Whenever the route is changed during flight , it requires some amount of time before the pre-allocated waypoint can be reset .
The Raven was able to switch between two modes of operation such that the second mode allows users to operate the UAV manually (Army Technology , 2009) .
The Raven is able to provide the flexibility in the mode of operation .
The price of the Raven system was also lower than the Desert Hawk system by $50 ,000 even though both UAVs share the same roles and similar function .
The Raven is now operated by eight military forces around world and the number increasing while the Desert Hawk is the only user still operating the UAV .
With the rich history of the Lockheed Martin's skunkwork environment , everyone would expect them to be above or at least on par with their competitors .
In this example , it was proved that the conventional process of innovation won the competition .
With all the improvement and continuous development , it makes the future generation of UAV to be better than what we have today .
Technology has been evolving fast throughout in the 50 years .
New products are invented every day .
In fact , these technologies may be categorized into two types: conventional  and skunkworks .
One example would be Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop .
Mac laptop was created by Apple in a conventional way whereas Toshiba laptop , the first laptop in the world , was produced in a skunkworks environment .
We may evaluate both of them by investigating their designs , durability , and portability .
As laptop is created for the convenience of the customers , both Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop are similar in their portability .
Being the first laptop producer , Toshiba was successful in turning the idea of portable computer into reality .
The smallest laptop it produced , Toshiba's Libretto U100-S213 , has only the size of 21 .0 x 3 .33 x16 .51 cm and weighs  2 .2 pounds .
Obviously , it is much more portable than many of the other laptops .
On the other hand , Apple has also released its highly portable laptop called Macbook Pro which is the thinnest 17-inch laptop in the world .
Since it has the smallest thickness , its weight is also very small .
Hence , we can see that both Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop are similar in their portability .
However , in spite of being highly portable , Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop have significant differences in their designs and durability .
Apple aimed to make Mac its own unique laptop .
As a result , the corporation spent a lot of time in designing Mac laptop .
Mac laptop is designed to be beautiful in its appearance and advanced in its operating system and software .
Its fashionable design has brought it many customers , especially the young people .
According to a Student Monitor survey conducted in US in 2009 , 43 percent of the university undergraduates in US preferred to buy Mac laptops .
While Apple works hard to ensure that Mac laptop has the most gorgeous design , Toshiba focuses more on the performance instead of the design of the laptop .
Despite the change in size , Toshiba put little effort in changing the appearance of the laptop .
There has not been dramatic changes in the design of Toshiba laptop over the last 20 years .
Besides , the two brands of laptop also differ in their durability .
Since the lifespan of the laptop might be difficult to measure , we can investigate the durability of their batteries .
The battery is the most significant device of a laptop .
Computer engineers always endeavor to enhance the quality of the laptop batteries in order to enable the laptop to work longer without plugging in A/C supplier .
The latest Macbook Pro has achieved the maximum working time of 8 hours on a single charge .
In order to achieve this , Mac has adopted two innovations , which are bigger battery pack of lithium-ion cells as well as adaptive charging .
The battery pack in Macbook Pro occupies the space of the removable battery and obtains  40 percent more capacitance .
In addition , adaptive charging reduces the wear and tear on the battery and gives it a much longer lifespan .
In contrast , although Toshiba has also adopted lithium-ion cell battery pack in its laptop , the longest battery life was measured to be 5 .1 hours , which is much shorter than Macbook Pro .
Therefore , in terms of design and battery durability , Mac laptop has  better performance than Toshiba laptop .
On the whole , there are quite a number of similarities and differences between a conventional technology and a skunkworks technology , just like Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop .
Although Mac laptop seems to have a bigger market , Toshiba never stops innovating new types of laptops .
In addition , without Toshiba , we may not see Mac laptop today .
It is hard to conclude which technology is better: conventional or skunkworks .
They both have their advantages and disadvantages .
As long as the importance of the innovation is highlighted , the development of the technology would be bright .
When the first laptop was developed , Japanese computer users found it hard to work .
This was mainly due to the lack of space for a desktop computer .
Furthermore , most of the Japanese did not have a computer at home .
These factors clearly show that there are favorable market conditions for the development of a portable computer in Japan .
Hence , thesedrove Tetsuya Mizoguchi to develop a portable computer , although the idea was rejected by his company , Toshiba (Rogers , 2003) .
He recognized the market potential of the portable computer and continued to develop a portable computer without his company's knowledge .
The laptop could have  developed much earlier , if Toshiba had taken the risk to develop the portable computer .
During that time , Toshiba had just suffered huge losses with the failure of their latest personal computer (Rogers , 2003) .
Therefore , they were unwilling to take risks , and stuck to known methods that worked .
If the leaders in Toshiba had been willing to take the risk to believe in Mizoguchi's idea , the laptop would have  developed much earlier and will not have taken 2 years to be developed .
The quality of the laptop would have also been much better , as they will have more funds and more talented people to develop the laptop .
After the first laptop was successfully developed , Toshiba still refused to market the laptop .
Fortunately , the idea of the laptop was not discarded , as it was later marketed aggressively by Toshiba Europe , which felt that the portable computer has great market value (Rogers , 2003) .
It proved the Toshiba Company wrong , as the laptop proved to be a great marketing success , with 10000 units sold in just slightly over one year .
This  resulted in the birth of the laptop , as it started gaining popularity .
The laptop's rising popularity led to the innovation of the laptop , as it was a great marketing success .
This has also led other companies to develop their own laptops; so as to gain a portion of the market share .
With more competition , each company  constantly tried to outdo each other by constantly developing and promoting their latest plural .
This trend has stayed on even till today , where we can see many different brands of laptops competing with each other .
The case of the birth of the laptop shows us that a good and feasible idea could be discarded and not be used , if they were not given the opportunity to be developed .
In the case of the laptop , we may not be able to see a laptop today if Mizoguchi did not aggressively push for his idea .
This shows that an idea , even if it is workable and has obvious benefits , will not be developed properly without the support required .
Therefore , an innovation will only become a product , if factors such as economic , government support and usability of the product supports the development of the innovation .
In Singapore , there are two problems that many Singapore engineers may face when designing and innovating .
The first problem might be the lack of key qualities like creativity and an open mindset caused by the kind of education system we have and the environment we grew up in , while the second problem might be the aging population in our country .
These might  be the two factors hindering local engineers from producing potentially creative innovations .
Firstly , Singapore engineers lack the creativity and it might be due to the kind of education system in Singapore .
The lack of creativity will definitely lead to problems faced by engineers when it comes to innovating new products .
Singapore's education system is more curriculum-based or in other words more book-based .
Even though there are "Art" lessons and "Design & Technical" subjects in secondary schools , it is still not enough to allow students to explore and nurture their creativity and designing abilities .
Modules and Subjects that explore a student's designing talent and abilities are only made available during the later years of their studies .
For example , students can only study these modules during their Polytechnic or University years .
Therefore we can see that students are only encouraged to  explore and express their creativity during their tertiary years of studies .
I feel that a short 3 to 4 years of tertiary studies is not enough to properly allow students to fully develop their creativity .
This will therefore affect them when they enter the working society as professional engineers .
Without enough creativity , local engineers are bound to face problems in their course of work , which is mainly innovating .
In addition , local engineers are also more "traditional" in terms of their mindset , in other words "kiasi" and kiasu" .
Many local engineers possess this kind of mindset and it is probably because of the environment they grew up in and accustomed to .
We Singaporeans are very well protected and taken care off in our country thus it is only natural that the "kiasi" and "kiasu" characteristics manifest in us .
Due to this mindset problem , local engineers are often not willing to take risks as they are afraid of failures .
Local engineers might be able to think out of the box but they usually dare not venture out of it and apply their ideas to their innovations .
Thus this might affect them in a way that by not trying out new and refreshing ideas , the end product of their innovations would definitely  lack lustre and appeal .
Therefore , with this problem local engineers are bound to face problems while innovating .
Secondly , the aging population in Singapore might have contributed to the problems faced by Singapore engineers .
As we  ,  the aged in Singapore might not be as tech savvy as the youngsters .
With an aging population , it means that older citizens form a relatively huge percentage of the total population in Singapore thus it also applies to the consumer market .
Many older citizens are unable to keep up with the pace of changes taking place in the current society and are usually slower when it comes to learning and adapting to new technologies and innovations .
Therefore , with this problem in mind , local engineers often face challenges that require them to come up with innovations and create products that not only appeal to the younger generation of Singaporeans but also to cater to the aging population .
In all , the problems mentioned above may potentially hamper local engineers from coming up with good ideas and innovations .
Therefore we might need to first look into the causes of the problems such as the Singaporeans' "Kiasi" and "Kiasu" mindsets caused by the kind of environment we live in and probably the education system for the younger generations in Singapore .
The first problem that hampers engineering design is the old education style .
In China , we attend classes just to remember useful knowledge which can be applied in the exam .
We are always adapting such a teaching pattern that teachercountry'sand students memorize .
That is to say , teachers never value the importance of training students' thinking ability .
Besides , in the examination , we only solve problems with methods that teachers taught us and almost never think about other methods .
In other words , faced with a problem , we cannot solve it using our own methods .
What is more , teachers also do not pay much attention to practical activities , such as social research and experiment class .
In fact , they just think It a waste of time .
iconsiderTo be a designer or inventor , the most important and also the basic quality is creativity .
Only when scientists have rich experience and various methods can they succeed in their work .
Also , before they can begin to design , they must know about their objectives first .
That is to say , before they design and innovate , they must know what to create first .
During the process , they must know how to design .
But due to the current teaching style , students do not have any aim and ability to create and invent .
extentdo not have any effect .isDue to the above two problems , Chinese Engineering design was harmed seriously .
To help China make great improvement in science and technology , we must pay attention to design .
In other words , we should create a good environment for design and solve problems that hamper the design process .
It is time for governments to take measures to make improvement in education and laws .
In this year's National Day Rally Speech , Prime Minister Lee Hsein Loog mentioned about the rapidly increasing ageing population .
This fact is very true and real .
The birth rate in Singapore is not able to support the uprising ageing population .
The impact of it can be very problematic if not dealt with prudently .
Firstly , the majority of the elderly population are often not in touch with the newer technologiesand most of them are unable to handle modern gadgets .
As of such , they often resort to using more simplified means such as the telephone .
Secondly , they are resistant to change .
If given the choice to send a letter , they would rather manually write the letter and send it via mail then to send an email .
Because they are technologically impaired , they would prefer to use more traditional methods .
Lastly , an ageing population would mean the special care that to be directed in order to cater to the needs of them .
Devices must be easy to operate and their welfare must be taken into account .
Following that , the mindset of Singaporeans also plays a big role .
Singaporeans are very money minded .
This is due 'to' the kind of society we are brought up in .
Electric Road Pricing , Certificate of Entitlement and housing cost all cultivates us to be money conscious .
In fact Singapore is one of the most expensive place to live in .
Hence Singaporeans are more unwilling to take risks as the cost of failure would be very tough to recover from .
We are reluctant to invest in research and explore new frontiers .
In addition , there is a lack of creativity nowadays .
New products in the market are similar to already existing products .
Take Apple's iTouch for example .
Ever since its release , all the major phone companies such as Nokia , Samung and Sony Ericsson have released their own versions of a touch screen device .
This lack of creativity does not only relates to Singaporeans but it is a global phenomenon .
As of such , these two problems can really hinder the growth of engineers in Singapore .
Engineers have to take into account the feebleness of the elderly and their technological constraints .
Extra care and effort must be provided to consider the safety and wellbeing of the elderly .
Moreover due to the trend , products must be centered on them rather than youths .
Engineers would also need to open up to more ideas and research .
Although getting their financial support might be a challenge , it is something they have to overcome in order to progress .
Our government does in fact provide some kind of incentives to researchers .
The movie star , Paul Newman said , "I never learnt as much in the classroom as I did staring out a window and imagining things .
"() Generally , design is a process of an imagination being produced by a human .
How creative or attractive the product is  will depend on the imagination of a designer , regardless of which area a designer focuses on .
However , by producing an innovative product on the market , it is not an easy task to achieve .
Most of the time , it is often hindered by multiple realistic problems .
There are two major problems which hamper engineering design processes for innovation .
The first problem is due to government related issues while the second is related to  environmental issues .
First of all ,  government related issues will affect the engineering design process .
This is because an engineering design involves a series of complicated steps such as drafting outline , analysis and problem-solving as well as product implementation and the final testing of the product before being shipped to the market .
Furthermore , the designing process is a long term investment as it may require engineers to spend a lot of time and money in order to come out with an innovative product .
Therefore , the support of the government will lead to a different outcome .
A good government will come out with a clear policy to help its people along the way such that 'it' financially  supports the engineers and  provides sponsors for other organizations to assist in the work of an engineer .
On the other hand , a bad government such as a corrupted government will make the design process come to a standstill .
As a result , it may end up in failure eventually .
However , even if the engineers have received  financial support from the government or other organisations , the funding may be limited sometimes due to long term processes which involve problem solving methodology and testing for the innovative design to be carried out .
At the same time , the government and the companies will doubt 'whether' this engineering design is workable or not if it takes too long to progress .
Therefore , the engineers will come across problems due to insufficient funding and eventually it leads to a standstill .
The second problem that hinders the engineering design is the environmental issues .
Frankly speaking , there are engineers who only care about the profit they are going to make and do not 'regard' the effects 'that these designs' bring to our environment . .
Therefore , they may come out with ideas for their own interest and benefit .
For instance , in Taiwan , the most popular transport is motorbike .
Everyone owns one , especially in Taipei .
In order to meet the demand in the market and to attract more people to buy , different designs for the motorbike are also invented .
However , due to the increase in demand for motorbikes , the use of motorbikes results in environmental problems such as air pollution and resource depletion of fossil fuel .
Therefore , the fossil-fueled motorbikes are forbidden in some countries .
In conclusion , I do think that  government policies and environmental issues will hinder the engineering design for innovation .
A good government has to come out with a clear policy to benefit  its people 'as well' as be concerned about the environment environment .
Otherwise , most of the engineering design for innovation could be a failure 
There are many different types of engineering disciplines in Singapore .
Basically , according to Jonathan Dunder (p .2 - 9) , there are eight different types of engineering .
These are the architectural , biomedical , civil , computer , electrical , industrial , mechanical and software engineering .
Each serves different engineering industries .
For architectural , it is more related to designing of buildings for commercial , residential and industrial purposes .
As for biomedical , it is the design of devices intended to be used in medicine .
Civil engineering is the focus of structuring designs for infrastructure such as bridges and roads .
Electrical engineering is the designing of electronics , software engineering is the designing of software applications that relates to operating system whereas computer engineering is the combination of software and electronic engineering which focuses on both the engineering design .
Industrial engineering is the designing of multiple manufacturing products while lastly  mechanical engineering , which is the oldest of the engineering field , is the designing of the mechanical systems .
There are so many engineering fields .
So what is engineering actually ?
According to Jonathan Dunder (p .1) , engineering is the designing , troubleshooting and testing of products 
Designing of engineering innovation may take up to several years of processes to see the ideal final output product coming to reality .
Innovation involves three different stages of journey .
There is the creativity , when several ideas come to mind , followed by the process where these ideas  slowly turn to reality by  .
Finally is the entrepreneurship process where innovations are introduced into the new market .
During these stages of innovation , different problems are faced by  engineers .
Some of these problems are significant enough that may affect  the progress\development of the innovation Problems do occur in Singapore during each and every innovating design by the engineers .
Here , two of the major problems  will be discussed .
Engineers are needed in the entire process of every innovation to plan , troubleshoot , build and install the equipments in order to make the innovation a successful one .
Experienced engineers are needed in the Organization to speed up  the innovation process .
So here , in Singapore , the first major problem faced in the innovation designing process is the high salaries by the senior , experienced engineers and the fresh graduate engineers from the ITEs , Polytechnics as well as the Universities .
, a statistics report done by 3 .5 million members in terms of the numbers of working yearssingular in the engineering world , shows that the longer the singularand the higher the qualification , the higher the monthly wages will be  The ageing-population in Singapore  will increase tremendouslydelete this phrase and insert 'and' only 40-45% of graduates in ITEs , Polytechnics and Universities are trained in some form of  .
( organizations in Singapore , in order to proceed with their innovations ,  have no choice but to turn  to the more senior and experienced engineers .
This will in fact slow down the process of innovation as the organizations in Singapore have to think of ways to increase their innovation budgets to pay the engineers .
Next , is the lack of land resources in Singapore .
Singapore is a small country and it has limited area of land .
The population of Singapore  will increase from the current 4 .8 million people to 6 .5 million people in the coming years  Therefore there will be not enough land area to build industries for the organizations as most part of the land will be used to build flats for the increasing population .
It will cost more and it will be hard for the organization in order to be in Singapore to proceed  with the engineering innovation process .
Infrastructure will also be a problem  for the organization due to lack of land area .
In conclusion , it is not an easy process for an innovation to be out in the market .
Organizations in other countries too meet  many significant difficulties during their innovation designing process .
But there  are a few  successful innovations  by organizations in Singapore such as Creative Technology .
contributedledFirs , from the technical perspective , the invention of magnetic stripe card technology makes it possibjumpedat credit card itself catod data of receipts and disbursements .
Moreoecard's service and make a strong link between the card and our wasily life .
Secondly , from an economical perspective , it can be summarized in two points: one is the consumption concept implied in thlivesedit card that consumption before payment .
The most important character of credit card is overdraft .
It mebroadenedn though one does notcardmplural handmade still possesses the ability of payment .
So the credit card can solve the instant shortage of money .
Also it to some extent increases the value of goods .
For example , one has to spend twenty days on saving money and then before he affords to buy a nice coat .
But if one has a credit card , everything remains same except that he gets the nice coat twenty days earlier .
So one earns the extra twenty-day usage of the coat thanks to the credit card .
This function of the credit card stimulates people's consumption desire .
So many countries encourage releasing credit cards to stimulate domestic demand and promote economic development .
The other point is that the credit card saves a lot of manpower and material resources .
With globalization going on , more people travel around the world and money circulates more quickly .
The credit card adopts the electronic fund transfer , which reduces banks transferring a large amount of cash from one place to another .
It does save a lot of work .
,Thirdly , from a social perspective , credit card brings a lot of convenience to our life .
There are several simple methods of paymen , that 'is'g credit card such as punching the card on POS machine and RFID machine , network payment and telephone payment .
No matter when and where it is , one can get money by credit card instead of carrying a lot of cash .
This character of credit card makes iadapt to the pac'it' increasesrn life .
adaptableIn summary , the consumption concept that consumption before payment is the main reason of credit cards' production .
The relevant technology plays an important role in creating a smallPOS and RFID machines .
d which has the memory function and can be linked to the network .
The convenience that credit card brings leads to its wide usage in the world and makes it fashionable till now .
China is a developing country .
On her way to be more modern , one of the key points is to improve engineering design ability .
However , in China , there are  some problems humping the developing of engineering designs .
From my point of view , two of the main problems are  the government system and people's minds .
We need a more complete governmental and legal system .
Some government officials do not do well in their  positions and sometimes there are official corruptions in government .
For example , when somebody or some companies want to apply new techniques into practice , in some certain situations , they have to ask the government for singular - permission .
Because of these types of  officials , this process can cost a long  .
Hence  the companies lose precious time .
Moreover , if the techniques can bring generous  benefits to the company , some officials may use all kinds of excuses to delay or even refuse to give permission until they get bribes from the company .
In some other cases , in order to protect big companies , officials may prevent new techniques and engineering designs from coming into certain  areas .
In modern society , 3G  techniques brings a new revolution in cell phone and information industry .
But 3G hand phones did not appear in China until very late .
The reason was that at that time some giant communication company did not have that technique they were afraid that their profitable old businesses may be replaced by 3G business .
So they collaborated with some officials to protect their own benefits .
China also needs new policies and laws .
For instance , because the patent law is not strict enough , there many pirated copies of software , books , and techniques .
The result is people who invent the new techniques can not benefit from them and  nobody is willing to do new engineering designs .
Besides the problems in governmental system , some social conventional concepts can also obstruct the improvement of engineering designs .
Many have got used to the old things .
They just want to do the same things every day .
They are afraid that they cannot control changes in their daily  lives These people may never think about inventing new techniques .
Moreover , they may also block other persons' way to innovate , because they think the men are showing off or have bad effects on their lives .
This concept has negative influences .
On the one hand people do not want to do new engineering designs and discourage others to do so .
On the other hand , even though there are new techniques which can make a difference , people do not want to use it .
As a  , seldom can designs be applied into practice .
Inventors become less and less .
The two problems mentioned above are serious in China .
They have bad effects on the development of engineering techniques in China .
However , as the world becomes more competitive and "smaller" , the government and public have realized the importance of sane policy and innovation .
I believe in the near future we can do much better .
centres eyetorelatedResearch shows that engineers have to fabricate products which combat with blindness , also user-friendly and low cost .
For instance , a device which creates an image of the visual world on the retina isof the central nervous system of the brain .

According to AutoCar Magazine (2008) in China , there are about 2600 new gasoline cars on the road everyday in Beijing , Shanghai , Tianjin and Guangzhou .
The rapid increase of  cars exhausts more carbon dioxide which is actually worsening the Green House effect .
People really need some innovation to solve this problem and save our earth .
Although countries like the US have already spent more than 10 years to do research and development on electric cars (e-car conversions) ,  there are still two main problems that significantly affect its growth in the market of China .
The government support is one of the main difficulties that prohibit the development of electric cars .
First of all , the running duration of  electric cars is what the government is concerned about .
By using the most advanced batteries , a fully charged electric car can run about 160km () .
However , compared to  gasoline cars which can last for 500 to 600 km , the distance travelled by the electric cars is still considered as too limited .
The government worries that the electric cars will restrict the development and expansion of the big big cities due to its short running duration .
Second , the cost for building the infrastructure of the electric cars is really a big amount of money .
There are about 600 cities in China .
Imagine how much it costs if the battery charging facilities are built in every car park .
Besides that , the development of the electric car industry will definitely affect traditional gasoline car industries  Thousands of petrol stations will have to close  petrol related service industries will also be severely affected .
As a result , many people working in these areas will lose their jobs .
The government is reluctant to see such kinds of bad influence to the economy .
In conclusion , the government will not support the development of the electric car .
Another main problem is that building of electric cars may affect our environment .
Many people suggest building electric cars  is eco friendly .
However , the major source of electricity comes from coal power generation in China .
Although there are wasted gas treatment processes in those factories , carbon dioxide emission is still unavoidable .
The only advantage is that the factories have high efficiency  resources resulting in  less pollution .
Besides that , making use of batteries will also have negative influence on the earth .
Normally , batteries are not biodegradable and there are toxic substances , such as mercury , inside the batteries ) .
If people do not treat them properly , the toxic substances may flow into soil and rivers and affect our environment .
According to a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit , Japan is the most innovative nation in the world , followed by Switzerland , the US and Sweden .
() Over the last decade , Japan has created many new technologies and creative innovations in different fields such electronic industry , transportation and nanotechnology .
However , there is not much innovation and invention in my home country , Malaysia .
The proudest innovation might be the creation of our own car , PROTON , which was created quite a long time ago .
In my opinion , I think there are two main problems that hamper innovation process in Malaysia .
The first problem is lack of appropriate source of finance and the second problem would be the mindset of Malaysians .
In  2003 , Malaysian Science and Technology Information Centre (MASTIC)  conducted national surveys of innovation and discovered that , in Malaysia , there are about 800 innovating companies .
However , 90% of them are self-funding companies .
() Hence , lack of financing resources has became the major problem for them .
Obviously , they need help from the government .
Unfortunately , Malaysia is claimed to be a developing country .
Therefore , the Malaysian government would concentrate more on agriculture and allocate most of their budget into it .
This apparently would affect the operation of innovation as financing resources is the biggest concern in an innovation process .
Furthermore , to develop innovation across a nation , mindset of citizens would be a vital part .
Malaysia's intermediate past prime minister , Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi ( once stated , "The way I see it , the malaise affecting Malaysia that may well jeopardize our way forward is a case of having first world infrastructure and third world mentality ."
This has somehow proven that most of the Malaysians are not improving by all means .
In my opinion , Malaysians prefer to live in a relaxing environment instead of an environment that is full of challenges .
Besides that , they are not competitive and creative .
This is because they are not taught to think critically since they were young .
Hence , designing and innovation would be a difficult task for them in this moment .
Due to these two problems , some impacts have appeared in the very beginning stage .
Firstly , insufficient funding will lead to a slower pace in the innovating progress .
Innovating companies in Malaysia can hardly create a new technology due to the financing problem .
They do not have the modal to do research although they have a great idea .
Moreover , Malaysians with these kinds of qualities and attitudes also act as an obstacle in the innovation process .
They will just blindly follow the trend .
It is hard to have  new ideas as they will not think out of the box .
In conclusion , the engineering design processes for innovation in Malaysia is still in the very first phase .
Malaysian government should be more concerned about these two major problems and solve them adequately .
In my opinion , the problems can be solved if the government thinks of changing the education system .
Besides that , Malaysian should also start to work harder in order to make Malaysia a developed country instead of a developing country .
Hence , creating a new gadget in Malaysia would not be a dream; it is just a matter of time and effort .
Over the years , the proportion of elderly (residents aged 65 Years and over) with respect to the whole population in Singapore has increased drastically .
Statistics have shown that over the past decade , the percentage of elderly has risen from 7 .0% in 1999 to 7 .8% in 2004 .
Till last year in 2008 , it has hit the highest proportion of elderly ever seen  .
A shocking proportion of 8 .7% (Singapore Government Statistics , 2009) .
As seen from these statistics , the needs of the elderly have to be looked into .
To narrow this down , I would like to discuss about the needs of elderly in public transport and some solutions which might help to solve the problem .
As we can see very commonly in MRTs and buses , the needs of elderly in public transport are not taken care of .
A few years back , the Land Transport Authority (LTA) introduced the 'Priority Seating' scheme which is meant to help the elderly , parents with kids , pregnant ladies or handicaps .
However , the scheme did not achieve its aim as people continue to occupy the 'Priority Seats' and did not give them up to those who need it more .
Just a few months back , the LTA decided to make some changes to it .
open inverted coma not requiredThe LTA , SBS Transit and SMRT , have standardised the signs for priority seating in MRT trains .
The new signs are in blue and white , aligned with the colour code for the International Symbol of Access , and state 'Reserved Seating' instead of 'Priority Seating' to make the call-for-action to give up the seats in a more authoritative and forceful manner  In addition to the 'Reserved Seating' scheme , the Public Transport Council (PTC) launched "a public education program titled 'A Happy Journey Starts Like That !'
to promote graciousness on public transport"  in the recent months .
One of the aims of this program is to promote the idea of giving up the reserved seats to those who need it more .
As we can see from the above examples , the LTA has been putting in a lot of effort in trying to make the 'Reserved Seating' scheme more effective .
The scheme might have improved the situation to a certain extent; however , it is evident that the problem has not been solved .
There have been a lot of topics on forums on the internet regarding the issue of 'Reserved Seating' .
"It is sad to say that there has been no impact .
People are still seating on thee seats even when old folks are standing near them .d" () .
This was a comment by someone after what he saw in the MRT .
Here , we can clearly see that the problem has not been solved .
To tackle the problem , I have generated three solutions .
Firstly , instead of having a 'Reserved Seat' , a "Reserved Carriage'   is a better idea .
- A whole carriage specially for the elderly and others who are entitled to it .
After giving it some thought , I believe the 'Reserved Carriage' should be the center carriage of the train .
This will not only provide convenience for the elderly (and others entitled to the 'Reserved Carriage') , it will also be good to standardise this throughout all the MRT stations .
The 'Reserved Carriage' will be blocked off and to gain access to the 'Reserved Carriage' , one must tap his/her EZ-Link card .
This concept is similar to the method of entering the MRT station but of course , money will not be  be deducted .
As senior citizens already have special EZ-Link cards , this can be used to gain access to the 'Reserved Carriage' .
As for the others who are also entitled to the 'Reserve Carriage' , they can apply for a special EZ-Link card which will allow access to the carriage too .
Secondly , we will use  the idea of the 'Reserved Seat' .
However , each seat is 'locked' by a bar across the seat .
Similarly , to gain access to the seat , one must tap his/her EZ-Link card .
Upon tapping  the EZ-Link card , the seat will be 'unlocked' and people who are entitled to the 'Reserved Seat' are now able to sit .
The same idea can be used towards the wheelchair bound area .
(Option 2) .
Lastly , I have read a couple of comments online , saying that those who are not entitled to the 'Reserved Seat' but are actually sitting on it are to be fined .
This is indeed a very good idea as the best method to deter Singaporeans from doing something is to implement a fine .
However , much has been said about Singapore being a 'Fine' city .
By doing so , it might be cost efficient but we are acknowledging to the world that we are indeed a 'Fine' city , to the extent of fining people for not giving up 'Reserved Seats' .
(Option 3) .
Therefore , I would not agree with this method .
As the third option of implementing a fine has already been taken out of my choice , I would like to compare between the first option and the second option .
There are four points of comparisons I would like to discuss .
Option 1 is definitely less costly than option 2 .
In the first option , it requires only 2 - 4 systems in each train station while in the second option , it requires a system in every train carriages for each 'Reserved Seat' .
However , option 1 is less flexible as compared to option 2 .
In the first option , those travelling together with the elderly are not able to enter the same carriage while in the second option , the elderly can be accompanied by their children or grandchildren .
This lack of flexibility leads to the third comparison of safety issues .
As other people are not able to accompany the elderly or those entitled to the 'Reserved Carriage' , they are not taken care of in the carriage .
In the case of emergency , there will be a lot of safety issues arising from it .
In the second option , however , the elderly are taken care of by the other commuters even in case of emergency .
The last comparison is the usage of  space .
In option 1 , there will be a lot of standing space wasted in the 'Reserved Carriage' , while in option 2 , it makes full use of the space and no space will be wasted .
As we can see from the above comparisons , option 2 is much better than option 1 except for the costs .
It is more flexible , makes full use of the space around and most importantly , it is safe .
I believe that if the LTA really hopes to solve this problem , the cost would not be an issue .
Therefore , option 2 will be a more feasible solution .
In conclusion , whatever schemes or ideas that might be implemented in the future , there will definitely be a lot of discussions and debates regarding it going on .
Forums on the internet will continue talking about it and so will the media .
This issue will never be solved completely unless Singaporeans learn from the culture of Taiwan or Korea for example .
I saw a documentary on CNA and they were showing that the reserved seats in their train remains empty despite the fact that the train was crowded yet no one occupied these seats .
It was mentioned that the Koreans have much respect for the old and  they are more gracious" (David , 2009) .
Singaporeans need to learn how to be more courteous and gracious and care more for the elderly and needy .
The bottom-line is that no matter how many new innovations engineers can invent , they can only reduce such problems but not eliminate them completely .
If you ask me , the one and only way to eliminate this problem depends on us !
I .H .When a new technology emerges , it first has to go through the government's "tests" .
Basically , it means you have to "satisfy" the higher government officials before your technology can be made available to the public .
Not it is  can "satisfy" the government , thus some technologies are never made available to the general public , which essentially means it has no chance .oP becoming an innovation !
Just when you thought corruption is not enough to bring India down , there is another big problem yet to be eradicated - poverty .
About 42% of the population lives below the International poverty line !
This indirectly affects the design process because most new technologies requia lot of takers in the initial stages for it to become a success .
For example , broadband costs in India are still one of the highest in the world , simply because not a lot of people are aware about it and thus not a lot of them want to take it , this forces the ISP (Internet Service Provider) to raise increase the profit margin per person .
Is this because of the lack of IT literacy in India ?
Well , first , the literacy rate needs to improve before we can even start thinking about IT literacy .
The government education system at the primary and secondary level is a total flop , the syllabus is outdated and the curriculum is something of a joke .
India has a long way to go in terms of primary and secondary education although university level education is on par with the international standards .
T .All in all , poverty and corruption are the weeds in the endless fields of possibilities called India .
First of all , internet search engine is the kind of tool which requires least cost , to both viewers and advertisers .
With the wide scope of internet coverage and common usage of laptops , it is economically advisable to use search engines for information gathering .
Comparing with gointhe Internetkstores or libraries and watching TV , which cost people time and money , it is cost effective to search information through search engines .
For advert ,sers , the cost of search marketing is much lower than th .fThis is 81%e advertisements in other forms like on TV programs .
In this world where profit means so much , more and more advertisers are exploring the new field of search engine advertising .
The economic factor really contributes to the growth and development of search engines .
Secondly , search engine is a relatively easier tool that everyone can accept .
For example , the homepage of Google is very clean and simple .
Without much distractions from fancy designs and display of every piece of information , users can access to what they want toComparedectly .
Moreover , the sophistication of the search engines enables users to accurately describe the information they want and view them in an assorted manner .
In addition , search engines are mostly globalized .
For example , "Google" has many versions in different languages .
Singapore also has its own "Yahoo !"
search engines .
This helps to expose their people to the outside world by browsing other countries' WebPages through search engines .
Thus the above mentioned features have encouraged more people to use search engines .
conclusion , thmergence of search engines in our daily life is due to the economical , practical and information coverage factors .
It definitely started a new age of information gathering .
Through making the gathering process easier and more reliable , it saves the time , effort and resources of people .
Therefore , it is no wonder that it has remainedpossessesr in these years and still dominates the international search landscape .
According to recent statistics , every 1 in 8 people in Singapore aged between 15 to 64 is an elderly citizen (http://www .singstat .gov .sg/stats/charts/popn-area .html) .
This is an astonishing figure .
Singapore has already been facing this imminent problem for decades , and many policies have already been put in place to control these statistics but to no avail .
With the advent of modern technology and sciences , living to a ripe old age is nothing too spectacular .
With an aging population , the ratio of people to proportion being able to work gradually reduces .
This reduction will no doubt cripple  the country's economy , as funds will have to be used to cater to the needs of the older majority .
It is therefore , required of the community to be able to design products to help them .
Hence , it is one need of Singapore as a whole country that should be given priority as it is an impending crisis and must not be neglected .
As there is a significant majority of elderly people in Singapore to date , catering to their needs should also be part of our consideration , as a community .
Through our engineering processes , we can ensure that we can provide tools and devices for the elderly .
Firstly , our engineering processes are structured in such a way that all factors are taken into consideration .
The rigorous nature of the various steps will guarantee that a solution that is most favorable .
Cost effectiveness , efficiency and safety are held in high regard in most cases , making certain that the products designed will not take a toll on the pockets and be a hazard when they use it .
Secondly , even before a certain product design is selected , there will be multiple blueprints that are presented to the 'panel' of engineers and designers .
This is crucial because the design of the product will be diversified .
Lastly , the survey that will be included will make sure that the product that is about to be designed will be suitable to the majority .
The information gathered from such surveys will be used in the process and the decision of the final product out of the many initial designs will be largely based on these statistics .
Up till 2007 ,  2 .4 billion people or 36% of the planet's population actually carried at least one phone(Tomi ,2007) , which means there are around 4 out of 10 people carrying a phone !
The number of people using a phone is increasing every year .
How did this happen ?
We should thank the people who thought of the innovation of making this innovative product .
The mobile phone has been a technology which was socially determined .
There are many factors that affect the shaping of this technological innovation .
Such factors are due to economic factors , military demands or government priorities and the private sectors .
Firstly , one of the main factors that affect this technological innovation is the economic factors .
One of the few economic factors that affect is the price drop in mobile phones .
Around 10 to 20 years ago , the mobile phone with basic functions that is similar to a basic land line cost thousands In contrast , mobile phones nowadays cost as low as 50 dollars or even  given as free !
Another reason that caused this to happen is due to higher demand for the mobile phone .
The physical properties of the phone have been improved over the years .20 years ago , the size of phones were much larger than that of today's phone .
In short , economical factors such as physical properties and price of phones are some of the examples that led the mobile phone to be socially determined .
Secondly , military demand is also another factor that shaped this innovative product .
Originally , the origin of the mobile phone was the radio phone which was used around the 1940s and during the World War 2 .
During the World War 2 ,Handie -Talkie and the backpack walkie-talkie were what soldiers used during the war(Tom ,2007) .Towards the end of the war , equipments used during the war , mainly the radio phones(the mobile phone's predecessor) were then brought to everyday usage .
The development of the mobile phone was in process over  60 years and now we have such innovative products .
The best example would currently be the IPhone .
In , we can see that  military demands 60 years ago play an important role in today's development of the mobile phone .
Lastly , the third factor that affected this innovative product is government priorities and the private sectors .
Most countries encourage people to use the  computers , the internet service and the mobile phone .
Reports also show that the increased connectivity through mobile phones and the internet may lead to improved economic growth and job governance(James ,2009) .
The government encourages the wide usage of mobile broadband service such as 3G and 3 .5G broadband services .
Furthermore , with the private sectors cooperating with the government to offer more different kinds of mobile services , this helps in the usage of mobile phones .
As a result , the number of people using mobile phones has increased .
Engineering design process is usually a cyclic process where decision making is required .
Often , engineering sciences , basic sciences and mathematics are applied to convert the available information optimally to achieve the desired deeds .
Basically , this process can be divided into  various steps including identifying objectives , defining problems , conducting research , analyzing solutions , making decisions , presenting the products and finally , selling the products .
These are the universal steps in the process which is followed by most  engineers .
Nonetheless , there are problems that significantly hamper the engineering design process for innovation .
In Malaysia ,  corruption within the political system has led to slow development in design processes .
Besides , the education system introduced leads to a lack of creativity and innovation by engineers .
Undeniably , political systems in a country plays an essential role in the development of the country .
statistics have  shown that Malaysia ranked 47th out of 180 nations on Transparency International's 2008 Corruption Perception Index .
Under most circumstances , one needs to bribe in order to accomplish his or her objective .
For example , bribing is necessary and people usually need to pay money under the table to establish an engineering company , or to conduct a project .
One of the examples is the defects in Middle Ring Road 2(MRR2) fiasco , which happened in October 2004 .
The British engineering consultancy firm , Halcrow Consultancy Ltd , had found that there were structural defects of piers on the MRR2 highway due to design flaw .
At first , it was announced that the British consultant would do the remedial work for RM14 million .
Then , the Work Ministry and the Cabinet  decided to replace the British with a German consultant , which costs RM40 million and at last , the Work ministry admitted that the repair cost was RM70 million .
However , the details of the remedial cost were not reported in a proper procedure by the Work Ministry .
Therefore ,  .
It is painful to hear that the repair works had to be deferred as the Anti-corruption Agency (ACA) stepped into the investigation  .
Indirectly , these corruptions have hampered the engineering design process at the stage of analyzing solutions to get the repair work done as fast as possible .
In addition , the a lack of creativity and innovation have been identified to be the main problems  hampering the engineering design process , which might be due to the current education system in Malaysia .
Most of the students are so used to being spoon fed .
s ,  they expect that every solution will be provided .
They were overindulged by teachers as knowledge or information was provided to them in an oversimplified way , causing students to be too reliant on teachers .
Students have been treated in a way that discouraged independent thought and learning processes , thus indirectly hindering their ability to analyze and interpret problems due to lack of creativity .
Consequently , these two reasons have caused a lack of development in engineering design process .
The corruption in the politicalystem and the abuse of power by the higher authorities hinders one's motive to design a product as the steps to run a project is so tedious As a result , there will be less and less engineering products being developed as a result people might not have opportunities to enjoy the conveniences and leisure that is brought about by the products .
On the other hand , a lack  of creativity and innovation by engineers  leads to a lack of knowledgeable engineers to design a product .
An engineer might have difficulties in interpreting solutions and making decisions during the design process if he or she  lacks creativity .
Indirectly , insufficient  human resources in  engineering field might llead to a poor economy , due to a lack of progression in the engineering field .
In conclusion , corruption in the political system and the lack of creativity by engineers ,  , significantly hampers the the engineering design process .
As said by the ex Prime Minister of Malaysia , Dato' Seri Doctor Mahathir Muhammad , "the use of money in politics gain could destroy a country" .
Therefore , action should be taken to prevent further corruption in the political system so that engineering design process would not be hindered .
Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day , teach a man to fish and he will eat for the rest of his life .
Hence , governments should encourage independent learning so that students will be more creative and innovative to facilitate engineering design process .
Before 1870 , people could communicate with one another from a distance  only by  writing .
It was very inconvenient as urgent information could not be delivered immediately .
But in 1876 , Alexander Graham Bell invented a device that changed the world .
He invented the telephone - a device that allows two remotely located users to communicate by voice with each other (Mary Bellis , n .d) .
Today , his invention has become a necessity in our life to fulfill our need to communicate without meeting up .
Similarly , Konrad Zuse  invented the first computer , which satisfies our need for a systematic and efficient method of data management (Mary Bellis , n .d) .
Who are these brilliant people who invented these incredible devices which we cannot live without in this modern world ?
Engineers !
From the past till present , engineers have designed products or systems that meet human needs (Seyyed , 2005) .
Therefore , they play a crucial role in the society by never failing to improve our standard of living .
Today , one of the main concerns about human need is the innovation of a more environmentally-friendly vehicle .
Current vehicles are producing too much carbon dioxide - the main substance that causes global warming .
About 33% of U .S carbon dioxide emission comes from the burning of gasoline in internal-combustion engines of cars and light trucks (Causes of Global Warming , n .d) .
Many signs of worldwide climate change have been identified .
If we do not react quickly , the increase in temperature could lead to large-scale food and water shortage and have disastrous effects on wildlife .
Moreover , the rise in sea level could flood many islands (Global Warming Fast Facts , 2007) .
With the Earth at its critical state , a "greener" car is of the essence , and engineering design processes can guide us to our goal .
Once alternative solutions to the design problem have been conceived , we proceed to analyze those solutions and select the best solution for implementation , the fourth step in the engineering design process .
In the process of analyzing the solutions , product safety and liability will also be considered .
Finally , the last step will be testing and implementing the solution to the design problem .
We must also consider the means of implementation such as prototyping or concurrent engineering  (Seyyed , 2005) .
In the contemporary world , preventing heart diseases is inarguably one of the most pressing needs of mankind , and is rated as the top priority for engineering design and innovation .
As years of research conducted by the WHO (world health organization) have repeatedly shown , heart malfunctioning is the most common threat among all health-related problems  .
Given such a life and death situation , engineers have responded and there have been many great inventions , of which the implanted pacemaker might be one of the most significant engineering products in preventing heart diseases .
This essay will explain in detail the working of modern implanted pacemakers and therefore how they have met the need in maintaining a smooth heart beat .
The first step is to have a pacemaker implanted into the human body .
After having numbed the patient's collarbone area and a small incision made , electrical leads are inserted into the heart chamber with the guidance of x-ray .
The other end of the leads is connected to the generator and a battery that lasts for a few years .
Next , the doctor will transmit a program tailored to the needs of the patient's heart into the pacemaker across the patient's skin .
Now the pacemaker is ready to work .
Under normal circumstances , it keeps the heart beating in a normal rhythm according to the program .
When an abnormality happens , such as a block in the coronary artery or a sudden stop of heart beat , the pacemaker detects it and sends out electrical pulses to the affected location .
The pulses will then stimulate contractions in the heart muscles , which will allow the blood to flow smoothly again or to start beating again , preventing a possible sudden death of the patient .
Besides preventing serious occasions of heart malfunctioning , the pacemakerr can also help regulate the heart beat when the patient is performing certain activities , such as exercising and sleeping .
Moreover , the pacemaker records the rhythms of the patient's heart beat in different situations and hence helps the doctor to write programs that best suits the patient  .
The reasons why implanted pacemakers have gone through generations of development and has been listed as one of the top 50 inventions in the past 50 years is that they are portable , which means they can effectively prevent sudden heart attacks , and dependable as they run on computer programs which are constantly renewed by having more suitable ones stored in the patients' bodies .
This invention is certainly a masterpiece of engineering design due to its contribution in the enhancement of health through maintaining a functional heart . 
First of all , the most practical pare facedowith a solution is to make full use of energy .
The phenoenvironmentalrgy wasting can be found everywhere in daily life .
Even the industrial design cannot avoid it .
For instance , most vehicles' engines can only transfer about 30% of fuel's chemical energy into mechanical energy , while the other 70% becoming heat and polluters .
Another example comes from the solar panel .
Although solar energy has been regarded as the most promising energy form , solar panel is also well known for its low energy exchange rate-less than 16% .
However , if the effectiveness of both energy use and production can be iareas ,of innovationergy could be saved .
Last but not the least , it is still very important to find other cleaner and renewable energr end in less than 100 years according to scientists' estimation .
On the other hand , the modern energy resources like nuclear power still cannot be widely applied since no good solution has been found for its deadly radioactive nuclear wastes .
Many engineers turn to ocean motion , geothermal power and other areas to find a good replacement .
are turningIn conclusion , the shortage of energy resources is threatening the development of the world .
To ensure an enough energy supply has become an urgent current human need than evetraditional If engineers can improve effectiveness of energy make full use of small portions of energy and successfully find some other clean renewable energy resources , the society will be able to develop sustainably .
From 18thinks 1949 , Chinese people were suffering from World War II and Chinese civil war .
After these battles and wars , Chinese people finally stepped in to a new era , a peaceful but impoverished era .
Chinese people did not have time to develop their economy and technology .
Therefore , Chinese economy and technology was far behind those developed country .
However , Chinese people did not give up; Chinese leaders put forward a series of policies .
Moreover , every Chinese people want to contribute to establishing a new China .
That is why Chinese economic situation was much better than before .
For technology aspect , a group of Chinese scientists and engineers scarified their holiday and worked every day and night in order to improve the technology of China .
Therefore , many excellent and designed technological outcomes appeared in that period of time .
But now , there are two factors hamper the design process for innovation .
One is the students are lack of the innovative thinking system .
Other one there is no co-operation between scientists and engineers .
Currently , the studThe Chinese China are used to learning but not thinking .The Chineseng means to learn and use the knowledge whThe Chinesetaught by teachers .
They also do not care whether this knowledge is right The Chineseg .
However , thinking is a totally different thing .

Furthermoduring , the way of testing is give you a lot of question an hamperinge theinnovative design processe questiothat students lack innovative thinking , and the other is a lack of co-operation between scientists and engineers .andard solution which is given by ministry of education , the solution is incorrect .
Therefore , students are satisfied in using one way to solve problem .
a problemthe ministrya teacherCa problemists and engineers do not know what is called co-operation .
For instance , there is a finding which is interesthas beeng and can cthe teacherse to society .
Scientists and engineers will do the research individually and if someone invented a machine by this finding first .
He will publish his achievements as are derived possible .
He wants to make money by this invention .
However , one person takes a whask their teachers a question ,What if a group of ensay theyrs invent thisa particularhine ?

Hence , if Chinese scientistheir query is to ask if the teacher can help to check if their method could be used or not .rk will be improved athe present lack d of work time will be less .
In conclusion , if Chinese scientists and engineers overcome these two problems .
Thetalentedl be more innovative outcomethod appears in Chito provide many questionslogy to have students solve them quicklyarather than give students a single question and have them solve it in many different ways .
From a technological point of view , the way to the future from where we are today is either by creating something new or modifying current technology so that it performs better than the way it previously did .
This is where engineering design process comes into play .
In order to come up with groundbreaking innovations to improve the way we live , engineers need to have a design-oriented mind .
However , coming up with  new ideas and innovations are more often than not , easier said than done .
As a matter of fact , statistically speaking , the number of failed attempts at innovation far exceed the ones which made it into the books .
Nevertheless , the process of learning through failures have significant importance in the engineering design process .
One of the main obstacles in the engineering design process has to be financial constraints .
Many great engineering design ideas were halted cold in their tracks just because the cost to realize them outweighs the benefits that they carry .
For instance , the proposed plan to use nuclear energy in Malaysia never came to pass due to the enormous funds that is required to carry out research in the technology and even if the necessary funds are secured , there is always the uncertainty if the research will yield any significant results .
On top of that , researchers and investors have all come to terms with the fact that running and maintaining a practical nuclear reactor in Malaysia will take too long for the technology to break even financially .
It is just not worth the effort .
Apart from that , new engineering design innovations need to be benchmarked against their environmental effects .
Engineers need to be sensitive towards this issue and thus , ensure that the impact of their ideas are minimal towards mother nature .
In the case of a nuclear power plant in Malaysia , the idea is not viable as the country has an abundance of forest reserves which needs to be kept untarnished and preserved  .
Constant exposure to radioactive substances may alter the natural ecosystem of these reserves , causing irreversible damage .
Even in Singapore , all engineering projects have to abide by the Environmental Pollution Control Act before being carried out .
Besides that ,  the innovations that engineers  come up with needs  to be safe for the public to use .
In this case , safety measures need to be put in place before an innovation is unveiled to the public .
This cannot be compromised .
As for the Malaysian power plant , The plant , due to the inadequacy of safe uranium containment as well as the skilled labour to handle them , the project is unable to be carried out .
The incident at Chernobyl , Ukraine serves as a good reminder as to why safety is of utmost importance .
In order to cut production cost , several safety precautions have been removed from the initial blueprint .
On the fateful day of April 26 , 1986 , one of the reactors exploded , consequently causing the area to be inhabitable till this day and instantly claiming 4 lives in the process .
In a nutshell , engineers may have great ideas and innovations .
Unfortunately , not all of them can be realized .
In fact , many of them will not .
However , all is not lost .
With small but useful engineering design ideas being introduced daily , serving as a basis for many bigger innovations , it's only a matter of time before the many obstacles which are holding engineers back are removed .
Long time ago  , the engineers' products as well as their achievements played a vital role in human life .
Along with the development of communities  , the basic human needs continue to rise and to branch into many fields such as : living condition  , effective supply chain systemetc .
The great knowledge of many talented engineers has helped to fulfill many human requirements  , which  directly impacts an ordinary life .
looking  around and anyone can recognize many magical changes that have been brought about by engineers  .
From a small household thing for normal use to a complex machine system that provides  electric energy to a huge city , all have been  designed by  engineers  .
as human needs are carefully observed to make necessary adjustments , the need for medical things and the curing of diseases is presently  the top priority Disease has been a great concern for humans from a very long time ago , but medical system seems not to be enough in the fight with countless threats that steals many human lives  .There are many limitations that can only be surpassed by the magic of engineers' technology .
For instance  , many doctors are having trouble in predicting human symptoms   .
There are many diseases like cancerwhich cannot be cured using only normal medicine .
This is the moment engineers start their innovations .
They realize the first problem  is that we need a revolution in medical procedures  .
The normal methods like injecting medicine , predicting a threatening symptom using common equipment does not bring optimal results or worse  , it is useless especially with the dangerous diseases .
We need a great change and the most possible plan now is to apply nanotechnology  .
Using the latest knowledge  , engineers can design various types of micro-robots which have the size of a bacterium  .
With this size  , the normal physical limitation is now removed and we can easily discover every corner of the human body .
It not only reduces the material cost ,  makes a more accurate diagnosis  , but also is less painful for the patient and gives scientists a great chance to study deeper about the human body .
These micro-robots can have many useful functions  .
It can bring a camera and help doctors observe the inner world of the human body with their own eyes .
It can be attached with a tiny medicine package and put  directly into the damaged spot  .
It can be programmed to kill any cell that causes the disease  .
This micro-robot is very promising and now is developed by many professional engineers all over the word and will soon be released  , making it one of the greatest achievement of engineers 
The long and tedious journey in finding the key to save mankind now lies in a tiny microscopic life , that is extracted from a mammals embryos , called stem cells .
They are believed to have the ability to create brand new organs , curing an array of serious diseases and even perhaps solving human ageing problems ,  .
Although after 30 years of research , scientists are still unable to solve the mystery of these cells , but there has been fruitful development where these stems are now being used to repair important tissues in the human body But due to the nature of these cells ,  scientists now face both technological and scientific problems which hinders them from unleashing the full potential of these cells .
Technology played an important role , to aid researchers on in their work .
We need the right tools for the right kind of job , we can't possibly use a screwdriver to do a hammer's work ,  wee need better technology to increase scientist's capability to understand this cell better , like how it changes (Transform) into specialized cells which will later transform into an organ .
Scientist believes that the answer lies within the cell itself , the DNA of the cell that causes them to differentiate .
With current DNA technology , it has proven insufficient to proceed any faster .
This is a serious factor that scientists are now looking into , and once they succeed , imagine the amount of life that would be saved .
Meeting the demand in the  market and reducing the cost of medical treatments bringing an infinite possibility to the medical-industry .
The impact this technology will bring to the world .
One of the fascinating problems faced , is the human body itself .
Firstly the human body has an extraordinary capability to identify foreign objects and purge them out from the system (Rejection) .
This has led to serious complications to patients who are receiving this life-saving treatment .
Secondly , these cells injected into the body have to be closely monitored .
Withoutthis , it would result in an uncontrollable and misdirected growth of unwanted cells , etc tumor , or even cancerous cells .
This is a major obstacle that scientists are  now facing .
Recently , the only way around this is to reduce the body's immune system to zero , so the body will not reject the treatment but it's a very dangerous step .
If the body always rejects such treatment , then all the research and funds spent on the project would be wasted .
there is only so much scientist can do , a lot more research will be required in order to bring this ideology to realism and put this cell into good use .
I believe this would be a most valuable scientific breakthrough .
Perhaps someday , the human ageing problems will be solved just purely by replacing old organs and injecting new cells to repair old and damaged tissues ?
The world food crisis would be solved by merging these cells with the current cloning technology to create fast and  range of food supplies .

Therefore , developwasy by research may require morwaswork and developing a technology serendipitously will need more attention to intproducing daily life .
In conclusion , though differences exfor the refrigeratorprocesses they are developed , in the  of their use andwas introducedting potential when the have usedpment comes out , both kinds of technologies contribute to the development of the society .
In fact , no matter in which way the technology is discovered , as long as it is beneficial to the society , we should appreciate it and enjoy the convenience it brings us .
Do you know that the global worldwide energy consumption was 500 exajoules which is  astounding 5 1020 J ?
Do you also know that 80 to 90 percent of that is obtained from the combustion of fossil fuels ?
(U .S . Department Of Energy) As globalization takes place , coupled with an increasing world population , more electrical energy has to be supplied to homes and factories so as to meet the increasing demand .
However , fossil fuels such as coal and crude oil , which is used to produce electricity , will eventually be depleted as they are non-renewable resources .
According to Wikipedia , "Assuming that our rate of usage in 2005 remains constant , we will run out of conventional oil in 40 years (2045) and coal in 154 yrs (2159) ."
Hence , the current human need for energy is one need that we must prioritize .
Engineers have therefore started to work on new technologies , such as photovoltaic systems that can convert solar power to electrical energy so as to ease the need .
The process of converting the solar energy to electrical energy is also known as the photovoltaic effect .
("Solar cells") First , when sunlight is shone onto the surface of the photovoltaic panels , sunlight in the form of photons will be absorbed by the silicon .
Next , the electrons with higher energy levels in the panels will be separated from their atoms and allowed to flow in a single direction due to the special composition of the cells .
Complimentary positive charges that are produced will flow in the opposite direction of the electrons .
Finally , when both positive charges and electrons flow through the silicon photovoltaic cells , electricity is produced .
("Solar cells")
However , even though solar energy has proven to be a very good and efficient way to generate electricity , the electricity produced may not be available to everyone who needs them due to the cost of production .
Many modern countries have been setting up more photovoltaic plants to generate electricity .
("Photovoltaics") However , in most third world countries , the governments or private industries may not have the funds to set up photovoltaic plants due to the high initial capital  As a result , despite many people in the country needing electrical energy , the country cannot supply enough to meet the needs of everyone .
Therefore , this shows that the technology of solar energy has its own limitations too , which hopefully would be resolved soon so that it can become an accessible source of energy for everyone in the near future .
To sum up , the most current human need that has to be prioritized is the need for energy .
In the next few decades , the demand for energy will definitely increase exponentially as the world population continues to grow .
Therefore , solar energy being a clean and renewable source of energy will definitely build up its popularity as a popular source that can be used to produce electricity .
Hence in order to ease current as well as future needs for energy , solar power is one viable source to consider .
As we know tis hydrogen can be made bliving thingsater ,so we need electrical energy .We first converwherebylar eneplantsnto electrical energy .
To achieve this we use plates that are mhumansf semiconductor which can absorbreceived throughts .The semiconduc can emit electron after theann light's stphotosynthesis .ole plnaturea battery .So the solar energy have developmentccessfully converted into electrical passesy .
After doing this , we will artificial causesate the proto beginof photosynthesis .In this step ,we need to find a highly efficient catalyst to speed up the electrolyzation and make the process to be complete .we let the water into a container and add the catalyst into it ,then take two metal plates into the water and transmit electricity we get before ineed to try hardwater .Finally , we can get the hydrogen gas .
Hydrogen gas has been produced ,but the transmission is still a hard work .We need a high-pressure and low-temperature surroundings to let the hydrogen be liquid .But it is very hard to make that kind of surroundings in normal life .We need a kind of catalyst to make the hydrogen be liquid at normal temperature and pressure .
After the two steps ,the hydrogen will replace oil ,coal and gas ,to be the most useful and important energy in our life .
We will no longer afraid of atmospheric pollution and greenhouse effect .What's more ,the energy we use is renewable .We will not be short of energy resource .

Simulated by the sun's light , the semiconductor can emit electrons .
ThesemiconductorsWith this kind of hydrogen energy ,a lot of problems that obese us today will be solved .No wars for energy will break .
I believe this will come true soon .
Among all those socially determined resistance on the way of innovation , one fatally significant phenomenon is the unfair competitioto be filledtween monopolies and other less competent companies .
On one hand , monopolies that have sufficient capital to back them up canprovidedihumanswith age sum of money in fields of designing and testing to increase thexiststy and ensure the reliability of their productcapitalismanding tasks .
Meanwhile the dominancy in market share also allows them to popularize and convert their products to revenue in a short time .
It can be perceived as good in the sense of market selection , but on the other hand , such type of rivalship can easily be abused and transformed into one-sided violation if monopolies use these advantages as weapons against their opponents instead of rising the standard of living for mankind .
raisingOne vivid thesele is Microsoft forced Netscape to theinto bankruptcy by packing its inferior web browser IE with its dominant windows system for free .
It is also common for monopolies to lower the price in a large scale to annihilate their opponents and rise it up latter .
Ironically , being the ultimate form in organizing capital , monopolies seem to be the major obstruction on the road of innovation , and hundreds of 'Netscapes' have been sacrificed over the years because of their pursuit of greater profit .
Innovation still has a long way to go before it can stand up to these giants .
Another frustrating fwhen Microsoftt hampers the desto gog process of innovation comes from decision makers' worries about being unable to take up the market in time .
Due to the advancing technology , the lifetocle for aextentproduct has been sharply shortehis , however , the time for design and development seem too long to wait .
This can be extremely significant in industries like pharmacy .
Before a new drug reaching to its commercialization stage , it must undergo a long period of time for testing to prove its effectiveness and safety .
Even after going through all these procedures , the lack of proper advertisement can also ruin its sales .
Meanwhile , people's intention to buy brand goods helps deteriorating this problem .
In short , companies may have enough funds for innovation , but that do not mean they can survive the loss of market share just because they are one step behind and let others climb on the top .
doesexacerbatebrandedreachespharmaceutical industrylike thetocomparedWith so many things to consider about , those managers do have reasons to hesitate before they risk the future of a company for the unguaranteed profit .
They will not start simply because they cannot afford to lose the race .
To sum it up , the rules of this tyrmine that the process of innovation will depend much more on engineers' creativity .
But as the society changes with time , hopefully we can create a harmonic atmosphere for innovation and provide mankind a higher living standard .
Several decades ago , Dubai was still a poor and backward country .
However , with the discovering of the oil , Dubaare generated from the human mind every second .kiIn the meantimes overnight .

Subsequently , a series of unbelievable plain beautifying and simplifying the whole worldotel , the most grand and luxury hotel worldwide once accomplished in Dec 1999 , was certainly becoming one of the most dazzling architecture at that time .
During the entire design and construction , not only some latest technologies have been applied into this magnificent project , more impressive is that mostderivedgns are never used before and every engineer can freely come up with all kinds of brand new ideas .

As the first step of innovation-development , the need of market is significantly considered in both two types .
Usually , the deterministsFor the  quality of life ,s technologically determinist and socially determinist .
Although both of them exist in convention and skunkworks , socially determinist takes more than technologically determinist in skunkworks .
This is because that skunkworks is born to solve those very real and urgent problems nevertheless in scarcity of capital .
In contrast , enough capital and technology support are the factors which lead the process of convention .
So convention is more technologically determthe marketand skunkworks is more socially determinist .
Furthermore , convention and development also show some sithe marketties and many differences in thetwo wayssearch & dethem need capthe marketis and technology to be succesdetermineder , as its namdeterminedkunkworks is being progressed in shabby environment due to the scarcity of capital .
In addition , the scale of research is often much smaller than that of convention .
Sometimes only six to ten people are involved .
On the other hand , convention gets enough things to support , which cause it much easier and more stabile to finish innovation .
But because of large scale and many other factors involved , it will take more time and more cost to finish the whole innovation .
This point quite differs from very efficient skunkswork .
For instance , how the refrigerator got its hum .
Actually , there was another superior alternative , gas refrigerator , would not hum .
However , many related big corporations decided that larger profits could be made from the electric refrigerator , so they poured huge amounts of funding into the electric refrigerator , and also aggressively promoted this product (E .M . Rogers , 2003 , the generation of innovation) .
At last , the products of the two , convention and skunkworks , will face to different kinds of consumers .
The products of skunkworks are more practical , and people are in need of those product .
For example , the invention of laptop helped Japanese developedad ma shabbyace to work .
But for convention , its products are often regarded as the milestone of technology or other purposes .
Like General Motors (GM) dedicated $2 billion to designing , manufacturing , and marketing electric vehicles to reposition GM asmakesnnovative company in peopstablends , but ththe innovationofHowever;ose vehiclesits large much poor (E .M . Rogers , 2003 , opinion leaders and mavens in the diffusion of electric cars , para .1) .
In summary , Convention usually has enough capital and technology , appeale scale and good environment .
These make it operate stably .
By contrast , skunkworks is more efficient and its proproductsre more practical than that of cthe laptopion .
But it shareemployees havek of no outcome due to the shortage of capital and shabby environment .
However , by taking every point into consideration , both of them can work well in innovation-development , depending on different situation .
Engineers are trained to solve problems and design products to fulfill human needs .
Overcoming a problem requires time and repeated trialsl to make sure that the product is safe to use and works efficiently .
Products that are designed should be able to suit daily usage .
As turning ideas into virtual products takes an engineer a lot of effort , an engineer should carefully define the problem that occurs in human life and thereafter starts to generate the problem and solve it .
One of the current human needs is to find an environmentally friendly vehicle as a substitute for the gasoline vehicle .
Air pollution nowadays has become a serious issue all around the world .
Some countries which are severely affected by air pollution could not even have a clear vision during day time .
According to Gulfnews .com eq \o\ac( ,1)(March 2008) , more than 75 per cent of air pollution is emitted from vehicles .
Exhaust fumes are bad for human health and will contribute to air pollution .
Thus , an environmentallyl friendly vehicle needs to be created and should be given priority for this creation to save our earth from pollution and to lessen the impact of the air pollution .
Electrically generated vehicles can be designed to overcome the air pollution problem .
electrically generated vehicle will not exhaust gases when it is being driven .
On the other hand , it also does not need gasoline as generating material .
This means that mining process for gasoline might also be lesser and therefore the air pollution problem will be less serious .
It is because mining and refining processes of  petroleum which emit fumes that will pollute the air .
To build an electrically generated vehicle that can have longer lasting battery power and powerful pickup , it should have a special battery , light weight material and well designed shape .
The battery of the vehicle must be able to recharge within a few hours .
It should also be able to store higher amounts of energy in order to last for longer periods of time .
On the other hand , building the vehicle with light weight material , such as aluminium can conserve energy .
Furthermore , having an aerodynamically styled shape , the vehicle can move faster and have a powerful pickup .
The electrically generated vehicle should be fully tested and examined .
It is an important process to make sure that the product is safe to be used .
Test drive  and open the electrically generated vehicle to the public and ask for feedback from them and make improvements for it .
After that the electrically generated vehicle can be introduced to the market throughout the world .
In conclusion , the creation of an electrically generated vehicle can reduce air pollution problems that is becoming more and more serious nowadays .
It has to be created to fulfil the world's need nowadays so that our future generation has a healthier earth to live in .
Engineers can make the world different by their expertise and knowledge .
E-commerce scenario in mind: a man sitting in front of a computer is busy using email , eBay , online banking , and teleconferencing .
This is ecommerce , which consists of the buying and selling of products or services over electronic systems such as the Internet and other computer networks .
CITATION wik09 \l 2052 (wikipedia , 2009) Thanks to this burgeoning technology , people can almost fulfil all their needs without moving a step .
With the initial to achieve a more convenient human life , ecommerce is considered to be socially determined rather than technologically determined .
To specify , the formation and development of this technology is mainly contributed by three factors: public's needs , economic consideration , and government regulation .
Basically , the origcommerce is due to public's desire to facilitate their life and work .
Tracing back to the late 1970s , Electronice-commerceerchange and Electronic Funds Transfer first emerged in the US to satisfy people's needs for simple business communication .
CITATION Ken08 \ly first types of ecommerce .
Later on , as the rapid spreadfulfillternet , the utility of this technology quickly vagoald extended to global scope .
The most popular usage is online shopping .
Because of the increasingly heavy workload , people are sick of stepping out of home and shopping .
This concern soon results in the appearance of online store .
In 1995 , both eBay and Amazon launched and quickly grew to become the biggest online retailers .
CITATION Jul08 \l 2052 (Julie , 2008) Till now , people can nearly do whatever they want simply by clicking the web browser .
storesDuring the speedy develope-commercecommerce , corporations realize the potential to gain huge interest and participate to shape the direction of ecommerce's growth .
Comparing with the traditional selling styles , ecommerce manages to broaden the market as well as obtain a cent publicity .
For example , originally the retail stores most probably sewith products only within the city since they can hardly afford to publicize in a larger area .
Thanks to the technology of ecommerce , these shops can now do publicity to a much larger target group .
By the same time , the online banking system also facilitates the proceduresultedake deals .
AtadvertiseBesides these two factors , governe-commercelation also conrealizeds to shaping this technology .
In the 1990participationult of the rising developmee-commerce'serce , the usage of this technology gradually became out e-commercel .
The public's privacy and security was seriously threatened .
In order to solforms of publicityproblems , Federal Trade Commission (FTC) established FTC Act in the US .
Similarly , the related governmental agency in other countries also established such rules to maintain the site-commerce
Directed by public's requirement , enterprises' intention , and government regulation , ecommerce is now still developing .
Undoubtedly , this is not the e-commerces growth .
If continuing the efforts of thwentree aspects , we have confidence this technology will sooner or later develop to a certain stage which satisfies the whole society .
First , the attitude of Singaporeans makes them reluctant to change .
Singaporeans live in the comfort of their own homes believing that all the things that can be invented have already been made .
Everyone is just waiting for someone to discover new things .
With attitudes like that , it is not possible for Singaporeans to innovate .
Moreover , Singaporeans accept things too easily .
They lack the motivation to create new things .
Such frame of mind hinders the progression of innovation .
Singaporeans are afraid to try out new things and they are also afraid of failure .
Innovation requires perseverance , the ability to accept failure and motivation .
These are a few traits that are often seen amongst the Singaporeans .
On top of this , the education system in Singapore does not emphasise on creativity .
Students are always 'spoon-fed' by the teachers .
As a consequence , they are instilled with a 'sit back and wait' state of mind from young .
Clearly , the lack of creativity and the passive attitude of Singaporeans have hindered the first stage of the engineering design process .
In conclusion , the design process is demanding and tedious .
There are certain stages of the process to complete before being able to come up with a feasible solution .
However , there are problems faced during the process .
The two major problems in Singapore are the attitude and the social systems .
The passive attitude results in people being unable to identify existing problems , which is the very first phase of the design process .
Furthermore , the social systems set strict standards for new products .
This significantly affects the third stage of design process which is the generation of solutions .
Therefore , only by overcoming the two major problems , will Singaporeans then be able to create and innovate .
Besides small population size , Singapore also does not have any natural resources to boast about .
The republic's physical landmass of approximated seven hundred and five square kilometers is ranked one hundred and eighty- seventh internationally .
Unsurprisingly , the scarce land does not yield precious metals nor is it a treasure trove containing prized fossil fuel .
Singapore's small population size affects the initial two stages as well as the final testing stage of the engineering design process .
Firstly , a small population would mean that most problems encountered by small groups in Singapore would often be overlooked .
For a similar situation overseas , the problems are likely to draw more attention .
This is due to the fact that for a seemingly insignificant proportion of people who require specifically designed solutions , it is quite a sizeable amount in absolute terms in countries with larger human concentration .
This situation would be problematic during the definition of problem stage of engineering design process .
In addition , even if there were potential solutions , it would be a tough task to carry out experimentation or trials , either as a means to gather data or to implement a solution , simply because a local test group might not exist .
This was illustrated in the report "A chair that's music to deaf ears" where a research team was unable to find a test group for a chair for the deaf they designed and had to look overseas .
The non-existence of natural resources is another concern .
Specifically , resources can be divided into raw materials , land , wealth and labour of which the first two , a nation like Singapore clearly lacks .
This deficiency in raw materials and useable land as well as to a lesser extent , wealth and labour , limits the magnitude of the engineering solutions to be pursued .
The space race cost the United States an estimated twenty-five billion dollars in ninety-sixties terms .
Such an enormous amount would be several years of Singapore's gross domestic product in the current economic climate .
The scarce land space further adds to the problem .
In conclusion , Singapore's unique size and state of available resources are obstacles in the engineering design process .
The ability to work with such constraints will greatly influence the outcome of future engineering endeavours .
The educational system in Malaysia is exam orientated .
The educational system is based more towards theory and not practicel .
Students spend most of their time in the classroom learning theory .
The amount of time spent in labs for practicals is minimal .
The system is giving emphasis on memory skills , not analytical skills .
Furthermore , school teachers merely teach students to pass their exams , but not for the students to learn .
Primary and secondary school students are spoon fed with information rather than letting them learning independently .
Students are taught and train to score in public examinations such as Penilaian Menengah Rendah (PMR) and Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) .
Eventually , students with good memory will be able to pass with flying colours as they are able to memorise all the facts and spit them all out during the exams .
These excellent students will face problems as they further their studies to be engineers .
They lack of analytical skills , creativity and innovation .
These are the two factors that will cease engineers from being able to solve real life problems .
Actually , after HencarsFord's Model T the lastmobile was invented , cars just gradually become a vehicle that can be adopted by people .
The {Model T}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Model_T] was introduced on October 1 , 1908 .
The casports very simple to drive , and easy and cheap to repair .
Economically , because the Model T was so cheap that by the 1920s a majority of American drivers learned to drive on the Model T . Apart from this , in order to make the Model T more universal , Henry Ford also createcars massive publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new productareHe also creatinfluencingork of local dealcars , which provided a good marketing channel to his company .
These are all the things that the Ford Company did in order to sell more Model Ts .
If we analysis from a bigger view , then we can see that there were also other economical factors influence the cars' adoption .
One of the most important factors was that declining cost of oil at that time .
Several years before Ford produced the Model T , in 1901 , the discovery of Spindletop really means a new age of oil mass production .
The daily output of this site was more than 1 million barrels o oil , which was even more than the sum of output of other sites in the United States .
This made the price of oil in United States decrease very fast at that time .
So the lower price of oil provided a good background for the adoption of Ford's Model T .
the UnitedofthebroaderanalyseBut the Model T was just a beginning of the adoption of cars , another factor whichbecamethe technology of producing cars became more mature was 1 broke out; in 1939 , the World War 2 broke out .
Many countries were involved in these wars .
DuringhBecaused armored transporter becassential for every country .
This caused a big demand for the engineers , designers and machinists .
Many new technologies were invented during the wars .
For example , a very popular hydraulic actuator which is still used today was developed in the early World War 2 .
All this inventions not only increased the useful time of engine , but also improved the overall fortuation of car industry .
the carGovernment policies and ptheiorities also play an important role to the development of indthe engine After World War 2 , the United States became tost developed country in the world .
After the United States won the war , many ordnance factories became civil factories; this made the expansion of car indvehiclesaster .
With ttransportationng of the word's economics , the car industry had already become a very important standard to measure a country's development level .
So the government provided the priority to the car industry .
Especially during the Cold War , in order to demonstrate Ameriearly part ofsuperiority and wethese , the government became more encourusefulnesse car industry .
encouragedthe carIn conclusion , the adoption of car and this technological innovinion was not only tecthe carlogical determined , but also shaped by economic factors , military demands , and government policies and priorities .
An engineering design process , which includes mainly five stages-defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and testing and implementing the solution , plays a very important role in improving the quality of people's lives .
In our daily life , we can easily identify automobiles , laptops , handphones and microwaves as engineering innovations around us .
Take China for instance , the culture for innovation in engineering design is severely lacking .
One factor would be China's rigid education system that produces only a small number of innovative engineers .
It does not help either that the Chinese government is giving very little incentives for innovations in engineering .
As a result , engineers have little motivation to innovate .
Even if they have the motivation , their ideas are unlikely to come true due to the lack of funding from the government .
One of the problems that hampers innovations in engineering may be China's rigid education system which discourages students from being creative .
In China , most teachers spoon-feed their students , and students are instructed to follow standard answers given by the teachers .
When a student finds out an alternative method of solving a problem , there is usually no reward for him and he still has to answer the question in the standard way to avoid losing marks at examinations .
Thus innovation among students is discouraged .
Moreover , students have very little hands-on practice of what they have learnt in class .
Instead , most of their time is spent on solving sample examination problems .
As a result , China's education system produces engineers that are generally weak in doing research and development , which will adversely affect the stage of generating multiple solutions in the engineering design process .
Another problem that poses obstacles to innovation in engineering in China may be the lack of funds from the government for research and development (R&D) , thus engineers are hardly attracted to the R&D industry and the lack of funds to implement their new ideas .
Furthermore , the government gives very little reward to engineers who have done innovative work .
Mr . Yuan Long Ping , who is known as the "Father of Hybrid Rice" , had contributed to tremendous increase in the level of world's rice output through cultivating species of hybrid rice during the 1970's .
His innovation has saved millions of people from hunger all over the world .
However , the Chinese government only awarded him the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award of China in 2000 which was valued at merely 5 million yuan .
This was very little if it was meant to reward him for his more than twenty years' of hard work .
This lack of government support means , engineers will not be able to get resources , raw materials , precise equipment for research during engineering design process .
Thus the stage of testing and implementing solutions during the engineering design process is greatly hampered
In conclusion , the rigid education system and the governments limited incentives for innovations limit the number of innovative engineers and hinder the realization of innovative ideas if any .
These are hence  two prominent obstacles that hamper the engineering design processes for innovations in China .
In many companies , brilliant and capable engineers were often denied the opportunity to express their ideas through innovation .
Engineers in the past were innovative and a vast amount of creative ideas were generated to improve the technology .
However , many of these ideas were rejected by the corporate leaders of various companies .
The leaders were not risk-takers and reflected the ideas to be non-profitable to the company .
Passionate engineers ventured 'in the dark' and started a skunk works project as they were unable to gain their superiors supports .
There are many defining features of a conventionally generated technology with those of a comparable innovation that was created in a skunk works environment .
Skunk works projects do not have access to the full resources of the company , have their own rules and have to maintain confidentiality about their projects .
Skunk works projects have their limitations in terms of resources .
The project is helmed by the project managers and all problems , including technical and administrative , will be handled by them .
The research funds and human resources are not made available to them .
Therefore the project managers will have to find their own financial support to fund their projects .
The construction of the team will not be easy as the choices are limited .
The more capable engineers were already involved with other projects and there can be no way to transfer out without the knowledge of the superiors .
On the other hand , conventional projects have a huge backing from the corporate level .
All administrative issues will be settled in a much shorter time to allow the project to begin earlier .
Also , capable engineers will be assigned to the new project , depending on its priority .
Skunk works projects aim is to develop the innovation .
Hence the rules of the company need not  be enforced in their secret working environment .
Project managers will set the rules for those personnel involved .
There have been extreme examples of rules set by project managers where both emerged successful in their innovations .
In contrast , conventional project personnel have to follow the strict rules of the company .
An image has to be maintained .
Smart dress codes are to be adhered to at all times and working hours should be fully utilized in the company's interest .
The engineers often follow a monotonous lifestyle .
Skunk works projects are secret projects not to be revealed to anyone .
Personnel will have to maintain a double life for this project .
No discussions on the project are to be made .
Personnel often have to stay back late after office hours to work on their secret projects and no claim of overtime is allowed .
Since they are involved in a secret project , no rewards will be guaranteed .
On the contrary , conventional projects engineers take pride in their work .
Special privileges were often granted to those involved in high-profiled projects .
There will also be media coverage and time to time updates on their projects .
Engineers working for conventional projects are more at ease with their jobs .
However they face equal stress on their projects .
They will have to follow their company rules while their leaders support them financially .
Skunk work projects do not have the backing of their leaders , resulting in secrecy and extra work .
Engineers must be highly motivated and passionate to achieve results .
Therefore conventional projects and skunk works projects are different in nature .
However an engineer can be successful as long as he is highly motivated , passionate and diligent .
As mentioned , the development of an intended product is part of the engineering design processes .
For these two processes , an engineer needs to be able to think out of the box .
One possible factor that might hamper such creativity is our educational system .
Singapore's education system has been structured in such a way that it is rigid and text based and does not teach students to apply what is being taught .
There is so much to learn in the syllabus and yet so little time .
Hence , we see chunks of lessons squeezed into packed timetables .
The time needed to fully understand the concepts are usually not enough .
Therefore , many students eventually end up merely memorizing and going through the motion instead of thinking of different ways to apply the knowledge learnt to the real world .
Furthermore , the choice of subjects is very limited and the subjects are mostly of the same nature .
For creativity to be induced , it is important to be exposed to knowledge from various different aspects .
Another portion of the design process involves commercialization .
For a new product or technology to be successful , it is required to be accepted by the public .
Therefore , the society is a big deciding factor for the success or failure of the product launched .
Sadly , society as a whole is generally not that receptive tto new ideas and innovative products .
This is a potential problem which would hamper engineering design processes .
Humans in general , like to stay within their comfort zone and is often unwilling to accept new ideas or changes in their lifestyle .
The new product needs to be widely accepted so that it will be profitable .
Hence , an unreceptive society is not going to generate enough profits to enable the product to be sustainable .
Without profits , engineers will not be able or motivated to continue research and development necessary to improve the products as it is simply not worth it to do so anymore .
An example would be the case of the refrigerator .
Refrigerators currently common in the market are electric refrigerators , which generally produce a "humming" sound .
A soundless refrigerator was in fact produced in 1930 .
However , during that time , large investments went channeled into the research and development of electric refrigerators .
Furthermore , electric refrigerators were more aggressively advertised for .
All these factors led to the downfall of the soundless refrigerator .
In sum , a society which is less receptive of new ideas and innovative products could lead to the hampering of engineering processes for innovation .
In conclusion , there are several factors that play a part in the success of innovative engineering processes .
It is necessary for engineers to exhibit a high level of creativeness .
Moreover , for a new product to succeed in the market , it has to be accepted by the society as they are the ones purchasing the products and making them profitable .
Two problems have been identified which might hamper creativeness in engineers .
Although measures that tackle these problems might have already been introduced , we have yet to witness the effectiveness of these measures .
Despite  the poor environment , tough stress , and high risk , skunkworks indeed value more than conventional technology .
To some extent , conventionally generated technology usually improves our life , but innovation in skunkworks often changes our lives .
Skunkworks- defined to pioneer the development of a technological innovation , normally has  tougher working conditions .
Usually skunkworks cannot get enough support to create a satisfying working environment .
Due to  uncertainty , R&D groups in skunkworks often cannot find enough people to conduct the innovation .
Without initial capital and sufficient crew , the developing process has no way to start .
In addition , it is a fairly stressful job because of the limitation of time and the finance .
Just like the design team at Macintosh , they  worked day and night under the aggressive leadership of Steven Jobs .
By contrast , conventional technologies have well organized systems that can ensure the progress of work .
Seldom do they have a stressful workload .
The starting point of innovation in skunkworks and conventional technology are different .
Innovation in skunkworks is made for solving the potential problems or needs of life .
However , Conventional technologies is made for solving the existing problems or needs .
When NOKIA upgraded its N series hand phone annually , iPhone of the Apple company surprised the world , because it give a different definition to the touch phone .
The success of innovation is generally much more considerable than conventional technology .
Skunkworks takes a high risk in the innovation process , but it is rewarding .
For skunkworks , the entire work can be in vain if the products turn out to be a failure in the market , but still it is rewarding because of the generous profits in case of success .
Moreover , in many cases , the failure in the research can turn out to be a great success in other fields .
Just like "Post-its" of 3M , was initially considered as a failure , but was finally proved to be a great success in other fields .
on the contrary , it is more stable and reliable for conventional technology . 
To sum up , skunkworks usually has a tough environment and a stressful workload .
Furthermore , it is often at a high risk to invest in skunkworks .
However , for the desire of changing the way of how people live , and also for the considerable benefits for companies and human life , innovation in skunkworks plays a more vital role than the conventionally generated technology .
The Compressedhe development of CNG vehicle is determined by thenvironmental factor .
Unlike the normal gasoline vehicle which emits greenhouse and harmful gases , the power of CNG vehicle can emit 70% lesser CO2 and little harmful gas .
Therefore CNG vehicmillionre environmental friendly than gasoline vehicle .
In the context of global warming becoming more and more serious , the development of such environmental friendly vehicles becomes a must .
Many automobile manufacturers (Fiat , Volkswagen , Toyota and others) conducted a lot of research , development and innovations for a number of years using CNG as a fuel source for vehicles .
CNG equipment manufacturers have invested in research and development to improve this technology and make it convenient and available for consumers globally (wikipedia ,2009) .
Apart from reducing the air pollution , Natural gas vehicle also produces lower noise levels than gasoline vehicle .
This is another positive feature of CNG vehicle .
The greater use of CNG vehicles for public transportation will result in a quieter urban environment , which will be a plus for our living environment .
(Lim , 2001) Thus , it is the environmental factor that spurred the development of CNG vehicle .
Moreover , the intention of reducing the fuel cost also shaped the develovehiclesf CNG vehicle .
The oil embargo resulted energy crisis in the U .S . during the 1980's .
Such situthe CNGon motivated the discovery of alternative fuels that could reduce our dvehiclescareon forenvironmentally The scientists found a vehicleshod that could compress natural gas in a smaia  morewserious problemn be put inside a car .
Witenvironmentallypment , the modern CNG vehicle became possible .
From 2000's , the oil price grew tremendously , but the price of natural gas was much less .
In order to reduce the fuel cost , many people preferred CNG cars in that period .
More owners of private cars country wanted to convert their petrol-driven vehicles to also run on CNG .
This actually spurred the manufacturers to improve the technology of conversion from gasoline vehicle to dual-fuel vThe naturalso that the cost can be reduced and more car owners could bevehiclesrom the CNG technology .
Lastly , the development of CNG vehicle is also influenced by the government policies .
Due to the increase of the oil price and the necessity of improvement of the urban environment , many countries' governments support the development of CNG vehicle .
Many countries which are abundant of natural gas introduce CNG cars and buses to their public transportations .
For example , in countries of South American , such as Argentina and Brazil , there are about 3 million CNG vehicles which are mainly used as taxicabs .
Some other governments provide tax rebate for the owners of CNG vehicles , so that to incentivize the using of eco-friendly vehicles .
For instants , the Singapore government provided 40% discount on the Open Market Value (OMV) cost of newly-registered green passenger vehicles from 2001 in order to build up the intensity of CNG vehicles (wikipedia ,2009) .
With the help of the favorable policies and sponsorship from the government , more talented people are attracted to the CNG vehicle industry research .
As a result the CNG vehicle technology is shaped by the government policies .
In conclusion , CNG vehicle technology is a socially determined technology .
Without the requirements of cheaper and cleaner vehicle and the governmental support , it might not as well-developed as now .
In recent years , with its growing prosperity and affluence , China is investing more on science and technology development .
However , the lack of research funding and an inflexible education system , in my opinion , has significantly hampered engineering design process in China .
On top of that , an inflexible education system in China has also hampered its engineering design process .
In order to come out with a new product , the engineers must be able to think out of the box and possess practical skills .
However , the education system in China does not train the student to think creatively and provide few chances for the students to put what they learn into practice .
The education in China is very much exam-oriented .
The students study hard in order to excel in exams .
The only aim of the students seems to be doing well in the university entrance examination and being enrolled into renowned universities .
In the so-called cramming method of teaching , teachers pay particular attention to memorization , even at the cost of comprehension .
During the examination , the students are evaluated by how much they memorize , and not on how they think .
Such a rigid education system has significantly hindered students' creativity and poorly equipped them to apply knowledge in the real world .
In conclusion , the lack of research funding and an exam-oriented education system are the two most significant factors which have hampered engineering design process in China .
However , in its eleventh Five-Year Plan , the Chinese government has promised to increase the R&D spending to 2 .5 percent of GDP by the end of 2010 .
Also , the education system in well developed cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is under restructure to better prepare the younger generation to compete in the globalized world .
Thus , the condition of engineering design in China may have a more positive outlook in the future .
The hard tomato program and the discovery of Warfarin started differently .
The program of hard tomato varieties began withe 1970's ,idea .
A California agriculture professor foresaw a future labor shortage in California and came up with a roughmachinesf tomatoes that could be picked by machine .
Then , he proposed this idea to his institution and got the research started .
However , the discovery of Warfarin happened during another research .
Prof Link , the discoverer of Warfarin , was involved in a research of sweet clove disease at that time .
After about ten years' research , he discovered Warfarin one day in an unrelated experiment , which turned out to be the most impressive progress in the whole research .
The big profit made by the patent was used to support other research projects of Madison professors , provide financial aid to doctoral students and cover other research expenses .
Moreover , the progresses of the two technologies are not alike .
The hard tomato program followed a whole procedure of research works .
A group of scientists were gathered together in an institution .
They were supposed to use the scientific approach to solve various unexpected problems occurring in the research .
In the process , development was extremely important .
Not only should the scientists figure out how to breed the variety , but also they needed to do other non-research works in order to successfully put the variety into practice .
They also cared aboof researchommercialization part .
All of these included building a prototype of the machine used to pick the tomatoes , contacting producers who were willing to sell their products , making their research results known to the local farmers and collecting their feedbacks to improve .
Finally , they came up with their research results after many years' research , in due time according to their plan .
years ofthey alsoIn contrast , in the case of Warfarin , the process was a reversed one .
The product came out first accidentally , followed up with some research to get a better understanding of the discovery .
Warfarin was put into practice directly after it , because its use was totally known when discovering it .
The whole process was highly effective and by chance .
No one expected it before head .
In conclusion , the mechanized tomtechnologiesm has different start , process and key to suweress from the discovery of Warfarin .
a contributionturnsare notas engineersenvironmentComparing to conventional generated technology , "Skunk works" has a greausinglo become a big fail ,Lifehas becomelso has a potential to be successful .
It is comfortable for engineers to make technology work and to optimize a design under en condition .
Whereas , a well optimized design is worthless if it cannot meet the desires , or at least needs , of the customers .
Therefore , on rejectthout sufficient market research , "Skunk works" is faced with a higabouttential to be a failure .
On the other han" can these ccess in market .
Like E .M . Rogers mentioned in his article -"the Birth of the Laptop Computer at Toshiba" , laple of successful "Skunk works" .
On the contrary , conventional generated technology is much safer than "Skunk works" , it can bring steady profit to its company , but , to most cin the future playing safe is not enough to compete with their competitors .
"Skunk works" and conventional projects are different , but botvery differentg contribution to the development of technology .
Conventional generated technologies are closely connected to our life .
By doing sufficient market research , technologies are controlled to provide things that can fulfill our desires , and these technoloworkmake our life become more and more convenient .
"Skunk works" care more about technology itself , and its aim is to produce the most advanced and optimized designs .
Therefore , "Skunk works" can promote the innovation of technology , and it also provides a big platform for creative engineers .
In sum , "Skunk works" environment is much tougher than conventional environment , ana contributionks" is more like a gamble for a comConventionallymay either be a big success or be an absolute failure .
The conventional generated technology plays an importaling people's need and bringing profit to copaniety of technology's steady and continuous deveprovide However , "Skunk works" provide a platform for engineers with great creativity , and it is a necessity in technology's evolution .
Therefore , both of technological innovationand alsoelopment .
With the largestpulation and adChinaural resources , China has developed quite well .
However , nowadays new technology is playing a more and more important role in the whole society and replacing the importance of resources .
However , there are two significant problems in China restricting the development of the technology .
One of them is that the intellectual property rights in China are not protected well; there are many illegal copy phenomena in China .
The other problem is that the normal employees in many companies are not valued much by the employers .
we all know , pirated software is very popular in China .
One of the reasons is tate of the popularity of computer is much faster than the rate of the increase of consumption level in China , which means that the price of the software is relatively highehan that theirmal people can accept .
Therefore , pirated softwarand there in .
However , piracopiesseverely limits the development of sofre in China .
Because of the low price of pirated software , normal people usually prefer the cheaper one , pirated software .
Subsequently , the inventor of the very software can only get a little profit , which will not impel him or her to continue paying much attention to the innovation .
Some other people who want to make profit by inventing new software will also be affected by the phenomena .
As a result , fewer and fewer people will try to invent software in China .
Without innovation , software in China developed very slowly .
When we compare the software area and the space flight area , we can easily find that space flight area of China develops extremely fast because of innovation while software develops slowly with little innovation .
Therefore , illegal copy phenomena restrict the development of the technology in China .
The phenomena of illegal copiesot inspirited also limits the innovation in technology .
There is no doubt that China has developed fast and well since the foundation of the country .
Howevepopularity rate of computershas increased terprises in China , we will of the huge entlevelsses are public and relied on resources anonopoly .
Huge enterprises which relin high technology are very few .
One of the reasons is that normal employrestrictsnot inspirited to take part in the innovation .
In many companies , only some certain research staffs take part in the innovation of technology while normal employees just do their routine work .
Compared to profonal research staffs , normal employees have more experience about certain productions .
As the employers do nohow much respect to normal employees , few employees will try their best to provide their experience to research staffs .
Without practical experience , research and innovation are difficult to achieve .
We probably know that IBM employers value every employee in the company .
Many employees have a chance to put up a suggestion to the company .
With the largints of outcomes of experience and observation , research staffs can achieve new production relatively more easily .
Therefthe illegal copy phenomenayees are not inspirited restrs the innovation of technology in China .
inspiredstaffmakeIt is well known staffstaffstaffTherefore , China should pay more attention on intl property rights to encourage people to innovate .
Utheimportant because different peopleis changed , it can be foundt opinions .
Unite everyone can maximize the abilitrelyhe whole unity .
One way to unite everyone is to shorelyect to everyone .
China needs to solve these two problems to clear the way to innovatio
Another major problem that engineers might face in Singapore is that people are less receptive to innovations and ideas as compared to  Western countries .
The older generation is especially resistant to change , and would rather use products that they are used to .
Thus , despite the presence of new innovations that would greatly improve their way of life , they might not be so accepting of these new products .
This would affect the testing and implementation of the solution during the process .
When surveying the feasibility of the solution , results would not be accurate as the target group of an older age would generally be less supportive towards the new idea .
If the customer base for the new innovation is too small , investors will be less willing to provide funds to fund research and development of new innovations and products , therefore affecting the whole design process .
In conclusion , it is inevitable that there will be problems that might affect the various stages of the design process .
However , measures have definitely been taken to tackle these problems .
For example , the education system has now definitely improved in terms of its rigidity .
Since 2005 , the Ministry of Education (MOE) has introduced Project Work (PW) to junior colleges in order to improve communicative skills of students , as well as to encourage building of teamwork among students .
Hopefully in the near future , more effort will be put in to encourage society to be more accepting of new innovations that would greatly change their way of life for the better , and also to encourage in not just aspiring engineers but in students in general , skills that they are able to use and apply in handling problems in the real world .
Rapid industrialization is one of the main economic boosters that characterize today's society .
Singapore is a good example of such a society .
Since the 1960s , there has been a paradigm shift from  low end industrialization to  high end industrialization thus resulting in a rapid depletion of the already scarce resources .
Land scarcity is one of the pressing human needs that may require immediate attention .
Engineering design processes are therefore created to meet the above mentioned human needs .
One  such engineering design processes is gathering pertinent information .
It is essential in minimizing the problems that arise due to land scarcity in Singapore .
According to Khandani , "Efforts spent searching for information about your problem . . .reveal facts about the problem . . .discover mistakes and false starts ."
Researching land scarcity problems can help one to prioritize by deciding on the more important infrastructure to build to strike a balance between social and economic needs .
For example , high rise flats are built to help prevent overcrowding and to sustain the population while mega infrastructures like the Integrated Resort are for economic purposes .
By prioritizing , one can efficiently make use of scarce land material for maximal benefits .
The other process is the generation of multiple solutions .
According to Khandani , "Creative abilities can be developed if one is willing to take risks and is not afraid to tackle problems ."
The lack of land is a challenging problem to the leaders of Singapore thus engineers have to come up with innovative solutions to tackle land scarcity .
In Singapore , a few solutions have been carried out to help solve land scarcity issues .
Some of these solutions are land reclamation , condensed structural landscapes and the construction of sky scrapers .
One of the final processes is to analyse and select a solution .
According to Khandani , Ergonomics is crucial in the designing process because production of final products must not result in disaster .
For example , the construction of Nicole Highway initially resulted in injuries but after detailed analysis made by relevant experts , the final product is on its way to completion without casualty .
Construction of sky scrapers is relatively safe despite their height due to deep analytical insights in the construction of these buildings .
As a result , the final products serve its purpose without imposing damage to the surroundings .

Toshiba's laptop and Microsoft's operating systems are two technologies that were created under different conditions and environments .
Toshiba's laptop is often known as a skunk work innovation whereas Microsoft'sis known  as a conventionally created product .
The key difference in these two products is the support they received during the creation process .
However , both are known to be successful creations .
The first difference is the lack of support for the creation of Toshiba's laptop as compared to Microsoft's operating system .
According to Rogers , due to the fact that Toshiba's laptop creator Tetsuya Mizoguchi failed to convince his superiors in Toshiba to support his laptop project , he was not able to receive any research and development funding .
The funds would have been useful to help him cover the cost of production .
Furthermore , his superiors refused to assign experienced engineers to aid him .
(1)
In comparison , although Bill Gates himself is the boss of Microsoft , he received much external support .
In January 1975 , the president of Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) agreed to let Gates and his partner to develop a program for MITS new microcomputer .
It would be useless if there was no hardware for Gates' program to work on .
With this , he went on to create new programs with the support of his entire team at Microsoft .
(2)
The vision of these two innovators also differs .
Bill Gates' way of running the business is largely monopolistic .
According to the article (2) , Gates actually wrote to computer hobbyists demanding that they pay for the usage of his program so as to allow him to continue to write quality programs .
In May 1998 , Microsoft was accused of abusing its monopoly power to keep rivals out of the market .
Its operating system is believed to favour Microsoft's web browser and not other competing browsers like the Netscape Navigator and Opera .
(3)
On the other hand , Mizuguchi's idea was to create a laptop that was compatible with IBM's platform despite the fact that they were competing for the same market share .
He recognised that IBM was dominant at the time and that it would be fair to  consumers to allow them to use an IBM compatible peripheral Toshiba laptop .
If Mizoguchi had done otherwise , people would probably only buy Toshiba's laptop for its convenience .
Despite the difference in both technologies , there is actually one similarity between them .
That is , both are largely successful .
Mizoguchi , with his perseverance and determination , finally sold the highly demanded laptops in Europe .
By 1988 , Toshiba commanded almost half the market share in Japan , despite the fact that there were many competitors . 
Similarly for Microsoft , Gates rode on the success of IBM's personal computer by becoming the full owner of a program that was written especially for IBM's personal computer .
The program was then sold to IBM , without the copyright .
This  allowed them to have a monopoly in the industry .
In conclusion , despite the fact that both skunk work and conventionally created technologies differ in the environment where they are being produced , they will still be successful if their creators have the determination and are full of ideas .
The birth of new technologies and inventions come about in different forms and through different processes .
Although the innovations may be comparably similar , the conditions where they were created may be totally different .
An example would be  the case of conventionally invented electric cars by General Motors and the first laptop that was invented in a skunk works environment by an engineer from Toshiba .
There are certain differences and similarities between these two .
Differences like , risks involved , working environments , marketing strategies and similarities like the visions and goals of both innovations .
The first difference between the two types of innovation is risks involvement and work stress .
For conventionally generated technology , companies would select a team or department and assign tasks to them .
Then , they would set out to complete their tasks , without having to calculate the risks involved because these are what they are supposed to do .
For skunk works  created technology , the person who suggested the innovation has to take very big risks because it is their own project , theyare not supported by companies , only their own team .
As mentioned in Rogers' article on the 'Birth of laptops' , Tetstiya Mizoguchi , a Japanese technologist , disobeyed orders and risked his career for the sake of innovation-development which in the endwas successful .
Therefore , risk taking is unavoidable in skunk works .
Secondly , the processes in which the new technology are designed and carried out  are totally different between the two types of innovations .
The electric car was researched and built by the R&D department from General Motors .
The team had full funding from the company to support their costs in researching and designing electric motor cars .
On the other hand , Tetstiya Mizoguchi who led the invention of the first laptop , had no team initially and was not funded by his company because his proposal of creating a laptop , was rejected by his company .
Therefore , people who are working in a skunk works environment have to gather their own team and a substantial amount of money before they can actually start on their project .
As such , because of limited funds the team or individual have in skunk works , they have more stress because they cannot afford to fail .
Because of disapproval from companies , the working space for skunk works innovation is usually smaller and limited as compared to those who work under companies to create new technology .
As mentioned in Rogers' article  , Tetstiya Mizoguchi and his team went 'underground' and worked at a factory which was far away from Toshiba's headquarters .
Therefore , for skunk works innovations , people have to find their own team , funding , and workspace to carry out their project .
The third difference is the limitations of marketing .
For conventional innovations headed by big companies , they have their own marketing department to advertise and test their products .
They have the ability to make their products appealing to the public and attract them to test their prototypes .
In the case study of the creation of electric motor cars by General Motors written by Rogers , General Motors went to the extent of putting advertisements in newspapers and came out with marketing campaigns to publicise their new product .
On the contrary , products or technology created from a skunk works environment do not have the capabilities to roll out massive campaigns to advertise due to the lack of funds .
They have to depend on their own network to publicise their product and introduce their prototypes to the public .
Comparing the two articles written by Rogers , the target group for skunk works prototypes testing usually started small , and then eventually became bigger as more people accepted the product; whereas in the case of conventionally created products , the target group is very large in the beginning due to large scale marketing campaigns .
The similarity between the innovations created under different environments is that both  wanted to come out with solutions to solve problems that were present .
In the case of Toshiba's first laptop invention , Tetstiya Mizoguchi wanted to solve the problem which most Japanese companies faced ,  crowded offices which prevented the usage of more desktops due to the lack of space; while , electric motor cars were created to lessen pollution .
In conclusion , there are various differences and similarities between conventional or skunk works innovations , but at the end of the day , both have produced products that have helped to solve problems and bring benefits to the people of the world .
In 1943 , Abraham Maslow published a theory on  the hierarchy of needs of people .
In his study , he defined five stages of needs; they are , in descending order of importance , physiological , safety , love and belonging , esteem and finally self-actualization .
In view of the world today ,  engineers should tackle the most important human need  .
This is of course one of our basic physiological needs , water , which is imperative in sustaining life . .
The five stage engineering design process , as proposed by Khandani , will guide engineers in making solutions to solve this problem . 
Potable water , the source of life , has become  in third world countries .
Drinking water that has not been treated  can lead to life threatening diseases .
According to the World Health Organization report in the year 2000 , Africa , home to a population of 784 million people , faces dire shortages of clean and disease free drinking water .
Furthermore , it is the continent with the least supply of potable water .
Nearly 48% of its human population has no immediate access to water supplies .
This is clearly a problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible .
According to Khandani , the first step is to define the problem of the water shortage in Africa .
It is important that engineers realize the true root of the problem , so as not to waste resources on a solution that does not work .
For instance , one may think of solving the water shortage by building desalination plants throughout the coast of Africa ,  only to realize that he or she did not address the problem  at all .
Because the water shortage may not lie in the quantity of water , but rather in the ease of access to potable water in Africa .
Hence , the first stage of the engineering design process has to be thought out carefully .
The second step is to research  the shortage of potable water .
Engineers have to understand why current technology has failed to solve the water shortage , and the oversights of engineers of the previous technology .
For example , a company has produced "LifeStraw" , a portable device that processes safe drinkable water  by removing microscopic bacteria through its filters .
Something like this may seem like a godsend to the people of Africa , but  its downfall is its cost and the problem of transportation of filtered water .
Therefore , a thorough understanding of the limitations of technology can guide engineers to invent a product that fulfills all the criteria .
The third step is to brainstorm various solutions to water shortage in Africa .
Khandani believes that engineers must be creative in this thought process .
Engineers have to develop solutions that fit the bill , adhering to the requirements of the water shortage .
Subsequently , in the fourth step , they would have to rate and outweigh all of their ideas and determine the best one to implement . 
Lastly , the fifth step is to make and test the developed technology .
This allows engineers to troubleshoot problems in the device and make changes prior to production .
This ensures the product meets expectations  .
In a nutshell ,  the five stages of engineering design introduced by Khandani can help engineers plan and develop solutions to solving the water shortage in Africa , thereby saving countless lives in dire need of safe drinking water .
Back in 1943 , while working on the secret project P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter , one of the team engineers in Lockheed Martin Corporation , Irv Curler answered a call by saying "Skonk Works , inside man Culver speaking ."
The name was soon adopted for usage in engineering , business and technical field to describe a small group of people  working on secret projects (How Skunkworks Got Its Name , par .2) .
Skunkworks have been a huge contributor for  invention for many decades .
Therefore , skunkworks drive  innovation to conventionally generated technology .
In comparison with conventionally generated technology , skunkworks have minimal management constraints .
Therefore they are often used to roll out  product research before it is developed according to usual business processes .
With minimal management constraints , inventors are given freedom to research  the area they want .
While everyone takes Macintosh as a classic example of skunkworks , Facebook was created under the same circumstances .
Facebook was started off as a small networking site for college students , which slowly extended to be the most popular global networking site With the help of a few roommates , Mark created Facebook with limited resources .
However , Mark was given the freedom to develop the program .
With no management pressure , Mark could add on any application on Facebook , which soon turned out to be the main ingredient in fueling  its success .
As mentioned , skunkworks  always lack  resources ,  .
As a start-up , Facebook didn't have the funding which its competitor , Myspace had .
As the history suggests , Myspace had everything  when they first launched , including funding .
The site was designed by the experienced eUniverse engineers(Myspace , History; par .2) .
Unlike Facebook , Myspace used its resources to push its program to the masses .
Thus , they got instant popularity in the beginning .
However , Facebook trounced Myspace recently , setting its user numbers to a record high .
It can clearly be seen that , skunkworks are no loser to conventional technology despite funding problems .
While conventionally generated technology are opened to the public , skunkworks undertake secret projects .
Before Facebook was created , Mark hacked into the Harvard School system to get the information of all the students  .
He posted the information up on a site called Facemash which paired photos of undergraduates with the visitors(Facebook , History; par .
1) .
Soon Harvard yanked Mark's connection .
Nevertheless , Mark didn't stop right there .
Instead , he scarified his sleeping time to program another program to replace Facemash , which is the Facebook we all are using today .
He started off the program alone without opening it to public before it was launced .
Myspace took a different approach to show the public what they were doing .
The underlying reason could be the confidence Myspace had over their program because of the size of their resources which Facebook didn't have .
Although there are many differences between skunkworks and conventional technology , both of them drive innovation in the same way as the other .
Despite the fact that the approaches they take are obviously different , they share the same goal , which is to innovate  future products .
Either Facebook or Myspacecan be used share information without borders .
They are competing with each other by introducing new features .
Thereby , the healthy competition between both parties should improve one another .

And knowing more of the information makes our design process more effectively (Khandani , p10 , 2005) .
In this case , the definiliving standardsNew eto satisfyources: energy sources except the fossil fuel have a reasonable price , are sustainable and belong to green energy .the energy supply are: the new energy should be safe;e energy should be sustainable; the energy should not create pollution; the price of the energy should be acceptable .

Since engineerse the most isuch as ,t in discovering new energy sources and the aim of their work is to meet people's needs , they should give priority to the development of new energy .
Since 2000 , the government has been driving Singapore towards a Knowledge-based Economy .
On one hand , much effort and funding has been put into our education system to prepare our people for the Knowledge-based Economy .
On the other hand , Singapore has always encouraged companies , regardless of their size , to do more in Research and Development (R&D) .
The reason for doing  is thatour government has realised the importance of R&D in Singapore's progress as a nation .
Although much effort and funding has been spent on R&D , some problems still exist to significantly hinder engineering design processes for innovations .
The first problem that hinders engineering design processes for innovations is the  influence of monetary profit .
The technology , which is selected to be commercialised by corporate manufacturers , must offer the greatest profits to the corporate manufacturers .
Therefore , in most cases , the technology that is selected is usually not the technology with the most advantages to the consumers , for example , the commercialisation of the humming electric refrigerator .
Around 1930 , there were two prototype refrigeratorselectric refrigerator and the the gas refrigeratorr .
Gas refrigerators did not produce the humming sound and had overwhelming advantages over the electric refrigerators .
But , the electric refrigerator was selected over the gas refrigerator because General Electric believed that larger profit could be made from the electric refrigerator .
This is understandable because the main purpose of corporate manufacturers in their investment in R&D is for profit .
Because such influence affects the commercial , diffusion and adoption stages of the engineering design process , companies will chose to promote the innovation which will bring the most profit to them and to the public .
Thus , many great innovations have been destroyed prematurely because of their lack of promotion to the public .
The second problem that hinders engineering design processes for innovations is that  Singaporeans , are not as creative as our counterparts , for example the Americans , Japanese and Taiwanese .
It is because , in the past , our education system was more exam-oriented and theoretical . .
Thus , knowledge was only applied in examinations , without applying it in real-life situations .
There was not much need and opportunity to think and act creatively .
However , in recent years , the government has been actively promoting creative thinking  .
For instance , project work in junior college will post real life problems to the students .
Thus , students are supposed to think of creative solutions to solve these problems .
Although the plans that promote creative thinking  were started years ago , it is still in its initial stage .
Thus , it will take time for the plan to take its full effect .
In conclusion , some problems may significantly hinder engineering design processes for innovations , but Singapore is trying its best to solve these problems .
In addition , in this imperfect world , engineers are always solving problems that arise to make a better world .
A problem will not last infinitely , it will be solved eventually .
an unsatisfying engineering education system .
Firstly , many companies lack money to supdevelopmentations in their product design .
As I mthe manufacturing industryturing companies onhina are running their business in a small-scale .
Wmanythey manage to do is making their designs slight different from other similar ones , which make their products quite elastic in the market .
These companies have to take the price from the market , which indicates a meagre profit .
And that is why they do not the Chinese marketneThis is probably due to the lack of innovation down .
Moreover , even if companies have enough money to support innovative design ,each other'say not do so .
In Chinese emerging market , not allexpecting thatin innovation are rewarding .
Instead , ollowing others is proved to be more prarises ,ble sohamperss .
Another group of companies are manufacturing products for large transnational corporations , which do not care about design .
has provedinvestmentsthe emerging Chinese  marketIn most casesSecondly , the engineering education is not focusing so much on innovation but memorizing .
This limits engineers' ideas when they are designing products .
Thus , enginonrs are more likely to use the similar moduto maket they learn inslightlyl or university instead of bothering to comakeser another , perhaps a better , way .
According to Dr . Seyyed Khandani , five steps for solving engineering problems are:
* Define tproblem
2 .define the problem; gather pertinent information; generate multiple solutions; analyze and select a solution; and test and implement the solution . 
Behind prosperity of the products "made in China" during the last few years , it is lack of innovations in products oand other steps are unfortunately neglected .
the main reasons why we lack innovation are high costs and low rewards of innovation in China and unsatisfying engineering education system .
I hope things are starting to change now .
The common challenges faced by  developed and developing countries are the daily demands for improvement in various areas , be it economy , infrastructure or even society .
Nation building is never easy; hence governments worldwide engage specialists , engineers in particular , for assistance .
Engineers plying their trades in Singapore , however , will face two major problems  which  are potentially critical in the future development of the city-state .
Singapore , besides being famous for its airport and most recently named as the best place for business by the World Bank , is also famous because of its size .
Hence , local engineers encounter their first major test in their quest: limited land space .
With just 647 square kilometres of land area , it has always been an essential as well as historical issue for the country's development .
Land limitation greatly reduces the range of technological advances local engineers can create in our country .
For example , lack of wide drainage areas force us to adapt building waste water reclamation plants instead , which admittedly drew ridicule from our neighbouring countries .
Despite ongoing plans to build a third plant , Singapore is still rather reliant on Malaysia for the sale of water .
Reclamation of land from the ocean was also limited due to sensitivity of border issues , thus hindering any designs that require huge spaces .
Burning of waste materials hence provide our major source of energy instead of bulky power plants .
Past engineering miracles in housing now require an upgrade in innovation and design due to the cultural shift in our society , as the younger generation now demands quality unlike the past , when the more crucial task was providing a roof for every citizen .
There is another common global issue , muchworse in Japan , and that is the ageing population crisis  .
Entry into the 21st century provides the world with a whole new set of problems: pandemic flu , terrorism and the emergence of a group of senior citizens .
Singapore has no chance of avoiding it as it also experienced a post war 'baby boom' period during the 1960s .
A new research report revealed that Singapore is set to be the world's third- fastest ageing nation , as the proportion of those aged 65 and above will double to 20 per cent in 2020 (The Straits Times , June 28 , 2008) .
Adding  to this problem , Singapore , being a small country , has always faced a talent crisis .
Low birth rates coupled with the outflow of local talent forces the government to resort to adopting a foreign talent scheme in order to increase the talent pool in the city .
An ageing population creates a new dilemma to engineers working on their designs , because they have to rebuild or edit all their past creations so as to be 'elderly-friendly' , a phenomenon unheard of during the early days of nation building .
This will be a somewhat testing task as they cannot rely on any past references in Singapore , so any designs will be a risk taken by them .
These two new obstacles in the 21st century will prove to be a huge challenge to the new generation of engineers in Singapore .
However ,  what Singapore's short history has shownis that it has faced countless daunting tasks and has proven to be up to the mark .
Therefore ,there is no doubt our engineers will strive and succeed in their tasks ahead .
Nowadays we are living infast developing world which provides not only abundant goods but also convenient and functional productions .
People's increasing desire for higher living qualities push our engineers to work on designing new things .
While , things does not get on as it seems to be .
Many negative factors exert on the processes for innovations that significantly hamper the design .
Now focus on the things in my home country , China , there are two main factors: the overflow of copying and lack of money .
The overflow of copying is a serious phenomenon especially in China .
When a famous company releases a new product , some smalproduction or just workshops will soon copy the design of the product and sell "their products" at a much lower price .
w product , the company will oney and a lot of time .
The engineers keep working and working , trial and error , wishing to invent a best seller and have a good benefit .
While , the workshops who simply copy the design just do the procedure directly with low prime cost .
Usually customers will not discriminate the products and they consider the price as the main point .
After the great effort , the company will not receive the benefit as they wish , which will definitely cool down their desire to innovate .
Thus , the overflow of copying really hamper the processes for innovation .
Despite the political impact onhave been facinghave facedar technologies in the less develolitary forces are likely to exert a similar impact on development of nuclear power in those more developed countries .
For instance , the US militaThis case clearly presentss viable source to provhave structured for the military uses .
Due to logistic reason combined with the unstoppable depletion rate , scientists in the United State is diverting most of theirincreased into research of how to make nuclear power as a readily mobile and less dangerous energyurce for military uses .
useonarereasonsusea viable sourceIn conclusion , the recent innovan and development have showed the impact of political , military and other social factors .
Moreover , they arthe development of nuclear powerinfluence in the future .
Similar to the development of technology ,  innovation has become more and more important all over the world .
In order to survive and develop in the competitive world , it is crucial for not only many countries , but also  individuals to fully develop the process for innovations .
According to Rogers (2003) , there are six main stages of this process , namely the needs and problems , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and the stage of consequences .
However , in some countries there are still many problems which restrict the development of these stages .
Take China as an example , there are two main problems  hampering the development of innovation .
First of all , the education system has a big effect on the process of recognizing the problems or needs which is the fundamental stage of the innovation-development process .
It is true that the Chinese  education system excels  in laying the solid foundations of knowledge and skills which are also very important in doing  research and studies , but the lack of flexibility and creativeness of the Chinese education system is still a big problem .
As a result , many students get used to accepting  information  without thinking and investigating by themselves .
Consequently , it becomes quite difficult for them to discover  potential problems even when they try  to  .
However , Innovation requires students to develop the ability of discovering problems instead of being easily satisfied with the current situation or just following the rules .
In fact , most  famous inventions or significant scientific discoveries are based on the ability of questioning .
If Watt did not realize the shortcomings of the traditional streamer , the age of stream maybe would not have been invented so fast .
If Galileo did not challenge and had simply accepted the statements presented by Aristotle thousands of years ago , people may not have realized the nature of free fall motion for a long time .
Without the awareness of recognizing or discovering  problems , the innovation process cannot proceed smoothly .
In addition to the education problems ,  economic development is also one of the important limitations for China .
General speaking , the success of innovation needs a lot of prerequisites .
Not only  human resources , but also  financial resources have an impact on the development of innovation .
The implementation of many big projects or innovations requires large amounts of economic support .
Indeed , the economy of China is accelerating at high speed  .
However , it is really hard to meet all the needs of the rapid innovation-development  .
Compared with some developed countries , China still cannot provide large amounts of financial aid to encourage and support scientists and engineers in doing the process of research and in putting these innovations into practice .
In a nutshell , for the importance of developing the processes of innovation , it is  necessary to solve these existing problems  .
Only if China tries to minimize these potential limitations , will the innovation-development processes succeed and flourish .
There is a distinctive difference in the aims and the expected results achieved fwas the experiments that resulted in penicillin and in-vitro fertilization due to the element of luck .
Rogers (2003) suggested that reonrches with the objective of providing solutions for ofertilizing in solutiospermt are useful for another mother .
Thed , for the wasse of penicillin , research .
not anticipate the discovery of penicillin , a type of antibiotics , when he was making researches on the characteristics of bacteria .
it can be seennd , In-vitro fertilization is researched upon and invented with the primarily objective of conceiving babies outside the wombs of mothers .
Therefore , there is a difference in the objectives of the two experiments in the setup - one set and achieved its goals and the other , set goals but achieved other results .
However , despite the difference in the expected results of the experiments leading to the discovery of penicillin and in-vitro fertilization , the environments in which both technologies were developed and the proresearchen are similar .
Fleming did his experiments in his laboratory as he was a professor in a hospital .
Likewise , Carl Wood (founder of in-vitro fertilization) and various other scientists did their experiments on the in-vitro feantibiotic techniques ondoing researchoratories too .
After the discovery of anti-bacteria subsinnce , Fleming did his wassearches to ove on the results just like what the researchers for In-vitro fertilization did .
Both the technologies have to go through laboratory testing and many other processes before the final formula is derived .
Hence , both the technologies are developed in a laboratory environment with sufficient equipments for their testing and both requires extra steps even after discovering the correct method of making the technology .
requiredequipmentwerehadinresearchan anti-bacterialIn addition , both the technologies are developed not only by the person who founded the technology .
Penicillin was actually extracted successfully from the fungus by Ernst Chain .
("Alexander Fleming" , Wikipedia) Also , in-vitro fertilization would not be successful if not for other researchers such as John Rock , Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards besides Carl Wood .
("In vitro fertilization" , Wikipedia)
Furthermore , both penicillin and inweretro fertilizatijustave similar impacts on mankind .

In conclusion , even though penicillin's discovery was accidena similar impact from the comparishave both broughto technologies that the invention is actually comparable to those developed by researches .
The developments of both technologies are similar in terms of the complexity of the processes and the impacts of the technologies are equivalent .
Many countries are faced with the problem of an aging population .
As the elder population grows larger and larger , the burden on the younger generation and the government becomes greater and greater .
Some people say that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
I think the government can implement positive policies to limit the money spent on the elderly indirectly .
Encouraging a later retirement and giving out subsidies based on the financial need are efficient ways to reduce the amount of money spent on the growing population of the aged .
The government has to limit the money given to the elderly because the expanded population of the elderly can lead to serious problems in economy , society and productivity .
Spending increase for the aged will surely reduce the country's total deposits and thus reduce the general social investment , imposing a negative impact on the sustainable , coordinated , steady and fast development of the nation's economy .
({http://bbs .chinadaily .com .cn/redirect .php ?gid=2&fid=6&tid=58116}[HYPERLINK: http://bbs .chinadaily .com .cn/redirect .php ?gid=2&fid=6&tid=58116]&goto=nextoldset) Encouraging the later retirement is a effective method to solve this problem .
First of all , it is good for employers .
As the aging population becomes larger , more people retire than  usual .
It can be predicted that more people will leave their work and fewer people can enter the work force .
If people can retire at a later time , the company can keep a balance of the work force .
Furthermore , longer work lives can certainly increase  productivity of the nation .
On one hand , the elderly can feed themselves without the pension from the government .
On the other hand , the amount of the tax will go up as the productivity increases .
Therefore , the government can give out more benefits .
This method is used by the countries which are confronted with the aging problem , for example , China , Canada .
Now it is accepted and used by more countries .
Giving out subsidies based on the financial need is another policy that government can make to reduce the pressure and burden .
Not all the elderly people need the help from the government .
For some people , they had saved enough money when they were young or they can still make their living when they are old or they are supported by their children .
They are able to ensure their quality of life for the rest of their lives .
These people do not need the pension from the government .
However , some people cannot live without the pension from the government .
Usually these people do not have a good education or they have some disabilities .
The government has the duty to take care of them .
If the government can give out the pensions according to the financial need , the amount of money spent on the elderly will not climb rapidly even if the aging population increases at an incredible speed .
Australia has already taken this policy and more countries are taking this policy into consideration .
Some people may say that the government should treat every citizen equally .
Hence , it is unreasonable to choose people to give out the subsidies .
Although every citizen has the same right , the government must ensure the living condition of its people first .
Giving everyone a pension means that some people's living standard will be affected but giving out money based on the fanatical need means everyone can live in a good condition .
The pension is not important to the people who are able to live a good life in their twilight years .
However , the subsidy is essential to the people who are not capable of feeding themselves .
Thus , the government should choose people to give out pension .
Although more and more countries are faced with the aging problem , the government can make some policies like encouraging later retirement and giving out money based on financial needs .
These policies can both limit the money spent on the elderly and ensure the living standard of its people .
Everyone will grow old one day; it is just another phase in life .
With every phase in life , comes its own set of problems .
Throughout the process of aging , people will face certain problems relating to health , finance , and socialization; and many of these problems are usually interrelated .
Just like every set of lock comes with a set of keys , every set of problems comes with their own set of solutions .
Now , with the help of technological advancements and the reforms of government policies , the aging process has certainly been made easier to a large extent .
Extensive research and development has been done in the medical field to make our lives easier .
Through research and development , new technologies are being created .
With the help of these technologies , many possibilities have emerged .
Diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past are now curable .
Many diseases can be detected earlier and thus prevented .
Also , many age-related problems can be cured , either fully or to a large extent , using these new technologies .
All these have helped to make the process of aging easier , as the aged can lead better lives with fewer health problems .
Also through research and development , many lifestyle guides that help promote healthy lifestyle become available .
It is known that by having a healthy lifestyle , one will have fewer health problems and thus will need to spend less on healthcare .
By saving more on healthcare , the financial stress on the aged will be relieved .
Therefore , through the help of research and development , the aged live better lives , and have fewer health problems .
However , as healthcare technologies improve , the costs of healthcare also increase .
As these new technologies involve the usage of newer , and more advanced equipments , the costs of using such technologies tend to be higher than in the past .
There is a small percentage of the elderly who are not financially secure .
For them , using such new technologies is either impossible , or it will create further financial problems .
Also , another side effect of improved healthcare technologies is that people tend to have a longer lifespan .
With prolonged life , the aged might face certain issues .
There are diseases which are incurable , but the life of the victim can be prolonged using these new technologies .
However , these technologies are expensive .
Prolonging the life of the victim can be financially draining on the family , and cause financial and social tension within the family .
This becomes the case where solving one problem creates another .
However , with the help of government policies , this problem can be solved .
Financial aids can be made available to these families and help relieve the financial stress .
Recently , government policies have also undergone several reforms to better cater to the aged in the society .
These reforms in policies are aimed to help the aged cope better with aging .
These policies encourage the elderly to retire later .
Also , they lower barriers to elder employment .
With these , the aged can have longer working life , and thus accumulate more wealth to support themselves through their old age .
Also , the government helps relieve financial stress by subsidizing healthcare costs , and providing financial aids to the elderly  .
These healthcare costs include hospital and caretaker fees .
Healthcare system is also restructured to cater to the aged .
An example is by building more community hospitals , nursing homes , and home care .
These will provide competent and appropriate care for the elderly patients .
Through the reforms of the government policies , the aged has been well taken care of .
In conclusion , current research and development , and policies have certainly helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
New technologies have been created to help eliminate many  age-related health problems .
Government policies and the restructuring of the healthcare system have helped the aged cope better with life .
However , not every elderly in the society can get to enjoy these perks , especially those who are bound by financial problems .
Therefore through current research and development and policies , the aging process has been made easier , but  only to a large extent .
Until recently , the problems of an aging population have become a major concern among all the nations throughout the world .
Governments of many countries have come up with policies and solutions to decrease elder dependency and slow down the process of a fast aging population .
Aging statistics taken from the United States of America administration of aging show people above the age of 65 represented 12 .4% of the population in the year 2000 but are expected to grow to be 20% of the population by 2030 .
The statistics have shown that in time to come , the problems of a fast aging population will be too overwhelming for the society to handle; therefore , we have to slow down the aging process .
A fast aging population will have serious detrimental effects in developed countries .
Caring for health of the aging population will pose a problem for the government .
The country's economy will also suffer as a small number of young working population will have to support a bigger umbrella of elder generation .
This will tax and stress heavily on the small working population .
A lot of resources will also have to be spent on the elderly people .
However , policies have helped to reduce the effects of an aging population .
I have to agree that current developments and policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Singapore has encouraged people to retire at an older age and companies to keep their employees for a longer time .
Legislative changes were made in Singapore in 1993 to put the retirement age at 60 , and then to move it up again from 60 to 62 years in 1999 .
This will help the working people to save more money and be more financially independent when they are old and have no income .
In this way , the working population will not be stressed  too much by the elderly population .
The government also has encouraged and provided incentives for companies to employ elderly workers .
This will help the elderly to be more in touch with the society and keep their physical health in good shape , which will in turn reduce diseases .
Singapore has also helped working adults to save money when they are working so that when they retire , they will still have money for living expenses .
Singapore introduced the Central Provident Fund (CPF) in 1995 as a compulsory saving scheme to help workers to benefit in their retirement .
Employees will contribute twenty percent of their salary while employers will contribute thirteen percent towards this saving scheme for workers .
The purpose of this saving scheme is to emphasize on self reliance .
To meet healthcare needs , Medisave is introduced to allow CPF members to use their CPF savings for hospitalization .
In this way , most problems of the aging population are taken care of .
Singapore has also emphasized and instilled filial piety to the children of the aging population  to support their parents through meeting their financial needs and emotional needs .
The children of the future should provide for their parents as much as they can even though their financial status looks bleak so that the aging population will not have to rely too much on government help .
Children also should arrange for their parents to live under the same roof so as not to only provide for them financially but also to show care and concern to their aging parents .
For example , children of the aging parents are able to bring their parents to consult a doctor if any minor medical conditions arise , thus preventing serious illnesses from developing .
Singapore has encouraged people to buy an HDB flat near their parents by subsidizing a substantial amount of money .
By living together , the children can also provide a listening ear to their parents and even warn them against making wrong decisions .
This will definitely reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency .
However , some critics might disagree with this strategy .
No matter how much we encourage young people to care for their parents , it's still their personal choice; the society or the government cannot force them to do their part .
However , if the government does a good job in educating the young people and introducing policies to encourage young people to be more caring towards their aging parents , this would be a very effective strategy .
This is because what the aging population needs are their children's provisions and their care and concern .
In conclusion , I think that many developments and policies have helped to reduce the aging process and also solve the problem of a fast aging population .
Although this problem cannot be solved in a short period of time , theses policies and developments will help to curb the problems of an aging population .
Nowadays , against a changing technology background , many of the social problems that have troubled people for centuries are being eased .
Among them is the aging problem , which leads to a restructuring of the social composition .
Many pessimistic predictions were made by people about this problem .
However , with the assistance of Information and Communication technology (ICT) , the situation could be fundamentally shifted through mainly three ways .
Firstly , the development of ICT can reduce the aged people's difficulties by changing the workspace .
Instead of being forced to travel from and to the office every day , now they can simply stay at home and finish their work through the internet .
This change effectively eliminates their disadvantages in terms of mobility compared to the young people .
Coming along with the workspace shift , the job itself will also change .
Nowadays , fewer and fewer jobs require certain level of performance .
Those repetitive and tedious jobs are now performed by machine and jobs become more of managing people and resources , especially with Information Technology as the medium .
This change of job nature makes a huge difference to the aged people's constraints for physical conditions are no longer employers' top concern .
Besides  changing the workspace , ICT also brings good news to the aged by changing employment relationships .
It is well known that for the aged people , jobs are really hard to find .
9 out of 10 employers would be reluctant to hire  old people because they are afraid that they can not work as efficiently (which is always not the case) .
However , with the introduction of ICT , many more new jobs are created , a large percentage of which are self-employed jobs .
So for the elderly , a new choice is offered to them: after their retirement , instead of heading into the job market and competing with people probably half their age for a post , they can start up their own business .
There are plenty of opportunities out there on the internet .
What matters is their  , not their age .
The previous two points are mainly about ICT's impact on the jobs for the elderly .
The third area that ICT helps is the access to education .
During the information age , the knowledge people acquire from school will be outdated within a very short time .
It is especially true for the aged people who received their education around the middle of last century .
Thus , being re- educated becomes a priority for them .
Important as it is , very few old people will get back to school and receive education again .
There are two main reasons for that .
Firstly they may feel embarrassed studying together with young students who are at their early twenties .
Secondly they may not have sufficient money or  time for their re-education .
All these concerns can be solved by Information Technology .
With many educational institutes setting up noncommercial web pages , the elderly can have access to the knowledge they need with just a single click .
The process of re- education becomes so simple and enjoyable .
This drastic change enables the aged people to keep up with the development of the society .
Opponents may probably argue that ICT is a privilege that only benefits the young people .
However , the truth cannot be farther than that .
Although young people have an advantage for they have been exposed to the technology from early ages , the aged people still stand a high chance to succeed , as long as they can adapt to new features quickly .
After all , the internet is a common property of which every one can enjoy a share .
Current research and development in the field of ICT has largely shaped the society .
It makes aged people remain productive by changing the workspace , reforming the employment relationship and offering easy access to re- education .
Technologies like this promise to offer us even more new dimensions to deal with existing social problems in the years to come .
Nowadays , the life expectancy of people has increased thanks to the healthcare technology which keeps getting better .
This should be a very good thing to hear .
But , there are consequences to this .
Since people have longer life expectancy , the number of elderly people increases .
This leads to the issue of the aging population .
The aging population causes a lot of problems , since a lot of money will be used to support the elderly .
Wikipedia stated that "As of July 2007 , medical costs for a typical inmate in the USA might run an agency around US$33 per day , while costs for an ageing inmate could run upwards of US$100 .
Most State DOCs report spending more than 10 percent of the annual budget on elderly care .
That is expected to rise over the next 10-20 years" .
This money could be used for the development of other areas .
So , we have a question here .
Should public spending on the aged be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ?
In this essay , I will tell you why public spending on the aged should not be limited .
Firstly , limiting the public spending is not efficient .
We have to calculate the limit carefully so that it will be enough for the elderly .
Even if it has been done correctly , since the public spending of each person is different , a trouble will still be there .
Consider if  an elderly person has been sick for a long time and his/her spending has already reached the limit; are we going to tell him to die because we will not provide him with anymore money ?
There are a lot of alternative methods that we can use to cope with the aging population .
Peterson (2001) in his review "A Graying World" suggests six ways to cope with the aging population .
We could use any of these six ways to cope with the aging population , without having to limit the public spending on the elderly .
It should also be noted that , limiting aging spending in healthcare will not bring much impact since "the annual growth in national health spending is not mainly due to increasing demand from ageing populations , but rather has been driven by rising incomes , costly new medical technology , a shortage of health care workers and informational asymmetries between providers and patients" (Rheinhardt , 2003) .
Secondly , the elderly have the right to be protected because they have worked for the country before .
We should not forget that the younger generations are raised by the previous generation .
So , the younger generations should repay them by providing their needs during the old age .
We , younger generations , must realize that someday we will grow old as well .
When we grow old , how would we like to be treated ?
Would we like to be treated as a burden  ?
It is really selfish if we treat the elderly badly but still want to be treated nicely when we grow old .
It may be argued that the elderly might misuse this service and fully rely on the public funding rather than trying to cope on their own .
However , we must not forget that a lot of people have no choice but to rely on the government .
"The most significant aspect of the growing percentage of elderly people in the population is the marked increase in those aged 85 and over .
Among this group is a large number of elderly people who are severely impaired physically and/or mentally" (Henwood , 1990) .
These people have no other choice but to rely on others for their funding .
Would we forget them because of the small group of people that use this service to become lazy ?
Therefore , we can conclude that we should not limit the public spending on the elderly .
There are a lot of people who could only rely on this service to survive .
We should remember their deeds and we should also remember that we will become old one day .
Limiting the public spending on the elderly is also not an efficient way to cope with an aging population .
So , the government should use a more efficient method to cope with the aging population instead of limiting the public spending on the elderly .
"The critical challenge of an aging society is not so much how to accommodate the older population , but how to ensure the productivity of future workers , regardless of age" (Friedland and Summer , 2005 , p .1) .
Major increases in public spending for pension fund and health care costs for the elderly will slow economic growth in most countries , even in developed countries .
Therefore , the government should focus more on how they can reduce this spending , so that the economy will not be damaged .
This can be done by improving workers productivity and increasing labor force participation .
In other words , the government should spend more on creating jobs and educating the population .
People with higher education are expected to get more salaries and accumulate wealth when they are still young , so that  will not be too dependent in their old age .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be diverted to other more important aspects .
Some people may argue that there will be insufficient protection for the elderly if the government shifts this fund to some other areas of the country's development .
For example , people say that old single women , whose incomes are mainly not high , are vulnerable and need special care .
It might be true to some extent , but we should also consider that the government will only limit the public spending on the elderly , butthey will not eliminate it .
This means special policies will be made for those with special needs .
The government will still take care of those who cannot take care of themselves .
Furthermore , we should also realize that today's group of older people is different from the past's .
Friedland and Summer (2005) stated that the meaning of "retirement" and "old age" nowadays is different from what it was in the past , as future groups of older people are likely to be even better off .
They are wealthier , healthier , and they have better education .
In addition to implementing special policies , the government could allocate more funds for educating young people .
Education is very important because employers tend to hire workers or employees with high education and experience in their fields .
Low education in a country may result in increases in the number of the unemployed , which eventually hamper the economic growth because people who are jobless are very dependent as they do not earn money for living .
Furthermore , the country will also lack  trained labor force .
For instance , Indonesia , the world's 4th most populous country , has 109 ,900 ,900 labor force , but the rate of the unemployed was very high (9 .10%) in 2008 (CIA , 2008) , due to low literacy rates .
The lack of education is the priority problem in Indonesia , mainly caused by the great number of people who still live in poverty .
The current situation is worrying as when this generation ages , the government will need to provide a certain care for them .
In other words , the new policy to cut off public expenditure on the aged cannot be implemented in this condition .
Hence , it is again the government's role to subsidize the education so that everybody at least can get the standard level of education .
Education alone is not enough because even if the society is better-educated  there may not be adequate jobs available and the unemployment problem still exists .
The government should create and maintain new jobs .
Therefore , they will need to create a supplementary budget for job creation .
In fact , some countries , such as Korea , have begun to implement this policy .
Korea has planned to spend 3 ,500 billion won in 2009 to help maintain and create jobs , and through this , 552 ,000 new jobs are expected to be created (Ministry of Strategic and Finance , 2009) .
This policy aims to boost the economic growth potential as there will be less tough competition to get a job .
Besides increasing the number of new jobs , the government can try to invent a new type of job , which can be done by people regardless of their age , including the elderly .
For instance , telecommuting part-time jobs , which do not require the workers to be in the workplace , are good to be implemented nowadays , by means of our advanced technology .
Clearly , there are many ways to limit and to divert the public spending for the elderly people without slowing the economic growth .
By providing good education and good jobs , our life will be guaranteed until our old age .
Governments and policy makers will take the main role to formulate the best policies to deal with the long-term economic and social challenge of global aging , so that we are fully prepared to face this  issue .
Aging is becoming a hot issue when the percentage of the elderly in the society is continuously increasing .
Certainly , when the number of aged people rises , public spending on this group will have to be raised as well to take care of this group .
However , I think there should be a limit on how much shall be spent for the elderly , because the government needs to use more money on country development .
First of all , spending money on development is the most effective way to address the aging population issue .
Actually , the problem of more population getting aged does not lie in the demographic change , but in the fact that the productivity of the nation will decline .
When the government tries to spend more and more on the aged , it will lead to a lack in money for development , then a slower economic growth , which will finally leave the government with less choice to spend for the elderly people .
In contrast , when focusing on country development , particularly economic growth , the country can earn more money .
With this extra money , the government can have more to spend for the whole society , and the money for the aged will be increased as well .
In fact , "if real economic growth averages about 2 percent per year between now and 2050" , Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer claim , "government expenditures as a proportion of the economy in 2050 might not be substantially larger than what it is today" (Demography Is Not Destiny , Revisited .
Center on Aging Society , Georgetown University , March 2005) .
Secondly , imposing a limit on public spending for the aged can make people spend money more responsibly .
For most people , if they know they will have to take care of themselves more when they are old , they will be forced to save money for the future .
They therefore will have to think more when spending money , and will try to reduce wasting extra money on unimportant things .
Moreover , nowadays , with better living condition for the whole life of a person , many old people may not be in poor health . .
Hence , extra care for additional health care may not be necessary for many elderly people .
Many opponents may argue that the aged are the most vulnerable group in the society and thus need more and more attention .
However , to help these people become less vulnerable , it is not so good  when they are already aged .
"Prevention is better than cure" .
Thus , focusing on social development as a whole , and improving living condition throughout the life of people is actually a better way to help people gain a better health and become less vulnerable when they are aged .
Moreover , when more money is spent for people when they are younger , it could raise a better workforce for the nation .
The productivity of the country will therefore be increased , and again , with more wealth earned , public spending in general , and on the aged , in particular , will be increased as a  result .
In conclusion , although the population of the earth in general is getting aged , which could lead to certain consequences , the government should not be panicked to address that problem in a temporary way by increasing public spending for the aged as much as possible .
Rather , the government should focus on developing the nation as a whole , especially maintaining the economic growth , because this is the long term and most effective way to solve the aging problem .
Have present studies , development and policies helped to relieve the aging process ?
This is the question many people grapple with and the core of the debate lies in the impact they bring on the aging process .
In my opinion , I agree to a large extent that current research , development and policies have helped ease the aging process .
In the course of my essay , I will first show how economics , medicine , architectural and technological inventions and social policies have helped ease the aging process while financial constraint can limit the effectiveness of easing the aging process .
Firstly , economics have helped ease the aging process .
Due to the growth in the awareness of the different financial needs over an individual's life cycle , financial institutions have designed and introduced a wide range of products to meet these needs .
For example , a person will need health insurance to protect oneself from the high cost of medical treatment .
Also , with the insurance coverage , an individual can seek adequate medical treatment to recover from any sickness .
The various products available have helped to minimize the impact of unforeseen events so that an individual can save resources to meet aging needs .
In addition , as education opportunities increase , economies around the world have transformed from labour intensive to knowledge-based .
This has extended the working life of the labour force .
With longer working life , people will be able to accumulate more wealth which they can use to support themselves in their old age .
Therefore , people will have saved enough money by the time when they are old to maintain a certain standard of living .
Secondly , architecture has also helped ease the aging process .
With the increasing prevalence of obstruction free buildings  , the mobility of the senior population is significantly increased .
For example , buildings are fitted with lifts , ramps and more railings to allow people who are physically challenged to access .
With mobility , the elder generation can have the same mobility options as they were young and continue to live their lives on their own .
The reduced dependency on others will ease the pain of aging .
Thirdly , the modern state of technology has significantly eased the process of aging .
Many tasks in life are made easy with technology .
For example , robotic vacuum cleaners have made housekeeping very much effortless .
The safety features in household appliances have enabled the elderly to take care of their own needs safely .
Overall , technology has allowed the elderly to reduce their dependency on others , and has improved the quality of their lives .
Fifthly , various social policies have been introduced to ease the aging process .
For example , filial obligation is stressed through informal and formal channels to increase the willingness of the next generation to support their own elderly parents .
With their children supporting them , the elderly will no doubt be happier and enjoy their golden age .
Furthermore , in some countries such as Britain and Singapore , people are required to provide for their own old age dependency .
They are compelled by law to save and invest more of their income earned while they are active in the work force .
In this way , the elderly will have a sum of money available to support themselves in their golden age when they retire .
However , many of these advances discussed require financial resources to achieve .
For example , the wide range of financial and technological products comes at a cost .
For those who are not able to afford them , they will not be able to enjoy the benefits .
Social policies also require funding in order to put the plan into action .
Therefore , the ability of recent advancements to ease the aging process can be greatly limited by financial constraints .
In conclusion , economics , medicine , architecture , technological inventions and social policies have helped to ease the aging process but they require financial resources to achieve .
Therefore , the elderly and their children supporting them must have sufficient financial resources in order to take advantage of the benefits of modern day advancements to ease the aging process .
In recent years , there is an increasing number of countries faced with an ageing population .
The problems of an ageing population have led to these countries coming up with measures to counteract the problems .
One of these measures is to increase public spending so as to ensure that the aged are taken care of .
Yet , at the same time , this money could be spent on other areas of the country's development .
Therefore , some may argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , I do not support this argument as increasing public spending on the aged is a necessary step for the government to take in order to prepare the country to face an ageing population .
Firstly , improving on current facilities to better suit the aged is compulsory .
We have to prepare more healthcare teams to specialize in treating illnesses related to the old as it is commonly known that the old are more prone to illness .
Thus , by increasing the amount of healthcare workers focusing on treating elderly illnesses prevent the situation of the lack of healthcare workers for the elderly in the near future .
Also , we have to create an environment which is elderly-friendly so that the elders are able to take care of themselves without the help of others .
Being able to take care of themselves is very important as this greatly decreases their dependence on others and hence reduces their burden on their children and the elderly will not feel that they are useless by not being independent .
Therefore , this public spending on improving facilities should not be comprised for the welfare of the elderly .
Similarly , the government has to provide elderly benefits as most of the elderly are no longer in the workforce and thus have no regular income .
The elderly depend on their savings or their children to support themselves through the old age .
Some of the elderly may not have saved enough to last them till death or their children are not willing to take care of them .
They are faced with the problems of living a proper life .
A proper life refers to having home , three meals and adequate healthcare .
Therefore , it is important for the government to step in to provide help for these poor elderly so that they could have a proper life .
If not , these elderly may die because of hunger or the lack of proper healthcare due to poverty .
However , an argument against this is that most people feel that old age is not the responsibility of the government and the government is not obliged to take care of the elderly .
The elderly ought to be independent .
Nevertheless , if the government leaves the elderly who are fighting old age alone without care , it would be too cruel of the government .
In other words , the government should not leave those elderly in lurch to struggle on their own for survival .
In addition , the elderly may encounter biasness against them .
This is a social problem where the government has to step in to solve it .
Ageism may be present in the working or social life of an elderly .
These unfair treatments that the elderly face may  pose a psychological problem to them .
For example , the  aged may face discrimination when looking for jobs as compared to the young and also , the old age may receive less all-rounded treatment in the healthcare sector based on the stereotype that they are in the natural process of aging and that they are less likely to recover .
The government then has to interfere to educate the public to be less prejudiced against the  aged .
This will take up part of the public spending which should not be limited .
On the other hand , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as the economic sector .
If the economy improves , people would earn more money and thus the burden on the children taking care of their old-aged parents would be relatively less as they could better afford the costs of taking care of the elderly people .
On the contrary , this is only applicable to filial children who are willing to take care of their parents .
Those elderly who are unfortunate or those who have no children may face problems as they would have no one to take care of them and would be worse off without any help from the government .
As a result , public spending on the aged should not be limited as it is needed to help these elderly .
To sum up , the government has to assume responsibilities in taking care of the elderly and to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to accept an ageing population; thus , spending on the aged should not be limited and money should not be diverted into other areas of the country's development .
The baby-boom generation has created a need to improve and provide care and services to the aging population .
I agree to a large extent that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Technology plays a significant role in providing aid for and improving the lives of the elderly .
Current technologies have provided aids and support to the elderly in the fields of personal health technologies by reducing the cost and time of medical appointments and increasing the effectiveness of health record tracking .
It is also important that ageing related problems are highlighted so that corresponding policies can be implemented , for example the introduction of the pension system and  late retirement to reduce elder dependency .
Firstly , the goal of personal health technologies will be to change from a centralized model where the elderly would go to the hospital where healthcare is provided , to a distributed model wherebyhealthcare services are delivered to  where the elderly live .
Information technology applications have enabled the elderly to initiate communication , keep track of their personal health record and also make follow-up appointments which can be conducted through Telemedicine .
Telemedicine was introduced to provide care for the patient from any location with the help of transferring electronic information through various technology applications and equipments such as the web camera .
This technology delivers care directly to the homes of the elderly at an affordable rate and provide right information at the right time which benefits decision making of the medical officers involved .
It allows the elderly to be more active in taking care of themselves at the comfort of their own home .
It may be argued that telemedicine might not be as effective as contact monitoring and hands on attention .
Nevertheless , such applications have helped to reduce the time spent in hospitals and medical costs , improve record tracking practices and speed of communication .
Next , national  policies such as pension systems are arranged to provide the retired elders income .
The fund may be set up by a corporation , the government , or any other organization to pay the  retired workers .
In the context of Singapore , the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is set up to provide Singaporeans with a retirement plan .
The benefits of the CPF scheme are classified into , retirement , healthcare , home ownership , family protection and asset enhancement .
Critics of this position point out that the cost of providing pensions leads to the increased taxes on the workforce .
However with the help of the pension system , it has provided the elderly with a retirement fund , thus reducing the elder dependency on the children of the elderly .
Last but not least , in light of the challenges of ageing population , many countries have changed their policies with respect to early retirement .
By encouraging later retirement it will help to reduce elder dependency .
Opponents of this position argue that there would be an increase in the wage base with a lower retirement age , because people will save less as they need less wealth and lower savings .
However working longer also means providing sufficient savings for old age; it will also help increase the economic growth and instill a sense of belonging and self value to the elderly .
Moreover , lifelong learning empowers the elderly to lead a better lifestyle through social interaction and contribution to the community .
In conclusion , technology and  national development and policies have helped ease the aging process .
Technology applications such as Telemedicine which aids the tracking and handling of medical reports and appointments  encourage the elderly to keep track of their personal health through a cost and time effective system .
In addition , pension schemes and later retirement help to reduce elder dependency through providing a retirement plan and increasing the economic growth .
In recent years , an aging population has become a serious demographic challenge to many countries around the world .
Population aging happens when there is a shift in the distribution of a country's population towards an older age .
Many governments are concerned about an aging population as it leads to problems such as a shrinking workforce , decrease in economic growth due to a drop in productivity , increase in societal costs and many more .
an increase in the number of elderly persons can potentially lead to an increase in healthcare costs .
Together with advances in medical technology , there will be an upward pressure on healthcare spending .
higher demands and costs for healthcare spending will pose  a great challenge to the distribution of family and public resources .
Government spending on healthcare in countries around the world has always taken up one of the biggest fractionsof the government budget .
However , what if there was a decrease in the amount of government spending on healthcare costs , where could the money be better used  ?
The second largest expenditure of most governments is education and these expenses will tend to fall with an ageing population , especially as fewer young people would probably continue into tertiary education as they would be in demand as part of the work force .
Hence , I agree to a large extent that public spending on the aged should be limited .
Money can then be diverted to other areas of the country's development which may be of greater use to the future generations .
This will also make members of the society more independent in after their own health  .
In addition , 
Firstly , with a higher budget to spend in other areas such as education and defense , a country may develop even more rapidly .
With little economic growth , a society may be faced with fewer options on how to take care of people who are least able to take care of themselves .
However , with sufficient economic growth , this would not be the case as there would be more options and fewer persons in need of the help .
With more educated youths , the size of the economy and the tax base would be bigger and the cost burden of an aging population may be spread over a larger and more productive future generation .
Such is the case in Scandinavian countries where generous public funding for prenatal incentives and investments in children , for example in education , has helped curb the problem of an aging and declining population .
Furthermore , in a more educated society , more people are equipped with the knowledge to better take care of themselves and hence help lessen the amount of healthcare spending .
Secondly , by setting boundaries on public spending , people will be less reliant on  government to take care of their every need such as in healthcare .
Elderly dependency can be reduced when they are forced or encouraged to plan and provide in advance for their own old-age livelihood .
When enforced by law or encouraged to save and invest more of their income while still in the work force , people will then save a sufficient amount of money to take care of their health  when necessary rather than depend on the government spending to support their health in their old age .
Dependence on the government can also be reduced by encouraging later retirement ages , longer working lives and lower requirements to elder employment  , which can be achieved alone with an increase on the eligibility of age for pensions and government incentives for the elderly .
Also , when people work longer , they will be able to accumulate more money to be used to support themselves in their old age .
In Singapore , the government has tried using schemes such as CPF (Central Provident Fund) , Medisaveand Medishield and even scrapped  the pension scheme in order to encourage more Singaporeans to take greater responsibility for their own health  .
Lastly ,  limited public spending on healthcare will encourage more working adults to take better care of their elderly parents .
With the elderly to look after  , there will be more stress on filial obligations thereby increasing the willingness of adults in the future to take care of their elderly parents by all means .
In an increasingly  society , working adults often have no time , attention , care and even finance to take care of their elderly parents and thus eventually abandon them in homes .
However ,  depending on the support and care from  the family may be a better and cheaper alternative to take care of the elderly  than depending on the nursing home's nurse to take care of one's parents .
However , detractors may disagree with the stand that  public spending on healthcare should be limited and the money should be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Limiting public spending on healthcare may not solve the social issues that have surfaced due to the problem of population aging .
It merely leaves the individual and his/her family more responsible for their healthcare issues .
Some of these costs may eventually end up going back into the public sector through other means .
The society may face  a wide range of social issues on education , housing and many more which may not be solved by setting limits on healthcare expenditure on the government's part as this may instead create even more problems .
Yet , in the first place , spending on healthcare may not be a good way to solve societal issues such as the lack of filial piety amongst the youths and over dependence on the government to solve every problem one might face  .
In a nut shell , government spending on the aged in  healthcare should be capped at a certain limit to take care of people who may really be in need while the rest of the budget should be shifted to other areas of the country's growth .
With a limit on healthcare expenditure in the government's budget , there may be a better investment in the area where the government's budget goes to , people would be more self reliant and lastly it will instill a stronger sense of filial obligation in the youths .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
Clearly , this suggestion considers the interest of the country but not the aged .
Although the country's development is essential , it cannot neglect the frailer aging group of the population .
Regardless of the problems an aged population may bring along , it cannot diminish the fact that the elderly is still part of a country's assets .
If the government decides to cut its expenditure on the aging population , the elderly will be struggling for their survival as many welfare benefits will be limited .
Instead , the government should continue to promote welfare programs that aid the elderly in terms of housing and healthcare .
Indeed , there are many problems associated with an aging population .
For example , the elderly people are in need of social and healthcare attention because of their feeble physical condition .
This increases burdens on the younger workforce as they have to bear the cost of healthcare services required by the elderly .
Other than that , an aging population will hinder the economic growth due to its lower productivity .
However , it is a fact that citizens are part of a country's assets regardless of their age .
We cannot abandon them just because they bring along several problems .
It is the responsibility of the younger population and the government to support the aged .
This is because the older generation contributed to the workforce during their younger days .
It is their hard labour that has paved the road for us today .
As a result , the younger people and the government should reciprocate the hard work by helping the elderly .
Even if the elderly is able to support themselves , the government should continue to assist through other policies .
However , priority should be given to the needy elderly , especially for older people with a lower education background and less savings .
One of the welfare packages that the government can provide is "housing" .
A handful of old people have been left stranded on the streets without shelter .
Some have been abandoned by their families while others cannot afford a house because of their financial difficulties .
These people definitely require attention from the government .
Therefore , the government should not limit public spending on the aged population .
Instead , they should invest on introducing new policies that can help these homeless elderly .
Another welfare package the government can offer is "healthcare" .
Health is the most common problem faced by the elderly .
As they age , their body constitution becomes weaker .
As a result , they are more vulnerable to sickness and disease .
They have to make occasional visits to the doctor for diagnosis and remedy .
The cost is high , especially nowadays when new technologies and treatments are expensive .
This is where the government can provide financial aid for the healthcare services required by the aged .
The government can subsidize part of the healthcare expenses incurred by the elderly .
This will lighten the burden of the aged population as well as the younger workforce .
Therefore , public spending for the aged should not be reduced for the country's development .
Instead , the government should increase their spending on the aged so that they can reach out to more needy senior citizens .
Certainly , if the government diverts its spending to other areas of the country's development , the country would enjoy greater economic growth .
Because of that , the government would be able to collect more taxes , which can be used to aid the aging population .
On the other hand , with little economic growth , the government has no choice but to cut down on benefit programs for the aged .
However , it takes time to realize a noticeable increase in economic growth .
It may be many decades from now .
By that time , an unfortunate group of the aged will have been deprived of welfare programs previously planned for them .
These people will suffer as the country works toward other areas of its development .
This is because the country has to limit its spending on the aged while expanding other areas of development .
This is where the government has to make a tough choice between the aged and the country's advancement .
Clearly , the consequences of cutting expenditure on the aged outweigh the alternative in many aspects .
A sizeable segment of the aged would suffer through the process of achieving  economic growth .
Consequently , they would be struggling for survival with the limited welfare policies available to them .
In other words , if welfare programs for the aged are reduced due to limited spending , many problems would arise .
Subsequently , the government would have to spend more resources to solve the problems that arise .
Therefore , it is better to give equal if not more spending to the aged , while keeping existing welfare benefits in place .
Current psychology researchers claim that there are several pillars to being a healthy individual .
Therefore , to have pillars such as having sufficient social support and having an active engagement in life helps the elderly to cope with the inevitable stress of elderly life .
Current technological developments have been developed to help the elderly ease the process of aging .
For example , the latest developments of assistive technology can make important contributions to the care of elderly people in elderly institutions and at home .
Care at home is often the preferred choice of the elderly and is generally more affordable for care providers than putting them into an institution for the elderly .
The elderly need some form of monitoring technology to help improve their safety when no one is able to be around to look after them all the time .
Remote health monitoring solutions such as to keep tabs on their blood pressure , body temperature and their heart-rate can raise alerts for medical attention quickly .
Inventions such as fall detectors , pressure mats and bed alerts can improve the elderly home owners' safety and their personal abilities to cope better at home alone .
Technologies have also been designed to help the elderly maintain their own independence .
One invented device uses optical sensors to monitor how these elderly pick things up and how they use them .
It can tell if a person does something wrong such as mistake a bottle of vinegar for drinking water; or if they are doing certain things in the wrong order .
This technological invention can also be extended to monitor how the elderly interact with other devices such as a television , a DVD player or a washing machine .
A screen called the "technology coach" will then reveal the problem and show them the correct way of interacting with these devices .
Another invention uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to track which medications are taken and when .
This can prevent the elderly from taking the wrong medication or overdosing themselves and thus jeopardizing their own lives .
In addition , adding a motion sensor system to provide a daily update of the elderly can help bring peace of mind to distant relatives who are concerned about the safety of their elderly family members who might be injured or ill and , worse of all , unable to call for help .
We have seen how technologies are able to replace human supervision and to monitor the condition of an elderly person round the clock , which is less possible with human care providers .
One may argue that these technologies could potentially isolate the elderly further from their families and keep them indoors even more .
This is no longer true because advanced technologies have managed to put a face to high tech devices .
A technology called the Digital Family Portrait enables the elderly and their relatives to hang up a special digital frame on their walls to receive updates of what's going on in  .
This technology can also be used to receive video phone calls from neighbors within the neighbourhood an elderly person lives in .
Furthermore , the elderly who have difficulties getting out of their homes can tap on various video technologies to draw themselves closer to their neighbors and faraway relatives through activities such as playing chess with them or engaging in a simple conversation .
We can see how technology was never meant to isolate people .
Instead , it is meant to be a life enabler to increase the quality of life , like helping the elderly stay indoors safely and providing maximum possible social interaction and social support from their neighbors and relatives .
Therefore , current research on technology targeted towards the elderly  not only helps ease the aging process , but it also increases the quality of life significantly for these elderly folks .
"Today , slightly less than 1 in 10 of our residents are 65 years of age or older .
This proportion of the elderly in our population is expected to rise significantly , doubling to 1 in 5 by 2030" (speech by Mr Mah Bow Tan , 2006) .
As Singapore's population ages , there are many questions  on how to help the elderly cope with the aging process .
with the government's emphasis on tackling the rising problems of an ageing population , current research and development have helped to ease the aging process through introducing policies , upgrading  facilities and providing quality healthcare services .
These improvements can be seen in various contexts and we will be looking at the benefits they have provided to the elderly .
822 words
Firstly , we will be looking at the social policies that the government has introduced in order to encouraged people to save for their old-age dependency .
They introduced laws and encourage people to save and invest more of their income earned while they are active in the work force .
The government created public awareness of early planning and proper saving strategies which are necessary to ensure that we have enough money to last us through our old-age after retirement .
Early planning means that we have to start saving once we step into the workforce .
This ensures that by the time we retire , there will be sufficient savings left to spend for our old age .
The government has also set up a mandatory saving scheme for all working Singaporeans .
It is called the Central Provident Fund (CPF) .
However ,  some people , especially the younger ones ,  disagree with such a scheme .
They believe that they should have control over their earned income instead of being 'forced' to contribute a portion of their income to such a scheme .
They feel that the responsibility of saving should not be controlled by the government but by themselves .
In my opinion , younger people tend to spend what they earn and neglect planning for the future .
They are not aware of the problems they may face after retirement .
Thus , with the public awareness of saving for old age and the CPF , one will have sufficient savings for their old-age dependency .
Secondly , as we grow older , we tend to experience more health problems such as walking difficulties and deteriorating physical strength .
Therefore ,  the development of an elderly-friendly environment helps to ease the aging process .
An elderly person is not afraid to walk around the housing estates or travel in public transport as these facilities have become more accessible to them .
One of the infrastructural developments that we can see is the building of lifts to serve all levels of new and existing HDB flats .
This eliminates the need for an elderly person to climb the stairs in order to get to the level that the lift does not stop at .
Another development is the building of more slopes instead of steps .
The elderly will have an easier time walking up and slopes than stairs to get to their destination .
These are some of the benefits that can be seen around our housing estates .
Public transportation such as the MRT and buses have implemented a similar concept  in the building of their facilities .
MRT stations have built lifts to allow the elderly to travel up to and down from the platform with ease .
Public buses have steps-free entrances and exits for easier mobility of the elderly .
However , some people question if the spending on all these upgrades to increase accessibility for the elderly is necessary .
They feel that the money spent should be used on strengthening the economy instead .
But if we do not maintain a good infrastructure that caters to the elderly , no matter how good the economy is , the elderly will not be able to enjoy accessible and user-friendly facilities that make their life more convenient . .
Lastly , better healthcare services that are readily available to the elderly ensure that they are well taken care of .
One may be afraid of growing old as more health problems will arise and it may be difficult getting the necessary healthcare .
However , now we will be able to get the proper care and rehabilitation due to improvements to healthcare facilities such as public hospitals , nursing homes and polyclinics .
We have a team of well-trained doctors and nurses who are committed to taking care of the elderly who need special attention .
We also have groups of medical specialists who are always finding ways to improve the healthcare of the elderly through better medication and rehabilitation .
As a result , more day rehabilitation centres and nursing homes have been built to handle the demands for increasing healthcare .
In my opinion , the elderly do not need to worry about getting good healthcare services as it is easily found anywhere in Singapore .
In conclusion , we can see that research and development has brought about improvements that have played a part in easing the aging process .
government policies are involved to ensure that proper saving for the future is in place , the upgrading of public facilities have helped create an elderly-friendly environment and  better healthcare services have been made available .
I concur with the writer's view of reducing elder dependency by encouraging later retirement , longer working lives , and lower barriers to elder employment .
Firstly , encouraging later retirement for the elderly can drastically change individuals' attitude towards work .
This in turn will provide a positive mentality to better prepare them for their old age .
For example , when the government announces measures to encourage later retirements , the citizens would be prepared for what is to come and  be more ready to accept it , thus reducing elder dependency in the long term .
Secondly ,  extending individuals' workinglife will often result in the accumulation of more wealth which can be used to support them in their old age .
This acts as a safety net to dramatically reduce the need for elder dependency .
For example , an elderly person who has worked for 50 years compared to one that has worked for 40 years should have considerably more savings .
Lastly , lowering barriers to elder employment can also reduce the need for elder dependency .
With the ability to work and also a sustainable income , the elderly will find themselves less dependent on others .
Moreover , their gained experience can prove valuable to the economy .
For example , with increased measures bythe government fto put the elderly into the workforce , the elderly will be able to depend on themselves .
All in all , the strategy on reducing elder dependency through the 3 methods can prove to be valuable for an aging society .
"Old age is like a plane flying through a storm .
Once you are on board , there is nothing you can do" , said Golda Meir .
Indeed , perhaps everyone is afraid of aging because it not only marks deterioration in physical health and significant psychological changes , but also places more financial burdens on the government and the society , because obviously , the elderly need fiscal support , better health care and facilities specialized for their age-related problems .
Therefore , it is suggested that "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development" .
From my point of view , this recommendation is completely reasonable and convincing for several reasons .
First of all , investment should be focused more on education as it takes a higher priority than other fields of development because education plays a very important role in the society , determining the wealth and success of the entire nation .
More specifically , a good education system will produce a more talented and creative generation who can replace the current old generation and continue to devote their best to develop the country' economy in the future .
One example of necessary financial support is the investment on developing and upgrading the current facilities used in education , including information technology equipment , laboratories and library systems .
This is particularly important to the education in developing and less developed countries , like Vietnam , China , the Philippines and Malaysia , where teaching and learning still utilise traditional methods with little IT support and the use of old textbooks , as well as using laboratories with obsolete devices .
With improvements in educational facilities , students will be able to accessup-to-date knowledge more easily , as well as experiment with and apply what they have learned in reality .
Another way to carry out this strategy is that the budget can be used to promote and export the country's education .
This is exactly what the Singapore government is doing to attract excellent students from other nations .
By providing tuition grants (of 80%) and financial aid for living costs of foreign students along with a career bond , Singapore will have a greater workforce serving them for at least 3 years after graduation .
Another area that the government needs to be concerned about is the environment as hundreds of environmental projects (such as reducing the level of green house gases and noxious fumes in the atmosphere or promoting the use of non-plastic carrying bags) are waiting for capital and fiscal support .
In such small nations (in terms of geographical area) like Singapore , this issue is particularly important because every climatic change or pollution problem is likely to negatively affect the whole country , especially the physical health of the people , including the aged .
Therefore , solving this problem means the elderly will be taken care of by the government , even though it is an indirect way .
Moreover , the environment is a global concern; it influences everybody in the world .
Thus , protecting it means we are protecting not only the young but also the elderly; not only the current generation , but also the future ones .
Therefore , there should be more policies on supporting environmental protection projects as well as monitoring and penalizing violation of environment laws .
Besides the concerns surrounding environmental protection and education , public spending on the aged should be partly transferred to public infrastructure development projects such as public transportation , schoolsand hospitals because such developments are directly related to the improvement in the living standards of senior citizens .
Firstly , a modern infrastructure will bring about s , effectiveness and efficiency .
One example of this is the extension of access to most public places and even on public transport vehicles for people with physical disabilities , through designing paths or elevators specialized for wheel chairs , or placing special directional signs for the elderly with sight or hearing problems .
Secondly , due to its higher efficiency , such facilities will help reduce operational costs and subsequently decrease the cost of living for citizens .
For instance , a well organized public transportation system will help minimize the use of private vehicles , which is costly , and reduce traffic congestion and accidents .
And therefore , to some extent , the elderly will indirectly benefit from this policy .
In conclusion , people may be upset with the idea of limiting public spending on the elderly because they may think that the aged increasingly lack  care from the society .
However ,  considering the positive impacts it brings about to the entire society , obviously the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages .
Hence , this idea should be carried out soon for the sake of everybody and the government needs to promote and analyze the pros of this policy in order to avoid misunderstandings  .
Population ageing is an international phenomenon .
Singapore is no different .
According to SingStats , 8 .5% of Singapore's population is above the age of 65 .
This figure was 7 .2% in the year 2000 .
As the population continues to age , government spending on the aged will probably increase as more and more people would rely on the government for their needs .
Many arguments have been raised on whether the government should limit this spending as the money could be used for other areas of the country's development .
I do not agree with this .
The government should not limit the spending on the aged .
In fact , they should make sure the needs of the aged are attended to .
In the past , the literacy rate of the people was low .
Many elders of the current generation have little to no education so in their economically active years , they weren't able to save a lot .
Moreover , most of the money they earned was spent on their children to make sure that they received proper education .
This act of placing the younger generation's interest before theirs and making sure that they got proper education increased the literacy rate of the country and contributed to the country's development .
In other words , the old have contributed a lot to shaping our country into what she is today .
Therefore , now that the country has prospered , the government should look after the people who helped made it possible .
some may argue that since the elderly spent their money on their children , it's now the responsibility of the children to look after their needs , and not the government's .
However , if that were to happen ,  would increase and the younger generation may find it harder to start a family .
Throughout the years , Singapore has concentrated on the country's development .
According to the Singapore Ministry of Finance , in FY2009 , 41 .5% of government expenditure would be placed on the economic and social development of the country .
Looking at the numbers , we can tell that sufficient funds have already been allocated for the country's development so no additional funds are required .
Even if there is a need for additional funds for economic and social development , instead of limiting or cutting expenditure on the aged , the government should look at other areas to cut .
For example , expenditure on security and defence is 34 .3% of government expenditure in FY2009 .
This is certainly too much an amount to be spent on security and defence .
A reason for the stand that the government should limit spending on the aged is that the aged is not of much use to the society so the government should not concentrate so much on them .
However , Singapore's policy of re- employing the old has proven that to be not true .
Most of the aged have proved that they can continue to work and contribute to the society in one way or another and thus their welfare should be looked at as well .
In conclusion , spending on the aged should not be limited or diverted as , for a developed country like Singapore , many successes have been brought about by them and they have helped shaped the country into what it is today .
If there was ever a need for more funds to be injected into the development of the country , other areas and not the spending on the aged should be looked at .
I agree that the implemented policies have eased the aging process .
After Singapore gained independence in 1965 , Singapore saw a boom in the population .
To control the population , the government introduce the 'stop at two' policy that was so successfulthat it resulted in a decline of the overall population even till today .
The drop of population has given rise to an an aging population .
To tackle the issue of aging population , the government has implemented some measures that are helping the elderly to age comfortably .
Some of the measures are the Medisave scheme , Lift Improvement and Facilities Enhancement for the elderly (LIFE) and the Eldershield scheme .
Firstly , Medisave was introduced in 1984 to help Singaporeans to set aside an amount of money from their incomes for future medical expenses .
The Medisave scheme covers a range of health expenses which includes surgical operations ,psychiatric treatment and many more .
Such measures of saving for the rainy days will help Singaporeans to cover part of their medical expenses as they retire into old age .
Although this scheme does not provide 100% coverage on their medical bills , patients will have a smaller burden when the majority of the medical bills are heavily subsidised by the government and supported by Medisave .
Secondly , LIFE was implemented in 1993 to provide better accessibility for the elderly in 1 room Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats .
The services include upgrading of lifts to access every floor , installation of support handbars in washrooms and setting up a Senior Activity Centre in the neighbourhood .
According to General Housing Survey 2005 , there are around 22 ,000 elderly people living alone .
More attention should be given to this group of elderly as they have no one to turn to if they require help in their home .
By installing handbars and improving the accessibility of lifts , the elderly are now able to move around safely and in greater comfort .
The Senior Activity Centre also provides a place for the lonely old individuals to mingle around and to participate in recreational activities .
The upgrading process might cause inconveniences to the residents but this is a trade off that they have to bear with for a better tomorrow .
Thirdly , the Eldershield scheme was introduced in 2007 .
The scheme automatically covers Singaporeans that are aged 40 and above with an insurance plan .
The payout is $400 per month and up to a period of 6 years if one is to become severely disabled .
According to the Census of Population 2000 , about 3% of the elderly are non-ambulant .
The scheme will reduce their financial burden that arises from medical bills .
However , one will have to pay a minimum of $176 .96 annual premium in order to enjoy the benefits of the scheme .
To make the plan affordable , the government provides premium subsidies and constantly reviews the plan .
In conclusion , the elderly are now more protected and are aging more comfortably with the implementation of the policies .
There are two sides to a coin; although the measures do not solve the problem entirely and may cause inconvenience in some cases , the benefits will eventually outweigh the cons .
The government will have to constantly review and improve the measures to be prepared for the aging population .
There have been many controversial debates on whether the government should limit public spending on the elderly  so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
While the latter is important and inevitable , our government is being challenged to cope with the need to increase allocation of public funds for the elderly with a graying population .
Rising living expenses and healthcare costs is also another factor which highlights the importance of limiting public spending on the elderly .
If a limit is not in place , the government might soon face difficulties in funding other key sectors of the country's development such as education and defense .
Smaller side effects include the over reliance on the government to support the aged .
This will turn the regime of supporting the elderly into a nightmare and burden to the society .
Firstly , with a graying population , the government is expected to spend more public funds each year on areas like healthcare for the elderlyand elderly friendly public facilities such as slopes in housing estates .
This section of public expenditure soaks up a large portion of the government's annual allocated budget each year .
In Singapore's 2009 budget allocation , a total of $66 million (up from a total of $55 .6 million in the year 2008) was allocated from the pool of $18 .1 billion allocated for social development .
This spending allocation only covers enhancements for the elderly in the society and excludes healthcare benefits coverage .
This expenditure is expected to rise further with the increase of life expectancy and the increase in the proportion of the elderly (from 8 .6% in 2008 to 18 .7% in  2030) .
To quote a statistic from Singapore's 2008 budget day report , in 2007 , 21% of the Government Healthcare Expenditure (GHE) , or 0 .2% of the country's GDP was dedicated to elderly care .
This proportion of spending is expected to double in the next three decades .
Many people might however , disagree that government should limit the public spending on aged .
This view is valid as well .
If the government is to limit public spending on this sector and instead channel it to other sectors , this might deprive the needy elderly from obtaining assistance and might lead to adverse effects .
Some of the adverse effects includes , elderly people especially those who are childless , spouseless and elderly people who does not have huge amount of savings to face difficulties to fund their own healthcare or living expenses .
This might in turn result in a social problem where an elderly might be utilized by crime syndicates to commit crimes to fund those expenses .
I strongly agree that public spending on the aged should be limited .
The economic growth of a country relies on many areas such as education , the welfare of the public , defense  , transportation , and many more .
All these aspects work together to make a great impact on the country and make the country grow .
Therefore , the government should not direct their money specifically into certain areas  while neglecting the rest .
Education is one of the very important a country should develop .
The government should invest a substantial amount of effort in this area .
The school is a place where every single young person receives education .
The government should also focus on developing this area to make the learning process more interactive and exciting .
Education and knowledge are important tools that help them to survive int  the working world .
Lack of education leads to lack of knowledge .
If a country does not develop well in the area of education , the economy of the country will definitely not grow well .
Besides that , even though the world is advancing rapidly and there are a lot of jobs out there , there are a lot of fresh graduates who are still unemployed .
This is because most graduates do not meet prerequisites required by the industy .
Thus , the government should also focus on and put in more effort to help these people .
The government should create more job opportunities for them .
For example , the government can run some job training programs to help the graduates exploit their talent and better equip them for the industry .
Investing in the young is more worthwhile than in the aged because they are well-educated and have the potential to make more contributions to the country .
Over  time , the population of the elderly is gradually growing .
If expenditure on the aged is not controlled , the government would be putting more and more money into something which would not really have any impact on the country's economic growth .
The government can limit the expenditure because the burden of healthcare can be borne by the family members of the aged through schemes like MediSave .
However , today , the cost of living is high .
Working adults have to pay for high living expenses such as their children's  tuition and enrichment classes .
To those with low incomes , these are already a burden for them .
Most elderly have a lot of health problems and they also need medical care , the majority of which involves high cost .
Therefore , cutting down on welfare programs will burden the working adult with greater financial problems .
They will then have to  work even harder to earn a living .
For example , they might  take up 2 or more jobs working day and night .
As a result , they end up with poor health  and reduced productivity in their work .
In conclusion , limiting  public spending on the aged does not mean ceasing  expenditure on them .
Instead , it achieves a balance  where the government can set a limit and provide adequate funding for them while focusing on other more important aspects like education  .
Public spending refers to money expended by a government to pay for areas such as defense , development projects , education , health , infrastructure , and law & order maintenance ,  and such spending is supported by taxation .
With an increasing number of elderly in  society , it is rather strenuous for the non-elderly to contribute to the tax base .
And it is in no doubt that the aged require additional spending on public pensions and health care .
However , this does not mean that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
One argument that suggests money should be diverted to the education area is that higher education would help to cut down the sizeable segment of the population who needs government aid during old age in the future .
This is because according to Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer , people with better education are more likely to have higher incomes and better health .
This educational disparity virtually guarantees a diverse group of older people in the future .
However , they should take into consideration the fact that there are elderly from the past generations without good education who have not been able to save in their younger days .
Since they are old , retired and do not have much savings , large health and long-term care expenses will significantly deplete their resources  .
Thus , it is necessary for them to receive sufficient aid from the government .
Some think that spending money on the aged is like throwing money down the drain since it is part and parcel of life for them to grow old , age and die .
If public spending on the aged is limited , it would help to reduce the amount of tax people have to pay to support these elderly in the society .
But we must not forget that these elderly who require aid from the government now are people who once contributed to the country's development .
The contribution they once made , be it little or a lot , helped to build up the country , thus making it possible for people to live comfortably now .
Therefore , it is reasonable for the government to spend on the aged as an act of repaying the elderly .
Certain children who are capable of providing for their elderly parents refuse to do so because they do not want to waste money and assume that it is the government's responsibility to provide for the elderly .
However , it should be made clear to them that public spending on the aged should not be misused .
In order to prevent public spending from being misused , government should provide aid to the aged after assessing their living condition and how much their children can provide for them .
For example , an elderly who lives all alone by himself , without any children , will receive more help from the government if he is unable to provide for himself .
Whereas , an elderly who has children whose income is relatively stable , will receive less help .
After all , it is the children's responsibility to provide for their parents before the government steps in to help .
In this way , public spending will not be misusedand children are forced to be filial and therefore , the government does not have to set a limitation on public spending since the amount spent on the aged will be less .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited because they deserve to receive help from the government when they need it as they once helped to contribute to the country's development .
In order for those elderly  to live reasonably well , but not to the extent of "luxuriously well" , government should assess the living condition of these elderly and provide them with the necessary aid they need .
In recent years , public spending on the aged has gradually increased , sparking countless discussions about whether public spending on the aged should be limited , so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Personally , I agree with such a view .
In countries where the population is not aging , public spending on the aged should be decreased and the funds should be channelled into other more important policies and schemes .
This would benefit the country , both economically and socially .
One of the reasons why the government should not be the one that supports the elderly is the simple concept of filial piety .
Filial piety is one of the virtues that have been around society for ages .
It emphasises  respect for parents .
Therefore , the costs of spending for the should be borne by their respective offspring .
Their children should be the one to support them through their old age as "repayment" for all that their parents have done .
It is not easy to bring up children ; parents have to scrimp and save just to give their children the best .
In general , for the first twenty years of anyone's life , they are fed , clothed and brought from adolescence to adulthood , all for free .
Parents also try to give their children the best education they can afford  .
So , should it not be only fair that their children support them through their old age , especially when they have no one else to rely on ?
Therefore ,  public spending on the aged should be cut down because the younger generation should be the one supporting their parents; it is their own duty and should not be left to the government .
Nevertheless , there will be special cases when such aged folk do not have children to rely on , either because they do not have kids , or due to some misfortune have lost  their children .
In these cases , it would only be right for the government to help them .
Hence ,  public spending on the aged should be limited , but not completely ignored .
Also , in every society where   exist , there will be a group of people who tend to "abuse" the system .
In reality , there are a number of those who try to leech off as much government funding as they can , despite their ability to support themselves .
After the aged retire , there are a large group of them who actually are still fit to workand  are able to do minor jobs to support themselves .
However , this is rarely brought up due to the fact that most of them do not wish to continue working into old age; they believe that they deserve to rest .
Although I believe that people who retire definitely deserve their  freedom , I completely disagree that most of them should be doing it at the expense of the government .
If their children are unable to support them through their old age for whatever reason , they should try to find minor jobs to support themselves , especially if they are still physically fit .
Therefore ,  spending on the aged should be minimized , and  funds that are allocated to it should be given out more wisely and strictly .
Some people disagree that  public spending on aged should be cut down , arguing that the cost of supporting an old person may be too much of a burden for  young adults nowadays .
The children of these aged folk do not earn enough to support their parents .
However , I feel that if there are increased funds in the other areas of  development , the burden would actually be lesser than it already is .
If  public spending on the aged is decreased or minimized and the funds are diverted to other channels to boost  economic growth , the country would be a richer society .
There would be a rise in wealth and the working population would actually have more monetary assets to support the aged .
Also ,  funds could be diverted into other sources which would result in an improvementin a country's cleanliness .
This can be accomplished through  increased technology , or investment into machinery that cleans up  polluted air .
The cost of supporting an old person is  no doubt largely due to  increased medical costs that come with old age .
However , if the country is able to find a way to improve cleanliness  , this will no doubt lead to a healthier population , which in turn means lower medical costs .
Therefore , it is a wiser choice to lower  public spending on the elderly because the net benefit from such an action would be much greater than if we were to leave the spending untouched .
However , such a policy would only work in countries that do not face an ageing population .
Countries that face the problem  are unable to carry out such a plan .
This is due to the fact that it is almost impossible for the younger generation to support the aged , considering  number of aged in society greatly outweighs the generation that supports  them .
Therefore , it would be wiser for the governments of such countries to craft other policies that would suit their own needs .
In conclusion , in countries where the population is not aging , public spending on the aged should be diverted to other more important sectors , such as research and development sectors .
This would in turn benefit the countries more than if they were to leave the policies untouched .
This essay argues to a large extent that current research and developmentpolicies have helped to ease the aging process because of the innovative  that Singapore's government and other organizations have provided  .
These solutions are mostly  in the area of medicine , technology and society  which  are essential in slowing the  and eradicating this problem in the future .
First , many people commonly associate health issues with the elderly .
For instance , in United Kingdom , a research done by Deloitte and summarized by Dr Michael Harris (Nesta , April 2009) showed that more than a quarter of fifty- to sixty-year-old elderly people have been  diagnosed with medical conditions and the numbers are expected to increase in the future .
One of the many medical solutions that helps to slow down aging and is available in the market is called the "Human Growth Hormone" drug (Somatropin , 2006) .
This prescription provides alternatives to improve old age health issues such as memory loss and weaker bones .
However , not many individuals are willing to adopt this medical option as they would want to age naturally and are afraid that this treatment will cause side effects as it is not commonly used .
It is possible for people to have this view because this medicine is not widely used in the market as further research is still ongoing to further improve its effectiveness .
Second , technology is advancing rapidly and users are expected to constantly upgrade themselves to keep up with the pace .
But the elderly may face problems in the process of keeping up .
Most of them will have trouble adjusting to new technology if they are already comfortable with the level of technological background that they are equipped in .
Moreover ,  health conditions such as deteriorating eye sight or poorer hearing can be a problem as well .
However , Microsoft has come up with technological innovation that helps the elderly deal with these situations due to their health concerns .
To illustrate , a Magnifier (Microsoft , March 2009) is made available in Windows so that the user can magnify part of their computer's screen in order to view it clearer .
Nevertheless , despite this solution , the elderly are still struggling to cope with the latest technology .
But they should be willing to adapt to technological changes as these are there to help humans cope with their daily activities ; there are also alternatives provided to these changes so that society would not to neglect the elderly .
Finally , society plays a major role in coping with the problem of an aging population with the country's government as a support .
In Singapore , the government has provided many measures to protect the elderly .
In fact , one of the measures includes the "Maintenance of Parents Act" (Statutes , "Maintenance of Parents Act" , Chapter 167B , June 1996) in which parents can demand  rights from their children who  neglected them .
This  helps to prevent grown up children from running away from their responsibilities towards their parents .
Moreover , companies are also encouraged to employ older workers even after these workers are past their retirement age (Channel NewsAsia , September 2009) .
To further attract the interest of companies to do so , recognition such as the "AARP International Innovative Employer Awards" is given out to companies which demonstrate innovation in  inclusion of elderly in their companies (AARP International , January 2008) .
Yet , despite such incentives being given out , many companies still choose to retrench those who fall under the older age group during the retrenchment period claiming that the elderly are less productive and effective .
While this may be true , it is possible to keep the elderly  from being retrenched  as they can take up  courses to improve their skills .
In conclusion , although such research and policies have yet to fully solve the problem of an aging population , they still provide alternatives for the aged and society to cope with the problem .
Thus , it is up to the individuals themselves to determine whether they  want to oblige to the policies implemented or try out those new alternatives .
Aging population is becoming a more and more serious problem , consuming a great amount of money from public programs .
There are several solutions proposed to ease this problem .
One solution is limiting the money spent on programs for the aged and diverting that money to other areas of a country's development .
Some critics say implementing this solution might imply that the government does not want to support the elderly; however , it is a practical solution to the current aging population problem .
Some people say this solution might cause financial difficulty to many elderly and their family , especially some critical segments of the elderly population , such as those who have particularly low income like older single women , or those who have attained little education ( Friedland and  Summer , 2005) .
However , this policy will only use up a part of the money used for the aged .
The remaining money will be used to serve the ones who really need the support from  government .
Those who can support themselves , either by their own savings  or by support of family , should help reduce  financial stress exerted on programs for the elderly .
In fact , there are more and more people who do not have to rely on the government help .
Friedland and  Summer (2005) also agree that "the population aged 65 to 75 is healthier , wealthier and better educated than persons in this age group in past generations" .
In fact , several countries have already implemented means testing systems that reflect the above idea .
In Australia , there is  means testing for age pension based on  income test and assets test to assess compensation payments (http://www .fahcsia .gov .au) .
Starting from 1 January 2009 , Singapore has run a means testing system in its public hospitals: a certain group of citizens with a certain range of income will have a different subsidy scheme .
For example , citizens who have average income lower than $3200 per month will have their hospital fees subsidized by 80% while those who earn more than $5200 monthly will only have their hospital fees subsidized by 50% (source: http://www .hospitals .sg) .
Most importantly , limiting public money spending on the aged will save a great amount of money for the government .
This money can be diverted to other needier and more important programs , such as educational , environmental  and other economic development related programs .
These programs are essential to ensure the development of a country in the near future (economic development programs) and in the long run (education programs) .
Friedland and  Summer (2005) state that the key word in fighting against aging population is economic growth .
As the economy develops , the country will generate more money and thus be able to spend a greater amount of money on programs such as health care support for the elderly .
In conclusion , a country which faces an aging population problem should consider limiting public money spent on the aged and instead use more of itforits development .
Such money can be considered as an investment for the country's economy .
Besides , a country could also  support programs that make this policy run more effectively , such as promoting children's willingness to support their elderly parents and implementing means testing programs .
Yes , I agree .
Information Technology (IT) has come a long way .
Firstly , it is user-friendly .
With IT , the old can age with dignity .
Also , IT is indispensible for learning .
It is said that one is never too old to learn .
With IT , this saying can never be truer .
Moreover , IT makes it easier to grow old nowadays with more available help .
IT is user-friendly .
It overcomes the two main problems that the elderly have when using IT .
Firstly , the elderly may have a difficult time figuring out the user interface .
Also , old people tend to forget .
Because of the above , the elderly may find using IT a challenge .
However , IT can actually be made simple to use .
One way is to provide a simple user interface .
With this , the elderly will never go wrong as there are only a few buttons to choose from .
Another way is to provide a functionality to the interface to "remember" inputs .
This way  , the elderly would not have to worry about having forgotten what they have done before to the interface .
IT is indispensible for learning .
Some people may think that many people nowadays do not have much patience with the elderly .
Teaching the elderly would therefore be a chore for them .
IT , on the other hand , will never grow impatient with the old .
It acts as an alternative and gives older people chances to learn or try to do something .
Some people may argue that although IT would not grow impatient with the old , the old may , in contrast , grow impatient with IT .
However , I believe that IT is user-friendly , and therefore easy to pick up .
The elderly , if given a chance at IT , will never tire of it .
IT makes it easier to grow old nowadays with more available help .
IT (as cited in Helsinki , 8 April , 2003) could improve the operative ability of the elderly and may even enhance their well-being .
The aged could even prevent being sent to an old folk's home , be able to live alone at home , and increase individual management of their personal issues .
One big hurdle is to get the elderly to accept the new products and to learn how to use them .
However , with the considerable degree of benefit that they will have , I think this hurdle would not be a problem .
The elderly would just have to see and understand the advantages IT would bring to their lives .
From the above , we can see that to a large extent , current research and development in IT have helped to ease the aging process .
IT not only brings great convenience to the livelihood of the aged , but is also user-friendly .
This makes it easy for the elderly , who would be slow at learning , to pick up IT and get familiarized with it at their own time .
It is also clear that with all the above reasons , the elderly would most definitely find it rather undemanding for them to embrace IT in their lives .
Aging is a process of life that one would eventually go through .
Many problems usually start to arise when one reaches  old age .
For instance , one will have lower productivity in work as well as  will need to face the issue of rising social and healthcare cost ( Peterson , 2001) .
Also , the effects of having little education , not being able to save during one's economically active years as well as deteriorating health among the elderly suggest that government should not limit public spending on them ( Friedland and  Summer , 2005) .
Although there are many benefits if money is diverted to other areas of a country's development , such as education and generation of a more productive workforce , public spending on the aged should not be limited to allow elderly people to age with dignity .
First of all , public spending on the aged can be diverted to help those people who have lower income but have the potential of pursuing a higher education to get better qualification .
The government could offer scholarships or offer subsidized school fees based on their income level in order to help to generate more highly educated people so that the effects of having little education and not being able to save during one's economically active years could be minimized .
Although there are benefits , this will result in a large number of people having high qualifications and it will end up becoming something that is common among everybody .
Therefore , diverting money to education would not help to minimize the effect of having little education and not being able to save during one's economically active years .
Thus , this suggests that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
Secondly , public spending on the aged can be diverted to increase salaries and bonuses of  people who are more hardworking and productive so that it will help to generate a more productive workforce .
With an increase in salaries and bonus , it will allow one to save during their economically active years and also help them to slow down deteriorating health that will continues into old age .
one will have the ability to pay for their healthcare cost in order to cure any illnesses before it continue into old age .
On the other hand , with an increase in salary and bonuses of  people who are more hardworking and productive , it will result in everybody fighting for such increases  and therefore , one will become an enemy of the other person .
This also suggests that public spending on on the aged not be limited  .
In conclusion , public spending should not be diverted to other areas such as education and generation of a more productive workforce .
Instead , the government should support the aged by providing work that are suitable for them  as well as providing support for their medical and social spending in order to help them  cope with the rising issue of social and healthcare cost .
In addition , by providing work for the elderly , they can earn enough money for themselves to spend even though they were unable to save during their economically active years .
Moreover , when the government provides support for medical and social spending , it will allow the elderly to have enough money to spend for their other leisure activities .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to allow the elderly to age with dignity .
Yes , I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be used for other areas of development .
There are several reasons  why public spending should be limited .
One reason is that the government can still provide benefits to the elderly by developing programmes that will benefit all age groups .
By limiting public spending on the aged , the government can focus on other areas of development such as the economy .
Government could use public funds to invest in job markets to increase the economic growth of the country .
This does bring some benefits to the elderly .
With an increase in economic growth , the number of working population will rise as more people will be able to find jobs .
In addition , working adults would be able to earn more income in a stable economy .
Therefore , the working population will have more capability to support their elderly parents .
This will encourage working adults to take responsibility in looking after their elderly parents and thus , promoting filial obligation .
On top of that , with a better economy , the elderly will be able earn more income if they decide to continue to work until retirement age .
Transportation is another vital area of development .
Firstly , business depends on a reliable network of transportation , as time saved will be money saved .
In addition , the transportation network is a key determinant of how businesses are  which , in turn will affect the flow of investments and the country's economy .
Secondly , people of all age groups need to travel .
With a better transportation infrastructure , travelling time will be reduced and accessibility will be increase .
For example , with more MRT stations and buses , the working population will find travelling to their workspaces  become more convenient .
As for the elderly , they will be able to save time travelling to places such as hospitals , community centers  , etc .
The elderly would also be able to travel in a more comfortable way .
Therefore , the government should use public funds to improve transportation .
Funds could be used to build more MRT stationsand increase the frequency and quality of buses which in turn , will benefit everyone .
There are other reasons  why public spending on the aged should be limited .
One reason is the rising cost of care for the aged .
This is because the number of people aged 60 and above is expected to  triple by year 2050 .
Also , with the rising cost of living , the amount of funds needed to care for the elderly will rise tremendously .
This will mean  higher tax is required .
Therefore , if the government does not limit the spending , more taxpayer's money will be needed to  care for the elderly .
If this trend continues , the country's financial reserves will be depleted .
As a result , there is a need to balance  public spending .
In conclusion , public spending on the elderly should be limited so that funds could be used in other areas of development .
The government must be able to balance the funds so that it will benefit all age groups without compromising anyone .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development" .
I disagree with this statement .
The idea of reducing public spending for the aged would eventually generate more problems in the country and thus slow down the country's development instead .
The scope of this essay focuses on the area of public spending in healthcare of the elderly .
The country could consider adjusting the budget to improve the economy .
Indeed , this may seem to be a wise move as the country will be richer in its next budget planning .
However , as the economy grows , wages increase and the cost of living also increases , it would be inevitable that prices of products , medication ,  services , and hospitalization bills , would also be on the rise .
As  subsidy is reduced , the family will have to pay more .
Therefore , the positive effect of an increase in wages could be  offset by or even be insufficient to keep up with the cost of living for the middle and lower income groups .
Thus , this would lead to the rich getting richer , and the poor getting poorer .
Can we consider  , a country with high GDP , tall and flashy buildings , but  with an increasing number of its citizens   living in slum conditions a country with good economy ?
The answer is no .
In order to reduce public spending  the aged , policy makersargue  that children who take responsibilityfor their elderly parents' medical expenses because it is a form of filial piety .
Despite  this wonderfully painted deception , reality proves otherwise , as people  to work around the system .
For example , the existence of schemes such as Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) and Euthanasia , though only in certain countries , could tell a different story as these voluntary schemes may possibly not be so voluntary after all .
Children could force their parents to die earlier allegedly to relieve their pain so as to lighten the children's financial burden .
The movie "Money No Enough 2" , directed by Jack Neo , shows a scene in the hospital where a mother's three children burn a talisman hoping for their mother's death during the economic downturn .
In addition , according to {http://www .euthanasia .com/deaths2003 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://www .euthanasia .com/deaths2003 .html] ,  an increased in the number of people in Oregon died through euthanasia , of whom 37% of the patients had indicated  being concerned about the financial burden of their families {http://www .euthanasia .com/reasons2003 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://www .euthanasia .com/reasons2003 .html] .
Although these statistics did not specifically target on the aged , they indicate that being a financial burden played a part in their decision to terminate their lives  , be they instigated or not .
Thus , the well-planned move for moral education may not be imparting the correct moral value in the end .
Money could also be invested in many other areas of the country's development for further growth or better benefits to the country , rather than waste on healthcare benefits for the elderly .
On the other hand , it is the aged population that had brought the country to what it is right now with their sweat and blood .
Their ailments and conditions could have resulted from their work , be it directly or indirectly caused , while contributing to the nation's progress , thus they should not be ignored .
Because of this ,  it is only reasonable that the country should look after these past contributors and not to overlook their achievements just because they are no longer as capable of contributing to the  .
This latter  move will reflect badly on how the country regards its citizens; it may even discourage its citizens from performing their best , or even  and work in other countries , as they know that the state will not take care of them in their later life .
To sum up , without a doubt diverting public spending from supporting the aged population to the other areas of development in the country may at first seem to be the best option , but eventually , it could  result in more harm than good , either by upsetting the balance of wealth in the country , imparting wrong moral values or conveying the wrong message to its citizens  .
With the development of societies , governments and policy makers pay more attention to the phenomenon of aging populations , especially in developed countries .
According to incomplete figures , in the European countries , spending on pensions , health , and related issues is currently 15% of GDP (gross domestic product)  .
However , although  spending on the aged is high , it should not be limited .
Some argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
For instance , government should cut down the spending on the aged , and use more money to attract talented immigrants .
This cannot only stimulate economic growth , but also buffer the rate of aging population .
To a large extent , it seems quite reasonable .
However , the result  may be that many immigrants who have different cultural backgrounds will enter the country .
One country with a great influx of immigrants may  become unstable , since cultures are different and cultural fusion needs a long period of time .
Hence , it is not necessary to limit  public spending on the aged to attract talented immigrants .
On the one hand , limiting  public spending on the aged does not mean that we can spend less money on the aged .
Some of the reasons mentioned are "reducing the share of public support does not eliminate societal costs" ( Friedland and   If public spending on the aged is limited , there will be social costs and repercussions on families and local communities .
Such costs may even be higher than the original cost of public spending on the aged .
At the same time , cutting down public spending on  will shift the financial pressure on  families with old people .
Therefore , we should not limit  public spending on the aged .
On the other hand , such spending should promote a sense of humanity and result in  more ways to help these vulnerable groups ; after all , it is the duty of government to pay more attention to the  groups in  society .
The aged belong to these   , as their productivity  is relatively low , with their medical expenses and social costs  higher than other age groups .
Thus , public support to finance  the aged is extremely important .
In contrast , some may say that it is of children to show filial obedience to the older generation , so young family members must take care of the older generation so government can take less responsibility for older people .
Thus ,  public spending on the aged should be limited .
However , the aim of government is to enable people in its country to live better and happier .
If we just cut down  public spending on the aged and divert  money to other areas of the country's development , this is contrary to the purpose of the government .
In other words , why do we divert the money to other areas of the country's development in the first place ?
Because we want to make our country stronger and the lives of citizens better .
Consequently , diverting the money to other areas of the country's development is an extra and needless job .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited just so  money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , it does not mean that the aged should totally depend on government's support .
The aged are advised to solve their problems as possibly as they can and put  public support as their second choice .
I agree with the statement that "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
Although we are moving towards a  fast aging population , public spending should be limited and diverted to areas like monetary reward to encourage parents to have more babies .
The country's development should not be hindered just because there is a need for public spending on the aged .
Besides , if we were to slow down the country's development , this might hinder our economic growth which , in turn , will affect  public spending on the aged indirectly .
As we are now facing the problem of a fast aging population , healthcare expenses incurred by the elderly need funding .
To fund these expenses , a large sum of money is needed .
Therefore , if public spending on the aged were to be limited , less budget would be set aside for the elderly , which would affect them as healthcare is very important to them as they  face many health issues .
With the limitation of public spending on the aged , the elderly might not receive essential healthcare due to insufficient funding , which may lead to undesired  .
If public spending on the aged were to be limited and diverted to funds to encourage couples to have more babies , many people would plan to have more babies since their worries of not having enough money to bring up or to support  many babies might have been partially subsidized by the fund .
As the increase in the fund for baby bonus leads to more people planning to have more babies , this would eventually reduce the problem of having too many elderly which result in an aging society .
Besides , when these babies grow up , they will be able to work and earn money to support their parents .
In this way , it indirectly reduces the problem of having to set aside a big amount of money to aid healthcare services for the elderly .
Another reason for limiting public spending on the aged is that the children of the elderly should pay for their parents' healthcare expenses .
If  funding for the aged is limited , this will result in children bearing the responsibilities to look after their own parents .
As people can no longer depend on  society to look after their parents , they will have to take up the responsibilities of looking after their own parents .
In this way , people will be setting a good example to their children on how to look after parents when they grow old .
Although funding for healthcare services for the elderly is essential , it should be limited and diverted to other areas , especially baby bonus .
With more babies born , it could mean more people looking after their parents in the future , which would in turn cut down funds needed for the elderly .
In addition , having more babies will reduce our median age and also solve our problem with an aging population .
I do not agree with the statement that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
As Singapore's population is aging , it is the best time  for them to provide for the aged .
The elderly have contributed their years of youth to the society .
Critics might think that as someone is aging , that person  can no longer provide for the society anymore; money should not be spent on them as they will leave sooner or later .
However , the elderly can still provide for the society even if they are old as they are the wisest group of people .
Firstly , the elderly can provide for  society by imparting values to the younger generation .
The elderly have spent many years of their youth on this earth .
Thus they have the most life experiences .
They have gone through many good and difficult times .
Therefore they are in the best position to impart values to their children as they are the wisest person in each family .
In this way , the younger generation will be able to gain more wisdom from them .
Hence , crime rates will be greatly reduced as the younger generation will be wise enough to do only the right things .
This will help to make Singapore the safest country in the world .
Therefore the public should continue to provide for them .
Furthermore , even if someone is old , he/she can still provide for the society in terms of decision making .
With the amount of life experiences , they will know the consequences of implementing different kinds of solutions .
A very good example is our former Prime Minister , Mr Lee Kuan Yew .
Despite  his old age , he still contributes to  society by making major decisions for the country .
This shows that an elderly person is never a useless person in the society .
On the contrary , they are the ones who can make the wisest decisions .
These decision making skills can also be imparted to the younger generation .
Hence , the public should continue to provide for the aged .
In addition to the above mentioned factors , the elderly have already contributed many years of their youth to  society .
Now that they are old , they have problems working for their own allowance .
It is the social responsibility of the public to provide for them in order to express their gratitude for the years that they have contributed to the society .
If not for them , Singapore would never have become a developed country .
Hence , there is no way that the other areas can be developed .
Therefore , the public should continue to provide for the aged .
In conclusion , I do not agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
The elderly can contribute to the society by using their life experiences to make important decisions for the country .
They will also be able to impart life values and skills to the younger generation .
This may seem impossible but it can be made possible if each elderly person begins imparting these values to his own children .
In due time , Singapore will become the safest county that can make the best decisions .
Until recently , there was  much concern about the consequences of over spending on the welfare of the aging population .
It is said that , if a huge portion of the public's money goes to the aging population , it will cause undesirable effects to the country in many ways .
The median age in Singapore is anticipated to be doubled by 2050 .
Which means that the amount spent on the welfare of the senior citizens is also expected to be doubled .
Elder people tend to be the primary beneficiaries from the public spending .
Although , the welfare of the senior citizen may be important  it should not to an extent where the other areas of the country's development are being hindered .
What is therefore needed is to take a close look at the current situation and evenly distribute the public spending into different areas to ensure that the country is  able to prosper .
Public spending must be limited so that it can be diverted into other major areas where it forms the pillars of the economy , like Education , Defense , Technology , and Research & Development .
If the government does not invest enough in these areas , the country will lose its competitiveness , productive capacity in the economy and decrease in public services which will greatly harm the economy .
The importance of a quality educational system is not less than the importance of the aging population .
There is a need to educate the future workforce of the economy , and also to create a workforce which is truly competitive and productive .
Japan is a country with little natural resources and yet has a very highly educated population , which resulted in them being one of the  foremost and advanced countries in the world .
A population with poor educational background will find it hard to compete with other foreign talents with quality education background , thus losing out when it comes to employment and resulting in a huge percentage of the population being unemployed .
Furthermore , foreign investors will not set up factories in countries that are equipped with a poorly educated workforce .
Thus  education is equally important .
The amount spent on the defense should not be neglected as well .
Singapore is a country which is constantly  the target of  terrorists .
There were several terror attempts on Singapore , but it was foiled mainly due to  an effective and strong defense system .
A weak defense system can cripple a country's economy .
For example , New York City was once a major financial center in the world , but after  the September 11th incident , the majority of the investors left New York seeking safer alternatives .
This particular incident cost New York billions of dollars and also millions of job lost overnight .
In addition , defense is also used to safeguard the economic interest of Singapore .
Singapore , being a small country and yet having one of the strongest economies in Asia , has always been the target its neighboring countries .
Without a strong and effective defense , Singapore would have been an easy target .
Therefore , defense is one of the most important areas which safeguards theinterests of a country and the allocation of budget to this area should never be overlooked .
Critics often said that the senior citizens were the country's pioneers and they had been through the process of nation building and it is our responsibility to ensure that their welfare  should never be overlooked .
However , the allocation of the public spending on the aged should be based on wants and the needs of the elderly .
The financially strapped elderly  will receive the necessary subsidies for medical  , and transportation costs from the government .
Therefore ,  those who are financially capable will have to rely solely on their retirement savings .
Otherwise , it would be a huge drain on the tax payer's money , which will not be utilized to its maximum potential .
Clearly , public spending on the aged is required , but other areas which will affect the development of the country are also equally important , if not  more important .
In this ever changing and competitive society , Singapore needs to make the necessary investments in other areas to ensure that it retains its foothold in the global economy .
Therefore there is a need to analyze the importance of each area and cleverly distribute the spending .
If we do not limit the spending on the aged , Singapore may risk  losing its current global recognition status 
Aging is an inevitable process which is often a slow and painful process for the society in general .
With the current research and development and policies , I agree this has helped  ease the aging process to a large extent .
Due to the globally aging population , many countries have since started their research and development on the aging process .
The government has also stepped in by introducing various policies to suit the needs of the aging population .
This has indeed become a global problem with the extensive amount of medical research going on and the various policies that are being developed .
Thus in the next few paragraphs , I will explain in depth  the  research and government policies being developed to help to ease the aging process .
Firstly , the advancement in science in the 2lst century has brought numerous astounding discoveries to prolong good health in times of old age .
An example is that there has been quite a lot of research on the kind of food  one consumes which will help to retard the aging process .
An example of the above is  research done by Pusan National University in Korea stating that eating kimchi could reduce the risk of heart disease and retard the aging process by reducing the amount of oxygen the body burns((Ilbo , 2000) , 2000) .
Another discovery  was found in the last few years that drinking red wine in moderation helps to preserve good health and retard the aging process .
This is because  red wine contains a substance known as "resveratrol" .
"Resveratrol" is considered to be so effective when it comes to slowing the aging process because the amount of [pic]antioxidants that are present within it .
The [pic]antioxidants that are present within this substance prevents and repairs cell damage that is caused by free radicals in the body .
It is these free radicals that wreak havoc within our bodies because they damage cells , which not only cause disease but also aging .
Thus , one can see how extensive this research  being carried out to ease the aging process of mankind is . . Secondly , the government has come up with various policies to ease the aging process .
In this case , we will take Singapore as an example because of the policies being implemented for the aging .
Singaporeans all know of the term  "CPF" .
"CPF" stands for Central Provident Fund which is a scheme that helps the citizens to save up an amount of money for their retirements needs .
With Singapore's aging population , the government has stepped in by increasing the interest rate of CPF .
The government also implemented the "Minimum Sum Policy" to ensure that one has a specific amount in his or her CPF before allowing them to withdraw it at the age of 55 .
The Minimum Sum was set at $80 ,000 in 2003 and will be raised gradually until it reaches $120 ,000 in 2013 .
This helps one to save up more for retirement in the later years .
Another policy implemented by the Singapore Government is the "ADVANTAGE !"
scheme .
It was introduced in October 2005 to support companies to recruit and retain mature workers as well as to re- employ them beyond the retirement age of 62 (Berita Harian , 2007) .
The scheme has helped the elderly by introducing age-friendly initiatives such as job re-design , automation , wage restructuring , training and introduction of re-employment policies in the workplace (Berita Harian , 2007) .
At the end of April 2007 , 411 companies had already adopted the scheme .
This shows how effectively the government pushes the policy .
Therefore , one can hardly see how the policies do not help to ease the aging process .
Controversially , citizens have argued that these policies do not help them in the aging process because it has taken a toll on their nett salary after having money deducted to their "CPF" contributions which make monthly living allowances even less for them .
An example is the rise in the "Minimum Sum" scheme .
This has been proven to be untrue as the majority of Singaporeans supports the "CPF" schemes which encourages safer retirement and there are many citizen who even went to sign up for more policies from the government on their own accord .
To conclude , due to  a globally aging population , various research and development have been carried out to slow down the aging process and the policies implemented by the government for late retirement .
It is hard to see how such research and policies do not help to ease the aging process 
In  Singapore , the number of ageing people continues to rise at an alarming rate due to the high fertility rate in the past .
With the sharp decline of birth rates that we are facing now , the majority of Singaporeans will be faced with a harder task-  taking care of elderly family members .
Hence , I disagree to a large extent that "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
There are three areas that I will discuss .
These are contributions that elderly have made; the different needs and problems of the aged and the responsibility of  the children .
Firstly , contributions to society made by the elderly cannot be ignored .
In the past , Singapore was an under developed country with swamps and kampongs  .
The living conditions were poor too .
If not for the elderly members of Singapore who contributed in helping to mould Singapore into a highly developed country today , many will not be enjoying the fruits of the labor .
They have laid a sturdy foundation only for most of us to benefit from it; the infrastructure , the technology , and the standard of living have made us what we are today .
As such , with all the hardships that the aged people have gotten through in helping to develop our country , it will be ruthless for us to leave them unattended or even setting limitations .
Ageing is viewed as an inevitable phase of life that we are compelled to live through .
Despite the challenges surrounding an ageing society , it is still depicted as the best part of our lives - 'the golden years' .
This description of old age is true as most countries have now increased efforts to address the challenges surrounding the graying population .
Therefore , I agree that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the ageing process .
One of the major problems faced by the aged is financial security .
Most elderly are worried about retirement costs .
One way to deal with the financial challenges of an ageing population is to enforce a compulsory saving scheme for their old age .
Like many governments around the world , the Singapore government has implemented the Central Provident Fund (CPF) whereby a fixed percentage of its citizens' salaries is set aside to the fund .
Recently , there have also been top-ups provided to their CPF accounts to further help them meet their retirement needs .
However , some may argue that no matter how large the nest-egg one has carefully managed to put aside , the sum is not sufficient to cover the rising cost of everyday life and healthcare services .
As a solution , the government also invests a considerable amount of resources in health promotion and disease prevention .
Not only are the healthcare services subsidized , a community health screening programme is also inaugurated for seniors .
These enable the aged to lead a better quality life without being anxious over financial difficulties .
It is regrettable that when we think of old age , what automatically comes to mind are visions of loneliness and neglect .
Over the years , efforts have been made to develop elder-friendly public infrastructure and housing as well as community based support services .
In Singapore , HDB flats are now designed with the ageing population in mind .
One example is the Studio Apartment Scheme .
These studios are built in such a way that it allows the elderly to be independent .
Some facilities include  lifts at every floor instead of alternate floors and  elder-friendly features such as non-slip tiles and grab bars .
Railing , ramps and passage way access to building are also  available .
With this , elderly people who have difficulty walking can get help by holding on to railing and at the same time exercise their leg muscles .
Ramps are also built for the wheelchair bound so that they can go in and out of the building without any help .
In addition , located within the perimeters are senior citizens' corners which allow them to mingle with one another .
However , one setback is the breakdown of family ties .
Children may not find the need to visit as they assume that the elderly already have  proper care .
Although some people claim that old people enjoy each other's company more than that of the young people , I find it hard to imagine an old person feeling very happy with only rare visits from his or her family .
Friendships may be important , but surely kinship is equally , if not , more important .
The government promotes close family bonding through education and celebrations such as 'Grandparents' Day .'
This way , the elderly can age happily in the comfort of their homes , surrounded by family and friends .
In conclusion , I agree that to a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the ageing process .
The elderly would feel more at ease knowing that help is forthcoming for them in their twilight years .
I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
It is well-known that our society is aging and there are strategies currently in place to aid the aged that would lessen their financial burden or other needs .
Singapore may suffer from long term economic loss while possible government support for the elderly could cause a portion of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to decline .
To deal with the limitation of public spending for the aged , a budget amount should be set aside to allow enough funds to be used for building and developing infrastructure , creating employment opportunities and improving the standard of living to benefit the nation , as well as to increase its economy and  GDP .
Firstly , by having more funds , Singapore can build and develop new infrastructure .
Public transportation systems including light rail system , mass rapid transit system , as well as the current new railway network , Circle line , are well advanced to make the public accessible to any location in Singapore .
Constructing of overhead bridges and expressways has benefited the citizens too .
Developing housing facilities in new towns or designated places enable people to have water and power supply , modern sanitation and communication systems .
Currently , the government has set aside an amount to build integrated resorts , the casinos , and tourist attractions to attract tourists to  Singapore .
This would enable foreign currency/ exchange to come in and improve the economy .
Next , having more funds can create employment opportunities for the people .
Having hotels , shopping centers , transportation or other amenities would  improve the economy .
Tourists  spend their money on accommodation in hotels , shopping and entertainment , food and beverages in restaurants , cultural shows and souvenirs and transportation which would generate foreign exchange .
Employment opportunities would then be created for the local people  as hotel attendants , tour guides are needed .
As these people need to be hired , they can contribute to the society and sustain the economy .
Lastly , the government can use funds to improve the standard of living for the citizens such as  building more schools to provide better education , and have advanced healthcare technology so that citizens can enjoy the excellent healthcare services With such rising affluence , people would expect a better quality of life .
Given the current situation , most of the people in Singapore would be able to go beyond meeting their basic needs such as food , shelter , water , electric power supply , sanitation , health care and education .
If there's an improvement in Singapore's economy , citizens would receive high income to have good food and modern housing .
When people have an improved standard of living , they will be able to contribute to , and sustain the economy .
However , the rising standard of living can cause some factors that will contribute to the aging population such as high-quality health care , which helps people live longer .
Even though with the help from the government and fund raising campaigns set up by charity organizations , there will be still a sizeable segment of the population the government has to consider to continue to aid  .
With the rising cost of basic necessities and medical costs due to inflation in the future , those with no or low income  will suffer as these factors will result in the elderly not having enough savings or income to overcome the current economic climate .
Furthermore , social problems like quarrelling over money issues , or even stealing of money would happen in future .
Another point is that the elderly , in their younger age , would have contributed to the society and the economy .
Therefore , the government has to play a part to help the aged if they have any financial difficulties or in any other ways .
In conclusion , an aging population may cause Singapore's economy to decline .
However , since the elderly in their younger age may have contributed to the society and the economy , we should spend a certain amount of money for their needs if they have problems dealing with money issues .
But , the amount must be balanced and has to take into consideration  other needs such as improving and developing  creating employment opportunities and the rising standard of living of the nation .
The extent of public spending on the aged has always been a complicated issue in many developed countries .
Over spending may result in a shortage of resources in the development of the nation , while under spending may imply  negligence of government towards the aged .
We will discuss  whether to limit the public spending on the aged .
Firstly , with appropriate limitations , more money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Upon having better technology and infrastructure developments , the country will be able to attract more Multinational Corporations (MNCs) to invest ,  thus increasing job opportunities .
For example , Singapore has  attracted MNCs such as Las Vegas Sands Corp . and Genting International & Star Cruises to invest in the tourism sector .
Integrated Resorts (IR)  will generate approximately 50 ,000 to 60 ,000 additional jobs .
It is also estimated that there will be a boost in the tourism receipts by 2015 and this will improve the economy of Singapore .
Hence , it can be clearly seen that with limitations to public spending on the aged , the money diverted to other areas can help in boosting the economy condition of the country .
Secondly , there is no transparency with regard  to the distribution of public spending .
Since no publications are made known , tax payers may be doubtful about the usage of their  taxes .
There had been cases of misuse of public spending within countries .
People may make use of charity opportunities to obtain money from the public and use it for their own personal benefit For example in recent news , Ren Ci's ex-director had been embroiled in a complicated money scandal .
It was reported that  he was supposed to loan an amount to Mandala Buddhist Cultural Centre but it ended up with his former personal aide .
This incident led to the distrust of the public towards charity organizations .
As a consequence , there was a dramatic drop in Ren Ci's donations from 9 .3 to 1 .1 million .
Limitations and transparency can be made to gain back  confidence  in public spending .
A third reason to limit the public spending on the aged will be that the aged population today is different from that of the past past .
They are healthier , wealthier and more educated than that of the past .
Many of them are within the top management .
They hold high posts such as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) , Chief Operating Officer etc .
They are capable of taking care of their lives and do not need the government's aid .
Other than this group of aged , there is also another group of aged who refuses to obtain help from others .
Due to their strong integrity , they believe that as long as they are physically fit , they will want to continue to work and support for themselves .
To facilitate this , McDonald's adopted a policy to recruit the aged population as their staff members .
As the aged  are able to take care of themselves , public spending can be limited so that it can be invested in other areas for enhanced development .
Finally , having no limitation on public spending on the aged will lead to an increase in dependency on the public spending by the aged .
Apparently , some persons will try to abuse the public spending policy .
They will have this mindset that since the government will be taking care of their lives , they need not work . .
Hence , they will rely heavily on the government subsidies .
However , there may be a small minority of aged who are physically unfit to work .
They will need subsidies from government in order to maintain their lives .
Hence limitations on public spending should be implemented so that only this needy group of the aged will benefit . .
In conclusion , with proper limitations on public spending on the aged , the excess money can be channelled to the development of the country , thus improving its economy  .
More trust can be gained from the public with transparency .
The aged population will also be encouraged to take care of themselves instead of over-relying on public spending .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited .
In  modern societies , the aging population is increasing  .
The reason is that the more the living standard is developed , the more the life is lengthened .
Therefore , the government should consider carefully how it treats this special group of citizens .
However , there are some people who state that the public spending on the aged should be limited , so that the money can be spent on other areas .
I totally agree with this idea .
This essay will give some reasons that support thist idea .
To begin with , it cannot be denied that the youth are the most important part of the citizens in every country , not the elderly .
The young people are the workers who can contribute directly to the country .
The research has shown that before 30 is the best time to learn and work in our lives .
The young citizens can work better than the elder ones .
Hence , the increasing of the public spending on the youth is not unfair .
Moreover , in my opinion , if a country has few old people , it will not be a matter; but a country which has few youths  may cause a lot of problems about manpower resources .
However , the opponents of this position argue that the elderly may have a lot of experience , and so they are very important .
To me , that is not true .
Although the aged have experience , that was in the past .
The world is constantly changing , so everybody must learn day by day .
The Internet today is the most powerful tool that can bring a lot of iinformation and the youth can use it easily .
Secondly , I hold the view that if all the other areas of the country are developed adequately , the living standard of the aging population will increase then .
It is easily  seen that if all the other parts of the public facilities are improved strongly , the living standard will increase for all the people in the country , including the elderly .
As far as I am concerned , when the living standard is developed , the incomes of the young people will rise so that they can pay more money to help their parents , who are the aged also .
Another argument  is when the government pays so much on the other areas , there will not be any money to help the elderly .
This counter argument is good but it may be not correct because the government pays for the other areaswhich are also the public facilities , so that the elderly can utilise those facilities also .
In my mind , the youth have a duty to care for their old parents in the way that  their parents took care of them when they were young .
All in all , there are many reasons which support the idea that  spending  on the aged should be limited .
There are also many benefits for the aged citizens .
All things considered , I totally agree with this idea .
Aging , a biological process which every single normal human in this world must experience every day , has become quite a  serious problem for some countries in  recent decades .
Japan for instance , with its average age of population at 42 in the year 2009 , is having a quite serious problem with an aging population .
What is the actual problem with the aging problem ?
Basically , with the number of the working population dwindling  and the number of the so called "old aged" rising up , the expense for taking care of the "old" is increasing and the economy is facing a huge threat of collapsing .
This  , however , has been taken too seriously by some countries .
Although this problem is quite serious , over-emphasizing and spending too much on this problem is not a good idea .
I agree that spending for the old age should be limited for the "old" is not the only concern of a country .
There exists many other aspects of a country that needs more funding and , in some cases , spending more in these other aspects can actually help a country's aging population problem .
Education in a country is one area that can indirectly help in easing the aging population problem .
How can the education sector help ?
Firstly we have to take a look at the cause of the decrease in the  working population .
The decrease itself can be caused by 2 different things: low birth rate , which means the problem arises because of the shortage of youth; and low education , which means that the problem arises because the shortage of well-educated youths for the workforce .
In the latter case , reallocating the funds for taking care of the "old" to the education sector can help in both easing the aging population and developing the country .
One example of this case is Singapore .
With the education sector well funded , not only  can Singapore increase the number of workforce by increasing the number of educated youths , she/ it also manage to attract a lot of immigrants from the neighboring countries such as Malaysia , China , India , Vietnam , and Indonesia .
These immigrants and well-educated youth , in the long run , can ease the aging problem by becoming the workforce , increasing the size and moving the wheels of the economy and decreasing the elder dependency on the government .
Another aspect that can help in easing the problem is the industrial development of a country .
In contrast to the earlier education sector which helps in easing the problem by eliminating the cause , an increase in spending in this sector helps by reducing the effects of the old aging population: the collapse of the economy .
The aging population problem can practically stop the turning wheels of economy as the ones who turn the wheel are the industrial and commercial sector of a country , which needed youths as its workforce .
By spending more in this sector , one can hope that the economy will not collapse and immigrants are more attracted to come .
Japan , in this case , is one good example .
Japan , as one of the developed countries , has put great emphasize in its industries .
Their industries , starting from the modern gaming industries such as koei and konami to the more luxurious and "heavy" industries of sport cars such as Mitsubishi , are well-known to have a wide range of customers around the world .
With the industrial sector well-developed , Japan can still maintain its economy from falling despite  its average population age of 42 and proved that funding the industrial development sector can really help in easing the aging problem by reducing its impact .
Although one can already see from the examples above that spending on the old age should be limited and the fund should be reallocated to other sectors , one might still think that we are in debt to the aging population because of their previous effort and work in the past and that we have to show our gratitude to them by allocating some  for them , spending too much is still not wise idea .
Taking care of the  aging population and spending some for them is indeed the government's obligation and responsibility but one can already see that there are some alternative and better ways to solve and to take care of this population problem , as shown above .
Spending too much on the  aged population will not benefit the country at all as spending too much will only waste the funds and will not bring any development or solution to the problem .
On the contrary , spending in other areas might bring benefits as well as solutions for the problem .
The examples stated above have already shown the facts that reallocating the funds will greatly benefit a country .
Spending on education will help in developing the country and eliminating one of the causes of the aging population problem , while spending on industrial development will help in attracting immigrants and keeping the economy running .
These examples , with the fact that spending for the old age population will not bring any benefit have proven that it is better to limit and reallocate the spending for old age .
Just as the aging population is a serious problem , spending on the  aged population is also a problem if it is not done properly .
Spending on the aged must be limited and not too much as there are other aspects as shown above that also need to be funded .
On the other hand , spending on the old age should not be too little either as spending too little will cause the population to be upset and therefore decrease the government stability .
It is a challenge for the government to find the right portion of the spending that has to be allocated for the aged population in the country as it is one of the obligations and responsibilities a government has .
The better alternative , however , is spending more on the other aspects rather than spending on the aging population .
If one can solve the aging problem and develop the country at the same time by spending more on other sectors in the country  as mentioned above , why would one choose not to and spend more on the old age population ?
The aging problem is gradually growing into a larger concern for many developed and developing countries in recent years .
Furthermore , this problem is likely to become more serious in the near future as the lifespan of mankind keeps increasing .
This is when technology comes into play .
Technology plays  an essential role in helping to ease the aging process for the elders in mainly three ways .
First of all , technology makes it possible to retard aging to some extent .
The newest advanced technology offers new therapies , anti-aging products , and others For instance , the Laser ablation of Lipofuscin , a new anti-aging project , aims to tune the use of laser pulses in order to remove lipofuscin from aged cells , to hopefully cure or reduce aging .
(ImmInst .org) The accumulation of Lipofuscin is implicated in a variety of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease ( Muscle & Nerve , date ?) .
If this research concludes in a major success , it may completely redefine the meaning of being old .
Other anti-aging products such as a skin-care cream can contribute to making a part of the consumer's body stay young .
Now that humans can age at a slower speed with the help of technology , people no longer wake up to the horror that the reflection in the mirror looks so old that it does not correspond with the memory .
Secondly , technology increases elders' capabilities tremendously .
People's abilities in seeing , hearing , memorizing ,  decrease drastically when they reach a certain age .
Therefore , the tools that enhance these sensitivities have been proven useful to the elders .
While such inventions allow the elders to live independently , they also lower the chance of feeling old , weak , and incapable of doing things  .
For example , Microsoft introduced new functions in its OS , which can magnify characters , read the screen , voice control , (delete) .
The new touchless keyboard from Actbrise even lets users  input without the trouble of moving their hands ( Engadget , year ?) .
These new tools or functions have made it possible for many elders to enjoy the excitement of experiencing advanced technology .
Because elders can "catch up" with many latest inventions , they are less likely to feel abandoned by the progressing society compared to the older generations .
Last but certainly not least , technology promises a brighter future for all men , including the elders .
In fact , the future is not far away from the present .
Take a look at organs , for instance .
"Several different technologies for harnessing regeneration are now in clinical trials around the world .
One machine , being tested in Germany , sprays a burn patient's own cells onto a burn , signaling the skin to re-grow" ( Andrews , year ?) .
Similarly , the quality of artificial organs is improving at an amazing speed , while the need for organ replacement is growing at an even faster rate .
(Cascalho and Platt) It can be seen that future technology may lead to longer lifespan and better healthcare , as well as possible ways to make an elder's body literally young and energetic once again .
Technology has been playing a major part in helping ease the aging process .
It slows human's aging speed , makes up human's deficiencies when they grow old , and promises a brighter future that human can look forward to .
It is most likely that technology will continue to play an essential role in almost all our lives .
From a handsome young lad to a grouchy old man and from a pretty young babe to a nagging old woman , "Aging is a continuous process from birth to death , which encompasses physical , social , psychological , and spiritual changes ."
(1) During this process , an elderly will experience deterioration in memory , slower reflexes and mobility and strong desire to have familial support .
To a great extent medical and technological developments help tackle such changes hence help ease the process of aging .
Firstly , the most common psychological change that elderly will experience is deteriorating memory .
This change can lead to a lot of complications such as forgetting to take medicine for other illnesses , wandering around the streets because they forget how to get home and unable to remember things they had just did .
Personal digital assistant (PDA) can be used to help the elderly remember things .
With this device , one can set time-based reminders to remind them to perform periodic chores for instance to take their medicine .
In the medical field , there is a lot of ongoing research to find medical cures to slow down or stop the process of deteriorating memory .
There are various non-profitable organizations all over the world seeking cures for common illness among elderly an example will be for Parkinson Disease there is the Parkinson's Institute and Clinical Center in America .
(2)
Secondly , biological change is another change that aging brings about .
There are the obvious changes such as physical appearance and the not so obvious change in terms of muscular build and structure .
As one advances in age , their movement and reflex become tardier .
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is a new technology which is in use to help the elderly .
For example in Singapore , the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is looking into using RFID to help the elderly .
The traffic light will be modified to be able to extend the time for slow-walking elderly to cross the road when it detects an elder is going to cross the road .
(3) Muscular related problems are common among the elderly .
Various types of pain-killer are introduced to help ease the pain of the elderly .
Lastly , the sociological change that the elderly experienced is the desire to be closer to their family members .
Familial relationship is more important to them and they are more dependent on their children to look after them .
Work commitment makes it impossible for their children to be with them twenty-four seven .
Web-camera is a technology that can help bring members of the family closer .
They might not be able to meet physical daily but at least it is an alternative for the elderly to have their empty heart filled and know that they are care for .
Working children can also use web cameras to keep a lookout for their elderly parents at home and should any mishaps happen they can go to their aid immediately .
Based on the aging statistics conducted by the Administration of Aging , "the older population who aged 65 years old and above in America is numbered to be 37 .3 million in 2006" and it is expected to be rising where there will be "more than twice the number by 2030 ."
As the population aged , there will be a higher probability for the elderly to suffer from certain illnesses and disorders that will affect both their physical and mental health .
Some of the illnesses and disorders include Alzheimer's disease , chronic disease such as hypertension and diabetes and cataract .
However , as the technology becomes more and more advanced , countries will be able to tap into the newer technologies and develop more elder-friendly inventions that eventually ease and slow the aging process .
Firstly , Alzheimer's disease is "the loss of intellectual and social abilities that is severe enough to interfere with daily functioning ."
Based on research , the number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease rise "from around 2 .8 million people to 5 .1 million today" and the probability of people "developing Alzheimer's disease doubles every five years after the age of 65" .
Thus to aid those elderly who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease , many researchers have used the current or newer technology to come out with different innovative solutions .
One of the examples will be a "reminder robot which is developed by the University of Tokyo" .
This reminder robot which is named as "Mamoru monitor every move its owner makes and verbally alert them when they are trying to do the same activity twice a day" .
This helps to prevent the elderly from forgetting and doing the same thing/action repetitively in a day .
In addition , the University of Tokyo has also developed another reminder robot where "it monitors a room with camera and senor to keep track of where pre-registered objects have been placed in the room ."
This helps the elderly to locate their items and ensure that they will not misplace their valuable items .
Secondly , chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes are very common illness among the aging population .
These illnesses require constant and regular medication and treatment from the doctor to keep it under control .
From research , "death rate from high blood pressureincreased25 .2 percent ,and the actual number of deaths rose56 .4 percent ."
To ensure that the elderly go for their treatment and take their medication constantly , researchers have come out with practical solutions that eventually alert/ remind the elderly to take their medications on time .
The first example will be the automatic pill dispenser called the Medtime XL .
"Medtime XL is a device for dispensing medicine where it reminds the user when the medicine shall be taken and making the correct dose available .
"Besides that , "alarm will also sound and pills rotate into position" based on the individual medication time and the "alarm will only go away after the users have turned the device upside down" to retrieve their pills .
The second example will be the "Ageing Lab's Robot Pet called the Pill Pets" .
Pill Pets is created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where "it reminds owner to take their pill or go to the doctor for regular treatment or checkup ."
If the elderly fails to perform the task required by the pill pets , the "pill pet will try a more visceral reminder which include simulating sickness or death ."
By having those inventions , children of elderly suffering from chronic disease will not have to manually remind their parent on their medication dosage and time through phone and thus train the elderly to be more independent .
Thirdly , as we age , the chance of getting a vision disorder such as cataract will be higher .
Based on research , "by age 80 , more than half of all Americans are suffering from cataracts ."
"A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision ."
To help those elderly who are suffering from cataract , researchers have come out with various creative solutions that are closely related to their daily lifestyle .
The first example will be the Tek Partner TV remote .
"Tek Partner TV remote is a special TV remote that consists of large , illuminated buttons" .
The second example will be the "Accenda Voice-Adicted TV remote where "elderly is able to change the TV channel and play video through voice command" .
By having these elderly friendly inventions , it increases convenience and elderly would be able to better operate their television with their blur vision and there will not be too much strain on their eyes when they look and use the remote control .
However , the critics of this argument feel that the current technology does not help to ease the aging process , but instead , it infringes on the privacy of the elderly .
It is true that technological inventions  tend to infringe on the privacy of the elderly , but they still help to ease the aging process as the monitoring of elderly through various electronic ways are done at a good cause .
Due to the increasing aging population , there will be an increasing number of elderly that are likely to suffer from disease such as dementia .
By monitoring the elderly actions through web camera and reminder robot , children of the elderly can be better informed of the well-being of their parents and thus able to work at ease .
Other than that , monitoring can also give the elderly more sense of security as everything will be recorded down and they can easily refer to the recorded video without straining their brain cells to recall and find those items that they have misplaced it .
Do you know that by 2030 , Singapore's aging population would increase from 8 .4% in 2005 to 18 .7% in 2030 thereby making it as one of the fastest aging population in Asia .
This can be translated into an increase of about 296 ,000 in June 2005 to 873 ,300 in 2030 .
[1] As the elderlyage , they are bound to suffer from illnesses such as visual and mobility impairment and stroke .
Although no treatment has been discovered to cure such illnesses , the only way is to improve and come up with new innovative technology to help ease the current aging process .
Although critics argue that technological inventions have helped to ease the aging process , this however , may not be the case .
In overall , technological inventions may be a great help to the elderly .
However once the elderly become over dependent on technology , they will be at a loss once the device is unable to respond to expectations .
This will result in the elderly being unable to continue with their daily lives .
For example , there is no absolute assurance that device that will never breakdown .
What if an elderly who is operating an electric wheelchair suddenly breaks down in the middle of the road and the elderly got stranded in the middle of the road; this will definitely cause disastrous effects to the elderly and to the traffic .
Therefore this is the main reason why technological inventions may have not ease the aging process in Singapore .
Another illness that brings forth attention is mobility impairment .
As elderly aged , they will gradually lose neuro-muscular coordination which in terms means losing of muscle power or balance .
This will result in elderly suffering from falls and which in turn risks osteoporosis-related fractures .
[5] Technology is also able to relieve the elderly in this situation , for example the "HipSaver Hip Protector" is designed to help prevent elderly from sustaining fractures and minimize the forces of impact if they really fall .
This invention is an all-soft one piece brief with thin tapered elastic foam pads encased in a waterproof and airtight pouch .
It effectively protects the elderly by absorbing the impact from a severe fall .
According to this source , a controlled study is conducted on elderly over the age of 79 , and the percentage of elderly who uses the HipSaver Hip Protector had 199 falls over 26 months with no hip fractures while the group of elderly who did not use suffers 369 falls over 26 months with 16 sustained hip fractures .
At the same time , an air pad will inflate like a miniature air bag diverting the force away the hipbone .
The elderly can wear this comfortable Hip Protector for the whole day in comfort .
[6] Lastly  this deviceno need for a comma here it provides confidence and independent living for the elderly .
"In Singapore , the 3rd leading cause of death is stroke .
"[7] "Stroke is a disease that affects arteries supplying blood to the brain and causes sudden non-convulsive malfunction to the brain .
Unless the blood supply restores , part of the brain cells will die and this will cause irreversible permanent brain damage .
"[8] There is an increasing number of elderly who suffers from stroke and many of which became disabled .
Thus , as technology advances day by day , there are many various innovative solutions that help the elderly to solve the problems faced in their daily lives .
For example , a new invention called "My Spoon" has been invented to help disabled elderly .
"My Spoon" is a robotic arm which operates by controlling the joystick where elderly can be able to move it in 4 directions (up , down left , right) to maneuver the arm which can wield a spoon or a fork to bring the food to their mouth .
The elderlycould  use the joystick to select their desired food on the food tray .
One of the users , Takashi Fuzawa who had tried out this device , commented that this device has helped him to eat by himself without much help .
[9] This technology benefits the elderly by obtaining minimal help from the care givers to feed them and allowing them to gain confidence in living an independent life .
According to a report concerning the aging population in Singapore , "there is an increase of elderly living alone from 10 ,400 in 1990 to 25 ,700 in 2000 .
"[10] With more elderly living alone , the need for more care givers also increases .
Moreover , as elderly are prone to illnesses and accidents , they might suffer from severe falls and strokes .
However with technology improving drastically , many new innovative technologies have surfaced to assist the elderly .
With these elderly care devices and gadgets , the elderly can lead a safe and independent life with minimal help from care givers .
In conclusion , the importance of technology has created an impact in elderly daily lives and has helped to ease the aging process .
Based on a recent survey conducted on the impact of technology on the elderly , the majority of the elderly surveyed believe that advancement in technology "will produce better quality of life for themselves"(1) .
Indeed , advancement in technology has helped to ease the aging process in terms of health , lifestyle and safety .
Lastly , technological inventions can help keep the elderly safe in their homes .
Today , many companies provide home monitoring systems .
An example would be QuietCare .
QuietCare uses an "average of five to seven" sensors to monitor movement within the elderly home (8) .
It can detect , using infrared sensors , if there is "a lack of movement" within the home and notify the relative or a care person (8) .
Another example would be the intercom doorbell , which can help the elderly "respond to visitors without having to rush" (9) .
This , in turn , can help prevent injury caused by falls .
The most common invention would be the webcam .
An example would be Willing Webcam that has a built-in "motion capture detection sensor" (10) .
This sensor can activate actions such as "sending emails" , "SMS text message" or "sounding an alarm" (10) .
It can detect "the slightest movement in the home" and notify the user if there is an intruder (10) .
With such technologies at hand , the elderly will be confident to live alone knowing that their safety is well taken care of .
Governments should prioritise on problems which require more attention .
They can cut down spending on other areas rather than the funds for the aged .
For example , military spending should be reduced if the country is already enjoying peace and defense stability .
However , the military is deemed so essential that it is the "prerequisite" to all areas of development in the country .
Although the country's defense cannot allow for any complacency , the benefits of investing in a military can only be projected as a contributing factor to the economic growth .
Nevertheless , the aging population problem must not be overlooked by focusing on only the important factors contributing to the country's development .
In  contemporary society , the elderly are well taken care of in many countries .
Some governments even do it "too" well that a large amount of money , which should be spent on other social issues , is wasted .
There should be changes in the policies about this problem .
First of all , there should be a careful consideration about what  governments should pay for .
As for healthcare service , it is not reasonable that the elderly can have free or low-priced treatment for all kinds of sickness .
Instead , it should be limited that everyone mustn't have any priorities when they get treatment for any kinds of illness that are resulted from unhealthy lifestyles .
For instance , the obese patients must pay full-price for their treatment since obesity is the consequence of the lack of exercising in their everyday-lives .
Moreover , governments should only pay for each individual a certain amount of money based on his or her financial position .
That everyone gets the same amount of money is neither fair nor efficacious .
There should be a prudent consideration so that it's worth every penny .
By making more efficient policies , governments will be able to save a lot of money to spend on other aspects of society that are also very important .
For example , more money should be invested in education so that children are better educated and later become a profitable workforce for society .
As a result , they can support themselves more effectively not only when they are young , but also during their old age In addition , governments can spend more on developing technologies .
By doing this , more and more useful and efficient tools and machines can be invented which will improve the productivity of every economic activity .
So it will enable the economy to expand which means more jobs will be created for everyone .
Not stopping at this point , governments can also use money to encourage more researching in many fields such as healthcare , etc . . . That will definitely better the living standard of citizens and improve the economy as well as ease the aging issue .
By limiting public spending on the aged , more money can be devoted to the progress of the economy .
Larger scales of technological investment can take place thus gaining better profit .
This economic growth is important because it allows the country to have the power to improve its citizens' quality of life .
Safe drinking water and proper shelters can be better provided for the population as a result of this additional growth .
Citizens enjoying this better quality of life are less prone to diseases promoting a healthier life .
To add on , the nation will also be able to build more hospitals and enhanced medical services to provide the population including the elderly with better health care .
The elderly of the nation will also be benefiting from this economic growth indirectly  .Caregivers , consisting largely of working adults , will be earning more income in parallel to the nation prosperity .
Furthermore , non-profit organizations dedicated to take care of the elderly are able to obtain donations easier as the members of the public are more able to contribute .
Clearly , economic growth not only affects the population positively but the elderly are also benefiting from it .
With larger financial support given , the education sector can be improved further .
More teachers can be trained to facilitate the learning environment of students .
Additional Universities and specialized schools can be built to enroll more students therefore allowing more citizens to get an education .
Through education , working adults are able to deal with highly complicated equipment that enable them to bring revenue back to the country .
Educating the population not only improve the economy by allowing them to become more efficient , but also allow them to plan for their retirement .
This would reduce their dependency on the government when they are old thus cutting public spending on the age .
Elderly who wish to continue working are able to do so by attend upgrading courses to facilitate them in finding jobs .
However , the mentioned advantages to the elderly are only applicable to the aged who have caregivers and are able to afford health services and education .
Single and poor elderly would not be able to reap the benefits but suffered because of limited public spending by the government on them .
Effective measures to identify these needy elderly are needed to separate them from the wealthier cohort .
Following this , appropriate amount of help is given equally to them so as to fully utilize the limited resources .
Limiting spending on the aged population could bring about social instability , affecting society infrastructure which greatly affects a country's image in the international community .
We cannot abandon them as ultimately they are still an integral part of our society .
Government should spend much effort on taking care of them by providing financial support .
It would be the most direct means of showing concern for them .
Not doing so would lead to many social problems such as climbing crime rates , street begging and so on .
These social problems greatly affects a country's image .
When a country cannot even handle its own problems there is no way it could be given the chance to hold world class events such as Olympics which boosts its international reputation and many other areas .
The rippling effect that arises from the small social issue greatly affects a country's developments on many fronts .
Secondly , cutting funding with particular reference to the aged is undoubtedly seen as out casting the society group .
It portrays a government as practicing discrimination , which is a violation of human rights .
In modern world democracy , infringing on human rights is a grave matter .
Any government would be unwise to openly advocate for policies which discriminates against a particular society group .
Denying responsibility to take care of its less privileged elderly would draw criticisms from both international bodies and its citizens .
It would be deemed political suicide .
Ousting of the political party in ruling is only a matter of time .
What more of other areas of development can the political party talk about when its not the ruling party ?
Lastly , shrinking responsibility to take care of aged citizens will lead to drastic loss of talents in the country .
Citizens would consider migration and foreign talents would be less attracted to migrate into the country .
Knowing the government would not take proper care of them after they retire .
Perhaps in the short term pumping financial resources to areas such as technology and economy may produce expected results .
In the long term , the country will suffer from irreversible losses as progress is made by its people and remaining talents are insufficient to substantiate the growth .
The first measure is MediSave .
Under this scheme , every worker needs to contribute 6 .5 - 9 % (depending on age group) of his monthly salary to his personal MediSave account .
As people grow old , they tend to use more health care products and services .
With this savings ,  elderly people can be protected as they can use this fund to pay for hospitalization , surgery , and other medical expenses .
However , some people might think that if they suffer from those prolonged diseases , it can quickly drain  their MediSave balance .
In this case , they will not be able to pay for their huge medical fees .
To counter this issue , Singapore has come out with MediShield .
This scheme is aiming to help the people who suffer from major or prolonged diseases .
It subsidies the large medical bill needed up to 80% .
Therefore , with these medical schemes , the elderly people's healthcare can be secured .
The second measure is the Maintenance of Parent Act .
This is an act to handle the cases relating to children abandoning their parents in nursing homes .
According to the article from Sunday Times , it is said that more than 400 elderly people have been beneficial from the Maintenance of Parent Act .
Of the 424 applicants , 328 or almost four in five were successfully compelling their children to take care of them .
This statistics show that the elderly people can be protected by the law .
However , some children might think that living with their parents is  a nuisance because they need a lot of care and attention .
The health care spending is also another burden .
If you think in another way round , the parent's contribution to children may not be less than children's contribution to parent .
In addition , one must admit that the hardship of bringing out a child .
The parents need to teach them how to walk , pay for their medical and education fee , and etc .
Anyway , this is about the issue of filial piety .
Therefore , to protect the elderly people , the filial obligation must be stressed .
The last policy is the age-friendly policies which increase the employment of the older worker .
This policy aims to help the older worker to stay employed longer .
According to Xinhua News , Singapore's employment rate for workers aged to 55 to 64 is 57 percent today .
It is believed that it will increase until 65 percent in the next three years .
To deal with such challenge , Singapore's government has implemented many schemes to help  people work longer .
One of the examples is "ADVANTAGE !
Scheme" which has made more than 1 ,200 companies to employ 8 ,800 mature workers , to keep 19 ,300 existing older workers , and recruit more than 5 ,300 older workers .
However , some people might think that elderly people should stop working and enjoy themselves in their old age .
If they do not have sufficient retirement savings , it is very hard to enjoy themselves in their old age .
So , if people can work longer , they will be able to accumulate more savings that they could use to support themselves in their old age .
In addition , they could lessen the burden on their children .
Certain social issues such as poor quality of life and insufficient funds for basic healthcare may arise from limited funding .
In general , most of the aged in Singapore are economically inactive and have a lot of free time on their hands .
In order to prevent them from turning to vices such as gambling and drinking , organizing more activities at various community centres are required for them to lead healthy social lives .
As these activities require government funding , limiting spending on the aged will make organizing these activities impossible .
Aside from social life , having basic healthcare is vital for the aged .
When people get older , it is only natural that they are more prone to illness be it mental or physical .
At present , healthcare is dreadfully expensive and the aged may not be able to afford proper treatment should they fall ill .
Thus , if the government limits spending and does not subsidize the costs of these treatments , the financial burden on the elderly will be even greater .
It is true that some of the families are able to afford to support their elderly parents and it should be their responsibility to bear the expenses of their aged family members instead of the government .
Nevertheless , there are some low income families who face high costs of living and cannot support both their children and elderly parents .
Hence , there should be distribution of public funds to the elderly parents of these families .
On top of that , there are elderly who have no children , so if their financial conditions are unstable , they should  be given the necessary funds to make ends meet .
Firstly , as a country usually allocates its budget to various areas , any increase in spending on a particular area will mean reduced spending on other areas .
For example , if a country decides to increase spending on the aged , a smaller budget may be allocated for education , research and investment purposes .
Reduced spending on education can mean fewer educators and lowered standards of teaching , reduced spending on research can mean fewer incentives for researchers and for their research work and reduced spending on investments may mean less cooperation with international bodies .
Thus , a country's budget cannot be adjusted without much consideration and thought or  it can cause instabilities to the supporting pillars of the country .
Secondly , public policies can be put in place to help the citizens to save up for their golden years .
For example , Singapore has a Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme that helps its people to save up from the time they start working .
Monthly , a percentage of their salary will be deducted and credited into their CPF accounts .
Employers  are also required to credit an additional amount on top of the employee's contribution .
The debiting and crediting process is automated , thus the citizen need not do anything but he will still be notified regularly with his CPF account statement .
With proper policies to help citizens save up , countries can not only find no need to increase their budget on the aged , they may also find themselves spending less which can also mean that more funds can be allocated to other areas of the country's development .
However , having a compulsory saving policy can be a double edged sword from the citizens' point of view .
For example the CPF scheme in Singapore states that the account holder must have a certain amount of money , which was saved up automatically since the start of his working years , before he can withdraw the entire amount at the maturity age .
If the account holder does not have a stable job , he will find that he has a hard time trying to reach the minimum amount thus also finding himself unable to use or even see his own savings physically .
Thirdly , if the aged have children , the children should also be responsible for their parents' well-being .
Having the children support their own parents will mean less dependency on the government .
Some children choose not to support their parents even though they can afford to do so , usually claiming that they need the money on other necessities and luxuries .
The government can start policies to make it compulsory for children to provide for their parents with the basic necessities such as housing and allowance .
Although such policies can reduce the people's dependency on the government , it may not be practical for some .
This is because some children may already have problems supporting themselves or even a new family which they started , so they may want to support their parents but are practically unable to do so .
Nevertheless , the government can be flexible with the policy such that if the children have financial difficulties they can then seek aid from them .
In recent years , many developed countries have been facing problems related to aging population , especially pressures on social support systems .
In view of the  dramatic increase in national budget spent on the aged , some people suppose that the government should limit its expenditure on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , from my perspective , I unhesitantly take issue with the above idea and believe that elderly people deserve public support policies , instead of boundaries on healthcare and welfare schemes .
One of the primary reasons why the government  should not set limits on public spending on older people is the aim to create a higher quality of live for almost everyone .
A society is developed  only if its citizens satisfy the minimum requirements of health , happiness , safety , prosperity , and fortunes .
And obviously , those of old age should also be provided services such as healthcare , insurance , housing . . .Thus , there is no reason for the government to eliminate its expenditure on this area while many people's lives can be improved thanks to the support .
Another factor that policy makers should consider before deciding to set boundaries on public spending on the aged is issues related to moral standards whose decline has been witnessed in recent years in many countries .
From this angle , public support policies for elderly people will make young generations change their attitude toward older people .
Improved healthcare services , subsidies . . . not only aid the aged in poor financial situations or make their health better but also are the ways people express their respect to the older , which has positive impact on enhancing younger people's treatment .
Last but not least , most elderly people after all have contributed to the development of the country during their young age through productive services as well as taxes .
Therefore , limiting public spending on them is irrational .
They deserve more support policies .
The government should not consider the rising expenditure related to programs to support a growing elderly population without mentioning their contribution in the past .
When taking into account  all the above factors , I can safely conclude that public spending on the aged should not be  limited  even though the amount of money can be used to invest on some areas like education , infrastructure and development projects .
Policy makers should find another solution to reduce the rising cost of healthcare or welfare schemes to maximize the benefits of both citizens and the nation .
As a man ages , his efficiency in both physical and mental capabilities decreases , causing many difficulties he would not have faced during his younger years .
Through current research and development , some of those problems have been eased significantly , providing a better aging experience .
In this essay , we will discuss how current research and development has helped to ease some of the issues raised by immobility , health conditions and resource management that the aged face .
Falls are one of the biggest issues caused by lowered mobility in the aged .
While individual efforts can be done to prevent falls , many of the aged are not aware of such prevention measures or they are unable to seek help if they fall despite of such efforts  .An article published by the American Academy of Family Physicians in April 2000 reported that falls caused 70 percent of accidental deaths in people aged 75 years and above .
Falls had also caused more than 90 percent of hip fractures in people aged 70 and above .
In order to address this issue , research in the wireless technology had developed a reporting solution to facilitate fall management .
A motion sensor and pager is installed in a watch and data will be sent to the database periodically .
Information which is collected includes location and motion level of the users .
Alerts can then be sent to family members who are not at home if the user is not within a designated area or haveexperienced a falling motion .
Heart diseases are frequently accompanied with old age .
Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) or the commonly known "heart attacks" become frequent with advancing age .
A journal published by American Heart Association in year 2003 had cited 85 percent mortality rate by ACS is of patients aged 65 years old and above .
Heart attacks can be prevented if ACS is recognised but it is not the case unless the patient and the physician are both aware of the symptoms that surfaced .
In most situations a heart attack strikes at least expected times and in most occurrences , immediate medical attention is critical to the survivability of the patient .
Arrhythmia , which is the alterations in the heartbeat , has an increased chance to surface in an aged patient who survived a heart attack .
Medical advancements such as cardiac catheterization (the opening of an occluded artery through a balloon technique) , pacemaker (a defibrillator implanted in the patient's heart to allow the heart to beat at normal pace) helps to ease some of the health conditions that are associated with old age .
A growing number of families have faced a common problem in elderly care and that is resource management .
Resource management may comprise  physical monitoring and medical records management .
Due to time constraints , some of the families employ services from nursing home or private nurses as they are unable to take care of their sick elderly .
However , not all services provided are trustworthy and satisfactory .
A news article by Telegram & Gazette (Worcester , MA) in 2007 featured  a lady who had not been properly taken care of , after the engagement of nursing services .
Research and development in Information Technology allowed resource management to be simplified .
A good example is the conversion of current medical records to technological solutions .
The majority of the solutions are designed to send reminders , the medical conditions or medical schedules to its users .
These solutions greatly reduce the need for physical presences of family members because the manual tasks are now automated .
Research and development has created many convenient and simpler methodologies to help ease the aging process .
If research and development ceased  to exist , it would be much harder to take care of the elderly as the world's aging population is expected to increase from now till 2050 .
Most developed countries are now confronted with more rapid aging in their population than the past .
As such , many countries  have started research , new development and policies to help to ease the aging process .
I agree to a great extent that such research , new development and policies will help to ease the aging process and also prepare the country with their aging population .
Countries are able to use new policy of encouraging employment of the elderly , increasing the awareness of filial obligation or creating new development of infrastructures that cater to the elderly in their country .
Firstly , countries can help to ease the aging process by implementing a  new policy  of encouraging employment of the elderly .
The government can help to achieve this by increasing the retirement age , creating more benefits and lowering barriers to employment of the elderly .
This measure will help to ease the burden of the younger generation , allow the healthy elderly to still contribute to the society and at the same time help to generate more wealth for the elderly which they can use for themselves .
Japan is one good example that uses this measure successfully .
Although the retirement age is legislated at 60 , the government of Japan encourages the elderly to continue to work up the age of 65 .
To help support the employers , the government provides grants and subsidies to the employers who employ the older workers .
Although some are prejudiced towards older workers due to their work efficiency and high salary cost , there are more benefits of employing them .
The older workers are more trustworthy , conscientious and dependable .
Other attributes include punctuality , lower absenteeism and less concern about monetary returns .
Therefore , implementing the new policy of encouraging employment of the elderly will help both economically and socially for countries with aging population .
Secondly , countries can increase the awareness of the filial obligation of its people .
It is the duty of the younger generations to display more filial piety towards their aged parents as they are the ones who took care of us during our growing up days .
They provided us with unconditional love and even paid for all our living expenses .
A society in which the children will take care of their parents will help to ease the government spending on the aging and divert the spending on other areas of the country .
In the Asian culture and belief , it is the responsibility of the children to take care of their parents when they are financially stable .
In Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea , most of the elderly still live with their adult children and can even help to cook , do house work and take care of the grandchildren .
However , contrary to the beliefs in Asian society , it is viewed as "not cool" in the western society to be living with your elderly parents when you grow up .
Living with their elderly parents will not just limit their social life , but also causes their freedom to be taken away .
Personally , I feel that this is a very selfish act .
The adult children should take this as a responsibility of their life and do it with pride .
After all , it is their parents who took care of them when they were young .
So , increasing the awareness of filial obligation will result in more children taking care of their elderly parents and help to ease the country's aging process .
Lastly , countries can ease the aging process by building new development of infrastructure in the country .
To prepare for  the growing demands of an aging population , countries can build special infrastructure , such as hospitals or apartments to cater  to the elderly .
This way , specialized and better care can be provided for the elderly .
An example will be Singapore , where the  government is building new infrastructure to prepare for  the growing demands of an aging population .
Singapore is building new community hospitals as well as linking up acute hospitals with community hospitals .
This way , patients can receive treatment at the acute hospital and then recuperate at the community ones .
Also , special apartments called studio apartments are being built for the elderly .
On the other hand , some may argue that the public spending on the aged should be diverted into other areas of the country's development .
Diverting the public spending into other areas of the country's development will cause the aging population problems to increase and hence also increases the burden of the younger generation .
As such , the public spending on building new infrastructure for the aging population should be encouraged so as to prepare countries for their aging population and ease their aging process .
In conclusion , current research , development and policy have helped to ease the aging process and prepare a country in facing the demand of an aging population .
By creating the policy of encouraging employment for the elderly , the elderly in the society will be more independent and able to support themselves .
Increasing the awareness of filial obligation will result in more adult children living with and taking care of their elderly parents .
Finally , building new  infrastructure that caters to the elderly will help a country prepare for the aging population .
In many countries , the proportion of older people is steadily increasing .
It has been shown that the world is facing the aging problem .
The growing number of older people has caused the attention of many people and countries , and it has caused many problems to the society .
So far there are many countries that have  come up with many strategies to deal with the problem .
Although we cannot solve the problem in the short run , we can ease the problem in many ways .
To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
However , we should still go on to ease the problem .
The growing number of aged people  has brought with it many problems including greater pension pressure , increasing medical expenses , and the heavy burden of nursing care for the elderly and so on .
It can slow down the productivity of the society .
It also gives more burdens on young people .
It also discourages the young people from working hard because they think they can depend on the society when they are old .
It also has great impact on health-care .
For governments , there are generally two ways to deal with the problem .
One is to reduce the future old-age dependency burden by increasing available resources , which means to increase the size and productivity of tomorrow's working-age population .
One is to rethink the private attitudes and public policies that now equate old age with a loss of health which somehow entitles the elderly to government spending .
We should do  both  to  deal with aging problem by making aging both more secure for older generations and less burdensome for younger generations .
The policy makers have found out many ways to ease the problem .
For example , the the government encourages old people to continue to work , and government encourages people to save for their old-age , and encourages young people to produce more and so on .
These policies have indeed eased the aging problem .
Without these policies , the government may increase spending on the old people or the young people will be more burdened .
For the young people themselves , they should work hard for their old-age and save to prepare for the old-age .
In this way , it can reduce the burden of the next generation and reduce the spending of the government .
Also , it can encourage people to work hard and help to increase productivity .
For example , Singapore encourages people to save for their old-age .
In the past , the old people just depend on their next generations .
This can make the old people not secure if they have no children or their children are poor .
Thus , the people can secure themselves when they are old in this way .
For the society , it can support the old people by building charity .
There are many charity funds in the society to help old people .
It can ease the aging problem without giving burden on the government and poor people .
Furthermore , it can help to distribute the property and decrease the gap between the rich and the poor .
However , some developed countries have high healthcare costs and thus aging may still impose an economic burden .
It is important to set appropriate limits on healthcare .
To do this , we should know what "health" means for an aging population .
Thus the government should decide on what is essential and should therefore be supported by the public sector , and what should be left to individuals .
Besides , different countries have different policies for their own .
Every country has its own features .
Thus one should not copy the so called paradigm of developed countries .
The developing countries may not have enough capacity to deal with the problem because they have not enough money .
The developed countries can also help developing countries to ease aging problem as it is a global problem .
It is a well known fact that the proportion of the elderly in every developed nation's population is on a rapid rise , thanks to increased usage of birth controls and past government policies .
Along with this phenomenon comes a wide range of problems such as social problems and ethical issues .
Inevitably , governments must intervene in order to curb this ageing population problem .
However , governments' intervention often meant huge spending on medical resources and infrastructure for the elderly , which created many other economic problems such as hindrance to the nation's economic progress .
Hence I agree that public spending on the aged should be reduced so that the government can use the available funds on other sectors of the society .
Reducing funding on the elderly means that the government has more capital to spend on improving their economy .
The funds could go to many different types of industries for research and development purposes .
The money could also go into building cost-saving infrastructures , hence attracting more businesses to the country .
When the economy improves , almost everyone , from the individual consumer to large multi-national companies , in the society will be able to benefit , as opposed to spending on just the elderly where only one group of people will really benefit from the funding .
For example , Singapore government spent a lot of resources to build Jurong Industrial Park so as to enhance its competitiveness in the global market , resulting in rapid increase in economic growth .
Hence governments should focus more of their resources into improving their economy , rather than spending so much of their funds on the aged .
On the other hand , critics of this notion have argued that with reduced government spending , less educated old folks and those who did not save enough would be at a severe disadvantage as compared to the rest of the population .
The government funds would not reach them at all .
These less competitive elderly people would be cut off from any benefits of economic growth .
However , this situation might not be necessarily true because if governments focus more of their funds onto the economic sector , the increase in capital as a result of rapid economic growth allows governments to create social programs for these more disadvantaged elderly people .
In the end , the main idea is that with more funds from the economic growth , governments can do so much more to help these elderly people .
Governments can also use their funds on the education sector .
Since a  large amount  of money is needed to support an ageing population , governments have to increase their own existing pool of resources in order to generate such amount of capital .
One such method is increased focus on education .
The governments could spend more on education , resulting in much better education institutions offering higher-quality education to the people .
The aged workers would benefit as well because governments could introduce educational campaigns that help subsidise skills upgrading for the elderly workers .
The population on the whole would become more skilled and hence increase their competitiveness in the global market .
The country would be able to compete more effectively on a global scale .
In contrast , aged workers , due to less governments' funding , might become even more dependent on their children .
In the end , it is still very taxing on the working population , who now not only have to support themselves and their children , but also their parents as well .
However , it can be argued that after all it is the children's responsibility to take care of their parents .
This belief is especially true in Asian countries .
Hence , governments should encourage their normal working population to bear the responsibility for taking care of their elderly parents , through social awareness campaigns .
In this way , economic growth will not be hindered and at the same time , the issue of ageing population is handled in an appropriate and ethical manner .
In conclusion , government spending is important for all sectors of the country's development .
However , there are limits on how much they can spend on each area .
Furthermore , new challenges and problems will arise in the future; hence because of these two reasons , I feel that the government should not be too focused on the ageing population issue as there might be other more urgent issues that require their immediate attention in the future .
Personally , I do agree that spending on the aged should be limited so that more money can be channelled to other areas of the country's development .
Instead of priming the spending on the aged as one of the key focus on our annual budgeting regularly , I strongly feel that the Singapore government should redefine its focus and divert its focus to other key areas such as military , urban development and education spending .
Firstly , military spending is of paramount importance to all sovereign countries like Singapore .
The adequate spending on the military aspect not only conveys a strong deterrence message to our potential aggressors , but will also instill confidence into our business partners .
The confidence that Singapore is well protected militarily ensures their continual long term presence and active involvement in shaping the country's financial establishments .
In addition , many more foreign investors may be attracted to this safe haven with the aim of expanding their dynamic business empire .
Evidently , we can see how well it is to diversify our spending , rather than just allocating a lion's share to cope with the aging problem solely .
Next , a substantial amount of the annual budget should also be set aside for urban development and education - urban development in the sense of creating a better living environment for our fellow country mates .
Throughout the past two years in the national day rallies , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had  reiterated the need to create a "work-live-play Singapore" .
Basically , the essence of that is to conceptualize a Singapore in which we can work , live and have fun  .
Since the Prime Minister had already envisaged a need to create a better living environment for Singaporeans ,  why not we reduce the spending on the aged and invest it on realising this wonderful concept ?
Also , Spending on education should be put on the top of the government's priorities list .
This is because unlike our neighbouring countries , which has abundant natural resources , we have only a form of natural resource , that is our people .
The Investments on our people will ensure the creation of competent personnel .
These competent people will not only ensure that we have a competitive edge over our competitors , but will also give our country a considerable leverage over our neighbouring countries .
Now , we can see in a better light how diverse spending can aid our country .
Although spending on the aged should be limited so that more money can be channelled for the county's development , we should also make sure that a reasonable portion of the  annual budget  is set aside for them .
As the saying goes , "One must never forget the hands that feed them ."
It is  indeed this group of people that had fought hard to bring Singapore to its current reputable standing in the world .
Thus , needlessly to say , it is only conscionable to allocate a reasonable sum of money to ensure that their health and well being are well taken care of .
All in all , as long as we have a definitive balance on the spending on the aged , we can achieve both taking care of them and national development .
In conclusion , we can see vividly how important it is to diversify our spending into military , urban development and education purposes , instead of just placing our top most priority on spending on the aged at the centre of the radar .
As long as their health and well being are taken care of , our priorities should be channelled to spending on other more relevant and crucial areas like military , urban development and education purposes .
As a result , this does not only aid in the nation's continual progress , but will also enable us to create a competitive edge over our neighbouring countries and also build a strong presence in the financial sector in this region .
Every country has its own strategies in development depending on its current situation .
Nowadays , as the world population is gradually aging , the governments start to adopt a new policy on  public spending .
Some people believe that "Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the the country's development ."
To some extent , I agree that we  spend more money on education and environment since investing in country's development is also a way to invest for the elderly .
First of all , education should take a higher priority than life for the elderly as investing in education is the inevitable preparation for the next generation .
For example , many European countries such as Denmark , Sweden and Cyprus allocate nearly 7% of their GDP for public investment in education .
That money goes to modernization of schools and universities , and helps to train students better , to make them talented scientists or skillful workers .
As a result , this public investment enhances the  intellectual standards of its people , and that leads to an increase in economics as people work more efficiently with knowledge .
Consequently , the government will have more money to provide better services of the elderly care .
After all , not only the young but the old people will also benefit from the investment in education .
Second , the government should also divert the money into the environment .
Recently there have been so many symposiums talking about the earth , the climate change , etc .
Just those conferences can show us how important the environment is .
As a matter of fact , spending money for environmental improvement really brings global benefits .
For example , this could help us to preserve many beautiful natural scenes , which attract many people and thus stimulate the country's tourism .
Moreover , living in a clean and fresh environment is better for everyone's health , including the elderly .
According to a recent study done by the U .S National Institutes of Health (NIH) , environmental factors , as well as the genetic factor , contribute to the longevity and ability of avoiding severe diseases that come along with aging , such as cancer , stroke or high - pressure .
Therefore , green funds can actually offer good returns for everybody .
However , although investing for development will bring good things for the country , we should not spend 100% of the money for it .
In other words ,  we need a policy so that money can be disbursed appropriately .
Firstly , investment for the elderly is an issue of morality .
People spend their whole life working and contributing to the future of their country , so after retirement , it is time for them to rest , and elderly care is somehow the requital for what they have done for the society .
Furthermore , as the young see that the government pays good attention to the elderly , which they will become , they will know that their future is well-secured .
Correspondingly , people will work harder , and there is no doubt that the country will thrive by leaps .
In conclusion , caring about the country's future development is good , but we should never forget about the past , the people who are now not capable of supporting their own lives .
It is much better to have a suitable and balanced money distribution of public investment between elderly care and other aspects .
Population aging generally refers to the increase in the percentage of elderly people in a country .
According to the latest statistics reports , the current number of elderly people is increasing constantly at 8 million per year globally .
Due to this situation , many countries have made huge amount of public spending on the aged in order to ease the various problems that came along with it .
However , I believe that instead of focusing so much on the aging issue , it is sometimes wiser for the government to divert the money to other areas of country's development  , which include education and military .
Adherents who starkly believe that public spending should be focused on the aged often claim that the elderly people are not financially protected once they are retired from their workplaces .
However , this would be tantamount to saying that the government is responsible for "feeding" the elderly people in the country once they are unable to get any income .
This could be a huge economic burden for countries like Japan  , which has one of the highest aged populations in the world .
While in Italy , the government actually has spent a staggering 14 .2 percent of the whole nation's GDP on pension system .
However , I believe that the government should put in more resources in the realm of education .
Providing a better learning environment for the younger generation will yield a better workforce in  future  and thus bringing in more revenue for the government to spend on the elderly people .
Besides that , the burden to take care of the graying generation will also be shared by the children of the elderly people  , who may be highly educated and therefore are able to find jobs easily to support their families .
Conversely , if the country were not knowledge- based , it could hardly make any economic progress  , due to the lack of understanding of technology in development  .
Thus , this may lead to shortages in the government's annual budget for the aged .
One typical example is the Singapore government spending 20 percent of the nation's annual budget on the education system  , which is  one of the key factors that help the country to progress swiftly throughout the years .
Another reason why people support the idea of  spending on the elderly people is  that it's a natural process for everyone to age .
Therefore , taking good care of the elderly people also means securing a better future for ourselves .
However , all of them have glossed over the fact that this can only be done when we are assured of the security and safety of the whole nation in the first place .
One can imagine living in a country like Sri Lanka where people live in fear everyday because of  the never ending wars between the local army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam .
How is it possible to look after the aged when the whole nation's security is at risk ?
It is apparent that we should not compromise on the  military spending  in our pursuit of  a harmonious and stable society  .
This is also the reason why more and more countries are increasing their military spending .
In 2008 , the global military expenditure rose by 4 percent to a record of $1 .4 trillion .
Therefore , it is clear that  military development should be ranked at a higher priority when compared to  spending on the aged .
However , this does not mean that we should forgo any spending on the elderly people  .
Being the ones who have served the community over so many years , the elderly must be provided for .
Many countries like US have set aside a large sum of money to ensure the welfare of elderly people annually .
Different healthcare policies are also implemented in different countries to allow the old people to enjoy free medical services .
All of these are done as a recognition of what they have contributed to the society for the years .
In conclusion , although it is indeed necessary for the government to take care of the elderly people  , there are many other areas of development that should be looked into   , such as education and military .
Without  these developments , there's no way we can ensure that the welfare of the graying generations will be met .
Based on the results of the 2006 Census of Population of Housing on 30 June 2008 , the number of people aged 65 years and over in Australia increased by 67 ,600 people  , which represents a 2 .4% increase .
The proportion of the population aged 65 years and over has increased from 10 .8% to 13 .3% between 30 June 1998 and 30 June 2008[1] .
To take care of this issue , public spending for the aged needs to be increased .
Critics say that the spending on the aged should be limited and used for other areas of development .
I feel that military and education should take priority over the needs of the elderly ; but measures should be put in place so that the elderly can take care of themselves .
One reason that public spending on the aged should be limited is that some of it can be diverted to develop the military .
Nowadays ,  crimes such as bombing or terrorism can be happened at anytime and anywhere .
According to the World Fact Book 2008 , published by the Central Intelligence Agency , military expenditures from all over the world have increased .
Being a small country with a small population  , Singapore has limited manpower .
This is the reason why Singapore has to spend a big amount  in the military sector .
Singapore wants to improve its military defense .
That's why some of the public spending should be diverted to the military sector .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited and diverted to military development .
Other than that , some of public spending can be diverted to develop education .
Education  is one thing that should be prioritized .
Education can prepare the younger generation to be more skilful and productive when they're at the working-age .
Without a good  education , one cannot be as good at work  .
[3]Manali Oak (citation year)  says: "education is important as it teaches us the right behavior , the good manners thus making us civilized) .
He also says that "Education is important because it equips us with all that is needed to make our dreams come true .
Education opens doors of brilliant career opportunities" .
Hence , some of the government public spending should be diverted for education purposes to prepare the younger generations for their future lives .
Critics of my position say that public spending on the aged should not be limited because we need to take into account what the aged have done .
However , unlimited public spending on the aged could encourage the elderly to be less self-sufficient or more dependent .
If the government keeps giving the elderly money without any limit , there's a possibility that the elderly would stop to work and  depend on the government for living  .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be maintained  to prevent the elderly from becoming less independent .
To sum up , even though the aging issue is quite difficult to handle ,  public spending for the elderly should have a certain limitation .
Therefore , the elderly will be  encouraged to be independent and self sufficient .
Other than that , some of the public spending should be allocated for education  purposes  and  military  defense .
By the year 2050 , more than 1 in every 5 persons throughout the world is estimated to be aged 60 or over , while nearly 1 in every 6 is estimated to be at least 65 years old .
( The United Nation , year) As a result , aging population has been one of the focuses in recent years .
The magnitude of the issue on aging population is comparable to issues such as global warming .
At the same time , problems related to aging population have arisen and more will start to surface as time passes and this has raised certain concerns for the world .
In order to tackle  the issues that are resulted from aging populations , many researches and studies have been done  .
The developments of current researches , especially in the field of science and technology have benefitted the older population greatly  .
Hence , I agree to a large extent that  research and development has helped to ease the aging process by improving the mobility  of the elderlyand their health conditions  .
Firstly , science and technology have helped to improve the mobility  of the elderly through the inventions of various equipment that aid in their movements .
As people aged , their health conditions will not be as good as before .
For example , their limbs will get weaker , and as  a result , this will impede their mobility as they are not as agile and strong as before .
Thus ,  science and technology has come up with improved version of equipment that aid the movements of the elderly .
For example , in the past , wheelchairs were bulky and heavy .
Most of the time , the elderly need someone to push them around as their arms are not strong enough to push the wheels for their wheelchairs .
However , there are improved versions of wheelchairs now , such as the electric wheelchairs .
The development of electric wheelchairs has brought great convenience to the lives of the elderly .
As electric wheelchairs are operated using electrical , the elderly can move around on their own easily without relying on others .
Furthermore ,  there are many elegant designs of the wheelchairs .
For example , the wheelchairs are made of lighter and durable materials ,  such as aluminum .
Nowadays , the elderly can have their wheelchairs custom-made .
For example , the elderly may choose the  colours and designs of the wheelchairs .
Thus , this would enable the elderly to  accept using the wheelchair when they  need one .
Therefore ,  science and technology has eased the aging process .
In addition ,  science and technology has helped to improve the health condition of the elderly .
As one aged , their immune and functional systems will not be as strong as before .
As a result , the elderly are prone to many illnesses and physical problems , such as deafness , blindness and Alzheimer's disease .
Research has shown that in Singapore , there are 220 ,000 people who have cataract and they are aged 65 years and above .
They make up about 7% of the population .
By 2030 , it will be about 18% and this is the  consequence of a rapidly ageing population .
However , with the help of science and technology , treatments for cataract are  more accessible to the elderly and more manageable in terms of cost and  risk  .
For instance , the use of ultrasound vibration to remove cataracts through a small incision results in  faster visual recovery after surgery .
This would result in less toll on the elderly  as the wound is smaller and thus able to heal faster .
Hence , advancement in technology has increased the efficiency of operations , and thus , easing the aging process .
Among the different age groups , the elderly population is at the highest risk for adverse events , such as falling down at home .
Even a slight fall might result in  dire consequences  if they are not treated immediately .
Thus , modern technology has come up with many innovations to  prevent some possible hazards faced by the elderly .
For example ,  an alarm system at home  will alert the emergency department and their family members when  the  elderly needs help .
This alarm system is useful  for an elderly who has met with any mishap at home and when no one is around to assist him or her .
As the alarm system is directly connected to the relevant contacts ,  a press of button by the elderly would immediately transmit signal for help .
As a result , the elderly would be able to receive immediate help and treatment .
Therefore , advancement in technology has helped to ease the aging process .
However , some may argue that science and technology does not help to ease aging process .
Critics  argue that what the elderly need most is the mental support provided by their families .
Thus , they might feel depressed or lonely .
This is when family's support plays a crucial role .
However , I beg to differ .
I believe that science and technology would be able to ease the aging process to a larger extent .
Firstly , with the help of modern technology , the elderly would still be  independent   , due to the inventions such as electric wheelchair  .
This would reduce the reliance of the elderly on their families , and thus help to relieve the burden on their family members as they do not have to constantly attend to the needs of the elderly .
Although the elderly might be physically weak , they do not have to rely  on others and can still be independentand continue to lead a normal life as before .
This would indirectly lead to a healthy mindset as the elderly do not feel  that they are a burden to their families .
Also , with the help of modern technology , this would ease the workload of  families  taking care of the elderly .
Therefore , they will have more time and energy to care for  the elderly .
In a nutshell , science and technology has eased the aging process to a large extent by improving the mobility  of the elderly , such as providing  better medical treatment  for the elderly  .
With the help of science and technology , the elderly will face fewer difficulties .
They will reduce their reliance on  families  and have a better time in coping with the transitional phase of their lives .
Thus , they will enjoy their golden age .
The global aging issue has aroused public attention around the world .
Research shows that "The number of persons above 60 years or over is likely to triple , increasing from 673 million in 2005 to 2 billion by 2050" (citation) .
Everybody will get old eventually and when we grow older ,  we may suffer from some organ  or mental decline .
Some illnesses , such as vision loss , hearing loss and senile dementia , often make the elderly feel frustrated , isolated and lonely .
However ,  technology   has helped us to slow down these aging processes  in many creative ways .
" Visual disorders and diseases increase dramatically as we age" (citation) .
Research shows that "one in six adults aged 45 reported some type of vision impairment" (citation) .
These vision impairments often cause troubles in people's daily lives .
However ,  technology has implemented various innovative solutions to help people solve these problems and many users find them very useful in their lives .
For example , a device called "Pocket Viewer" is designed to help old people with long-sighted problem .
The device takes videos of the contents , enlarges and displays them on the screen in real time .
It is so light and handy that users can put it into their pockets and take it along with them wherever they go .
Some other smart products that I would like to mention here are the "Tek Partner TV Partner Remote" and "Accenda Voice Activated" .
Both devices are able to work with TVs and VCRs .
The former remote controller has larger buttons and the words on it are printed in bigger fonts than the usual  ones .
The idea is to simplify the design as much as possible so that the elderly who have low vision problems will find it easy to use .
The latter is more straight forward .
It doesn't even require the user to press any button .
To activate it , one simply gives it a voice command .
The commands are customizable and can be stored in the device .
One of the customers , Anita Clevenger in Sacramento , CA United states , bought this device for her mother who was 91-year-old and almost blind .
After using it for a few months , her mum found it very useful and gave a good feedback on it(author , year) .
Technology can help the elderly with their hearing problem as well .
Hearing loss is probably another common disease which can be found among the elderly .
Reasons that led to hearing loss vary; they could be "birth-related" , or because of infections , injuries , and being exposed  frequently to loud noises for a long period of time .
Once an old person catches such diseases , or her life would turn out to be very inconvenient .
However , engineers can create diverse tools using technologies to  help the old in their daily lives .
One significant problem occurs when they need to make a phone call  .
In fact , some research show that many old people with hearing difficulties do not use the phone at all because they are not able to hear  clearly .
Thus , companies such as "Clarity" , implemented the "Ameriphone amplified cordless phone" .
Its most important feature is to make " sounds much louder , clearer and easier to understand" (citation) .
These amplifier attachments in the telephones also allow users to adjust the volume according to their needs .
Other common techniques used to alert the users are vibration and flash-lights .
"Bed Shaker" and "Doorbell Signaler" are probably two of the most useful devices using the technique mentioned above .
A bed shaker can be designed to work with the telephone to provide alert  .
It can be placed not only under the pillow , but also under the cushion; and  it can  be portable .
Elizabeth A .Smith who is 75-year-old and deaf in one ear said that the "Bed Shaker" had provided a lot of  convenience to her as she is  a deep sleeper .
A "Doorbell Signaler" uses sound and light system to alert the user when there is a visitor .
It can be installed at any location in the house ,  so that  old people can see it easily .
Technologies  can also be applied to prevent senile dementia among the elderly .
One of the most innovative ideas is to create special video games  for the old people .
As we all know , our brains need constant stimulations to remain active .
A study done by psychologist and neuroscientist Helena Westerberg(citation) shows that older adults with an average age of 65 are able to "reach the same level of working memory" as younger adults with an average age of 25 , after they have been through a series of memory training on computer for 5 weeks (citation) .
This inspires game-developing companies to design videos games for the elderly .
Computer games such Wii game "BOOM BLOX" are relatively popular among the old people in some countries such as Japan and Britain .
Millions of people aged over 45 years old believe that taking up brain training through video games are the secret to a happy and healthy old age (citation) .
And such training is "said to improve mental agility , slow the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease " (citation) .
In  other words , playing games like Wii regularly is likely to help the elderly retain their abilities to do multiple tasks , exercise their brains and boost their thinking .
Global aging has become a worldwide issue that many developing  and developed countries are facing , or probably will face in the future .
However , we should always believe that technology will help  to ease the aging process and , eventually lighten the burden on the state .
Many countries experience population aging .
It seems to be a natural consequence of economic development , which extends lifespan and lowers birth rates .
This  phenomenon is most obvious in Japan , where 22 percent of its population is  aged 65 and older .
Hence , aging has becoming a popular issue that everyone is concerned about today .
Some of the common aging effects include changes in sensory , perceptual , motor  and  cognitive functions .
The current state of science and technology is able to diminish aging effect of the aging population and enhance their living so that they can enjoy  their twilight years .
It is  undeniable that being healthy and looking young  are the common  dreams of many elderly .
With the advancement of science and technology  , this dream can be brought much closer to  reality .
Firstly , common aging effects such as wrinkles , hair loss and weight issues can be countered to a certain level with the current state of technology .
This can be done by either plastic surgery or  manipulation of hormones   .
This is because hormone levels  have influence over metabolism levels , which in turn influence the effects of aging .
For instance , a new wrinkle reducer named Dysport  works  the same way as Botox in relaxing the facial muscles that caused wrinkles .
On top of that , to fight hair loss and thinning , a product called Revivogen , which is a dermatologist-formulated solution , was introduced to the market aiming at people aged 40 and above .
Secondly , advancement in science allows the elderly to enjoy a healthier life .
Scientific research can be made to deliver solution as well as  alternatives to ease the aging process .
For example , studies have shown that just as a child's nutritional requirements differ in quantity and quality from an adult's , the nutritional needs of the elderly also differ from the younger adults .
Therefore , Dr . Robert M . Russell , a professor of medicine and nutrition at Tufts University in Boston and his colleagues at the Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts , Dr . Alice Lichtenstein and Helen Rasmussen , have developed a revised food guide pyramid for Americans over 70 .
If the elderly followed the  the new food pyramid , they could get healthier  .
To sum up ,being healthy and looking young are important to the elderly because this is how they can live with confidence and satisfaction  .
Technology can provide a means for the elderly to have a more enjoyable life .
Their free time can be better spent in a  meaningful way .
Firstly , technology introduces a wider variety of entertainment for the elderly to choose from .
Due to the booming of the media and gaming industry , many sophisticated technological inventions are penetrating the market and becoming more affordable and ubiquitous .
This is unlike the 1970s when old people normally led a monotonous life  , such as  listening to the radio or reading the newspapers to kill their  time .
Today , with many technological inventions such as television , gaming consoles , and karaoke becoming widely available , the elderly have a wider range of options for entertainment .
Moreover , they are more willing to spend money on these devices because they  attract their  relatives to visit them  .
In fact , this makes the home livelier and merrier .
Secondly , the elderly can now expand their social networks beyond the neighborhood by means of using the internet , which is a fruit of technology  .
They are no more confined to the  area around their houses  , but are able to venture into the outside world .
In America , statistics (citation) has indicated that 45% of the senior citizens aged 70-75 are now online , meaning that the internet has become a channel for the elderly to connect to the outside world .
In addition , they enjoy mixing with other people  , especially with the youngsters via virtual communities such as facebook , flikr , and Del .icio .us .
Therefore , their lives will not be boring  because they can make friends on the internet .
The advancement of  technology also enables the elderly to be more independent and  perform activities that they like .
This is unlike the past when they are considered a burden to the family because of  the considerable amount of effort  needed to look after them .
Firstly , with the aid of technology , senior citizens can enjoy more mobility  , and they can go wherever they like  .
They are no longer confined in the house by their family  , who may want to ensure their safety .
With a handheld device like a mobile phone with the integrated Global Positioning System(GPS) feature , they are less likely to get lost in the cities  .
There are cars designed for  the wheelchair-bound or those with difficulty walking , like the Toyota Motor Corp .'s Welcab series .
Secondly , the elderly can look after themselves or even take care of the household chores .
This is because they are aided by artificial intelligence or technological innovations .
In Japan , where 22 percent of its population are aged 65 and older ,  a care-technology market has emerged and it is worth $1 .08 billion in 2006(citation) .
One  example is the "muscle suits" developed by the Tokyo University of Science , which keeps the elderly active by providing support for the upper body , arms , and shoulders .
This eliminates the needs for maids or family members to look after the elderly and monitor their every single movement , which in turn spare some dignity for the elderly .
Clearly , the aging process can be eased by current research and development .
Negative effects of aging can be diminished to  a large extent with the help of  science and technology .
It is possible that in  future , aging effects can be diminished to so low a level that the elderly could enjoy healthy and fulfilling lives into their twilight years , without being a heavy burden on their children and grandchildren .
Nowadays , many countries are facing  the problem of a fast aging population .
As a result , public spending on the aged will increase and eat into the spending of other areas of a country's development .
However this does not solve the aging issue in the long runand in fact it will hinder the progress of a country .
Therefore  , for a developed or developing country , public spending on the aged should be limited , and diverted to other areas of development  .
The most important area should be , education , as education helps  people to acquire the necessary skills needed for work .
With an educated workforce , the country will be able to ask for better wages for their citizens and hence increase their standards of living .
For  example ,  Singapore , at the beginning of  nation building , viewed education as one of the priorities  .
This  not only increases the level of skills of the workforce , but also brings women into it .
As a result , it creates a disciplined and cohesive society that benefits everyone .
Furthermore education also helps the aged to acquire new skills which enable them to work even at  old age .
Another important area would be the environment .
Earth's average temperature has increased dramatically over the past few years and this results in an increase in the public's awareness awareness of global warning  .
Building a greener environment to protect our planet becomes the objective of many countires .
In the long run , it will not only benefit the current population but also the future one .
For  example , Iceland has replaced its energy sources from coal and oil to geothermal and hydropower for decades .
This has helped to eliminate the amount of greenhouse gas emission and hence reduced air pollution to the environment .
As a result ,  their citizens are able to enjoy fresher air , which means that they will be healthier at  old age .
The last area that this essay is going to cover is the military development of a country .
With increasing terrorist activities around the globe , the ability to keep a country safe and stable has become an important issue .
Without security there can be no economic development .
Conversely , stability and security will be jeopardised without economic development .
By achieving security and economic stability ,  a country will be able to exist .
For  example , Singapore has always believed that National Service is important in keeping the country safe .
It  protects our country from external threats and  brings foreign investment into our country .
Only then will Singapore be the safe for everyone to live in .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged will only benefit a minor group of people and slows down the country's progression .
Therefore , in order to benefit everyone in the country  , there is a need to divert the money into other areas for the country's development .
A report from the United Nations predicts that there will be an increase in the proportion people over 60 years old from 10 per cent in 2000 to 21 per cent in 2050 .
Accompanied by the decline in the proportion of the young , by 2050 , the number of older persons in the world will exceed the number of young for the first time in history by 2050 (author , year) .
This trend  is largely irreversible and is presenting countries with  opportunities and challenges .
Every country needs  Fortunately , many advanced policies and technologies are now helping the elderly to  ease the aging process and to become a useful workforce for society .
Many economic schemes are being implemented to help the elderly deal with financial problems .
The increasing  population of the elderlyhas a significant impact on economic growth , investment and consumption .
However , many countries are on the right track in dealing with the problem  , by adopting some schemes like pension plans  .
For example , almost all the old people in Canada are receiving income from Canada's public pensions--- the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) .
Together , the CPP and OAS provide a modest base upon which Canadians can build their retirement income (author , year) .
Another example is  Great Britain's new strategy , "Building A Society For All Ages" which  extended the retirement age to beyond 65 .
Minister for Pensions and the Ageing Society Angela Eagle said that this new policy will help  old people to save enough money for their retirement (author , year) .
This policy will give  older people a chance to work longer and contribute to the society .
The healthcare systems are  improving to meet the need of the elderly .
Statistics from The Center for Disease Control (USA) shows that "88% of those over 65 years of age have at least one chronic health condition; nearly 40% of deaths in America can be attributed to smoking , physical inactivity , poor diet , or alcohol misuse; and almost 20% of older Americans suffer from a mental disorder that is NOT part of normal aging"(author , year) .
Long-term healthcare has become a vital need for old people .
Many counties are paying more and more attention to the healthcare system as the proportion of the old population increases .
For example , the United States  spends more money on heath care than any other nation in the world .
It spends approximately 15 .3% of GDP and the spending is expected to reach 19 .5% of GDP by 2017 (author , year) .
About 97% of older American are benefiting from healthcare system through health insurance like Medicare(citation) .
Being covered by healthcare insurance has become critical for old people  , especially those with disabilities and chronic illness associated with aging .
Many People suffer from sensory impairment as they grow older .For instance , 28% of people aged 65 and above have difficulties with their eyesight , 55% of people aged 60and above are deaf or hard of hearing(author , year) .
Nowadays ,  these problems can be solved with just some small devices .
For example ,  devices like hearing aids are a solution for the elderly with hearing loss problem .
It  can be really small to be noticed .
Another useful device for  old people suffering from vision problem is PocketViewer .
The PocketViewer is a portable solution for older people to read , write and see and it uses a miniature video camera to transfer and enlarge the text and images from a page to the screen(author , year) .
Many others devices are now also helping the elderly to lead better lifes .
The unprecedented demographic changes are transforming the world .
The consequences of anaging population present both opportunities and challenges for all nations .
Many nations are achieving successes to help the elderly to become  a useful part of society .
There is an observation made by Morrow Bourne: "Age is a prison from which we cannot escape" .
Indeed , aging is a natural process that everyone will experience  .
Due to the effects of aging , some  people may suffer from  .
As people are a country's most precious resource , the government should help its people when they are suffering from ageing problems .
In recent decades , many countries have invested a certain amount of money in areas such as science and technology , to develop new products such as  iShoe  and big button TV remote control that would help the elderly .
I certainly agree that these developments have greatly helped to ease the aging process .
With the help of technology , scientists have created an intelligent system that helped the elderly to remember everyday tasks (An Intelligent System Helps Elderly Or Memory-impaired To Remember Everyday Tasks , 2009) .
"Research has shown that aging may affect memory ,  changing the way the brain stores information and  making it harder to recall stored information"  (Memory Loss With Aging) .
Consequently , older people will forget things more easily .
For instance , some of the elderly may be unable to recall some  daily activities such as taking medicine , bringinalong with them their cell phones or keys when they are leaving the house .
to solve these problems , a team of researchers have created a system that  ususes  sensors to identify human actions and  mobile devices to remind the elderly to perform daily activities (An Intelligent System Helps Elderly Or Memory-impaired To Remember Everyday Tasks , 2009) .
As a result , they are able to carry out their everyday tasks as usual .
One of the graduate students from Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology has developed an iShoe that prevents the elderly from falling (HO , 2008) .The iShoe contains a device that measures and records human movements .
In addition , it helps to stimulate the feet and alert the elderly when they lose their balance .
Using these data , the elderly can look for a doctor for early diagnosis .
Therefore , their balance can be improved and they are able to lead a better life .
Tek Partner , has invented a big button TV remote control to help elderly who have visual problems (Aging and Technology Research , 2005) .
Research has shown that  older people will experience some common visual problems such as tearing , floaters and glare (Aging and Technology Research , 2005) .
Consequently , they are unable to focus and see objects clearly .
With  large size of buttons , older people are able to see and operate the control without any help  .
To conclude , science and technology have help in developing products  to ease the aging process .
For instance , the intelligent system is invented to help the elderly to remember their daily tasks .
This is because as people get older , they will forget things more frequently .
Therefore , they need a system to remind them to perform certain activities .
iShoe , is another product that is developed using science and technology to prevent the elderly from falling down .
It helps to monitor human movements and provides a warning if any balancing problem is found .
As a result , the elderly can improve their balance by approaching the balancing specialist earlier .
Lastly , a big button TV remote control is created to help seniors who are unable to see certain images clearly .
With the help from the control , they are able to operate the television , VCD and DVD player independently .
In conclusion , the elderly are able to lead a better life with the help of all these products .
For  the past 44 years , Singapore has made drastic changes to the layout of our buildings and many of these commanding buildings symbolize our country's success .
For instance , the unique "durian" appearance of the Esplanade gives our small city a distinct sky-line and becomes one of the main tourist attractions in Singapore .
However , Singapore is facing a rapidly ageing population with a rise in median age from 20 in 1970 to 37 in 2009; there is a need to improvise our buildings' architecture using current technology to ease the aging process .
Government spending on investment in architectures for the aged has increased tremendously over the  , so as  to build a friendly environment for elderly to live .
A good example is the LUP (Lift Upgrading Program) , which ensurensures that all apartment blocks , including the older buildings built before 1990 , will have lift access to all storeys by year 2014 .In the past , this project is not feasible due to the high costs involved  .
Nonetheless , with our present advanced architecture technology and economic status , lifestyle for the elderly can be improved to a  large extent .
It is also  significant to create a barrier-free environment for the increasing ageing population in Singapore .
The elderly  with crutches have difficulties climbing up and the stairs; therefore , it is  impossible for the wheelchair bound the elderly to move out from their houses .
Obstruction-free walkways are built to connect various districts within the the neighborhood .
of Accessibility to all the facilities in neighborhoods is enhanced with the distribution of ramps throughout the vicinity  .The elderly and the  disabled could move around comfortably because the gradient of the ramps is design in such a way that even without the help of a second party , elderly will also be able to move up and down freely  .
At block level ,  lifts are improvised to stop at every storey  and additional features such as the widening of  the lift door for wheelchairs and the lowering of  handrail bars for elderly to grip on for support are included  .
These architecture advancements are frameworks of the 5-years Barrier-Free Accessibility (BFA) Upgrading Program  .
The BCA (full name of BCA) invested $40 million Accessibility Fund into this program in  2007 .
It aimed to transform Singapore into an elderly friendly and barrier-free environment for the elderly  in the near future . 
Improvements in the architecture of the external environment are essential in boosting  the physical and mental development  of  the elderly .
Elderly who are prone to illnesses need sensory stimulation and exercises to maximize their mobility .
A study has shown that outdoor parks and regular exercises have therapeutic effects on the elderly in improving their health and wellness , as well as  increasing their muscle strength and stimulating  their spiritual developments .
Within housing estates , elderly wellness stations and community gardens are built under the MUP (Main Upgrading Program) to promote healthy living among elderly residents .
There is a wide variety of exercise equipment at the elderly wellness station and pebble walks are also available .
Since elderly have brittle bones , more resting areas with lower benches have also been built to cater to their needs .
These  recreational outdoor facilities are being built extensively to create a better living environment  for the ageing population .
"Old age isn't so bad when you consider the alternative" , said Maurice Chevalier (citation) .
Indeed ,  we are actively implementing various architectural developments and policies  to meet the special needs of the aged .
To raise awareness of the importance of "shaping a safe , sustainable and friendly environment" (citation) for people of all ages , a BCA Universal Design Award was introduced in  2007 to promote barrier-free accessibility in our environment .
With these improvements , we are one step closer in building a totally barrier-free healthy environment where the elderly can travel around freely and safely in absolute comforts .
According to the U .S . Census Bureau  , the average rate of people turning 65 years old in 2000 was 795 ,000 each month .
In 2008 , the figure increased to an average of 870 ,000 monthly .
This rate has increased by 9% in just a short period of 8 years and is expected to rise at a higher rate as the first group of baby boomers who were born between 1946 to 1966 moved into the category of elderly in two years' time .
As humans age , their five senses deteriorate gradually .
Among the five senses , the  common deterioration  are those of vision  and hearing  .
Hence , recent technological inventions ,  such as assistive technologies for sight or hearing can in fact ease the elderly in their aging process , making their aging symptoms more manageable .
Vision problems such as presbyopia (a condition whereby the ability to focus and see objects that are near is impaired)  , and cataracts (a condition whereby the vision is affected by the clouding of the lens in the eyes)  are common among aging people .
Being unable to see well may be dangerous a the elderly would not know whether there are obstacles in front of them , which could lead to falls .
Firstly , the development of lens optics improved greatly after the first wearable glasses were introduced by Salvino D'Armate in 1284 .
The improvement in lens development has allowed presbyopia , as well as myopia (near-sightedness) and hyperopia (far- sightedness) ,  corrected using spectacles equipped with convex lens  .
This  in turn assists the elderly to see better while reading or doing tasks which required close  focus .
For elderly with both presbyopia and myopia or both presbyopia and hyperopia , recent improvements in lens optics have resulted in the creation of  bifocals lens (convex and concave lens combined into a single lens)  , which  allow the elderly to have both their presbyopia and myopia or both their presbyopia and hyperopia to be corrected .
Secondly , with vision- assisting technology such as PocketViewer , the elderly can capture an image of any item or text they wish to magnify .
Lastly , for elderly who have serious vision problems like near-blindness or blindness , there are softwares like Talking Cellphone Accessibility 2 with voice-activated commands to allow even people who are completely blind to use a mobile phone 8 .
Hence , the  vision sight assistive or replacement technologies helps the elderly  to see better and  do simple tasks  .
Another condition that is common in aging people is presbycusis , which is more commonly known as hearing loss .
Hearing loss related to aging is nerve- related  , and it is caused by damage to the inner ear .
Without being able to hear clearly , the elderly cannot hear emergency horns when they are crossing the road and  they cannot enjoy simple pleasures like watching the television .
Moreover , it would be difficult for them to communicate with their loved ones .
However , hearing loss  can be helped using hearing aids ,  which are readily available in the market .
There are many kinds of hearing aids such as behind-the-ear or  in-the-ear type  , as well as   bigger models such as the walkman look-alike type that are hung around the waist .
As technologies advance , hearing aids  are getting smaller  , to the extent that  it can be hidden in the ear canal .
This allows the  elderly   to use an inside the ear-canal- type if they felt conscious of the hearing aids .
For example , Sonic Listener is a type of wired amplifier that is to be hung around the waist with the ear phone connected directly to the amplifier .
Also , if wireless is preferred , there is also the TV headset which can also be used as a hearing aid .
The wireless type would be less restrictive as there are no wires from the amplifier connected to the ear phones .
Moreover , there are also other devices that do not amplify sounds but rather  make use of other senses such as touch and sight .
One such example is the Bed Shaker , which vibrates when the phone rings or when the alarm sounds , which  can be used under the pillow when sleeping 11 .
Another example is the Doorbell Signaler which flashes light from the device when the doorbell is being pressed 12 .
Thus , even with  hearing problems , the elderly can still make use of the available hearing assistive technology to help them in their daily tasks .
There are also times when technologies create  troubles for the elderly .
As we move into the technological age , where computers and other devices flourish in every home and office , the elderly would have problems trying to use such devices .
For example , in the National Library , books to be borrowed were to be scanned at the checkout counter .
However ,  it would be very difficult for the elderly to learn how to use new devices without the  from others .
In addition , working elderly are also being easily replaced  machines that can do menial jobs like cleaning  .
One such example is the Eurolab Auto Vacuum Intelligent Cleaner which has wall sensors and can be controlled from a distance .
Employers may be tempted to replace the elderly floor cleaner who may be slow in cleaning  .
How would the employer not be tempted to dismiss the elderly floor cleaner when the price of owning the machine for one year is much cheaper than the annual wages of the elderly cleaner ?
Therefore ,  not every product that is being invented would help the elderly  in the aging process .
In sum , with the help of advanced technologies , the elderly can counter their  sight and hearing loss and  live independently  .
This would help the elderly to feel less depressed and frustrated  .
With the advancement of  Information Technology , many devices have been developed to help the aged , especially those with healthcare problems and are home-bound or have difficulties moving about ,  .
These devices make an impact in their lives by providing them an alternative to ease their problems .
Hence , I agree with the statement to a large extent .
Developments in Information Technology help to monitor the health conditions of the aged without having themthem leaving their homes .
For instance , the  the Visiting Nurse Services of the Northwest , a homecare organization in Spain ,  allows patients to monitor their vital symptoms and send these data back to the nursing home over phone line or satellite  .
The  nurse working in the homecare organization would review the information and  call the patient to tell them about their conditions .
Monitoring programs that make use of technology like the one used by Visiting Nurse Services of the Northwest ease the burden of the elderly having to go to the clinic and also save the trouble for the aged to go through the procedure of medical examination .
In addition , there is a computer program in the US  called The  Technology Coach that helps the aged to simplify  the complex procedure on checking their vital symptoms  , such as taking measurement of the glucose level on a step-by-step basis .
The Technology Coach can even identify  errors  during the procedure and notify them on their mistakes .
These computer programs allow the aged to be independent as they do not need to rely on caregivers anymore .
Besides monitoring programs , there are also devices that helped the aged to remember things  as their memory may deteriorate with old age .
One of the devices is the "memory mirror" developed in the US .
This is a computer program that will remind the elderly of the time to take their medicine , and  the type of medicine to take .
It also uses radio frequency identification technology to allow the aged to keep track of the number of times that they have taken their medication and also the type of medicine they have already taken .
If the aged has taken the medication , it will be shown visually of the computer screen  .
The data will be recorded in the history logbook on the computer .
This is a very useful tool for the aged  , whose memory have deteriorated because of old age .
Nearer to home , Information Technology has revolutionized how the aged communicate with other people .
With the computer and the Internet being readily available  , the elderly can communicate with their families at anytime and anywhere in the comfort of their homes .
The aged who have their family members worked overseas can communicate with them  using web camera .
There is also the Internet chatting system like Windows Live Messenger that allowed them to communicate with their families and friends at anytime .
There are also "video chats" , "forums" and "weblogs" to allow them to  make friends with other aging people and  to express and voice their opinions  .
The Internet also allows the aged to  obtain and learn about information  at their preferred pace .
Thus , with Information Technology , the aged no longer would to be lonely even when they are homebound .
According to an interview with Leonid A . Gavrilov , Ph .D for the Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine () , the aging process is defined as "any process , which contributes to age-related decline in performance , productivity and health .'
Over the years , research and development specifically in the field of technology has made significant contributions to address this process of increased inconvenience .
Although critics of this position point out that technology is still short of significantly slowing aging , current research and development has to a large extent eased this process and made life easier through the introduction of technological inventions .
This essay will discuss the impact of some of these technological inventions and how it helps the aging population cope with their decline performance , productivity and health .
Certain objections must , of course , be considered .
One may argue that older people are forgetful and are not able to learn new things .
Also , with the advances of technology , it is impossible for the older people to learn the complex nature of new technology such as using the text messaging function of a mobile phone .
However , this argument is flawed .
Aging does not affect our ability to learn .
Although it might take an older person a longer time to learn , the cognitive function does not decline with age .
While an older person might have " some difficulty with short-term (working) memory" as cited by James Pirkly ,  "long-term memory generally remains sound ."
Also , although technology itself is complex in nature , there are technological inventions tailored for the older people and we will take a look at two of this technology .
Firstly , the current technology of mobile phones and personal device assistance (PDA) has in a lot of aspects contributed in addressing issues arising from health and decrease performance in terms of mobility .
These devices (mobile phones and PDAs) have various functions and applications that assist the user to complete daily essential tasks that are made difficult due to aging .
The quick dial function allows the elderly to seek emergency or medical help promptly with just a press of a button .
This ensures that the elderly are attended to when they are alone at home and suffer a fall or have any other injuries that need attention .
The global positioning system (GPS) function that are found in certain devices allow loved ones to keep track of the elder's movement and if the elderly gets lost , the loved ones are just a call away .
Applications such as the Baycreast's Memory-Link Program that can be installed on a PDA have functions to set time-based alerts and snapped photos to aid the elderly in remembering important details .
These applications and functions amongst many are easily available on the market and are there to ultimately help the elderly age in the comfort of their own home .
Secondly , the technological invention of Med-eMonitor , a device  helps the old to differentiate the various prescription drugs and when exactly to take it .
Managing the different drugs that often look similar in appearance is a challenge for the elderly .
With their ever-worsening eyesight and memory loss , this device seeks to help ease that burden .
This device has different compartments to store different medication and each compartment has its own unique time reminder system with instructions .
When it is time for the elderly to take a particular medicine , a musical chime will be played .
When an elder opens that compartment , text instructions are displayed clearly on an LCD screen .
If the musical chime is not attended to , the device can place a phone call to family members or care givers .
Current research and development particularly in the field of technology has in a huge way helped the elderly cope with the demands of aging .
The 2 types of  that are mentioned in this essay are amongst many that facilitate the old in handling age-related decline in health , performance and productivity .
As technology continues to advance , more tasks can be done and aging will soon be considered a transition rather than a problem .
I do not agree with the statement that suggests "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development" .
Aging issue has been a very serious problem that most of the countries , especially developed countries , are now facing .
It is expected that in future , this issue will be more severe .
To minimize the impact of it , a few suggestions have been proposed .
They are increasing money spent on the elderly; cut benefits; or cut other government spending .
From these solutions proposed , it is very obvious that money spent on the elderly currently is predicted to be sufficient to cover their needs anymore .
By limiting the money spent on this group of people , it means that lesser amount of money will be used to share among those who depend on the public spending to live .
This shows that the suggestion is not going to work as it will cause  problems for the elderly who depend on public s .  At the same time it not help to solve aging issues .
Besides , there is other option available other than cutting the spending on the elderly in order to have more money for other developments .
Cutting down spending on the elderly will only increase the seriousness of the aging issues .
Over the years , journalists and scholars have been publishing articles regarding how public spending on the elderly are rising and will be increasing in the future and the consequences of it .
They think that this will become a financial burden for the young generation and working adults , who will be contributing to the public spending .
It is normal that tax-payers are very concerned on how policy makers make decisions on how their hard earned money is pent and whether the policy makers are making full use of the money .
Hence , more and more people are suggesting diverting the money to other areas of development , which they think is beneficial to them as compared to spending on the aged .
But , this is definitely not a good suggestion because I believe that the government should always put their people as the first priority when making decisions .
If they were to ignore the needs of the elderly and focus on the development , it will obviously bring more social problems to the society .
Furthermore , this aging population is very much dependent on the public spending to cover their daily needs , more importantly their medical expenses .
They  usually have low income level or are below poverty level .
Daily expenses and medical needs might become a burden for them .
I believe this is one of the reasons why most of the  refuse to see a doctor and accept medical treatment when they are ill because they think that it is a waste of money .
Without the help from public spending , they might face financial problems in order to maintain their living and health condition .
Illnesses and various diseases  always seems to attack the old people as this group of people are weaker compared to other age groups .
It will be more worrying if they need special or long term medical treatment that might be too costly for them to handle .
Other than cutting the spending on the elderly , there are other ways divert more money for other development plans .
As for the United States government , they divide the spending to five sectors , which are pension , health , education , welfare and defence .
Due to falling birthrates , I believe it is possible to reduce public spending on education .
Low birthrate means that there are lesser students in future , and also , parents to kids' ratio will be higher .
These two factors will be two very good reasons to cut down spending on the education sector .
From the all the reasons mentioned above , it is very clear that cutting down public spending for the old age is not a good choice in order to divert the money for the areas of development .
The group of elderly people is getting bigger which tells us that the current policy is not applicable anymore in the future as there will be more demand from the elderly .
In order to have more money for other areas of development , one of the ways is to reduce other sectors of public spendingsuch as  education , for example .
So , the suggestion to cut down spending for the old age people is not a good solution to use the money for other areas of development .
Global aging is also known as demographic  .
Population aging has become a typical issue  these days .
The economy growth of the country will be affected when there are less people who  contribute to the country .
The National budgets and economies will come under pressure as growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer younger persons .
The simulation effect indicates that the changes will have a major impact on rates of national saving and real wage rate .
To deal with such challenges , the government has created many policies to overcome this issue .
Firstly , the elderly are encouraged to work for longer periods Social policies , practices and attitudes discourage working at an older age because the retirement for the elderly will be costly for firms .
By having less restriction from the company , the elderly will also easily  suit  the job scope .
The "Age-friendly" policy of setting wages and employment practices has  ensured that the employers have strong incentives to hire and retain old workers .
Moreover , the amount of government incentives , for example the Central Providence Fund Board (CPF) in Singapore will be enough for them to live independently after the retirement  .
By having this policy  , older workers have become people who contribute to the society and not a  a burden of country .
For instance , The Singapore government encourages the university educated or professionally qualified mother to have at least 3 or more children by giving tax rebates of $20 ,000 or more .
On the other hand , the government has begun to provide a subsidy of $100 for employed mothers when their 3th preschool children is placed in approved full day child care centers .
There are also unrecorded leave for mothers to take care of the sick children .
The "three , if you can afford it" policy  has increased the total population of Singapore citizens and has allowed the population of the country to younger .
Lastly , filial obligation is also one of the methods to decrease the negative impact of fast-aging population .
Some moral western philosophers believe that adult children do not have any moral obligation to support their aged parents .
The sacrifice that the parent made for them in the past is compulsory for every human being in the West .
This is so because the children do not ask to be brought into this world .
Thus , the traditional filial obligation of taking care of the elderly is left as either the responsibility of the elderly themselves or as a societal burden of the public .
On the other hand , in eastern countries the grown children , who started working in the society have to take care of their parents .
Most of them have a mindset that it is a must to give back the things that their parents sacrificed for them .
These circumstances  cause the long-term care costs provided by the western government increase sharply .
To overcome this situation  western countries such as the United States have to learn from Asian countries like Japan and China where  this 'moral responsibility' as well the fact that the elderly still stay with their grown are still being practised . .
In the long term  , the increase of the aging population will lower  the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country .
The government has to take this issue seriously before it affects the eeconomic growth of the country .
Before the leaders take effective action ,  .
They must realize  .
For instance , The United State of America  The government has to be concerned about this issue , so that htis will not impact the future .
The  population in Singapore is aging rapidly .
According to a report on aging population by Committee on Ageing  , the number of residents aged 65 years or older will increase from 300 ,000 to 900 ,000 by the year 2030 (Balaji , 1999 .
It is expected for the aging population to continue increasing for the next few years .
Since  the government introduced the  campaign "Stop at 2" to control the high birth rate , it was too successful that the population decreased due to the overwhelming  positive responses by the citizens .
This has led to  more and more elderly living in this society .
Therefore , the government has been promoting active aging to help the elderly to engage in a healthy and happy lifestyle .
Thus , I agree to a large extent that the "policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
Different types of policies have been introduced to improve the welfare of the elderly so that they are able to benefit from it .
One of the policies that has been introduced is the housing policies such as lift upgrading , elderly fitness corner and studio apartments .
Firstly , the government has implemented the lift upgrading program to build new lifts in  housing blocks which have direct access to every floor to cater to the elderly residents who have painful legs and who are wheelchair bound .
According to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong s the old lifts have been replaced with the new lifts which previously only stopped at every third or fourth floor (Lee , 2009 .
With the newly upgraded lifts ,  more convenience to the elderly is provided
Secondly , elderly fitness corners are built to cater to the elderly to exercise more in order to lead a healthy lifestyle .
They are strongly encouraged to use the facilities at the fitness corners to do a light workout to improve their health conditions .
Having regular exercises helps to prevent any chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and heart disease from attacking the elderly ( , 2009 .
Besides exercising , the elderly are also able to interact with their  , thus widening  their social network .
Through a healthy and active lifestyle  the elderly  are able to live longer and stay free from illness (Balaji , 1999 .
With that , they are able to return  to work and continue to contribute to the society .
Thus , not only do the elderly  benefit from it , the country's economic growth may also benefit since they have valuable experiences in the industry .
Thirdly , studio apartments are being built to meet the elderly residents needs .
Living in the studio apartment enables the elderly to be more independent .
These apartments are customized with safety features such as non-slip titles which prevent them from falling , level flooring which makes the floor even to accommodate elderly who are wheelchair bound and support hand bars for them to hold on to ( , 2007) Therefore , the elderly are able to enjoy the benefits that are given to them .
They do no not have to worry about their physical needs not being well-taken care of .
However , critics of this position argue that the government should not spend time and resources to ease the aging process .
Instead they should implement more policies on the younger generation to boost the economy growth so as to move towards a knowledge based economy and also to introduce more schemes to increase the birth rate so that the government is able to meet their goals .
Moreover , it is the children's responsibility to take care of the parents instead of the government .
If the elderly well- being is not well taken care of , the younger generation may not want to reconsider giving birth since the society is unprepared for the aging population in the future and this will cause more elderly living in this society .
If the society is well-prepared , the younger generation does not have to worry about their own welfare when they turn old .
Besides that , not all children have the ability to support their parents as they might be facing financial problems and hence are unable to take good care of them .
In addition , some elderly do not have any children .
Therefore the elderly need the government's help to meet their physical needs .
In conclusion , it is important for the society to be well-prepared for the aging process so that they are able to tackle the issues of aging population that the country will encounter in the future .
Most importantly , by implementing the different types of policies , it has indeed helped the elderly to meet their  .
The elderly able to engage  in a socially  active lifestyle .
In my opinion , public spending on the elders should be limited and the money can be diverted to other sectors of the progress of the country .
Indeed , the aged  were once the main human resource that  contributed greatly to the development of the country and thus deserve the welfare of getting public spending , as a token of gratitude .
Yet that token of gratitude should not be too much till it may drag down the development of the country .
Instead , reformed policies should be implemented to limit the public spending for the aged , and meanwhile , to make sure that their welfare is still taken care of .
To begin with , public spending on the aged population has become a burden to the tax payers .
It is known that the money proposed for the eldercare nowadays has comprised a large portion of the government spending .
For example , according to the Singapore budget report of 2009 , the payout for the Senior Citizen Bonus is at least SD$73400000 .00 for that year .
This figure has not  included the other programmes that are proposed for the senior citizens .
As the source of money for the government is mainly the tax payers , this figure translates as  a burden on these contributing citizens .
Furthermore , in these few years , the amount of money that is allocated for the eldercare has been increasing .
If this trend does not change in the next few years , the average citizens would have to pay more , in order to enable the government to use the money for the aged ones .
In other words , the income that they earned would be constantly reduced .
This may result in the feeling of indignation in the tax-payers towards the ruling government - which is not an advantageous condition for the further growth of the country .
Moreover , the over-emphasis in aiding the elders for their sunset years may cause the insufficiency of financial resource in the other parts of the country .
As all areas in a country are equivalently important , such as  in terms of the development of the  , the happiness index of people , or even for a higher living standard of life .
If the part of the funding for the aged is overstressed , it is more likely that the spending in other sectors by the governments have to be reduced , so as to compensate the budget .
This is because the money resource of the government to invest in these parts is limited .
As a result , the progress of the other sectors may not be so ideal .
If the situation persists for a long term , it will do harm to the nation and may shake the public trust in the government .
A well-developed country may indirectly even lose competency with the other countries .
Especially in  , agriculturewhere small middle enterprises  depend on the government funding  .
For those developing countries , this will affect the effort of the government and the private sectors in the growth of the nation .
Another reason that makes me agree with decreasing the funding for the elders , and diverting it to the other areas instead , is the familial factor .
When the government takes a great share of the duty to care for the elders , most of their adult children tend to shift their own filial piety .
These adults usually see their parents as a burden , feeling no gratitude to  their teachings , their contribution and , last , but not least , their needs and feelings .
As the government introduces programmes for eldercare , they will happily leave the problem to the government .
This has indirectly sparked their decision to just abandon their parents .
The government has proposed bonuses and allowances for the parents  .
Some of the programmes have even distributed the aid monthly !
Hence ,  public funding may indirectly relate with the rising case of abandoned parents at the old folks'  .
F these parents , all the funding seems to have lost its values , if they have lost their connection with their beloved family  .
In fact ,  public funding for the welfare of the aged  is still needed in some ways , but it is  so crucial until it should comprise such a huge section of the government spending .
As an alternative , some of the policies should be reformed to shift a part of the government duty to the family of the elders , and even the elders themselves .
For example , people should be compelled by law to take care of their own parents .
The family should carry out the responsibility to look after the elders .
Besides that , most of the elders do have their own savings or investment that they have accumulated since they were young .
Anyway , in the case of  homeless , childless and jobless ,  they should savour the benefits from the eldercare programme by the government .
Or else , they may have to end up suffering without assistance or even notice of the others .
Pension , subsidy and medical insurance is the main way through which the government can directly help the aged , however , this does not imply that more financial support would definitely lead to better sitution .
Now f .scal policy to help the aged does not satisfy everybody's needs .
Firstly , in terms of pensfees , the government's regulations always determine the amount of pension given to a person by how much he or she has contributed to the society .
Mostly , these productive people are able to accumulattypes of h wealth to fight for their aged problems .
t the same time , research reveals that these people can often be productive and healthy even after retirement .
In contrast , those who are less succesupport their life will get comparably less pension to support them .
Their low-skilled and physical jobs limit their possibility to continue working after certain age .
These men have to cope with their miserable sunset years with limited pension , and this is where the pension system's imbalance lies .
Secondly , in terms of subsidy and medical insurance , the government often fails to differtiate the levels of need among different groups of people .
For example , people who have chronic disease should receive more subsidy and better medical insurance .
For those who work in high polluted industry , they should also be specially considered .
Therefore , the government's financial support should depend on people's financial state and healthy state .
What is more urgent and practical comparing to purely spending more money on the aged is to restructure the pension , subsidy and medical insurance systems to ensure the limited government's money can effectively help the aged .
thatcomparedTsubsidiesdiseasesneedsFurthermore , the money we save could be diverted to develop education .
Education is the root of a country .
It is widely believed that the most important treasure of a country in 21st century is talents .
The main way to produce competent people is to develop education .
Many countries have made different new policies to boost education development .
One of China's well-known policies is popularizing compulsory education in urban and rural places .
The vision of this policy is to raise the civilization level of the country and give its citizens abilities to keep pace with the fast developing technologies .
Thus education deserves huge financial support from the government .
On the other hand , focusing on ethical educational topics either in school or social propaganda could teach children as well as adults to be willing to take the caregiving duties .
Hopefully , such broad education could evoke love in everyone's heart , and let all people take initiative to care about the old people in our society .
This would probably have a better effect on solving the aging problem than just focusing on financial areas .
Besides education , spending money on economy development is also very important .
A country can step on its way to prosperity if it has good economic policy .
A good example is thethe 21storm and opening-up of China .
It is a time when Chinese government paid huge sum of money to create good investing environment and financially support local entrepreneurs .
Without this , China could not possible to achieve what it has today .
In addition , it could be concluded that spending money on economy would make people wealthy , which could greatly help to ease the aging problem .
The reason is that if people could afford the healthcare fee themselves , they already overcome the radical part of the aging problem .
have achievedTherefore , public spending on the aged should be limited; the reasons are given in terms of pension , subsidy and medical insurance .
Furthermore , the money saved should be diverted into important areas relative to the country's destiny , such as educpaysn and sumsnomy .
In return , developia investingcrucial areas would benefit the as well .
Recently , the aging population has caused lots of social and economic problems , which has drawn the attention of more and more governments .
However , what most governments do is just to increase public spending on the aged  , which is not enough to tackle the issue and even decreases the country's development .
In fact , it will be more efficient to limit spending on the old and use more money on economic development .
First of all , it cannot be ignored that there will be more choices to care for those who are in need with sufficient economic growth .
For instance , Cambodia possessed a very slow development for a long time .
With a large population living in poverty , its government spent quite a large amount of money on the needy .
The situation is similar for the problem of aging population .
If more efforts and money are spent on the development of economy , there will be much more benefits gained from it in turn .
Therefore , we are provided with more choices to care for the elder people .
Secondly , it is not necessary for governments to spend too much money on the elderly to resolve the problem of aging population .
Alternatively , by requiring people to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency , governments can also solve this problem without slowing down economic growth .
In some countries , like Singapore and Britain , people are encouraged or compelled by law to save and invest a certain portion of their income when they are active in the work force .
This method proves to be very effective .
With enough money saved or invested during the years of work , the elderly  become less dependent on financial aids from governments .
Moreover , there will be more money diverted to other areas to promote the economic development .
Instead of increasing spending on the old , the problem can also be tackled by encouraging the elderly  to lead longer working lives .
That is an effective way to solve some economic and social problems caused by aging population .
A good example is that the UK's government managed to solve pension drain by using this method .
Furthermore , longer working lives can definitely help lessen the pressure of younger generations , which protects them from being overwhelmed by overloaded work .
What is  most important is that longer working lives give the aged opportunities to accumulate wealth for later lives , making them less vulnerable to the changes of outer aids .
This will truly benefit the aged who are completely dependent on pensions from governments .
Some people may have doubts about the productivity of the aged and argue that it is their right to lead a peaceful lives .
However , this is not true .
On the one hand , life today is different from the past , in part because of demographic and economic changes .
The population aged 65 to 75 is healthier and better educated than those in this age group in past generations .
Most people who retire  from work today are still energetic and in quite good health .
So there is no doubt that the aged are able to lead longer working lives .
On the other hand , since the aged are mostly more experienced and patient , there truly exist some  jobs more suitable for them .
In that case , they are even more productive than younger workers .
It is shown that we are able to efficiently solve the problems caused by aging population with limited spending .
Through the methods of requiring people to provide in advance and encouraging longer working lives , more money can be diverted to other areas to promote  economic development .
And with sufficient economic development , there will be more choices for governments to care for the old .
Firstly , it is not worth spending a lot of money on the aged at the cost of the whole society's development .
Money should be transferred to some more important areas .
In fact , if the ecmics of the whole society can ensure a steady growth , then it will be much easier for the country to undertake the pension .
Although the aging problem is worsening , it is not a wise choice to focus too much attention on the issue .
When the limited money is made the most of , the aged can benefit from the various prospering departmeeconomyver the country , even maintain a self-sufficient life without the financial aid from the government .
Secondly , governments can encourage every citizen to save for their old-age dependency .
If everyone starts to save when they begin to work ,  most of them can be independent in finance after retirement .
Nowadays investment companies or insurance companies provide a variety of investment plans which can satisfy the needs for most people .
For example , in Singapore , people begin to save a certain percent of his salary into his bank account , in order to pay the housing loan , car loan or for advanced age .
Many developed countries such as Britand Australian also carry out this policy .
If people are not willing to save in advance , then the government can compel people to save by law .
Thirdly , government can provide some work especially for the old unemployed people .
Since most of the old people have a lot of leisure time , the government can promote some temporary or long-term programs for the old .
For example , some big supermarkets can employ the old to put the good messed up by the shoppers back to theofplace .
Some jobs like this are not very brain-consuming and do not need a lot of physical strength .their additaccountse old people can earn some money and get some exercises by contributing to the work .
This policy can also be applied to some low-salary jobs which are beneath the young's notice .
Spending the governmentoney is not the most effective way to solve the aging problem .
We can also achieve the goal of easing the aging process by encouraging advance savings and providing suitable jobs for the old .
Since the money should be reduced by promoting these two policies , more goodsy can be transferred to other more urgent areas .
In a nutshell , money spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
I agree with the question that "Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
The greying population are expected to double by the year 2030 , "one in five Singaporeans will be over 65 , up from 1 in 12 today" () .Therefore the amount of public spending required are also expected to rise proportionately .
The Government should limit public spending so as to prevent over reliance of the elderly on them which  in turn causes an even bigger strain on the shrinking work force .
Therefore , the Government should focus on increasing productivity of future workers and making the citizens more independent rather than  expanding the budget .
Some of the ways to do so is to make saving compelled by law , to elderly to come back to the workforce , and in healthcare aspects .
In order to cultivate the sense of self reliance the Government should make a compulsory law for the working adults to save into a special account with their monthly pay .
One  such example is the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme used in Singapore over 5 decades .
This policy helps to prepare the citizens for their retirement while they still have the ability to earn an income .
This would ensure that each citizen would have some amount of money to fall back on when they retire and would in turn lessen the needs for subsidies or help from the government .
Education should also pay a part in allowing the future citizens to know the importance of early retirement preparation and planning .
One of the major problems of an ageing population is the lack of workforce to drive the economy .
Since the human's life expectancy has generally increased over the decades , it is essential that elderly  work and earn more income for their retirement while it is possible .
Therefore the retirement age should be pushed back and elderly should be encouraged to upgrade their skills and continue working as they are a country's invaluable resource with a lot of experience .
By tapping on the large number of elderly , the country's workforce will be increased and more people will be available to drive the country's economy to encourage growth .
With sufficient economic growth , there will be lesser needy people as well .
The cost of healthcare is on the rise .
One of the challenges of the Government is to try to make healthcare services more affordable .
Healthcare service is very essential to the elderly as they are more prone to  .
Therefore by lowering the cost of healthcare , elderly can have more money to use in other areas of retirement .
As the saying goes "prevention is better than cure" - free health screening and health campaigns should be implemented .
Getting more elderly to get free health screening can ensure health problems to be treated at an early stage thus reducing the cost of expensive treatments when symptoms turn serious .
The citizens should also be encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle to prevent any possible illnesses to ensure a smooth retirement with more money spent on other areas other than healthcare .
The human's life expectancy has increased over the years with the advanced technology and different living environments; more adults are better educated and well off than before .
This has changed our perception towards what is healthy and what is ageing .
Despite all these improvements , it does not mean that every single one of the elderly in the country would be covered and well taken care of .
There will still be a group of vulnerable elderly like the old single elderly  mentioned by Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer () .
This means that lower educated people will be more likely to be in need  the public spending funds .
But all in all , the advantage of limiting of the public spending  outweighs the disadvantage as the needy group of people would be minimised .
In conclusion , I agree that public spending should be limited as citizens should not be over reliant on their Government and the focus to solve such problems should be to increase workforce and also make use of more money on lowering healthcare costs  in other areas of the country's development .
Nations in Asia are suffering from the problem of an aging population .
With the increasing problem , the government has no choice but to spend a large sum of money to help and allow the process of aging in the society to be easy and convenient .
With policies , resources and money set aside for elders , elders are prepared to retire and enjoy retirement in a more fulfilling manner .
Reasons for the government to increase their spending on the elders include , the importance of an elderly in a family setting is important and we should all respect them in all aspects Elders in countries have given most of their lives in their homeland and as a result become a significant part of development of their nations .
In return , the government should take care of our elders as a means of gratification .
Lastly , the potential contributions of the elders would be valuable for the current generation .
Firstly , we should all respect our elders at home and everywhere else .
Given the fact that they have been with us , are living with us and their presence has brought joy into the different households , the support they give us and the advice they always share with us , lies far more than just a duty to them .
Rather it is love and appreciation for taking care of them .
To be an example for the households to respect the elders in their family , the government first must show examples of it .
If the government pays more attention to them ,  the chances of the individual families to pay attention to their elders would  increase .
Secondly ,  our elders have given most of their lives to their homeland and contributed to the society as much as they could while they were younger .
Taking Singapore as an example , just after the World War II  , people  started to work hard for their future and we the following generations simply  enjoy the fruits of their labor .
Remembering that our forefathers have done so much , we cannot just simply abandon them when they are old and seemingly useless .
If we just neglect them , there are many other complications that might lead to facts that seems that the aged are really of no use .
Japan has increasing crime rates and from what they see is that , a lot of them are the  .
Why is that so ?
Shibata , whose task force has questioned 220 elderly people arrested mostly on charges of theft Stated that "When people feel lonely , there is an impulse to commit a crime so they will somehow connect with someone"  It was also noticed that the crimes that they commit are non-violent , t small and minor thefts With that to show that the elderly really need that attention and  help from the government ,  we cannot forget them and leave them aside but help them in the process of growing old .
Lastly , the potential contribution of an elder would definitely be valuable for the current generation because of the knowledge and experience that they have , that would bring many great lessons to the younger generation .
Making use of this important factor would allow the younger generation to appreciate them so much more .
The agedare a valuable asset if we know how to make use of their strengths and not focus on their weakness .
Hence , when they are contributing to the society by giving valuable lessons to the younger generation , the best that we can repay them is in monetary value to allow them to get by in this expensive and fast-paced world that we live in .
As they grow older , we must not leave them  .
Instead we must them get through with just a little guidance to bring them alongside the  .
There is much that an elder would be able to give their advice on .
In conclusion , elders have so much that we can learn from and they are indeed a precious human resource in a country .
instead of looking at them in a negative light and saying that they are of no use ,  let's make use of their strength in terms of experience and knowledge to help the younger generation and advice them more .
Therefore the government should  try its best to support them  , in all aspect of their lives , emotionally , physically and mentally .
Research shows that of people aged 70 years , 8 .6% report problems with both hearing and seeing" .
This vision impairments and hearing loss can be a serious problem to the elderly as they may lead to misunderstanding in communication .
Elderly who suffer from vision and hearing loss will find difficulties in making a phone call , listening to voice mail , and using text messages with cell phones .
However , the development in technology has eventually overcome such problems .
In 2006 , an electronics brand , Samsung , launched its Jitterbug J , an excellent cell phone for the elderly .
This gadget provides the elderly a simple way in making phone calls and using text messages .
Jitterbug cell phone suits the elderly as it has loud and clear sound as well as large and brief on-screen text .
A satisfied customer , MakenzieB , purchased a Jitterbug for her 62-year-old mother .
Her mother absolutely loves it and could easily understand how to use it .
She can easily call her family and check voicemail by herself .
Technology development has also helped the elderly with smell problems .
A statistic from National Institutes of Health shows that "More than 2 million adults have disorders of smell" .
These problems are more common in elderly because the sense of smell changes as people age .
When sense of smell changes , elder people will lose the ability to detect smoke , leaking gas , or airborne pollutants and toxins .
Thus , they will need warning devices to detect smoke and carbon dioxide .
A device called The Shake-Up Alarm is a solution to this problem .
The Shake-Up Alarm contains  two parts: smoke detector and signaller .
When smoke is  detected , the smoke detector will transmit signals to two receivers which are a bed vibrator and a strobe light .
The bed vibrator can be placed under a pillow or mattress .
Thus , the vibrator will alert the owner even when he falls asleep .
The second receiver , which is a strobe light , will flash 60 times per minute .
The other illness that usually attacks elderly is memory loss .
According to a mid-March story from HealthDay , "5 .4 million Americans over 70 have memory loss that affects their daily lives" .
One problem that occurs as an effect of memory loss is a difficulty to manage a strict schedule of numerous prescription drugs .
Many pills look similar and there are different instructions for taking each of them .
Thus , it will be a big problem for the elderly with memory loss to remember the instructions of each pill .
However , there is a device called Med-eMonitor which can help ease such burden .
Med-eMonitor is a pill organizer which functions as medication separator and system reminder .
This device also shows on-screen instructions which will help elderly take the drug with proper dosage and schedule .
Another device that can help elderly with memory loss is Mnemonic .
Mnemonic is a wrist-wrapped device that reminds the owner about important events or meetings .
It has a special feature which is built-in accelerometer which will keep the display on top no matter which direction it is rotated .
In conclusion , every person will face the aging process and as a result , various diseases such as vision and hearing loss , smell problems , and memory loss are likely to attack as they age .
After all , nowadays research and development in technology has eventually provided a variety of gadgets that suit the elderly and help them handle the aging process .
Thus , elderly will feel convenient to do their daily activities and live independently .
Firstly , new science researches and discoveries are regularly annouced and the eldly can follow the suggestions given by the researches .
e training can help ease senescence , especially to women .
(Stein , 2008) "The lack of physical activity plays a big rolee eldly with strong muscles are less likely to fallscientificffer bad consequences .
In fact , we keep hearing health tips from the news broadcast or RSS feeds such as healthy recipes , aerobic exercise and Yoga .
These are the practical summaries of the science researches and discoveries .
Secondly , uesscientifichresearchinventions have also convenienced the eldly a loelderly is not unsual that the eldly has problems with their body like loss of senses .
Technologies like Hearing Aid may be old news to us; however , a new inventiotn enables the blind to see .
That is , the device converts what its footage captures to electronic signals , which are transmitted to the tongue .
('Electric lollipop' givielderlyght to blind , 2009) "They cannot necessarily read a book but they can read a sign" , said by the development company .
The blind are able toin rough perception of their surroundings with the "eye" and get independent from their familiesscientifichresearchlind discoveryheir family attendants , who now have more time with their work , which is conducive to the society's productivity .
bea roughThirdly , social policies like CPF (Central Providentbeen convenient to the elderlye the financial support of thelderlylhaveCPF is a policy to make people save a portion of their salaries wThe Hearingey are economically active .
With CPF , the einventionmoney for life after retirement without extra financial help from the government , thus the implementation of CPF alleviate the government's finaest of the society since they do not have to pay for the expenditures othe eldly after retirement .
Critics of science , technologies and social policies' alleviation on aging population argue that the eldly couelderlyve a satisfatory lifehelpterms of material; however , it is hard for them to be happy since the society does not favor old people who do not fit its fast pace .
This is not necessarily true .
It is because there are communities which welcome talleviateses who are healthy , independent and rich in time , and they are becoming more popular and "recruited" by the communities since traditionally , women have provided much of the voluntary work but now more of them have joined the work force .
(A . K .
Rose . , UC Berkeley and NBER) Retirees in this way have much more chances to communicate and probably they would not feel lonely .
In conclusion , science discovries ease the aging process by educating the eldly what is healthy; technological inventions do this in ways to heal the sick , injured and even disabled; finally , social policies help the eldly in finance to secure their peaceful eldly life .
A research conducted by The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States showed that " [1]about 80% of the population aged 65 and above has at least one chronic health condition , and 50% has at least two" .
Some of the most common chronic health problems which the elderly suffers from are arthritis , heart disease , and cancer .
These diseases often decrease the quality of life of the elderly because they cause the elderly to lose their ability to live a normal life as they used to live .
However , some recent medical inventions give us promising solutions to these health problems related to aging and hence ease the aging process .
[2]Almost 43 million adults in the United States suffer from arthritis .
One of the most common types of arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis .
Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many tissues and organ but mostly attacks the small joints .
The disease disables the elderly from doing their normal activities because it causes the joints to become swollen and limits their movements .
Moreover , arthritis and related conditions are the leading cause of disability in the United States .
[3]The most frequently affected joints in the hand are finger joints .
This fact is quite worrying since fingers are the most frequently used part of a human hand .
Nevertheless , researchers at Royal Hampshire County Hospital have invented [4] "a particular type of silver ring splints worn on fingers which is effective in controlling hyperextension deformity of finger joints , which is common in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis" .
This new treatment method replaced the old massive plastic rings which were worn to stabilize the joints .
Many patients who have received the new silver ring treatment commented that [5] "the silver rings look better than the old bulky ones .
They are also more durable and stronger ."
[6] Heart disease makes up more than 30% of deaths in American adults aged 65 and above caused by chronic disease , making it the disease which kills most elderly .
The most fatal symptom of heart disease is heart attack .
When heart attack occurs , blood supply to part of the heart is interrupted , causing some heart muscle cells to die .
This often causes severe heart failure because the heart muscle cells cannot regenerate themselves due to the absence of myoblasts , which are the cells forming muscle cells .
In the past , these dead cells caused by a heart attack could not be replaced .
But today , thanks to a new heart  treatment called "Heart Myoblast Cell Injection" , heart attack victims can get their healthy heart muscle cells back .
[7] In this new treatment method , myoblast cells are extracted from the heart  patient's own thigh muscles .
After that , the cells are cultured in the lab then injected to the heart of the patient .
Research show that new tissue formation and improvement in the heart function of the patients were found after this treatment .
The lead researcher of this treatment at the Arizona Heart Institute , Nabil Dib , says , "Through this heart  treatment we can regenerate a scar tissue caused by a heart attack , which is the opposite of what we learnt in medical school ."
[8] While heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the elderly , cancer comes second .
[9] In the United States , Lung cancer kills more people than other cancers .
The traditional method to cure lung cancer in a patient is by surgery or radiotherapy which is given five days a week for six to seven weeks .
Radiotherapy process can be burdensome because of its frequency , especially for those who do not live in cities with equipped hospitals .
However , cancer specialists from Temple University have found a new method called Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) .
[10] Unlike the ordinary radiotherapy , SBRT can be stopped after three to eight treatments .
Another advantage of SBRT is it can double the survival rates of early stage patients .
The survival rates of SBRT are as high as surgical methods , which some patients cannot have because of their conditions or refuse to have .
[11] Experts are very optimistic that this new treatment can replace the old radiotherapy and surgery .
Curtis Miyamoto , M .D . , chair and professor of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Temple University School of Medicine said that "With the success of this technique , we're now questioning whether we'll even be doing surgeries on these patients in the future ."
[12] Colorectal cancer is the second  cancer-related killer in the United States after lung cancer .
Most  colorectal cancer patients are elderly because the possibility of having colorectal cancer increases with age .
Chemotherapy is often recommended to cure the disease depending on the patient's condition .
The problem is , most elderly patients are not as fit enough as younger patients to stand chemotherapy .
Nevertheless , some scientists from The United Kingdom have found a vaccine called TroVax which is able to cure kidney and bowel cancer .
This includes colorectal cancer .
The research on the vaccine showed that "[13] One patient who was given the vaccine has seen his tumour disappear totally  .
Another two have seen their tumours reduce in size , and in three people the cancer has been stopped in its tracks .
50 patients have had the vaccine and 95 per cent of those that can be evaluated have had an 'anti-tumour response" .
Unlike chemotherapy which can cause depression of the bodies immune system because it kills not only bad cancer cells but also good cells which contribute to the body's immunity , this vaccine works in a totally different way .
The vaccine improves the body's immune system to fight a particular disease which in this case is colorectal cancer
Recent inventions offer medical solutions to the elderly suffering from chronic medical conditions such as arthritis , heart disease , and lung cancer .
These inventions help the elderly to live a healthier life .
By living a healthier life , the elderly people can live their days more normally and hence this will help them in the aging process .
Equally importthe layoutighting is another concern about the elder's health , especially the eyes .
, light should be used carefully for eye health .
Such as rliving spaceghwith nong with controlentry pointsnses is also necessary to increase the illuminopening intoor eye protection , and glare should be avoided by choosing the material of the wall , ceiling and mirror to fight against cataracts .
On the other hand , getting enough exposure to daylight can fight against osteoporosis and insomnia .
The best solution is to gain daylight through the ccaused by fallingg .
With the daylight sustained , skin would produce vitamin D more easily , which is critical for strong bones and teeth .
And a study by Gloth (1995) suggests that half of the elder people are under the vitamin D levels .
Furthermore , since old people stay at home for the most of the time , adequate sunlight would help them Psychologistsle of the universityght Texashus prevent them from sleep disorders .
having sleepAlthough some peoplis lightingist that it is bewith regard to the health of the elderlycare of the old or provide asylums for them , and therefore there is no need to redesign their homes , they fail to consider the fees for the care and the feeling of the old .
Firstly , since most ofthe glareold do save their pension for the health care and do not want give their children too much burden .
Secondly , since old people have already developed a strong sentihelp fightfor their house , they do not want to move .
Furthermore , home care can also be done by providing welfare and consultation by government agencies at a lower cost to alleviate the solitude and physical burden of the dependent elderly , which is suggested by Claude (1993elderly"ahave deficient 
andIn conclusion , redesigning homes such as ordering the layout and adjusting the light for the old can ease the aging process in terms of cutting the home accidents , facilitating those who have physical problemtheirnd protecting feelingss and boelderly sSincemmended tthemde home hospitality and contation in the mean time to guto burden their childreneaand2)
The aging process usually comes with several phenomena such as bad vision , bad hearing , backache , hair loss , etc .
much progress have been made in science , especially medicine , to provide the elderly with convenient tools for their lives .
For example , dealing with bad vision , which is very popular among people above 60 , we now have special lenses and eye drops , together with traditional magnifiers which are being improved more and more to help the elderly with their eyesight , furthermore special hearing-aids can do a very good work in reinforcing the hearing ability .
In terms of medicine , we also have skin cream to prevent wrinkles , anti hair loss drugs , special medicine for osteoporosis , heart disease , etc .
to provide different ways to ease the aging process .
In addition , technology has also brought to the elderly many convenient tools to help them to be independent in their lives .
Nowadays many houses are equipped with intercom doorbell to help "respond to visitors without having to rush or feel panicky" (1) , thus preventing them from falling .
Electric appliances are accompanied with remote controls which are easy to use and remember so that the elderly can flick through television channels or turn on and off lights and fans themselves .
What's more , wheelchairs now do not need physical strength to move , but thanks to the controls with some different-color buttons , the elderly can use an electric wheelchair and skillfully direct them to wherever they want within the house and around the neighbourhood .
For children working at offices who cannot keep their eyes on their old parents , they can install the webcam system around the house to watch over the parents while still doing their job .
Perhaps the most modern tool for the elderly that has been invented is robots , which have been brought from factories to home to do house chores .
They can do various things and multi-task and thus help the elderly a lot in the house .
For example , the robot named Domo is programmed to not only hold cans and tins but also identify other food with different shapes and quickly find an desired object to accompany the elderly whenever they need(2) .
Or in Japan , where nearly a quarter of the population is at age 65 and above , robots are being used very effectively to help lift the elderly or support them in moving .
Some of them can also respond to oral commands such as "forward" , "back" , "right" , "left"(3) , very convenient for the elderly because they often struggle to remember the buttons and the functions to run a machine .
Who says computers are just for teenagers and the youth ?
With significant advances in information and technology , today the elderly can also use the Internet to join some virtual communities especially designed for them to meet their peers and talk about many things with one another instead of staying alone all day in the house waiting for their children to come home after work .
Singapore recently has launched an Internet portal "I Not Old" ({www .inotold .com}) especially for the elderly , "to provide them with social platforms , games and information"(4) .
In America , a survey has been conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation to find that one third of seniors above 60 and two-thirds of people between 50 and 64 get access to the Internet .
What are they looking for ?
They search healthcare , such as how to consult a doctor online without having to leave home , or drug information , etc .
(4)
In conclusion , the elderly nowadays are being helped a lot with different advances in technology , to become more and more independent and to live on their own .
We now can feel safe to leave home on our business and leave them at home , knowing that they are supported and equipped with all the things they need .
And with the rapid development in technology , we know that in the near future , many more things will be invented for our parents .
People today have to face an extremely serious problem of an reasons for an aging  population .
According to a definition on the Wikipedia website , the aging population ,  are usually migration , longer life expectancy , and decreased birth rate , which increase  the number and proportion of the older people in the society .
Since  , aging population has been dramatically influencing various fields in people lives such as economics , healthcare system , and social policy , many research , development and policies have been proposed to help to ease this process .
Firstly , for a graying population around the world , lots of policies have been applied to control the birth and death rate or to balance the age structure .
One of the most possibly effective ways is the "two child" population policy in Shanghai , a big city in China .
The Shanghai Daily says about 22% of the population is over 60 years old .
additionally , for a long time , the Chinese population was controlled by a "one child" policy .
As a result , an increased aging population has developed  .
Therefore , "a "two child" policy can relax this problem and boost a higher birth rate , with a government campaign that encourages couples to have a second child .
However , due to a lack of financial incentives , there is still no official announcement with regard to this .
Secondly , to cope with the aging process , an increase in healthcare demand can be organized by improving system performance , redesigning service delivery , support informal caregivers , and shift demographic parameters .
Obviously , the older people use more healthcare than young people .
Nevertheless , health costs are independent of the age structure , which defines the distribution of predetermined expenditures .
Particularly , in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) , aging population does not have any connections to health expenditure as a part of GDP .
For example , the over-65-year-old Swedish made up 17 .3% in 2000 , but Sweden just spent 8 .6% GDP on health .
The former in Australia was 12 .7% , and the latter was 9 .3% , figured in 2001 and 2002 .
Thirdly , as  mentioned in "A graying world" by Peter Peterson , late retirement not only solves the employment problem , but also lightens the financial burden on the young .
In countries with a limited labour force , taking advantage of experienced , stable employers is very important , as it also contributes to the family income and saves  training cost .
Moreover , providing work to the older people helps them from being bored , alone , and maybe  depressed .
Therefore , the younger people who are the breadwinners of the family are more relaxed and under less pressure , so their work will be more efficient but less stressful .
First , technological inventions provide solution to the vision problem that comes with aging , presbyopia .
The aged may choose to wear optical lenses for presbyopia , and current research has raised this lens technology to a new height .
For example Bifocal Contact Lens has been invented recently .
(Pizzo & Segre , 2008) Each piece of this kind of lens is divided into two parts with different focus .
This enable the presbyopputting it ton a , usually the aged , to see both far objects and near objects clearly without changing lens .
Moreover , this kind of contact lens rides on the eyeball but does not roll together with the eyeball .
This means , when the patient look down , he or she can use the lower part of the lens to read and use the upper part of the lenwhich is being currently done to look at distant objects .
Besides , the aged may also choose to carry a portable digital magnifier which takes picture behind the device , magnifies it to desired clearness and show it on the screen such as PocketViewer .
(HumanWare Group , 2009) With these technological inventions , the aged may be able to read and write like young people .
Hence , the pressure of aging process is reduced .
Second , technological inventions provide health condition monitoring for the elderly in order that they may be able to arrange their activities accordingly and get treatment in time .
This is enablethe technology of this lensif portable , user-friendly and accurate devices which works as sphygmomanometer , glucometer or electrocardiograph .
For example , one hospital in Qindao , China is providing a 24 hour heart electrocardiogram monitoring service to the aged .
(Surprising !
Heart can be monitored 24 hours a day , 2008) People rlensesving this service will carry a newly invented device which captures a persons heart electrocardiogram and sends it to the hospital thlooksh a mobile phone network in real time .
These information is further recorded and processed by the server in the hospital .
The server can recognize abnormal patterns of the electrocardiogram and send warnings accordingly to the doca picturereover , this service system allows pa desired to get consultshowsn from doctor using the device whenever they fell unwell .
With technological invents like this , it is likely that the aged will enjoy a healthier and longer life which , eased the agithe agingocess .
Third , technological inventions provides help for the aged who is incapable or inconvenient to walk on himself or herself .
With the decline of muscle and motor nerve , the aged tends to have difficulty in walking and doing physical activities .
To cope with this problem , technological inventions use two main method: either assist and enhance the ability of weak limbs or provide alternative transport .
For example , Cyberdyne Inc . in Japan introduces a rSankai , 2009) This robotic suit is driven by battery and can worn by a person .
It detects bio-signal on a person's skin , analyzes the signal to figure out the person's movement and gives suThis at proper place with proper power .
In this way , a person's weak limbs can be enhanced .
Another example is wheelchair , which gives the aged an alternative way to 'walk' .
New technological inventions such as Topchair even allow wheelchair to climb stairs .
This whdoctorsir from France is able to climb feelnd go down stairs as well asinventions in a speed greater then 35km/h while it only needs one or two finger to operawhich will ease ,Stlimbing wheelchair , 2008) With the help of this kind of technological inventions , the mobility problem of the aged is eased .
In this way , the process of aging is eased by technological inventions .

Technology has improved our daily life a lot .
It impacts  our work , leisure and home .
when compared with the past , today , everything can be done easily with the aid of technology .
As the speed of  technology grows , people in the society age as well .
Recently , the aging population has been a a cause of concern for governments and society .
By 2050 , many people in the first world countries will reach 51 .
(1) In order to ease the global aging process , people have begun using technology with the hope of helping the aging population .
Internet and automated gadgets are some of the technology that were used  a few years ago to help the elderly .
Today , the internet has become so common in  society it has beingused to help the aging population .
People have started to create a link from the elderly to the their family members .
For example , in the United State some family members actually give their elderly a GPS device which can help to keep track of their location  anywhere and at any time .
As people get older , the chances of them getting lost are much  higher and with the help of a GPS device , their loved ones can easily find out their current location when they get lost .
Another way of helping the aging population are automated gadgets .
With the automated gadgets , it can help to take care or monitor the elderly especially when they are alone .
An example would be the Med-eMonitor , invented by InforMedix , which acts as a medicine reminder for the elderly .
This gadget actually is just about the size of a VCR tape and operates on a rechargeable battery which can last for two weeks .
Inside this gadget , are many compartments that can help to separate the medication and also allows users to set a date and time .
It also comes with a reminder system , on-screen instruction and a line of communication .
When the time has come for medication , the gadget will play a musical chime that will alert the elderly .
When the user press on the button a LCD screen will display the instruction for taking the drugs , for example , some drugs are to be taken before meal or with a empty stomach .
If the musical chime is not responded to by the elderly and the medication is not taken , the gadget will place a phone call to the family members to inform them .
(2)
Besides using internet and automated gadgets individually , people have also combine them as one device .
In the United State there are devices that can also help to connect the elderly to the doctor without having them to go to the hospital everyday .
For example , the elderly with Cardiovascular diseases can be attached  with an intelligent small device which is called a Chronicle system in their body to monitor their "heart rate , physical activity , body temperature and right ventricular (RV) pressure in them ."
(3) the results gathered by the device are transmitted to the doctors through a remote monitoring so that their health can be monitored even if they are at home or in the hospital .
Using internet and automated gadgets have helped to ease the aging process a lot .
Both the elderly and their family members can receive many benefits from technology .
As time passes , our aging population grows and so does our technology .
But as technology grows , it can provide us with more inventions that can help to ease the aging population process .
"We have an ageing population and the demand for elective surgery continues to increase , which provides us with a real challenge" .
(1) This famous quote by Australian politician Michael Wright not only illustrates one of the problems the government has to deal with an the aging population but also points to the pressure the aging population place on the medical system .
It appears that aging population has become the biggest and common concern for countries all over the world , especially those in Europe and Japan .
Many researchers have recently stated:" To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process" .
From my point of view , supported by many reliable online articles , I agree with the claim above .
The diverse obstacles associated with an an aging population creates lots of pressure , ranging not only from medical services but also to the education system too .
For instance: A survey conducted in British Columbia on the impact of aging population on social services shows that as the average age of citizens increases , so does the health care cost per capita .
(2) The government has to reserve a greater portion of the budget for taking care of the aged because they are more likely to suffer from ailments that almost always occur with old age (such as: diabetes , osteomalacia . . .)  .
Or let's take education as an example: when the majority of the population is old people , which means that the average age of a student in the university will increase .
Students tend to stay in the colleges longer and as a result , the cost on education will rise significantly .
It's also predicted that the cost on education in British Columbia will rise 40% between the period 1989/1990 and 2015/2016 .

On the other hand , the scientists keep giving out new technological inventions to help the elderly feel more comfortable and content with their ordinary life .
They present wireless and mini hearing aids to enhance the listening ability of  elderly as well as artificial limbs for them or walking sticks to aid them standing and walking around .More specifically , designed elevators used for the elderly  in wheelchairs are everywhere , which plays an important role in helping them to access higher levels in tall buildings .
The older they get , the worse their body organs function , which leads to the situation that they really need some help from inventors to retain their original life .
Without these gadgets and assisting tools , now they would suffer numerous and tremendous difficulties in communicating with other people or going around as well .
The next question that needs to be debated is: "How much money should the government spend on  medical care for the elderly ?" .
In my opinion , the government should use much more money towards taking care of the elderly  due to the following : Firstly , the aged are citizens who have contributed a lot of money to the National Treasury through compulsory taxes like land-tax , income tax . . .  therefore they deserve receiving more care from the authorities .
Secondly , as long as you take care of the elderly well , the average longevity of the citizens will rise significantly .
As far as we are concerned , many economists evaluate the wealth and development of a country not only by its wealth , but also on how the average longevity of its citizens is .
In conclusion , it's unassailable that: To some extent , current research have helped ease the aging process .
This mission not only lies on the scientists' hands but also require some support from the society in general , and the government in particular .
If the government reserve more money on the medical care for the elderly , absolutely they'll be more satisfied with their life .
That's the best solution in comparison with other inventions from the scientists .
Disability affects some people .
Aging affects all people .
As we know , people are living longer today than they used to , and this is resulting in a much larger elderly population than before .
Also , as we grow in to adulthood , many things start to change in our life .
Aging is an unavoidable process , beginning at conception and ending with death .
The process does not proceed at a uniform rate all over the body .
As we age , the organ systems of individuals age at different rates .
Our body gradually slows down in early adult life .
So , current research and development or policies in particular fields of science and medicine have helped to ease the aging process .
Technology can help the elderly with their hearing problem and hearing impairment is one of the five most chronic conditions of aging .
According to research , it is estimated that one out of three people over age 64 has some hearing impairment; this increases to almost one out of two persons over the age of .
But , nowadays , there are many assistive devices available for persons with hearing impairment .
That is what technology is !
For example , vibrating alarms allow older people with hearing impairment to wake from vibration than by auditory alarm .
Also , door knock alert allows older people with hearing impairment to see a blinking light rather than hearing an auditory "knock" sound .
As we know ,  chronically ill patients need to check in with a health-care provider every day and answer questions about their current symptoms allow for immediate intervention .
So , numerous telehomecare devices have been developed to allow health-care providers the ability to manage follow-up care of the chronically ill .
This technology allows patients to sit in the comfort of their own homes while health-care providers conduct routine and comprehensive medical monitoring procedures in their offices .
One example of this type of technology is Aerotel's Medical Parameters Monitoring (MPM) devices , which allow data to be stored for immediate consultation and treatment , as well as for future reference .
Other than those technologies used in developing devices to aid old people's hearing and illness , home , as we know is a very "important" to the older people .
They need a comfortable home for their retired life .
So  , there is a new technology in our modern world now  , Well@home Telemanagement System from Patient care Technologies ,Inc .
This Well@home devices has an interactive function similar to a bank ATM .
This technology reminds patients to take their medication; instructs patients through text , illustrations , and the spoken word on what , when  , and how to make their medication; ask patients if they would like to learn more about their medication; provide administrative , side effect , and storage information to the patient  etc . , .
This will help the older people a lot so that they would not to be "thrown"nto the old folks home because of their disability at home .
As the world goes on , Technology has been applied to public transportation in the development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) that enhance older persons mobility by providing better information before and during a journey .
[1] Many of the age-related reduction in function that contribute to driving cessation can impede mobility independence when using public transportation systems , The application of technology within an ITS can support deficits in vision  , hearing  , cognition , and sensorinotor function .
Technology in itself is not the only panacea to solve the aging global population .
So , there should be improvement in every field of study and research to ease the aging population and to enhance the quality of life for a global population that will double in size by 2050 .
Since the birth of human beings , our ancestors have gone through the 4 stages of life , namely birth , aging , illness and death .
It is a process that began when we were first born .
It is inevitable that we will eventually become old and vulnerable to problems and diseases that are associatede with old age .
Therefore , there is a need to improve the life of the elderly in order to ease the aging process .
It is not unknown that Scientists have been researching while governments are constantly improving development and policies for the elderly .
The current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Firstly , modern medical research is able to treat and cure deadly diseases that we were incapable of previously .
With the current advances in medical technology , we are able to remedy and prevent diseases more effectively .
Previous generations had no knowledge of illnesses like diabetes , hypertension and high cholesterol which leads to more severe problems like heart attack and stroke .
With modern research , medicine have been produced to assist in treating the problems .
The findings were used for the prevention of these illnesses , thus the elderly who are more prone to these diseases are able to take more precaution with their health .
Secondly , More health care centers have been developed to cater for the elderly In fact we have access to medical , health care center within a kilometers of any housing estate .
For instance , presently mostmarkets or shopping malls will have at least one clinic in service as compared to the past where patients had to travel long distances in order to get basic treatment .
In addition , more hospitals are being built .
examples like Jurong General Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital will be built to provide medical services in Jurong and Yishun respectively .
These will provide more opportunities for treatment and shorten the traveling time in a time of emergency .
We can cure and treat everything easily and conveniently but it is always costly .
In fact not many people can afford long term medical treatment especially for elderly who have either retired or have savings that are not enough to cover the expenses .
But on the other hand , policies are made to engage the potential financial problems .
For example , Medisave is made compulsory for Singaporeans to contribute part of their income into saving for medical use .
A minimum balance of $15 000 is required in Medicsave to prevent premature depletion which will be needed for future medical needs , more precisely during old age .
Also benefits such as national medical subsidy schemes have been introduced to subsidise the medical cost for the elderly .
The Elderly are given a subsidy of $360 annually for chronic diseases like diabetes , hypertension and high cholesterol .
These policies make medical treatment more affordable and less taxing to the elderly .
To summarize , with the current medical research , development and polices made by  scientists and the government , it has definitely slowed and eased the aging process that everyone will experience .
Although our lifespan have significantly lengthened from 60 to 65 year to 75 to 85 years in developed countries .
However ageing will remain the same for today and will not change at least in our time .
Regardless of country , race , language or generation , staying young , healthy and active is the dream of every person in this world .
From the birth of mankind , we have been searching and trying all means and ways to ease or stop aging .
This process or searching and examining has never ended , ever after decades .
This is even  more obvious  in this century , where the standard of living of the generation X has improved compared to the past .
They have begun to realize that their life expectancy is now much longer than that of previous generations .
Therefore , the demand for anti aging products and treatments to restore health and beauty has grown significantly .
Men and woman past the age of 40 feel more empowered than ever to take control of their bodies and redefine the aging process .
To ease or slow down the aging process is to have the ability to lengthen the lifespan of our youthful healthy days .
As such , life extension is the main concept that most companies are engaging in to target aging issues .
These anti-aging promoters from various nutrition companies are promoting their own brand of nutrition , in the form of diets or supplements , to extend lifespan .
These products use different raw materials and food processing methods , which they claim  is safe and effective for consumption , after rounds of testing .
However , mostly they work and agree on the same common theory , which is the importance of keeping a stable blood sugar level , achieved in part by managing the glycemic indices of food choices .
[1] An example of the 2 diets with different approaches and with some support from scientific research is the Palaeolithic diet and Caloric restriction .
An alternative to the use of nutrition products to ease aging process is the research and development of Cosmetic interventions such as skin treatments and plastic surgery .
They are widely used to mask the effects of aging , although they do not actually affect lifespan .
Some of these surgeries include skin resurfacing , eyelid surgery and Botox treatments , cosmetic dental procedures and many more .
In addition , Anti-aging creams such as "Olay" and "Loreal" is also getting more popular and commonly use by both men and women .
These are mostly moisturiser based cosmetic skin care products marketed with the promise of making the consumer look younger by reducing visible wrinkles , expression lines , blemishes , pigmentation changes , discolouration and other environmentally (especially from the sun) related conditions of the skin .
[2] Despite great demand , many such products and treatments have not proved to give lasting or major positive effects .
However , it is on the rise at many age levels and has been embraced by many age groups including teenagers .
Another issue connected with the aging process is the terror of memory loss .
According to one  research conducted by the Natural Marketing Institute (NMI) [3] , memory loss and losing brain capacity is the biggest fear of the aging baby boomer population .
Their research had shown that 52 percent of females and 36 percent of the males in United States has memory loss and losing brain capacity as their biggest fear .
Hence , research on means to prevent memory loss and increase brain capacity is essential and important in helping to ease the aging setbacks .
Currently in the market , thereare brain supplements such as "Prevagen" and "Essential Youth" [4]; products which claims to have remarkable formulas , which can help old people look younger , feel better , think faster , remember more clearly , thus enjoy their life again  .This is out in display in all corners of the shopping and healthcare centre .
These products were advertised with the support from TV artists and provide documentation testing from scientists .
When it comes to matters related to healthcare , research is never ending .
Scientists have also carried other studies and proposed other strategies of life extension .
Some examples will be the studies of Cloning and body part replacement technology .
They suggest that therapeutic cloning and stem cell research could one day provide a way to generate cells , body parts , or even entire bodies (generally referred to as reproductive cloning) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient .
Others suggest Cryonics [5] , which is the low-temperature preservation of humans and animals that can no longer be sustained by contemporary medicine until resuscitation may be possible in the future .
However , these 2 researches involve debatable points in ethics and religion which need to be resolved .
Ethical and theological opinions of cloning and cryonics tend to pivot on the issue of whether this method is regarded as interment or medicine .
Aging is a process which cannot be stopped and it is going to be a much more critical  issue for mankind in the next decade , while the ratio of working adult and to the old is further reduced to one-one .
It is a problem that every country is facing , and if it is not properly dealt with , it will hold back the country's development and be an economic hindrance .
As such , in conclusion , the researches in medicines and other field such as technology and social policy is one of the  most importance issues currently .
With education , detail and proper planning now it will help to ease numerous problems that the country and family will face as the population ages .
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics (2008) ,  life expectancy in Singapore continues to increase .
The report shows  that the life expectancy of people is increasing with time  , which implies that the aging process is becoming  than before .
why if this tendency happening now ?
There are various fields contributing to this tendency , including science , technology , economics , government policies , medicine and psychology .
It can be argued that the development of technology plays an important role in this .
There are two kinds of technology that contribute a lot to the increase in the life expectancy of people .
They are information technology and technological tools .
When it comes to  information technology , every young person should be familiar with it .
However , it seems that information technology is not very popular among the old .
Thus , it seems that  information technology does not help the adults a lot .
The main reason is that the tools are quite hard for the old to handle .
For example , the buttons on a mobile and the words on the screen are too smalll so the old cannot read  .
However , the producers are trying to produce  products particularly for the old .
The products are cheap and the word is big enough and  These tools are suitable for the old and they are quite popular among the old .
With these tools , for example mobile phones , the old can get in touch with their sons or daughters easily .
In this way , the old can chat with their children when they miss their children and ask for help when they are in danger .
Thus , these tools will  help them both physically and mentally .
According to the above analysis , there is no doubt that information technology helps a lot to ease the aging process .
How do technological inventions help to ease the aging process ?
According to the 'loss of hearing ability ,' website , there is a decline in the ability to taste salt and bitter foods , whereas sweet and sour are much less affected .
There is also a  reduction of the thymus gland to 5-10% of its original mass by age 50 .
From this , it can bee seen that when people become old , the organs and tissues will not work as well as before .
However , with the help of some technological inventions , the old can overcome these weaknesses .
There are a lot of quite useful inventions for the old .
For example , there is a walking stick that can test the heart rate and blood pressure of the people using it .
If the walking stick finds anything wrong , it will send a message to a healthcare center and the center will get the information of where the person is and send a nurse to take of them .
In this way , , the health of the old  and this will  ease the aging process .
There are also hearing aids to help old people listen clearly and electronic wheelchairs to help old people go out conveniently .
From the above , , it can be concluded that technological inventions help to ease the aging process . 
In conclusion , with the development of technology , the aging process will become slower .
Technology really helps the old a lot in easing the aging process .
Hopefully , the elderly will benefit  from the fast developing  technology .
Technology has vastly improved during the past century  and made life easier for the elderly around the world .
In the case of  developments in terms of Architecture , this has been true thus far .
In our current society , one which faces a graying population , Architecture has played an active role in creating a safe and greatly accessible environment for the elderly .
With better knowledge in Architecture , homes and places outside home are made user-friendly for the elderly
Moving around at a speed and mobility which they had decades ago was not possible , but Architecture has changed our homes in a manner which assured that the elderly can at least move around without facing many  difficulties .
Homes that are user-friendly to the elderly have features that allow the elderly to move around easily .
One such feature is having homes with only one floor built .
Another  such feature will be homes with wider corridors .
Both of the mentioned features allow greater mobility for wheelchair bound elderly or elderly who move around with the help of a walking stick .
The elderly have always been stereotyped as people who are prone to slipping and injuring themselves .
To ease such worries of the younger generation , developments in Architecture have the means to solve such problems .
In areas where the floors tend to be wet , such as the toilet , anti-slip tiles can be installed to induce greater friction even when the floors are wet .
Furthermore , grab bars can be mounted to the walls of the toilet to aid the elderly in sitting down or standing up .
In parts of the home where a staircase must inevitably be built , handrails or barristers can be built for support if the elderly wish to climb the stairs .
As the number of elderly that live alone rises , the government has seen the need to provide special housing for them .
In terms of Singapore , the government has decided to develop blocks of rental 1-room flats which have lifts that stop on every floor , an alert alarm to call for help in the event of emergency  , and support hand bars in the toilets and along common corridors to facilitate mobility of the elderly .
For the elderly who are able to better support themselves , they can choose to stay in rental flats or studio flats .
Besides homes , Architecture has made the community more user-friendly for the elderly .
New shopping centres such as Orchard Centre and Ion Orchard have elderly-friendly facilities such as ramps or ground floor entrances toilets for the disabled which are also user-friendly for the elderly .
At City Link , there are machines installed to maneuver wheelchairs up and down the stairs .
Architecture has raised the standards of living up to a point where even the elderly that have low mobility are able to move around as they wish .
Certainly , developments in the field of Architecture have helped to ease aging process .
Victor Hugo , poet and novelist , once said that "Forty is the old age of youth; fifty the youth of old age"[1] .
Old age is therefore not the end of our life but a start .
There are many physical and mental ailments that often arise from aging , such as brain degeneration , discrimination from the public , social isolation and no sense of direction in life .
To reduce the negative impact of the aging process , it is therefore important to create a role model for the elderly , to eliminate ageism in the society ,  and ito improve detection of depression and encourage lifelong learning .
Creating a positive image of the elderly is necessary to eliminate the adverse stereotypes on elderly .
For example , there is a controversy as to why many people believe that when we were young and forgetful , the reason for forgetfulness is because we had too much stuff on our mind .
However , when we are old and forgetful , we are more likely to accept memory loss as part of aging .
Memory loss is often equated with growing old and deemed inevitable .
However , this is a fallacy and believing in it will likely to lead to a negative self-image of oneself .
Recent research has suggested that "negative stereotypes highlighting the detrimental effect of aging on memory can negatively affect memory performance among older adults" (Andreoletti & Lachman , 2004)[2] .
Fighting ageism is essential to ease the aging process of our society .
One way of fighting ageism is educating the people about the adverse effects of old aged stereotyping  .
In a study done by Levy and her colleague , older individuals with a more positive self-perception of aging  lived 7 .5 years longer than those with less positive self-perception of aging[3] .
Another common problem of aging is depression among the elderly .
As a person ages , the signs of depression are much more varied than at younger ages .
[4] This is turn makes it harder to detect .
Therefore a possible solution is to increase the number of doctoral-level trained geropsychologists (Psychologists for the elderly) and make age-related information more available to researchers , practitioners and students to help improve  detection and treatment .
A Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) Program was setup in 2002 to provide grants to accredited doctoral , internship and postdoctoral programs .
In a survey done in 2008 , the GPE Program has doubled the number of students who are trained to provide mental and behavioral health services 
Critics of this position feel that people should not be pressured to participate in lifelong learning  "for the good of society" .
[6] However , this is  as there are also many benefits that lifelong learning can  .
Engaging in lifelong learning can help build our body , mind and spirit to be ready for future challenges .
In a book "Learning Later , Living Greater" co written by Nancy Merz Nordstrom and Jon F .Merz , the authors highlighted the benefits presented with supporting case studies on lifelong learning .
Having a positive image for the elderly , effectively combating ageism , and promoting a depression-free and lifelong learning society have contributed to ease the aging process .
The idea that old age is not an end should be embraced . . After all , as George Burns , an American comedian once said  , "You can't help getting older , but you don't have to get old" .
[7]
The world's population underwent rapid growth in the 1950s and 60s .
This was the period of the post-war 'baby boom' as there was peace and stability .
Today , these 'baby boomers' form the majority of our population .
It is expected that by 2030 , about nineteen percent of the world's population will be over the age of sixty-five .
Indeed , this illustrates a concern for an ageing population .
However taking a look around us today , current research , development and various policies have evolved to an extent large enough to dismiss  concerns about a greying population .
These measures and policies  have greatly aided the elderly with their ageing process .
This is especially so in the area of social policies , namely government grants and healthcare benefits .
Considering the aspect of government subsidies and grants , firstly , the local government has done much to introduce various measures to help lessen the economical load on the elderly .
SFor example , the Grandparent Caregiver Relief' policy grants married couples an income tax relief of $3000 if a grandparent is helping the couple take care of their child .
The grandparent caregiver relief encourages three generations to live under one roof .
In this manner , the elderly are in turn taken care of by the younger generation , easing their ageing process .
Secondly , there are also public housing schemes .
First-time buyers of government flats can get a housing grant if they purchase a flat in the area where their parents live .
Even if the elderly are not living with their children in this instance , they are still within an accessible vicinity of their children .
This allows the older folks to easily stay connected with their family as visiting is now made convenient .
The aged today also possess another advantage in the form of Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents .
This scheme allows parents to get the court's help to seek financial support from their children who are capable of supporting them , but are not doing so .
The parents , however , must be incapable of supporting themselves financially and be over sixty years old .
The above mentioned law contributes to the easing of the ageing process by creating a dependency between the younger generation in families with their elders .
Other social policies established to help ease the ageing process include the Central Provident Fund .
This comes across as forced savings where members can withdraw their savings on reaching the age of fifty-five years , leaving a minimum sum in their retirement account .
From the age of sixty-two , members receive a monthly sum from their retirement account , ensuring they still have money left to fund their old age .
This social policy has helped many to remain self-sufficient in their elderly years .
Also , this has achieved the reduction of elder dependency by encouraging later retirement and longer working lives .
Such is an example of raising the eligibility age for public pensions and government incentives .
At the same time , when people work longer , they will be able to accumulate more wealth which they could use to support themselves in their old age .
In the area of healthcare policies , there are a handful of available measures which have essentially helped ease the ageing process .
Firstly , one such example is the Medisave fund , whereby a portion from a member's central provident fund is channelled into their medisave account where the money can be used to pay for hospital bills and certain medical treatments which are expensive .
This measure curbs elderly people's worry of escalating healthcare costs , which they find themselves more liable for in their older years .
Secondly , direct subsidies are given to government hospitals , polyclinics and some nursing homes for the elderly to ensure that basic healthcare services are made available for all Singaporean senior citizens .
The ageing process is made easier as worry about health issues and expenses are greatly reduced .
As illustrated , currently , many social policies exist which have become widely available .
These policies cater to the varying needs of the ageing population be it in financial terms or healthcare .
Today , the concerns involved with the ageing process  and a majority of people's concerns about a greying population have been dismissed .
The elderly are greatly aided with their ageing process through government grants , healthcare benefits and many other social policies made available to them to be easily utilised .
People today are able to  ease the aging process because of current research and development .
One area of focus is on psychology .
In psychology studies , scientists analysed human mental functions and behaviours and came out with solutions to help the elderly ease their process of aging .
[1]
Through research , psychologists found out that elderly people get depressed easily .
This is mainly due to ageism .
For instance , in the work place , some young adults develop prejudice and discrimination against the older people because they feel that the elderly are less efficient and no longer productive .
Therefore , the aging process  can be eased by helping the elderly develop a positive attitude towards life .
The elderly tend to think that they are incompetent and useless as they no longer contribute to society .
Firstly , life long learning  is emphasized to help them .
They can upgrade their skills by taking up enrichment courses like computer classes .
At the end of the course , a certificate will be awarded to them if they have successfully attained the skill .
This can boost their confidence in securing a .
Secondly , "a community work approach can change old people from passive clients into active and empowered individuals with a positive self-image ."
[2] According to one study , 20-25 percent of the elderly in nursing homes are clinically depressed .
[5] They often feel lonely and helpless as they have no one to confide in .
Now many community service clubs like NUS CSC have gathered volunteers to visit these elderly at least once a week .
In this way , the elderly can get involved in community activities which in turn make them look forward to the next session .
Thirdly , for retirees , they can not get used to the amount of free time they have .
Other than joining activities held in the community centres , they can also form groups with other elderly people to do morning exercises .
"People who are physically active in their leisure time aged more slowly than" people who live a sedentary life .
[3] .
Exercise can help them to improve blood circulation , bone strength and immune system functionsand this makes them look and feel younger . 
On the other hand , critics feel that these solutions can only help the elderly to a certain extent .
It only eases aging temporarily .
However , it is not true .
Easing the aging process is just about making them feel better .
As long as the elderly are engaged in their busy lives , they will actually feel not much different from the young ones .
For retired elderly , they may even feel better as there is no stress from work .
The saying goes: "You're only as old as you feel" .
The solutions from current research and development can help elderly people to feel young and create a positive attitude towards life , and to a large extent help to ease aging .
Caring for the oldcontroversial topic has been put forward .
It is about whether public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
As far as I am concerned , we should not limit the public spending on the aged .
The reasons are as follows: Firstly , put first thing first .
Secondly , cutting down public spending may arouse the complaints of the public .
Thirdly , limiting the public spending on the aged will surely increase the load over the youth .
Another reasonput first things first ,ithisnding may arouse the complaints of public , which in return , has an effect on the developas only of the country .

Most interesting thing is thatthe peoples are tended to vote for those who approve the usage of money on public spending .
So government should not lig in case of the complaints and indignation from the public .
Finally , limiting public spending will surely increase the complaints from the publicce they will share much more responsibilities of supporting the aged .

However , it is not true .

The aged shoulcan be talked .
Furthermore , the governmentublic spending may cause the complaints of the public and increase the load on the younger gerely more on limiting public spending is the wrongElderly peopleshould not limit public spending .
Aging populations are a global phenomenon which affects economic growth , sustainability within families and public spending .
It is caused by declining fertility and rising life expectancy .
It reduces economic growth as the size of the workforce shrinks as more elderly people leave the workforce and less people are recruited into the workforce  .
Another impact is the sustainability of families , because there are far less children supporting far more elderly .
This results in severe financial stress for the working population .
Public spending  is also stressed to provide pensions , building infrastructureand healthcare catered for the elderly .
Therefore , Public spending for the aged should be limited because 
It is impractical for public spending on the aged not to be limited .
If it is not limited , then it will increase indefinitely .
Either other areas of public spending have to receive less funding  , or taxes have to be raised to allow for more funds to be spent on the aged .
These two solutions are both impractical .
Firstly , public funding on other sectors is also limited and cannot be reduced as they are equally important .
Housing and healthcare are basic needs of people .
The military is needed for the defense of the nation .
Public spending on technology cannot be reduced as it is a substitute for the decline in productivity of a shrinking workforce .
This is because , technology provides the automation and machines to increase productivity solving the problem of a shrinking workforce .
Secondly , the main income for public spending is from taxes , especially income taxes from the working population with services tax forming the largest proportion .
If taxes are raised substantially , it would  worsen the severe financial stress for the working population and adversely impact the consumer market .
Therefore , public spending on the aged definitely has to be limited , ensuring enough funding goes to other sectors such as education , military , technology , transport , housing , healthcare , sports , etc which are equally important so as  not to increase taxes for the working population .
The government should limit  public spending on healthcare for the aged , and the limit should satisfy the healthcare needs of all the elderly .
Healthcare has become more of a want rather than a basic need .
The government has to distinguish between needs and wants .
Needs are consultation and medication upon falling ill .
Wants are usually specialist services that perform detailed checkups to determine the underlying cause of the illness , analysis of patients' symptoms to predict illnesses they might contract and certain pharmaceutical medicines which act as supplements .
The wanted healthcare costs are significantly higher as specialist services and pharmaceuticals use high technology equipment and expertise .
Therefore , individuals should pay for what is wanted and only needs should be subsidized by the government  to reduce public spending on healthcare for the aged .
The government should also support healthcare costs for those elderly in families with financial problems as poverty  if basic healthcare is not provided to everyone .
The elderly are extremely susceptible to certain illnesses due to age .
These illnesses or diseases could be non-communicable or chronic which include cardiovascular disease , dementia and Alzheimer's disease , cancer , arthritis and diabetes .
Hence , self reliance such as retirement savings has to be in place first to allow the elderly to be able to pay for illnesses which they might contract later .
Otherwise , it would be a huge drain on government resources to pay for all their medical expenses .
Although ,  public spending on the aged has to be limited , it cannot neglect the social needs of the elderly .
Social needs of the elderly include being able to communicate with the community .
As the elderly are physically weaker and have poorer vision , elderly friendly infrastructures  ,which include enhancements to transport facilities and housing , are necessary to free the elderly from problems of mobility within the community . .
Imagine if there were plenty of staircases and no lifts , signs with small fontsand no resting areas .
no resting areas .
It would be an anti-elderly society where the elderly would most likely stay at home .
These elderly friendly infrastructures are meant to give accessibility for the elderly to physically communicate with friends , families and other people making them part of the community .
After all , it is only morally right to do so as the elderly were once part of the working population that contributed to the nation and they now form a significant portion of the population .
In conclusion , the world should shift towards fostering an elderly friendly society that values their contribution and allows them to be part of the community .
It should also inculcate a strong sense of self reliance among the workforce to prepare them for their old age .
This would reduce their dependence on children or government to support them and not hinder the growth of other areas of the country's development  , as these other areas currently receive fewer funds due to the increasing amount of funds being diverted into helping the growing aged population . 
ogy advances , elderly depression can be deahumansth thrinuhelping people to knowans .
First , elderly depression could be prevented with psychological consultation .
For example , a qualified psychological consultant is able to offer an old person constructive suggestions of preventing depression such as keeping a positive attitude towards aging , developing hobbies and participating in social activities , which can activate the old person's mind .
The consultant might also advise the children of the old person to keep the elderly company regularly and care more about him .
Probably elderly depression would be prevented from happening to the old person with active mind and lots of emotional support .
Second , elderly depression could be treated with psychological treatment .
The means is more or less the same with the prevention means , but is more enhanced .
For instance , psychological doctors can address the importance of sports as appropriate amount of sports can keep the old people's body and mind on .
At the same time , volunteers can play a part in helping to treat as listeners .
Speaking out personal experience and difficulties in life is a good way of letting off negative mood for old people .
Current psychological development has functioned well in the two points and hence helps to ease the aging process .
Besides , promoting life-long learning has played a significant role in helping to ease the aging process .
Life-long learning is known as "lifelong , lifewide , voluntary , and self-motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons ."

With the population of aged getting larger in society a big sum of money is involved in helping the aged .
If this huge amount of spending is reduced , but in turn , spent on other areas of the country's development , the wealth of the country can reach a  .
To many people , limiting the amount of money to be spent on the elderly can be perceived as being cruel to them .
However , it is necessary  to be realistic and pragmatic .
A country's development is the key element to bring wealth to the country , so as to improve the living quality of the future generation .
With sufficient funds , the country can spend on manpower , education , investment , construction and other aspects to aid in its development .
Nevertheless , a government can still provide funds for the aged .
This has to be done within a certain limit , depending on the individual's wealth status .
In this survey , the elderly can state down whether they receive any forms of subsidy from their families , where they stay , who they stay with , and whether they are interested in applying for financial assistance .
In this case , those who decide that they are wealthy enough to support themselves should not be part of this financial fund .
This is because they still have sufficient money to spend on things other than their basic needs .
On top of that , it ensures that their contributions to the country's economy still  exist .
By doing so , the country could differentiate them from the rest of the elderly that  do not need any form of financial aid because they already have enough to finance themselves .
On the other hand , for those who are really in need , they can apply for subsidies to receive a certain amount of funding every month .
Under this financial plan , they will benefit from the country's welfare and at the same time be able to satisfy their basic needs .
A well-developed country can bring wealth and boost the economy of the country .
With that , the citizens can get to improve their living standards and quality of life .
For that reason , spending on areas that serve the purpose of helping a country's growth is essential to the country .
If the government continues to splurge a lot in funding the aged , the country's capital would ultimately become unbalanced and would be insufficient to spend on the other areas , for instance , education .
Imagine a country  that has slower development in education .
In the near future , children in the country would have a lower chance to be educated .
With little knowledge and skills , the country would be poor and would not grow .
In a nutshell , a country's funding for both aged and young should be balanced out .
People need to be more practical and far-sighted to  consider the next generation in the country .
This can be done by building up funds for the country's development , while not overdoing funding for the aged .
The main focus should be on the country's development .
Therefore , public spending on the elderly should be restricted .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited because this is part of the country's development and social well being .
It is equally important as the other aspects of the country's development .
Some countries are experiencing an aging population , for example Japan , which is facing rapid change  , had a 5 .1%1 increase in aging population over the last 30 years .
This figure is expected to increase as more elderly  reach 65 years old .
Countries such as Singapore are also facing rapid aging population growth with a decreasing fertility rate  of 0 .31%1 over the past 7 years .
If this trend continues , Singapore will be second after Japan  .
An aging population  affects the country's economy because of the high retirement rate and the increased need for providing healthcare for the elderly .
therefore public spending should not be limited  because it is still part of the country's responsibility to take care of the aged population .
Firstly , Singapore is one of the many countries experiencing an aging population , where the median age has increased from 16 .9 years since 1970 to 19 .51 years now with a decreasing fertility rate [1] .
Large number of retirees are expected in the futureand the government has extended the retirement age from 55 to 65 years .
Other policies the government have implemented is creating more job opportunities for the aged including , providing part time jobs , allowing flexible working hours and giving an option for them to work at home .
Public funding should be spent on the aged for retraining , as it is also a form of investment because the aged , being part of the workforce , are also helping to improve the economy .
Secondly , as the country's aging population increases , health problems become one of the concerns for the elderly .
For most developed and developing countries , healthcare will become an issue .
As the cost of living increases , the cost of healthcare also increases  .
For instance , healthcare is an issue in the United States  .
Any healthcare cost will become a burden to the elderly as well as to their family members .
On the other hand , countries such as Singapore have policies which help the elderly to cover their medical expenses .
ElderShield plan , an insurance scheme , covers medical treatment expenses for severe disabilities especially for the elderly .
This will not be possible if a limitation on public spending on the aged is imposed .
However , a significant amount of the country's funds should be spent on improving the country's economy , which in turn creates more job opportunities .
For instance , during the current economic downturn , public funding should be diverted to developing more facilities , which will in turn improve ththe economy .
One example is the recent government project of the integrated resort , which will create job opportunities and attract people to spend money when it is completed .
If the economy of the country is not growing , it may affect  businesses  within the country , which in turn affects the employment rate .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited as they are still part of the country's development and social well being .
It is still part of the country's social responsibility to take care of the aged population .
As a Chinese saying goes , the aged population is actually a treasure to the country .
However a significant amount of funding should also be diverted to other  to stimulate the economy and help the country and its people to survive the economic downturn .
It has been argued that "To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
Elders experience  capabilities in body functions , like standing for extended duration , lifting , diminishing eyesight and slower reaction time among others .
Technologies have been deployed to assist elderly people in day to day activities to counter or decrease disadvantages they face due to their less athletic bodies .
Elderly people are eased in the aging process by technologies that retain  Technologies lower the requirement for physically demanding tasks .
Compared to the past where there was less advanced deployment of machineries and technologies , there are four areas that technologies help the elderly in , work , communication , healthcare and transportation .
Firstly , mechanization and automation have taken away the physical component of many jobs This allows the elderly to have less physical capabilities in their work .
The elderlys are as capable of operating and monitoring equipment as the younger , stronger workers are . .
Working at the port or the warehouse would be impossible for elderly people in the past , where cargo is  uploaded by man .
Dockside cranes and forklifts ,  , allow elderly people to handle the job even though they are not as fit as the younger workers .
Thus , due to mechanization and automation , workers have a smaller decrease in productivity due to age , allowing elderly people to work at an older age than could be done in the past .
The elderly can have a longer time to save up for retirement , decreasing potential financial problems .
The elderly can be at ease knowing that they are able to be more financially capable at an older age .
Secondly , elders can access communication networks through specific communication devices  designed for usage by the elderly .
While most products are still at the prototype stage , the demand in the market warrants such products to be available in the near future .
These devices take into account the tendency  of the elderly to fail to recall operation methods , contacts , schedules , locations , etc .
Much emphasis has been placed on shadow learning curves and user- friendliness to non-technically inclined users User interface and controls can be self-descriptive and intuitiveby using extensive use of icons , grouping of related tasks and automatic hiding and showing of controls by intelligently determining the likely intention of users .
A phone by Doro with big buttons and limited functions is a good example .
The simplicity of this device made it more adoptable for elderly people .
Elderly people can now communicate with each other , their children and relatives regardless of geographical distance .
In the past , they would have had to visit physically at another geographical location or employ the help of their children to make a phone call or chat on the Internet . .
For  , technologies can assist in their healthcare  The access to emergency services and families are of high importance .
There are products in the market where the elderly at home can wear a device like a necklace on which there is a big red emergency button .
A modem installed at home will wirelessly detect the pressing of the emergency button and automatically dial for the emergencyservices with the location  , medical information and family members of the elderly person as long as they press it within the detection range of the device .
This greatly increases the chances of help arriving in a timely manner .
Emergency respond units are able to have detailed medical records of the patients before arrival and apply the appropriate pre-treatment before sending the patient to hospital .
In the past , elderly people would need someone else to look after them and respond to emergency situations .
The elderly might also be unaware or cannot remember their own medical records .
Technologies thus make aging much safer for the elderly .
To help elderly people travel around , the public transportation system underwent changes catering towards them .
In Singapore , MRT stations are retrofitted with lifts so that elderly people do not need to climb the staircase or take the the escalator Many bus service providers around the world are acquiring low- floor buses , which has increased accessibility for elderly people .
Combined with a policy that encourages priority seating for senior citizens , taking public transport has become a much more comfortable experience compared to the past .
In conclusion ,  many technologies  have helped to ease the aging process by a large extent .
Aging would become much more difficult and uncomfortable without these technologies . 
One of the most challenging issues in the world now is  the ability to meet  the increase in energy demand .
Current resources like  fossil fuel , which is used to generate electricity , will eventually be depleted in a few centuries' time (Mitenkov , Kodochigov , Vasyaev , Golovko , Ponomarev-Stepnoi , Kukharkin & Stolyarevskii , 2004) .
One of the solutions to this problem is the Generation IV nuclear reactors .
Among all the proposed reactors , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is the most suitable option in terms of its design (Mitenkov et al . , 2004) .
Although there are public opponents who do not wish for the nuclear reactors to be built due to potential threats , past incidences and cost , the Generation IV VHTR aims to overcome these negative aspects with funding for its research and development  .
Nuclear reactors are known to be a potential terrorist target .
This is one of the reasons why opponents among the public do not wish for nuclear reactors to be built .
However , according to Butler (2004) , the VHTR has the capability to decrease its own temperature should there be any accident , with minimum operators' involvement .
Therefore , the likelihood of reactors melting down because of terrorists shutting off the coolant to the VHTR is minimised .
Furthermore , terrorist attacks could also come in many other forms; one well-known example is  terrorist attack upon the United States on 11 September 2001 which did not involve nuclear reactors .
Therefore , it can be concluded that if terrorists are determined to destroy a country , they could still use different methods even if nuclear reactors are present in the country .
In addition , since terrorists know that there will be extra precautions taken to safeguard the nuclear reactors , it will be more difficult for them to sabotage the country by means of the nuclear reactors .
In order to make the VHTR  much less attractive as a target to the terrorists , funding for research and development is necessary  to develop simpler safety interlock systems and  materials which can withstand very high temperatures to build the reactor .
The public being nuclear-averse is also the result of the past accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl in Pennsylvania and Ukraine respectively .
The former was caused by operators not being able to respond to a sudden shutdown of the reactor .
Moreover , the cooling system of the reactor was not properly set up; hence , overheating caused the reactors' core to melt and become severely damaged (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
The VHTR can reduce the occurrence of this incident by incorporating a simple cooling system which does not need skilled operators (Butler , 2004) .
Thus , with careful , well trained operators and better cooling systems , the probability of accidents happening will be reduced .
As for the other accident which happened in Chernobyl , it was a result of operators , who were not well trained in operation and safety , operating on a reactor which was inadequately designed (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
These factors led to 56 deaths by 2004 as a result of the reactors' explosion and therelease of radioactive materials into the surroundings (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
It was noted that the explosion was due to the coolant used , which was water , turning to steam and thus suddenly increased the power produced and set off a nuclear reaction (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
It was the inappropriate handling of this sudden increase in power which led to the tragedy .
In the case of the VHTR , the coolant will be helium .
Being chemically inert , helium does not influence the nuclear reactions with a temperature change or  .
Hence , power surges of the reactor will be minimized , resulting in a decrease in the probability of reactor explosion .
This goes to show that nuclear reactors have become safer for operation .
There is no doubt that  opponents would not want  history to repeat itself , so they would not want nuclear reactors to be built .
However , there are important lessons to be learnt from this accident which can be used to improve  the design of nuclear reactors .
Research and development of the VHTR can help to ensure safer operation of a nuclear reactor where safety aspects of the reactor will be better than before .
Besides that , adequate operator training will be planned and carried out faithfully to bring accident rates to a minimum .
With safer nuclear reactors , opponents should feel more at ease with them in their country , and hence , more can be built to help in sustaining the energy supply for the future .
Although the cost of hydrogen replacing gasoline is huge , there will surely be more benefits to mankind due to  high efficiency .
According to Butler (2004) , approximately 400 nuclear power plants , each requiring about US$1 billion , need to be built in order to fully be dependent on hydrogen instead of gasoline .
In addition , research and testing work is required to look for materials which are able to resist the high temperature of the VHTR and the rapid impact of high energy neutrons in the reaction (Butler , 2004) .
Opponents may comment that the initial capital cost is very high , but the VHTR is able to produce 50% more energy than the typical reactor using the same quantity of fuel (Butler , 2004) .
This could help to meet  the rising energy demand .
Although there might be future technologies which will be better than the VHTR , this is not definite as yet .
Therefore , rather than wait for a new technology to fully emerge , we should continue to carry out research work on enhancing  feasible technology present now , which is the nuclear reactor .
Opponents may think that nuclear reactors are potential terrorist targets , but precautions have already taken to minimize the impact .
Moreover , nuclear reactors are not the only targets of the terrorist; there are other ways  terrorists can think of to destroy a country .
Certain major accidents in the past which resulted in deaths involved nuclear reactors , so the public are against nuclear reactors .
However , it is because of these past experiences that there can be improvements to the design of the Generation IV VHTR .
Therefore , the VHTR can be said to be much safer than nuclear reactors of the past .
Lastly , the cost to build and experiment on newly designed nuclear reactors may be high , but the advantage that they can produce more energy with the same amount of resources  far surpasses the cost involved as the important issue now is to solve the problem of constantly increasing  energy demand .
It is mentioned in Butler's article (2004) that building the VHTR can involve many obstacles , but if engineers are able to overcome them , then energy production will be "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant" .
Hence , I strongly recommend  further funding for  research and development for engineers to overcome the challenges involved in constructing the VHTR .
When talkingarchers pay more and more attention to aped psychology in the recent decades , people are wondering whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented some major en accident lwere confirmedhernhave beenyl Accident .
The psychology discussed in this essay is defined as (Merriam-Webster , 2009) "the science of mind and behavior in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity [i .e .
safety of engineering design process here]" .
Evidence shows the use of psychology during the design process would largely reduce the chance of the Chernobyl Accident by raising the awareness of safety culture among the crew .
In this essay , two aspects where psychology could have been applied to prevent the accident will be talked about , they are: calling people's attention to the importance of safety and making people consider the safety of the complex high hazard system from a macro view .
Above all , applhave been payingg psychology during design process could make people pay more attention to thhave beenmportance of safety .
It is identified by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the post-accident report accidentsicient knowledge and awareness of safety through out the design , operating , and regulatory crew was one of the main causes that lead to the Chernobyl Accident (IAEA , 1992) .
Here are some examples that reflects the deficient knowledge safety of the crews .
For the design team , a few fatal design errors of the nuclewould havestem and reducedpossible consequences had been known long before the Chernobyl Accident , action was taken to correct these errors in the design process .
For the operating team , insufficient training of the operating st;ff caused a serious about the man-machine interaction .
And for the regulatory team , they underestimated the potential danger in the nuclear test and therefore did not provide necessary supervision for the test .
(James , 2009) All these had contributed to the painful consequence of the Chernobyl Accident , and could be prevented if psychology had been applied to make the crew more responsible and pay more attention to the nuclear safety .
have beenwhichFurthermore paying more attention to tthe design processof safety is not enough psychology should be applied to guide the engineers to considerthe Internationalf the nuclear plant from a system level .

When the Chernobyl Accident occurred , the poor communication and interaction between different departments of the nuclear plant made  worse than it might have otherwise been .
To prevent the accident , it is important to consider twithfety from a macro view by analFinally ,nhe whole nuclear sysncluding the interaction among human , organizational , and technological factors (Meshkathe necessary .

as well as organizationalhumansthe safety of the systemwould have beenhave preventedmight otherwise have beenabut ofwassystems ,nature ,likeFurthermore ,r hand , not everyone agree with that applying psychology denough; psychology design process would have prevented the Chernobyl Accident .
There are mainly two rebuatstheagainst applying psychology .
First due to the wrong social peagreesif psychology and the social scienthe engineeringeople think psychology is only under the field of human arts and social science , which is totally unrelated to engineering , therefore they think there is no way applying psychology during the designing process will help to prevent those engineering accidents like this Chernobyl Accident .
Nevertheless , these people do not realize that those who designs , constructs , maintains , and runs the systems are all humans (Wilpert , 2007) .
Therefore a large part of the safety of the engineering systems lies on human activities .
Applying psychology in engineering can help to make people more mature , responsible , and careful while dealing with complex high hazard systems like the nuclear reactors , which will definitely reduce the chance of accident .
First ,er rebuttal against applying psychology is that some people argue that design errors is the main cause othe macome underngineering accidents , and applying psychology cannot correct these design errors and p;etherefore ,accidedoubtthat applyingaccidents are due to design errors , but it is also true that his the factor that gives risthe the accidents in many cases .
If we cannot improve the safety awareness among design , construct , maintain , and runlve the technical problem .
For instance , abouTherefore ,e before the Chernobyl Accident , a nuclear accident occurredint the Three Mile Island , of which the technical cause was also the water cooling system (WNA , 2001) .
The reason of why ten years later the similar technical defect stilaused the Chernobyl Accident is because people did nchances enoan accidentntion to the nuclear safety and therefore did not learn a lesson from the prior accidents , which is not a pure technical problem and could be solved by applying psychology .
What is more , studies (Wells & Ryan , 1991) show that 65% of the major engineering accidents are directly caused by the mistakes made by human beings .
Human is therefore of vital importance to the safety of engineering design process .
So instead of solely focusing on the technical problems , applying psychology would be another thing we need to give equal priority to prevent accidents .

Nevertheless , solely apping psychology during design process would not have totally prevented the Chernobyl Accident , because tinre are osolvingfactors that lead to the accident , for example , cultural factor .

Nowadays , the scarcity of energy has increasingly become a severe problem .
Compared with other kinds of power generation , nuclear energy is relatively cost competitive and eco-friendly .
Thus , more and more countries have put the construction of nuclear plants on their agendas .
With the development of nuclear industry , the proliferation of the generation reactors will become a certainty .
among all the generation reactors , I believe the supercritical water reactor should be the most applicable for most countries , especially those developing countries without advanced technology and tremendous capital .
Firstly of the supercritical water reactor is not only very highly thermal efficient but also quite economical .
The construction cost , the supercritical water reactor is rather low .
Due to the simpler structure , many of the traditional Light Water Reactor components such as the coolant recirculation pumps , pressurizers , steam generators , and steam separators and dryers can be eliminated in the supercritical water reactors(Buongiorno & MacDonald , 2003) .
And as for material engineering , according to the corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility tests in supercritical water by scientists from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and the University of Michigan(McKinley , Teysseyre , Was , Mitton , Ki & Latanision , 2003) , two traditional austenitic steels (304L and 316L) can be used as high temperature components in the SCWR .
On the other hand , as for the Very High Temperature reactor , big safety provisions have to be considered to ensure its stability under high temperatures and a multitude of coolants are needed .
Since the coolant for the VHTR is aninert gas such as Helium which is not recyclable , a lot of energy and money will be required to separate it from air .
Moreover , a large amount of money needs to be spent to design and develop new related materials which can bear high temperatures , high{neutron}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Neutron]doses , and{corrosive}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Corrosion]operating conditionsinside the VHT reactor (IAEA 2004) .
In addition , it is very costly to build the VHTR because of its excessively complicated inner structure .
However , the SCWR can be installed not only withina shorter period but also by fewer workers , which will dramatically save the fixed costs of plant construction .
In the meantime , the supercritical water reactor also enjoys high thermal efficiency and a high energy conversion rate .
According to the SCWR annual report published by Jacopo Buongiorno and Philip E . MacDonald (2003) , about 45% to 55% of the heat generated by nuclear reactions can be transformed into electricity against 35% efficiency for advanced LWRs .
Since the coolant is just supercritical water , at extreme pressure , above the critical point , steam and liquid  into a single phase , which will convert more fission energy into electricity .
Moreover , compared with the VHTR , the SCWR is a  one .
Thus , it can produce more  potentially usable fuel , which means less core material such as uranium would be consumed to produce the same quantities of electricity .
Lastly , compared with the VHTR , owing to its lower temperature , the SCWR needs less heat to trigger the reactions and keep the thermal inertia , which saves more energy but also  .
Secondly , compared with other generation four reactors , the SCWR should be more applicable for most countries .
Since the SCWR is a combination and expansion of the old Light Water Reactor and the fossil fuel fired boiler , which are commonly deployed and widely used around the world ,  the basic theories and technologies for the SCWR have been proven to be reliable for many years (Yang & Zavaljevski , 2003) .
In contrast  for VHTRs , not a similar plant has been built yet (the first VHTR will be completed in 2020) , a lot of new and untested concepts still need be verified , which may cause reactors with more nondeterminacies to produce more unexpected problems .
Moreover ,  for the VHTR , a lot of technical challenges also remain to be settled .
However , since the SCWR's simple and user-friendly design incorporates mostly mature technologies of the LWR  it is more likely to be adapted soon by many countries , especially those developing countries without strong capital and mature technologies .
Moreover , by processing electricity , hydrogen can also be generated with electrolysis by the SCWR , which will support the development of the hydrogen industry in the following decades and make additional profits .
Thirdly , the Supercritical water reactor is more eco-friendly and safe .
Different from Light Water Reactors used around the world today , the Super Critical Water Reactor is more likely to slow down and catch 'fast neutrons' , which means it would burn less nuclear fuels in a more thorough way .
Therefore , less radioactive waste will be generated and need to be land-filled .
Thus , the time for breaking down nuclear wastes will be decades instead of millenniums after the SCWR is applied .
Further , compared with the VHTR , the primary and secondary coolant of the SCWR is  the same supercritical water which can be relatively easy to get and recycle .
In addition , because of the super enthalpy of supercritical water , more energy will be transplanted but less unexpected by-products will be produced , which will certainly decrease the risk of contamination to the environment and enhance the integral efficiency of transplanting , which will effectually reduce  carbon emissions by burning less fossil fuels .
The safety of the SCWR has been proven and can be bettered in the future .
Thanks to the improvement of the core design , less average core density will be required so that the possibility of devastating accidents such as the core melting down  will become extremely slim .
Moreover , because of the dedicated moderator of the SCWR , the boiling crisis of coolants under normal operating conditions can also be eliminated .
Since the SCWR safety system is comparable with that of the ABWR , scientists are now trying to combine the SCWR with ESBWR-type passive safety systems  .
If they can be integrated together , the safety of the SCWR will be dramatically enhanced .
To conclude , although some technical issues of the Super Critical Water reactor are still being researched ,  I reckon that the SCWR would be the most promising reactor against other generation IV ones , in terms of performance , cost , feasibility , and impact on the environment .
With the development of science and technology , the SWCR will not only be able to efficiently produce clean energy but also significantly address the severe global warming challenge today .
To further explore the potential of nuclear energy , the United States , Argentina , Brazil , Canada , France , Japan , South Korea , South Africa , Switzerland and the United Kingdom , have come together to form the Generation IV International Forum(GIF) .
(Butler , D 239) GIF's criteria for including a nuclear reactor design for consideration include: sustainable energy , competitive energy , safe and reliable systems and proliferation resistance .
( "Very High Temperature Reactors" , section 5) The Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of the six generation IV reactor concepts proposed by the GIF .
The VHTR requires an operating temperature of 1000oC and high pressure with helium being the coolant  used .
(Butler , D 239) Critics have argued that the current nuclear plants in operation are susceptible to terrorist attacks and doubt that the plant is worth the high cost of funding .
Lastly , they are concerned with the safety level of the plant .
All these critics are against the funding and development of nuclear power plants .
However , I strongly support further research and development funding of nuclear reactor plants .
This is because nuclear reactor plants have many advantages such as being able to produce both hydrogen fuel and a large amount of electricity from a small amount of fuel at the same time .
(Butler , D . 239)
Ever since the 9/11 incident , protection of nuclear plants has been a heightened national priority .Yet , some anti-terror experts have commented that the current criteria do not protect the plant from a threat equal to the one posed by the 9/11 hijackers .
A report released by the Government Accountability Office even mentioned that it is critical of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) , finding that the latter has not increased standards enough to ensure plants are genuinely secure , but only as much as industry officials believe is necessary .
("Nuclear-plant security: Is it enough ?"
par .3)This has instilled a lot of fear in the citizens and they have no confidence in the security of the plants .
As such , they oppose the funding of nuclear plants .
On the contrary , the security problems of nuclear plants have already been tackled .
One solution is the "Design Basis Threat" (DBT) which specifies the severity of the attacks that has to be prepared for .
The NRC requires each nuclear plant to periodically conduct security exercises to test its ability to fight against the DBT .
("Nuclear Power Plants: Vulnerability to Terrorist Attack") Last but not least , the nuclear industry has spent more than $1 .25 billion in the upgrading of its security operations and the increasing of its armed guard force from 5 ,000 to more than 8 ,000 .
("Nuclear-plant security: Is it enough ?"
par .9)In conclusion , the security of the plant is now sufficient to repel  terrorists and therefore the funding of nuclear power plants should be supported .
The high cost of the funding for the development of nuclear plants has also met with much public discontentment .
They claim that nuclear power is uneconomical .
In the USA , since its beginning , nuclear power has cost the country over $492 , 000 , 000 , 000 , which is nearly twice the cost of the Vietnam War and the Apollo Moon Missions combined .
Since 1950 , nuclear power has received over $97 ,000 ,000 ,000 in direct and indirect subsidies from the federal government .
No other industry has enjoyed such a privilege .
("Some Important Facts about Nuclear Power ."
par .3)The high cost of nuclear plants is transferred to the citizens so they have to pay more on utilities .
Hence , they reject the idea of funding nuclear plants .
On the other hand , many differ in opinion .
Even though the cost of building a nuclear plant is very high , the operating cost is relatively low .
Therefore , nuclear power actually costs about the same as power generated from coal .
("Energy Resources: Nuclear Power .
")This means that  nuclear energy can be charged at an affordable price that is competitive to coal and gas .
In addition , nuclear energy , though expensive , can be produced in abundance to meet the ever increasing demand for energy .
In short , nuclear power plants should be funded as their benefits outweigh the shortcomings such as the high cost .
After the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island nuclear accidents , which took away many innocent lives due to the explosions as well as exposure to excessive radiation , people are now very concerned about the safety of  nuclear plants .
In Texas , the citizens have again succeeded in opposing  the development of two proposed nuclear reactors at the South Texas Project .
The opposition came about as the citizens are fearful that the environmental effects of radioactive compounds may lead to health problems if contamination or leakage was to occur .
("Citizens Gain Ground in STP Intervention over Water Concerns Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel Admits Four Additional Water Related Contentions for a Hearing") However , there is evidence to support the claim that the safety aspect of nuclear plants are up to mark .
According to the World Association of Nuclear Operators(WANO) , performance indicators show that the U .S . nuclear plants have managed to sustain  high levels of achievement in safety performance , industrial safety , unplanned automatic reactor shutdowns and programs to protect workers from radioactive exposure .
(" Nuclear Industry's Safety , Operating Performance Remained Top-Notch in '08 , WANO Indicators Show") Since the nuclear plants are now of higher safety standards and with agencies to regularly check on the status of the plants , the further funding of nuclear plants should be supported so that this safe and reliable source of energy can be made available to everyone .
In conclusion , I support the notion of  research and development of nuclear power plants .
Even though there may be problems and public opposition along the way ,  by bearing in mind three main factors , namely , the benefits of nuclear energy , the importance of a strong defence and most importantly , the importance of having a set of safety protocols , we are able to push the development of nuclear power to greater heights .
Thirty years after the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown in the United States , nuclear energy seems poised for a renaissance .
The world can expect the number of nuclear power plants to double by 2050 , spreading across the Middle East and Southeast Asia , particularly in China , India , South Korea , and Japan (Butler , 2004) .
In 2008 , Kaplan (2008) reported that more than 40 developing countries have expressed their interest in launching nuclear power programs to United Nations officials .
The issue of whether developing countries should first handle unemployment and poverty in rural areas rather than provide huge funding to build nuclear reactors is still controversial .
Some argue that a nuclear reactor is too costly to build and that they should adopt other renewable energies instead of nuclear power (Totty , 2008) , while others argue that developing countries do not have enough skilled labour to cope with the  needs of building and operating nuclear reactors (Squassoni , 2009) .
Although there is much opposition to the idea of building nuclear reactors in developing countries , there is some evidence that building nuclear reactors , such as the Generation IV reactors , yields positive outcomes for these countries .
Opponents of nuclear reactors claim that building a new reactor can cost a country between $6 billion and $9 billion each (Totty , 2008) .
Although proponents of nuclear reactors agree with the fact that the reactors are expensive to construct , they argue that it is comparatively inexpensive to operate because nuclear fuel accounts for only 27% of the variable cost of a kilowatt-hour as compared to  alternatives like natural gas which accounts for 85% .
In fact , any new design of reactors today will be pre-approved for lower construction costs , which include the cost for decommissioning and waste management (Johnston , 2008) .
Furthermore , developing countries that have insufficient funds to build nuclear reactors can seek assistance from Alternate Energy Holdings (AEHI) that has offered to provide skills and funding in constructing nuclear reactors (AEHI , 2007) .
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Mohamed ElBaradei , proposed that these countries could alternatively construct hundreds of small-scale plants for a single town , each one built using a fraction of the cost used for a large-scale plant and without using expensive power grids (Bullis , 2005) .
Opponents also maintain that developing countries should adopt other renewable energies such as solar and wind energies rather than building nuclear reactors (Totty , 2008) .
However , despite the fact that studies show that the use of solar and wind energy is more economical than nuclear energy , opponents completely ignore the limitations of these energies in producing electricity for the decades ahead (Healthy Environment Alliance [HEAL] , n .d .) .
Moreover , solar power is limited to daylight hours and  there is no continuous supply of wind .
The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that , even with continued subsidy and research , and a landscape full of solar panels and windmills , these renewable energies can generate only about 6% of the world's electricity by 2030 (Silverio , 2008) .
Thus , the key difference is that nuclear energy can supply electricity on a global scale .
The final argument advanced by opponents of nuclear reactors is that jobs created by nuclear power plants require highly skilled workers that developing countries , like China and India , are lacking .
As a result , opponents maintain that building nuclear reactors would not address the problem of unemployment (Squassoni , 2009) .
However , the research is inconclusive .
In fact , by 2010 , Asians residing in Asia will dominate 90% of all Ph .D . physical scientists and engineers in the world .
And among the Asian Ph .D . engineers and scientists , most will originate from China (Li , Whalley , Zhang , & Zhao , 2008) .
In addition , to better meet the demand for skilled workers , nuclear industries in the developing countries could set up on-site training centres that recruit and train the locals to work in the nuclear industry (Freeman , 2009) as each plant creates about 400 to 700 permanent jobs and 1400 to 2400 jobs during peak construction period (Nuclear Energy Institute [NEI] , 2009) .
In summary , developing countries should develop  nuclear reactors for several reasons .
First , nuclear reactors operate using cheaper nuclear fuel that accounts for only 27% of the variable costs of a kilowatt-hour .
In addition , a new nuclear reactor design will only be approved if it presents a relatively lower construction cost .
Moreover , if developing countries have insufficient funds , they can approach AEHI for financial and labour support but an alternative way would be building smaller-scale plants without the need to use costly power grids and thus incur lower costs .
Nuclear power is also capable of supplying electricity for the whole world as compared to wind and solar energy .
Besides that , developing countries like China and India have sufficient highly-skilled workers to contribute to the nuclear industry and the unemployment rate can also be reduced , as approximately 2400 jobs are made available in each new plant .
Therefore , in my opinion , developing countries should first provide huge funding to build generation IV reactors in order to combat unemployment and poverty in  rural areas .
According to Butler(2009) ,  researchers have been pondering on whether to use  nuclear funding for the development of generation (IV) reactors , which are projected to be better than the current generation (II) and (III) reactors , or to retain the nuclear funding for existing generation (II) and (III) reactors .
Moreover , for the generation (IV) reactors , there is a debate on whether to channel the funds for the research of SuperCritical water reactors (SCWRs)  , which scientists have claimed  would benefit mankind more in most aspects  like cost and efficiency compared to the other five generation (IV) reactors .
Although there are reasons that seem to support the funding of the SCWR , the development of the SCWR should not be funded as there are other factors like economic and social feasibility to consider before we can conclude that the funding for the development of the SCWR should be approved .
One of the many reasons given to support the claim for SCWR funding is that the SCWR is a combination of two proven technologies , which are Light water moderated reactors (LWRs) and supercritical-water fossil plants (Buoniorno , 2002) .
Supporters of the SCWR claim that the SCWR would have a reduced capital cost as a result of plant simplification and high thermal efficiency .
Although I concur with their view to a certain extent , they have overlooked the problem of the SCWR being capable of reaching the commercialization stage of an innovation (Rogers , 2003) .
The likelihood of the SCWR reaching the commercialization stage is low because even though the SCWR is the combination of two proven technologies , research is still required to merge the two technologies together .
Furthermore , the simplification of the SCWR involves the usage of materials that are either expensive , rare , or do not exist (Absolute astronomy , 2009) .
This reinforces the possibility that the SCWR cannot enter the commercialization stage of innovation , proving that there should not be funding for the development of the SCWR .
Another reason proponents give is thatthe SCWR uses water which is cheap and easily obtainable as a coolant (Butler , 2009) .
In addition , supporters of the SCWR also state that the SCWR takes up less space than current Generation (II) and (III) Reactors (MacDonald , 2003) .
I have to acquiesce to the two points raised by the supporters of the SCWR .
However , these two arguments  do not consider that both water and space are vital to mankind .
Although water is easily obtained and affordable ,  only 1% out of the 97% water available is usable (West , 2007) .
Thus , it is astute not to use water as a coolant because the world population is constantly rising , so there might be a possibility of water shortage .
This implies that funding should not be channeled for the development of the SCWR .
Instead , funds could be directed to the development of the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) which utilizes helium which is not important for human survival as helium is not found in the human body (The Encyclopedia of Earth , 2008) .
In addition , although the land required to build the SCWR is less than for the existing reactors , the area needed to build a new SCWR would be better utilized as area for agriculture instead , especially in the future .
It is projected that in the year 2050 , there could be 9 .2 billion people in the world (BBC , 2009) .
This signifies that there will be a high possibility of a food shortage which is a more pressing problem than energy shortage .
Therefore , there should not be funding for the development of the SCWR as the SCWR utilizes two key ingredients for human survival .
The last reason that advocates  funding for the development of the SCWR  is that the building of the SCWR  could generate desirable jobs for the society (Nuclear Energy Institute , 2009) .
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute , the operation of a nuclear plant generates 400 to 700 permanent jobs and these jobs offer a salary that is 36 percent higher than average jobs .
Although this may be beneficial to society ,  after the completion of the construction of a nuclear plant , there would be job losses involved .
During the construction of a new nuclear plant , around 1400 to as high as 2400 jobs are created .
However , after the completion , only 400 to 700 jobs will be available .
This indicates that a job loss of around 1500 will be incurred .
Furthermore , the 400 to 700 jobs require personnel that are highly skilled which developing countries are unlikely to supply .
Therefore , the validity of generating desirable jobs needs to be redefined .
After considering both sides of the arguments , it is evident that there should not be funding for the development of the SCWR as there are more shortcomings than  benefits .
The first consideration is that the funding for the development of the SCWR should be channeled to more pressing needs like eliminating poverty and food shortage .
Next , the possibility of the SCWR surviving the commercialization stage is low .
Lastly , the benefits that the researchers had predicted are not totally beneficial to humans , thereby indicating that there should not be funding for the SCWR .
In conclun , it is clear impression ofage of nuclear eis thatrit isis beneficial tandeinefficientamount of uranium (the main source of nuclear energy) , it will generate a mass energy to run nuclear power plants .
All-time high efficiency will greatly reduce cost and time which satisfy the demands of the people .
Nowadays , there are around 440 nuclear power reactors generating one-sixth of the electricity of the world .
(Ritch , n .d .) .
It is a proven success in generating energy and it is worthy to invest into such a technology for the sake of the future energy demand .

technologicalwasstoodaccidentsremovedhad all beenifaccidentAccording to the author of 'Psychology and design process' (Wilpert , 2007) , he regards the human minds' deficiencies as the basic reason of an accident .
He thought that disastrous consequences could be avoided or at least minimized with the help of psychological education , and if psychological aids were industries through out tthehtheengineering progress , during to therocessing , structure desigeffectivem managing , and even a catastropheking , the Chernobyl dilayer could be essentiallythe psychological educationofiew , I  ,m support to the insistedat human factors' impacts overwhelm failures in the design of the plantnt .
First and foremost , it was identified that several operational procedures wed by the crmind's1deficiencyois (the InternationabehindNuclear Safety AdthinksGroup , 1992) by the Internatiocanuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) states that three components of reactor protection , which referreare Emergencythroughoutng System (ECCS) , trip on steam drum water level , and the 'two turbine' trip had been disabled .
Those disabling were not prohibited in the document under normal procedure , but it was a test on that day , and thof special approval should have been askoverwhelmeddallon , the required tthe Chernobyl accidentel had not been achieved , and the reactor was operated only at half power then .
Apparently , the operating staff was untutored and not competent for the job .
Moreover , whenever a deficiency in engineering process occurs , thus in a case when the engineering process is unable to perform according to the plan , the whole should be ceased immediately for a thorough re-evaluation .
However , in 1986 Chernobyl , the operators did not stop but to modify the condition at the spot (the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group , 1992) .
In sum , psychological aids are urgently demanded to educate high-risk-system operational teams in a large scale , for calling up their attention to safety operation .
The disaster could be totally avoided if at least one of the operators had a sense of safety operation .
Secondly , the design faults of the reactor accounts for a considerable proportion of the causes of the accident .

In recognizing the three main problems as the operators' unawareness , designers' misses of considerations and politicians'as much weapons-grade plutonium as possibled be highly appreciated as an efficient way to minimize the human errors , and thus to prevent such accident from happening again .
the very-high-temperature reactorOf these six reactors , the forry-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) are the more promising reactor designs .
The conceptual design of the VHTR will be the first to be defined and optimized by the year 2015 (OECD Nuclear Energy Agency , 2009) , while LFR is , judging from the existing schemes , more feasible because of its low costs and good security features .
In compari ,on with the gas-cooled fast reactors the lead-cooled fast reactorttthe sodium-cooled reactor tthe molten salt reactorr the supercritical-water-cooled reactor
Both LFR and VHTR have their advantages and disadvantages over the other in terms of performance .
The VHTR will be operating at temperatures 900 to 1000 degree Celsius .
This high outlet temperature allows it to have high efficiency (> 50%) electrical generation and also givesalthoughhthe LFRbility to produce hydrogen (OECD Nuclear Energy Agency , 2009) .
Even though LFR is estimated to have a comparatively lower efficiency in energy the LFReration than VHTR (Chand isn  , et al . , 2004) , it is more suitable in cmorecountries due to its flexibility in its scale of operation .
Currently , the reactor is envisioned to have 2 sizes: a small transportable system of 50 to 150 MWe and a medium system of 300 to 600 MWe .
(OECD Nuclear Energy Agency , 2009) The small system design will be useful for providing energy for developing countries and remote communities due to its size .
(Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) Also , researches have shown that LFR will also be able to generate hydrogen (Bouchard , et al , 2008) .
Hence , it is evident that though LFR is predicted to be poorer in terms of efficiency as compared to VHTR , LFR seems more useful and suitable for many countries due to its other features .

On the other hand , it is roughly estimated that the smaller plant of LFRthe LFRn be designed , constructed and operated for 15 years for less than $700 million .

In addition , the development of small LFR will incur smaller research and demonstration costs , since the technology base can be applied to later FR concepts on building larger2009) .tors .
(Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) On the whole , it seems that lead-cooled fast reactors are much cheaper to build than VHTR .
Lastly , the LFR's operation methods seem safer and more secure tHTR .

For the small LFRchance of a melt-down of reactor will be far lower as the operating temperature is only around 550 degrees Celsius (OECD Nuclear Energy Agency , 009) .
Also , as its fuel cycle2007) .lThus , oned , there is no need for offsite emergency response - the system will shut down witVHTRs spreading radioactive materials .
Therefore , LFR seems a safer reactor as compared to VHTR .

Hence , there are still uncertainties in the features of the reactors; it is not certain that LFR will still have thea higher possibility VHTR after the completion of designs of the plants .
However , from the theoretical point of view , after looking at the advantages LFR has over VHTR in theory , I believe that LFR will be a better reactor than VHTR with its predicted fleFurthermorelity in its scale of operation , low cost and better security .
Hence , more funds should be allocated towards the research of LFR .

Within the past half century , two major accidents at the Chernobyl and the Three Mile Island nuclear power plants have caused the public to have a negative view of the operation of nuclear reactors and also , the future of nuclear energy generation .
Presently , the most common energy source , which is  coal-fired power generator , has been causing detrimental effects on the environment by releasing tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases and subsequently causing a rise in global warming .
Furthermore , with increasing concerns regarding the future of our environment , there is also an increasing need to search for alternative sources of energy which would not cause as much harm to the atmosphere .
As a result , leaders of environmental organisations , such as Patrick Moore who is a cofounder of Greenpeace , are beginning to realise that nuclear power generation is one of the most secure , economical and environmentally- friendly energy sources available (Yousefzadeh , 2007) .
In 2001 , the Generation IV International Forum introduced six different generation IV nuclear reactor concepts which had been designed in such a way that when accidents occur , the damage will be contained (Butler , 2004) .
Out of the six reactor concepts , the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) looks to be the most promising one .
With the past accidents in mind and considering the advantages that nuclear power has to offer , if sufficient research efforts are to be channelled to the development of the LFR , we humans can certainly benefit from it in the long run .
When the Chernobyl accident occurred in 1986 , thirty-one people were killed immediately and many more died due to the radiation-related effects of the accident ("Chernobyl Accident" , 2009) .
This accident , especially , had caused many to oppose the nuclear power system as they feel that the extent of damage incurred by such systems would be massive and unacceptable .
However , future thorough research and development towards the safe operation of nuclear plants may prove to be worthwhile .
For example , the accident which occurred on the Three Mile Island did not involve any deaths or injuries as the radioactive particles were successfully contained within the reactor itself (Yousefzadeh , 2007) .
This simply shows that with advanced technology , even if an accident-free nuclear plant may never be achieved , at least the technology incorporated into the reactor system would be able to ensure that radiation is contained in times of accidents .
In addition , LFRs are relatively safer as compared to other generation IV reactors due to the inertness of the lead coolant .
Lead is chemically inactive with air and water , ruling out the possibility of accidental fires and explosions (Wider et al . , 2005) .
Hence , with more funding directed towards the research and development of the LFR , it may one day become one of the safest forms of energy generator .
Critics also claim that nuclear power plants and nuclear waste can be potential terrorist targets as a great extent of damage can be done when the plants are attacked or exploited .
Therefore , a strict set of security procedures have to be put in place and the use of advanced technology should be incorporated into the security system .
Another factor to be considered is the sustainability of the LFR .
Critics of nuclear energy claim that nuclear energy generation produces a large amount of radioactive waste products and eventually , storage spaces will run out , making nuclear energy unsustainable .
However , a characteristic of LFRs is that they are fast breeder reactors that carry out nuclear reprocessing of nuclear waste .
With this reprocessing feature in LFRs , uranium and plutonium , which make up 96% of the nuclear waste , can be extricated and reused in the reactor (Butler , 2004) .
As a result , the final amount of waste product would be reduced to a very large extent .
In addition , nuclear reprocessing also increases the efficiency of the usage of uranium and hence makes nuclear power a sustainable source of energy .
Moreover , lead is abundant (The Lead-cooled Fast Reactor , n .d .) , and uranium resources can last us for the next 250 years or so (Wider et al . , 2005) , making the LFR an excellent reactor in terms of sustainability .
In conclusion , the LFR has much to offer to mankind especially in terms of safety , security , sustainability as well as environmental effects .
The LFR is a nuclear energy reactor that is environmentally friendly with zero greenhouse gas emission .
Furthermore , the resources required in an LFR are in abundance , making it a sustainable source of energy .
Most importantly , humans can benefit from the LFR in the future if thorough research and more developments are to be made on it so as to make it safer and more secure from accidents or terrorist attacks .
The public has been concerned about the danger of radiation leaks from nuclear plants , especially after the Chernobyl incident in 1986 when the massive radiation exposure directly caused approximately 250 deaths (WHO , 2005) .
The incident raised security concerns about nuclear plants becoming a terrorist target , where an induced meltdown in terms of present-day operating scale will have catastrophic consequences .
The US administration , though , has recognized the potential of nuclear energy and has committed US$40 million to support research and development (R&D) for Next Generation Nuclear Plants (NGNPs) (DOE , 2009) .
The very-high-temperature-reactor (VHTR) , with  and the extensive R&D conducted on it , has been selected over other reactor concepts such as the supercritical-water-cooled-reactor (SCWR) as the reactor choice for the US' next generation nuclear power plants (DOE , 2008) .
Federal funding should be channeled for the R & D of the VHTR concept as it promises enhanced safety and inherent security designs , in addition to a highly efficient production process .
An estimated 4000 cases of thyroid cancer cases in children were attributed to the radiation leak from the Chernobyl incident , with the long term effect of the radiation exposure expected to continue over the years (UNSCEAR , N .D .) .
The slow but fatal effects of radiation have made radiation leaks from nuclear reactors a major safety concern among the public .
The VHTR addresses this concern by using helium gas as the choice of coolant for the reactor .
The inert nature of helium means it will not react with the radioactive materials of the VHTR to become radioactive , eliminating a source of radiation in the event of a coolant leak (CHM333 , 2007) .
Another safety feature of the VHTR is the use of uranium fuel pellets multi-coated with graphite .
These reinforced pellets are extremely heat resistant and do not crack easily , so even in the case of a meltdown , the uranium pellets will be able to retain the radiation and fission products within its core with minimal release to the surroundings (CHM333 , 2007) .
Questions have been raised by opponents of nuclear power technology regarding the security of the fuel pellets , which are rich sources of uranium .
When extracted and processed , enriched uranium can become a key material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .
However , the multi-coated uranium fuel pellets used in the VHTR require a temperature of more than 1600oC before the fission products within its core can be removed and this arduous extraction condition deters potential weapon proliferation using its radioactive core (GIF , 2008) .
In addition , unlike traditional reactors , the VHTR is designed to minimize fissionable material in its spent fuel by running the fuel pellets through the reactors for consecutive cycles until its fissionable material is exhausted .
The spent fuel pellets will then be safe for disposal and not pose a security risk should there be any intention from terrorists to extract fissionable products from it (CHM333 , 2007) .
Detractors of nuclear power technology also have doubts on whether nuclear power plants can match the cost effectiveness of existing coal and gas power plants .
However , NGNPs are not only capable of generating electricity like coal and gas power plants , they can also simultaneously produce hydrogen (GIF , 2008) .
This co-generation of electricity and hydrogen is made possible by the high operating temperature of up to 1000oC for the VHTR which allows for the efficient production of hydrogen by thermo-chemical processes .
Hydrogen fuel cells have been identified as the energy source of the future , so the capability to produce hydrogen gives NGNPs an edge over existing coal and gas plants .
By future proofing its technology , NGNPs can ensure their relevance to the power industry in the future .
Moreover , the high operating temperature of the VHTR also results in higher fuel burn-up ratio of the fissionable materials in the uranium pellets (DOE , 2008) .
With its highly efficient fuel burn-up , NGNPs will have a lower carbon footprint than coal and gas technology and at the same time , havingless radioactive material remaining in the spent pellets reduces the amount of radioactive waste to be treated , improving the overall process economy .
R&D work done on nuclear power technology to date has shown promising prospects to justify the US$40 million financial support from the US administration .
However , additional funding for the VHTR will only be available if both the US government and the public can be convinced about the viability of NGNPs replacing coal and gas power plants as the main supplier of US electricity .
To achieve this , the VHTR has to stay on track through sustained R&D work in the coming years so that it can meet its expected delivery deadline in 2020 (Butler , 2004) .
The world is encountering an unprecedented challenge which requires urgent global action to prevent the risks of climate change (Stern , 2008) .
To do so , the global greenhouse gas emissions have to be reduced by half relative to 1990 by 2050 , which means to reduce to less than 10 Gigatonnes of emissions (Stern , 2008) .
Many countries rely on fossil fuels as their source of energy and fossil fuel is known to be the major contributor of  greenhouse gases .
In the United States alone , greenhouse gas emissions mainly come from the burning of fossil fuels for energy use .
Energy- related carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of petroleum , coal , and natural gas contributed to eighty-two percent of total U .S . anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2006 (Energy Information Administration , 2008) .
By using the very high temperature reactor (VHTR) , hydrogen can be used as the fuel of the future to replace  fossil fuels .
In addition , more electricity will be produced with the help of the VHTR .
Therefore , for a better environment to live in , countries should support further research and provide large funding for the development of the VHTR even though the public is concerned with the cost and security of the VHTR .
VHTR plants are able to produce hydrogen for fuel using high-temperature steam electrolysis , which breaks apart the bonds of water molecules; this process is 50 percent more energy-efficient as compared to  existing hydrogen production methods (Svoboda , 2009) .
Thus , hydrogen can replace fossil fuels as a source of fuel .
However , until now , there is still no material that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures required for the VHTR to operate , and even if such materials are found , they might add millions of dollars to the still- unknown cost of constructing a VHTR power plant (Svoboda , 2009) .
The public is then concerned about the huge funding needed for development of the VHTR and thus feel that developing countries should first handle poverty and unemployment .
However , the developing countries will account for around eight billion out of a world population of nine billion by 2050 (Stern , 2008) .
and so they need to be involved in achieving global emission reductions .
In addition , poor people around the world also need abundant , affordable and modern energy .
1 .6 billion people in the developing countries do not have excess to electricity so they have to end their day earlier than those in richer countries due to lack of proper lighting (Bradley , 2009) .
With the VHTR , developing countries will be able to meet their energy demand and will thus lift millions of people out of poverty .
Therefore , similar to those rich countries , developing countries should also provide funding for the development of the VHTR .
The the VHTR is able to produce fifty percent more electricity from the same amount of fuel as compared with conventional plants (Butler , 2004) and is also able to produce electricity about forty percent more efficiently than most reactors in the United States (Svoboda , 2009) .
In addition , INL researchers also believe that nuclear energy will be important in maintaining the nation's electricity supply as  (Svoboda , 2009) .
However , given memories of the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and of the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , during which the reactor core exploded , killing some 31 people instantly and spreading radioactive debris across Europe (Butler , 2004) , the public is concerned about the safety of the VHTR .
Furthermore , the Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Agency found that reprocessing increases nuclear waste and the dangers of proliferation and terrorism (Lieberman , 2009) .
However , in actual fact , VHTR is able to function without having to rely on the reprocessing of plutonium waste (Butler , 2004) .
Nuclear reactors would then become less of a terrorist target .
The VHTR also has safety features to prevent core overheating and the release of radioactive material , in hope that these new approaches will eventually erase the memory of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl (Svoboda , 2009) .
Therefore , countries should provide funding for research and development of the VHTR .
Building of the VHTR means that countries will no longer need to depend on fossil fuels as a source of energy and the emission of greenhouse gases will also be greatly reduced .
In addition , the controversial reprocessing of nuclear waste will be solved .
Generating sufficient hydrogen to totally replace gasoline for  transport purposes would mean building more than four hundred nuclear power plants ,  (Butler , 2004) .
However , there are only 441 nuclear plants in the world today (Butler , 2004) .
It is evident that  countries should proceed with the research and development of the VHTR .
Developing countries should also invest in the development of the VHTR as satisfying their energy demand is essential for their economic growth .
Nuclear power has been a source of energy since the 1960s .
Nevertheless , the world has always been concerned about the safety and security issues of  nuclear reactors .
Thus , researchers have come up with generation four reactor concepts , hoping to ease the public's worries .
I personally support the molten salt reactor concept for further research and development based on the following factors: safe operation of the plant , global security and  cost efficiency .
The safety issue of nuclear reactors is directly linked to the risk of radioactive emissions .
Radioactive emissions can come from nuclear explosions or nuclear wastes .
An explosion of a nuclear reactor not only affects the people on site but also millions of others kilometres away .
A good example will be the Chernobyl disaster .
An explosion of the nuclear reactor  occurs due to either excessively high temperature or excessively high pressure .
According to Ghetta , Gorse , Mazi re and Pontikis (2008) , the molten salt reactor functions under very low vapour pressure but very high temperature .
Nevertheless , Forsberg (2006)statesd that the MSR has a strong negative temperature coefficient .Thus ,s when there is an increase intemperatures , the fuel-salt density will reduce and push fuel out of the reactor core into critically safe , passively cooled tanks .
This will prevent overheating which leads toexplosionsn .
As for the waste of molten salt reactors , due to reprocessing , the nuclear wastes are minimal .
According to Forsberg (2006) , the final nuclear waste from the molten salt reactor can be solidified to a stableform ,m thus ensuring that it does not emit radioactivity .
He also added that MSRs operate ata steady-state conditionn , with minimum excess nuclear reactivity .
This greatly reduces the radioactive emissions around the reactor .
Besides safety issues , the security of the nuclear reactors is another point brought up by critics .
The location of a nuclear reactor is to  terrorists an ideal bombing target .
In addition , in molten salt reactors , plutonium , a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons , is actually created during the process before it is reprocessed .
Critics fear that the plutonium might be stolen by terrorists to make nuclear weapons .
However , Idaho National Laboratory (2005) claims that the plutonium  remains in the salt and has high critical mass that makes it less desirable for use in weapons .
According to Butler (2004) , supporters are also positive that the plutonium obtained can be spiked with other chemicals or elements to make it  to steal .
This further supports the need for research and development on molten salt reactors .
As for  , the World Nuclear Association (2008) states that the basis of the design of the reactors assumes these threats .
There are sensors in the reactors that will shut down the entire reactor when there is any abnormality .
Having to incorporate all the safety and security measures makes the cost efficiency of the nuclear power plant  another concern .
The World Nuclear Association (2009) states that the cost of nuclear power generation has declined since the 1990s .
They also show statistics proving that although the construction cost of nuclear reactors is significantly higher , once the reactors are built , the nuclear generation cost is comparable to other energy sources .
In addition , Thornley (2009) claims that as compared to other energy sources ,   nuclear energy has the highest average capacity factor .
This means that nuclear power is the most efficient energy source .
Efficiency means lower costs .
Taking the MSR as an example , previous designs for the MSR used steam cycles for electrical production .
The current proposal uses the Brayton cycle which has advantages such as lower cost and improved efficiency .
According to Forsberg (2006) , there is a 4 percent increase in efficiency .
However , the MSR uses fluoride salt , which is more corrosive at high temperatures .
Thus , there are doubts about whether the MSR is a good choice .
Nevertheless , there is currently the carbon-based material which , according to Forsberg (2006) , is compatible with molten salt at high temperatures .
In other words , the corrosion will not be an issue .
In conclusion , I have to agree that the molten salt reactor is not perfect , but the benefits of the molten salt reactor outweigh the cons and supporters are optimistic about finding solutions to the problems , showing their potential .
This is proven from its low excess reactivity to decreasing maintenance costs .
Thus , I support the further research and development of the molten salt reactor .
A serious train calamity took place in Eschede on 3 June 1998 and claimed the lives of 101 innocent people while 88 were left severely injured (Sckhman , 1998) .
It was proclaimed to be the world's deadliest train accident .
Investigations proved that the derailment of the train was due to a single fatigue fissure in the wheel .
The steel tire had gotten loose from the wheel and was wedged in the rail carriages .
As the train passed two rail switches , the loosened tire knocked against a switch lever and pulled the train off the railway track , causing one of its carriages to crash into a bridge .
It is unimaginable that this minor fault is the main cause for this catastrophe .
At hindsight , it seems that this whole accident could have been prevented if more precautionary measures had been taken into consideration .
The numerous controversies over the actual cause of this accident revolve around the unsuitable design of the wheel , the inability and misconception of the conductor , the inadequate train repairs and the company guidelines for investigating the accident before addressing an issue .
After reviewing this accident , some experts have felt that incorporating a psychologist into the developmental process could have aided in preventing it .
This writer feels that the introduction of a psychologist in a team of design engineers would not have prevented the accident .
Nevertheless , the psychologist could have contributed to the design process by reducing the rate of accidents  .
A point to argue about is regarding the wheel design .
The train company , InterCity Expss (ICE) , had received complaints regarding the original train wheels causing serious resonance and tremors whilst travelling at high velocity .
Engineers resolved this problem by inserting a rubber damping ring between the wheel and the tire .
However , this design had never been used on high-speed trains before and thus failed to adhere to safety standards .
It is evident that had the engineers waited for the approval of the new wheels before  , this accident might not have happened .
A psychologist roped in to help the engineers may have been able to foresee this impending structural failure of the wheel and intervened before it was too late .
Another point lies with the company and the conductor .
Company policy stated that thorough examinations had to be done before taking any necessary action .
This led to the conductor refusing to stop the train even after a passenger raised concern regarding a damaged coach .
In addition , even after the conductor had verified the problem , he still  refused to stop the train and insisted on adhering to company regulations .
It is shocking to realize that this unique policy that ICE complies with differs from the traditional 'stop and examine' one .
This accident could perhaps have been averted if the conductor had used his personal judgment and halted the train when an unexpected problem was discovered .
It must have been pressure from the organizational management that made the conductor follow ICE orders and refuse to do what was right i .e .
stall the train .
In part , it can be said that the cause of the accident was ICE for forming this rule and the conductor's erroneous judgment .
After conducting a root cause analysis on the accident , a psychologist could perhaps have aided the company by vetting the flawed regulations to grant train conductors the power to make an assessment to stop the train should they receive any complaints from passengers .
Yet another point is  a simple fault found in the train's wheel .
This brought forth attention to the frequency of maintenance checks carried out by the train company .
ICE had claimed that they had conducted checks on the train on a regular basis using conventional flash lights .
This proves that checks were only conducted on the external structure of the train and not on the internal hardware and sustainability of the wheels to support the train's weight .
It is evident that ICE was too complacent and did not use more advanced technology to maintain their trains .
The aid from a psychologist in this aspect would have been limited as it deals with technical equipment and the views of psychological design would not have been implemented in this field .
After various considerations , this writer concludes that only one factor cannot be blamed as the sole cause of the accident .
Instead , it was various factors working together to create a chain reaction which led to the dire consequences .
In this train accident , the problems began from the preliminary wheel design that design engineers came up with , to the insufficient maintenance of trains and the operation mode ICE used .
The aid from a psychologist would have been inadequate in preventing the accident as the majority of the causes for this accident dealt with technical  aspects that psychologists do not have experience in .
However , the psychologist could have contributed to the intangible aspects of the company's routine like spotting the mistakes engineers sometimes overlook .
Hence , with the help of psychology design , the rates of accidents may reduce drastically .
Public opposition regarding the issue of nuclear technology has been evident ever since the Chernobyl and Three Mile accidents .
People are mostly concerned about public health and safety caused by radioactive exposures .
In the case of Shoreham , the nuclear plant faced strong opposition from both the people and the government .
Although Shoreham had a license for nuclear power testing , the plant was fully decommissioned in the end in 1998 .
Light Water Reactors (LWRs) make up the majority of nuclear plants in the United States .
Uranium is the primary fuel source in these nuclear plants .
Unfortunately ,  .
In addition , nuclear waste repositories require geological isolation  .
On the other hand , the concept of fourth generation nuclear power addresses the issue of  .
They are capable of combusting nuclear waste and leaving a minimal volume of waste with insignificant half-lives , thus addressing the nuclear waste problem .
The Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) is a type of fourth generation nuclear reactor .
The coolant comprises  a molten salt .
The concept of the MSR involves nuclear fuel dissolved in the molten fluoride salt as uranium tetra fluoride .
As such , the fluid would be able to rely on fuel that is dispersed in a graphite matrix with the molten salt providing low pressure and high temperature cooling , unlike in today's LWR's .
Thus , the MSR has the ability to work at high temperatures , at low pressures and at high power densities .
At higher temperatures , most of the reactor heat can then be transformed into electricity which ensures complete combustion of the uranium fuel .
Operating at lower pressures reduces accident risk  and  in the event of an accident .
The MSR can be air-cooled , making it capable of using waste heat for water desalination .
The turbines have also excellent thermodynamic efficiency due to the relatively high temperature it functions at .
Secondly , unlike traditional LWRs , refueling of the MSR can be done while the system is still in operation .
Fission products are removed and new fuel is added to portions of the fuel at a time , drastically reducing the cost operating the MSR .
The Obama administration was initially opposed to the idea of the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository .
The amount of money needed to build a nuclear repository isolated away from civilization cost up to $25billion .
There are better methods of using this sum of money collected from taxes from its people to solve the waste disposal problem .
The government should exploit the funds available to develop MSRs .
These reactors are capable of consuming existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity , and prevent nuclear waste from accumulating .
Accelerated development of MSRs will result in the US  successfully managing the nuclear waste problem and revolutionizing an entire new level of carbon-free energy that can last longer than just centuries .
Furthermore , MSRs are up to 300 times more fuel-efficient compared to  LWRs .
They actually provide a bit more than what most scientists expect from fusion as an MSR can be built in small 1 .2MW electric units .
A 7 .4 MW thermal reactor was built in the 1960s and operated for years ,  .
MSRs are also much more efficient than  helium-cooled Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTRs) operating at similar conditions , in terms of electricity conversion .
Apart from that , MSRs are capable of operating for several centuries with only uranium that is already present .
Thus , the claim of nuclear fuel mining using up fossil fuels and adding to the greenhouse effect is unjustified .
However , the high temperature and corrosive operating conditions of the MSR require materials that exceed the limitations of current nuclear reactors .
Materials used for these reactors require high dimensional stability and most importantly corrosion-resistance , due to the molten salt of MSRs being corrosive itself .
Some materials that are suitable include nickel-base super alloys , silicon carbide , specific grades of graphite and refractory alloys , which are expensive in nature .
Hence , the cost of operation will not be as price-friendly as claimed .
Nevertheless , the introduction of MSRs still deserves strong support as they are likely to prove to be the best solution for improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energies .
Prompt development of MSRs is especially required for  countries such as China and India .
These countries are unable to satisfy their energy needs  solely  based on the current available avenues for energy sources  .
In conclusion , nuclear energy from fourth generation nuclear reactors is the best substitution for coal and natural gas .
Current emissions of carbon dioxide from automobiles and industries are furiously contributing to global warming .
We have already crossed the threshold of acceptable greenhouse gas emission levels .
Thus , preventing accelerated climate change beyond human control is of the greatest priority .
According to a study done by the Sunssex Energy Group based in the University of Sussex , the world's fossil fuel supply is currently dwindling and will be running out within the next 20 years (Walker , 2009) .
Moreover , the increasing emission of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuel has been proven to be one of the factors  causing climate change (Jager , n .d .) .
These two major issues will lead to more people accepting the use of nuclear energy .
However , there remains doubt of the safety of nuclear reactors' operation and hence , the public might not fully  .
In order to make the nuclear reactor safer , cleaner and cheaper , the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) was established in mid 2001 to further research  the III generation nuclear reactors .
In late 2002 the GIF announced the six best reactor technologies which they believe  will become the future nuclear reactors .
The six technologies are the Very High Temperature Reactor (VTHR) , the Super-Critical Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) , the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) , the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) , the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) , and the Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) .
The few paragraphs below explain why you should support further research and development on the super-critical water-cooled reactor (SCRW) in terms of safety , security and performance .
The first reason is the safety of the super-critical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) .
The SCWR is basically a pressurized water reactor operating above the thermodynamic critical point of water .
The working temperature is about 510-550K and the pressure is 25MPa (Butler , 2004) .
many people may feel shocked at the high operating temperature and pressure of this reactor .
They will argue that the pressure vessel wall cannot withstand such a high pressure and the high working temperature will melt the core .
They worry that the will replay the accidents on the Three Mile Island on March 28 , 1979 and at Chernobyl on April 26 , 1986 ("Nuclear Disasters and Accidents") .
However , with the growth of modern technology , the SCWR has been designed with the pressure-tube design .
The success of this design eliminates the need for a thick wall vessel and minimizes the risks of explosion of nuclear reactors .
Furthermore , in this design the separation of coolant and moderator is introduced as part of a passive heat-removal system to minimize the consequences of accident scenarios where active cooling may not be available .
Decay heat will be removed through radiation and convection from distributed channels during accidents , and consequently fuel melting in the core will be prevented .
As a result , this design improves the safety of the SCWR .
The second reason are  security issues such as nuclear proliferation .
Nuclear power leads to potential security risks , as plutonium has to be separated out during the reprocessing of nuclear energy production .
Plutonium is a key ingredient of advance nuclear weapons .
Although the U .S .A . has decided to dump all the plutonium waste at  Yucca Mountain , the government never mentioned the level of safety that can be achieved .
Consequently , the public claims that nuclear power wastes create a high degree of proliferation risks and until today there is no solution for it .
Among the six generation IV nuclear technologies , only the SCWR and the VHTR do not require waste recycling .
In the super-critical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) system the waste recycling is optional , which means that the SCWR can operate without having to depend on the contentious reprocessing of plutonium waste (Butler , 2004) .
In conclusion , this technology is free of  proliferation risks .
Last but not least is the performance of the super-critical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) .
The SCWR is considered one of the most promising future nuclear reactors because of its high thermal efficiency .
The use of the multi-pass flows system in the SCWR allows the production of process heat on demand and improves the thermal efficiency .
The thermal efficiency of SCWR is about 45% , which is much higher than the generation III light water reactor of 33% of thermal efficiency (Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR)) .
Moreover , the distributed fuel channels in the SCWR allow the system to optimize fuel bundles into each channel .
Thus , an appropriate fuel cycle , flow , cladding temperature and independent power distribution can be achieved , which ensures the stable and predictable performance of the reactors .
In conclusion , the super-critical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) has been proven to be cleaner , safer and better performing as compared with the generation III nuclear reactors .
In addition , to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide from  burning fossil fuel , we should now support further research and development for the super-critical water reactor (SCWR) .
The super-critical water-cooled reactor is the best future reactor to generate sufficient energy to fulfill the energy needs of the public .
The atomic bombs dropped on the island of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during the Second World War and Chernobyl Nuclear plant that caused two explosions in 1986 have raised eyebrows about thevastating effects of nuclear energy .
The Chernobyl disaster , especially , exposefission reactionsons of people to radioactive chemicals and has been linked to many for them torms of cancer in Eastern Europe and Russia , as well as destroying animals and plants .
These two incidents have highlighted the power of nuclear energy , which has caused so much controversy as to whether it has become a liability or a source of energy to the world .
Electric utility reactors heat water to produce steam , which is then used to generate electric energy .
In the Chernobyl nuclearworld's electricity came from nuclear power , despite concerns about safety and radioactive waste management .
More than 150 of such plants were built .
In this way , nuclear power has become an independent source of energy to meet the rising demand of a country and an increasingly growindestroyedopulation .
These reactors can also be used to split hydrogen from water thermochemically .
Many countries around the world that largely dependisd fossil fuels for their energy needs are betting on hydrogen as the fuel of the future , using fuel cells to convert the gas into electricity for cars and homes .
Research has been done by many countries to improve on generations of reactors , some of which are in operation now .
The latest theoretical nuclear reactor design has been drafted up by a consortium of ten nations that are planning the nuclear reactors of tomorrow .
The Generation IV reactors are expected to be available by 2030 .
These new plants would operate at high temperatures to improve their efficiency and they would include simplified safety features that rely on non sophisticated back up systems to eradicate any problems .
One such reactor that we could see in the near future is the Very-High-Temperature-Reactor (VHTR) , which allows for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity , up to more than half of what could be produced previously .
The problem of high operating temperatures is eliminated by using coolants that use inert helium .
Another important point to consider is that nuclear energy is not a source of carbon dioxide emission , unlike the burning of fossil fuels .
With the "greenhouse" effect and the environmental issue of global warming , nuclear energy has come at the right time to slow down the melting of the ice caps and stop the rise of sea levels .
will includewill operateAs much as there are many positive reasons to use nuclear power , many people still have their doubts about this source of energy , mainly due to the fact that they remembered the infamous Chernobyl incident and the atomic bombs of World War Two .
Any accidents could lead to widespread damage and nobody can afford another radioactive leakage which could signal thenergy demandof nuclear energy .
Despite a generally high security standard , accidents will , nonetheless , happen .
Technically , it is almost impossible to build a plant which is totally safe .
There is always a chance of the plant failing .
The consequences of an accident would be absolutely devastating for both humans and nature , as in the past .
have been the caseIn addition , the power plants , together with the nuclear waste , could be targets for terrorist attacks .
No atomic energy plant in the world could withstand an attaremember to the infamous 9/11 .
Such a terrorist act would have catastrophic effects for the entire world .
Researchers have not solved the problem of radioactive waste produced by plants .
This waste from nuclear energy is extremely dangerous and can be used for the production of nuclear weapons .
The question now is: Is there a future for nuclear energy ?
The sustainability of nuclear power is questionable .
Nuclear energy uses Uranium as a form of energy , which is a scarcthe infamous 9/11 incidentetically , the supply of Uranium is expected to last for about 50-60 years .
We can say that nuclear energy is a non-renewable resource .
Nuclear power is not just an energy technology .
It is a unique blend of technical , economical , political and military interest .
In my opinion , there is no future for nuclear power because: chances of an accident which will release radioactive waste into the atmosphere is too high , there are still no safe solutions for the growing pile of deadly radioactive wastes , and reprocessing of this energy is dirty , dangerous and costly .
From the above discussion of the pros and cons of nuclear energy , it should be clear that nuclear power cannot be a solution to any problem that we are facing today .
In any case , it is a source of many other problems we could face in the near future .
Nowadays , the issue of nuclear power is being discussed frequently .
Nuclear power is a new energy source and has a lot of potential to be discovered and explored .
According to Declan Butler (2004) , nuclear power will not release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide  , and global energy demands are predicted to double by 2050 .
Therefore , the nuclear option has now become a viable alternative to be considered .
However , there are many uncertainties regarding safety in the processes found in nuclear power plants .
Many accidents and tragedies have happened .
Studies (Recently in Nuclear Accidents Category , n .d .) state that in  2008 , there was a plutonium leak at the Austrian IAEA Facility and a uranium leak at France's Tricastin Nuclear Facility .
In  2009 , a fire broke out in Unit 1 of Ukraine's Rivne Nuclear Power Plant .
Although these accidents did not cause any people to die , it reminded people that  nuclear power is not as safe as people think .
One system-the Emergency Response Information System (ERIS)- has hence been developed to enhance the safety .
When  something happens , the system will function immediately to respond to the incident and therefore adequately save the nuclear workers and the general public .
However , in some aspects , this system still has many defects in terms of its feasibility and performance .
In carrying out the ERIS , many training courses and regular exercises are essential in order to make the nuclear worker able to deal with radiation leaks or other accidents .
These essential courses and exercises will cost a lot of money to carry out .
Besides the cost of training , money is also needed for introducing  advanced technology skillsas well as modern facilities and equipment into the nuclear power plants .
According to H .J .
Laue (1982) , a total number of 400 experts in more than 60 Member States as well as the advanced equipment cost US $10million .
This is a big amount and thus needs a consortium to raise .
However , there are many obstacles and contradictions in finding a big consortium to raise these funds .
Hence , the ERIS is not feasible enough to be carried out .
Furthermore , this Emergency Response Information System may not be reliable as well .
In order to provide quick and effective response to any nuclear emergency , this system requires a complete round-the-clock operation centre (Asculai & Collins , 1988) .
There must be a very close connection between each stage of the system's operations in order for the system to perform well when incidents happen .
Even at midnight , there must still be workers to monitor the system to ensure that the system is functional for 24 hours .
Furthermore , most of the public are ignorant and do not have much knowledge regarding this system .
They do not know what they should do if there is an accident .
In addition , the government should also have good coordination with the nuclear power plants regarding  safety issues and be very clear of what they should do with this system when an accident happens .
Although this system is efficient to protect people when incidents suddenly happen , nobody can give a 100% guarantee that this system will perform well as this system consists of many operation stages and requires a wide range of people to monitor it .
Thus , what is the most efficient design to enhance the safety of nuclear power plants ?
Many researchers are dealing with this issue now but no one can design  the most efficient system to enhance such safety .
Therefore , many proponents still support the Emergency Response Information System .
They claim that other than the problems of cost and performance , this system is still very important and functional when nuclear accidents happen .
This system is believed to be the best system so far to protect  nuclear workers and the public  rather than  other methods such as probabilistic safety assessment because the ERIS is more practical  protecting people directly after an incident happens .
To sum up , theEmergency Response Information System is a effective system that protectsthe public if an incident happens .
However , it has to be improved on and developed more in-depth to ensure its safety and enhance its feasibility .
The countries that are developing this nuclear power (only five countries-China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom and the United States) must make good use of the nuclear power as the energy source for people's daily use .
People will definitely not give up this nuclear power as it has a lot of potential as an energy source .
Therefore , developing a design to enhance the safety of nuclear power plants becomes a long-term project of the world .
Consequently , the nuclear power source will be extensively used by the public  .
Mankind has been exploring various methods of obtaining high energy output to sustain the usage of energy supply for our daily lives , resulting in the expansion of the energy supply industry .
In its early days , nuclear power was seen as offering a potentially limitless source of energy .
However , this promise is notably associated with the technologies , the costs and the precise features , which were not yet known with high precision then .
There are various reasons leading to why expansion of nuclear power has faced problems through the years , such as the public's objection (Butler , 2004) .
On top of that , there are other factors that contribute to why further research and development of nuclear power should not continue .
For instance , the Very-high- temperature reactors in the generation IV reactor concept (Butler , 2004) , which still requires further development in the aspect of safety at this stage , is rather  .
Firstly , all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle involve potentially harmful effects on the environment or mankind due to the high reactivity , the radiation emitted by nuclear wastes and the huge heat dissipation during nuclear processes .
Any flaws in the reactor design or processes could result in disastrous circumstances .
For instance , the Chernobyl accident is still causing deaths years after the accident , with victims mainly dying from cancer caused by exposure to radiation from the highly radioactive waste products released after the massive steam explosion , which occurred due to system flaws , and a second non-nuclear explosion (International Atomic Energy Agency , 2006) .
A 2005 report entitled The Chernobyl Forum , prepared by the International Atomic Energy Agency and World Health Organization , attributed 56 direct deaths and estimated over thousands more deaths among the most highly exposed people .
Another example is the Three Mile Island accident , which occurred due to a partial core meltdown in one of its units (Corey , n .d .) .
The above examples illustrate the potential dangers of nuclear power due to its explosive and radioactive characteristics .
The radiation coming from the nuclear wastes will not only produce  instant harm , but also a long-term effect on residents in affected areas , spreading across generations .
Keeping that in mind , the gas-cooled fast reactor , one of the generation IV reactor concepts , which requires research on irradiation- resistance material ,  .
Furthermore , the need for research on heat resistance material and security in the various generation IV reactor concepts is also worrying in terms of the possibilities of nuclear accidents in the future .
Secondly , arguments are that nuclear power is the best alternative because of the characteristic of not producing combustion-related air- pollutants that will lead to global warming , and because of the huge power supply it provides .
In addition , nuclear power uses uranium , which is a scarce resource that is only expected to last for another 30 to 60 years , as fuel .
Therefore , uranium will soon deplete and we will need to search for a new form of energy supply .
Thus , the huge amount of funds pumped into research and development on nuclear power , which will not support us for the long run , is not cost-effective .
Moreover , renewable energy technologies are now expanding faster than nuclear power technologies (Natural Resources Defense Council , 2007) .
They are equally environmentally-friendly and the depleting of resources for renewable energy is of no worry since the reactants are renewable .
Last of all , one of the most promising and nerve-racking reasons is the risk of development of nuclear weapons in an era of transnational terrorism (Gaukler , Barnett , & Rosinski , 2002) .
Terrorism is one of the most troubling global issues in recent years .
The improvement in technologies of the nuclear power would also provide  in handling nuclear weapons , so any leakage of details could result in development of nuclear weapons , which in the time of translational terrorism is almost inevitable .
It is also worrying that nuclear power plants may be the target of attack for terrorists due to their destructive nature .
Therefore , there will be a higher risk of  nuclear warfare .
The result will be disastrous .
In addition , the need for research on security in various reactor concepts of generation IV is also disturbing .
To summarize , nuclear power has various  that could affect the well-being of our environment and health that cannot be neglected despite its numerous benefits .
In addition , there are better alternatives such as  renewable energy that will be able to support our energy needs in the long run .
Hence , the funds pumped into the development of nuclear power should instead be used in the development of renewable resources that are more cost- effective .
In Singapore , according to the Ministry of Manpower (2009) ,  about a total  of 11000 cases of fatal and non fatal  occupational accidents occur in Singapore and 60 people die in these accidents per annum .
The accident of the Nicoll Highway Collapse in  2004 , which is one of the most catastrophic accidents in the construction sector of Singapore ,  took away 4 lives .
According to the accident investigation report (Ministry of Manpower , 2005) ,  found that the main cause of the collapse was due to under-designing of the retaining wall which could not handle the stress of holding up the tunnel .
Although some people might think that the effectiveness of psychology in preventing accidents from occurring is controversial ,  I believe that the use of psychology during the design process could have prevented this accident from occurring .
Many people think that not only the Nicoll Highway Collapse incident , but also most of the major occupational accidents were unexpected and  mainly caused by errors in human judgment .
They believe that psychology could have done nothing to prevent the accident from occurring (International Labour Organisation , 2000) .
However , in certain aspects , accidents can be prevented if psychology is introduced to  during the design stage .
According to the Heinrich Domino theory ,  an accident is caused by the chain reaction of a series of factors .
Moreover , "Heinrich proposes that the removal of unsafe acts and unsafe conditions will prevent accidents , as  his research it was found that these were the direct or immediate causes of most accidents" (Singapore Polytechnic , 2008) .
In the United Kingdom , the approach of understanding human behaviour was used in a practical set of Human Factors Analysis Tools (HFAT) which was developed by Mr Ronny Lardner & Mr Richard Scaife .
This made significant enhancement in the steel- making , chemical manufacture and construction industry in preventing accidents at work .
Besides that , with this Human Factors Analysis Tools (HFAT) , the originatorsalso won the Occupational Psychology Practitioner of the Year award in  2006 (Division of Occupational Psychology , United Kingdom , n .d .) .
Most people claim that accidents are unpreventable because a malfunction in a product is due to inadequate design that might cause accidents to occur , which is beyond the control of human capability (Wilpert , 2007) .
However , this kind of situation can be easily prevented for a well designed product , if psychology is put into consideration during the design process .
(Association of Independent Consultants , Inc , n .d .) .
These could assist the engineer to experience and discover the limitations and weaknesses of the design and improve on it .
They may take into consideration of the Fixed Guard design (Singapore Polytechnic , 2008) .
This design has no moving parts and prevents access to dangerous parts at all times by enclosing the hazardous operation completely .
The safety level is 100% even when there is a malfunction of the system during its operations , so no one will get injured  .
Moreover , many people in the construction industry think that accidents caused by natural disasters and unfavorable working environments is something beyond the human limit and  are unavoidable (Julian , 2007) .
For example , a landslide occurs on a work site due to soil erosion after a heavy downpour .
This may be out of our control , yet it is not 100% inevitable that accidents cannot be prevented from occurring in this kind of situation if approached with psychology during the design stage .
According to Michael F . O'Toole (2002) , assistant professor from Western Michigan University in industrial psychology , "Accident investigation is about finding fact not fault" .
It is used to identify the cause of the accident so that corrective measures can be taken to prevent such similar cases from occurring .
Carrying out research studies on related issues or consultation of expertise would help the engineers to understand and envisage the possible accidents that may occur due to the surrounding environment (Association of Independent Consultants , Inc , n .d .) .
Therefore , they may apply appropriate measures to eliminate or minimize the potential risk with respect to the unfavorable working environment , such as strengthening the slope with grout anchor tie back , and using an inclinometer to monitor the slope condition .
To summarize , the approach of applying psychology  throughout the design process of a project such as understanding  human behavior and knowledge on how accidents occur may help to prevent them from occurring .
Studies on related industrial accidents and accident investigations , the ability to envisage possible accidents that may occur , and working with a psychology practitioner could eventually help to minimize and prevent the occurrence of accidents due to errors in human judgment , malfunctioning of products , and working environment factors .
In conclusion , although accidents are unexpected , it is possible to minimize and preventthem from occurring  by using the psychology approach in design processes .
It has also been proven to be effective in accident prevention as the MOM has made an obligatory requirement that all work sites must employ a Work Site Safety and Health Officer before the commencement of a project (Singapore Polytechnic , 2008) .
According to a recent US poll , a significant 44 .7% of the respondents think that nuclear is somewhat dangerous or very dangerous .
And they are not wrong in thinking that , given However ,t the radioactive uranium used as fuel is inherently dangerous , being extremely lethal to human health and polluting to the environment .
To address the safety concerns of the public , this design envisioned many safeguard systems .
A NEA report stated that a 'three barrier pbringle' will be implemented , and there will be 'cladding at fuel levels; vessels and primary circuit' .
This means that the radioactslatedar fbecomel be well contained by three separate layers of shielding material , greatly reducing the chances of leakage .
Furthermore the report emphasized the employment of 2 separate and redundant heat removal systems .
One is a passive system that uses natural convection while the other is an active system that uses circulators to pass the gas through the reactor core .
The coolant will be helium , an inert gas that is much safer than the sodium liquid used in sodium-cooled fast reactors .
A major constraint of nuclear power is the tricky issue of waste disposal .
Nucleanuclear energy productions need to be stored in deep geological repositories for thousands of years .
Hence the treatment of nuclear waste will be a major public concern .
A key feature of the gas cooled fast reactor is that it is a fast neutron reactor that fully recycles actinides .
According to 'Nucthe designgas cooled fast reactorincludes published on Nature , '96An of spent fuels consist of uranium and plutonium' in other words more fuels can be generated if the wastes are to be reprocessed .
In the gas cooled fast reactor , radioactive byproducts are recycled and the waste eventually produced will only be a fraction of that produced by reactors with once through uranium fuel cycles .
In addition , as the design is a fast neutron reactor , it produces excess neutrons which can be used to transmute the nuclear waste to isotopes of shorter half-lives , reducing the toxicity of the waste .
This design also addresses a security concern of nuclear waste reprocessing .
Currently , in the logistics of reprocessing , nuclear wastes are transported to reprocesHence ,facilities which recovers the urisnd plutonium before sending them to another mixed oxide fuel (MOX) reactors to be burnt as fuels .
This involves frequent transportation of highly dangethe article , 'Nuclear Power's New Dawn' , over long instances .
This exposes a security risk as an accidentplutonium'; in other words ,dioactive materials or a hijack can send these ials into the hands of terrorists .
However a report by Hussein Khalil from the Argonne National Laboratories in USA envisioned 'an integrated , onsite spent fuel treatment and refabrication plant' .
This essentially obliterates the security risks involved in transporting radioactive wastes and allows security efforts to be focused on plantintotself .
the plantLastly , this design is commthetted to becoming asurroundingustainable form of nuclear power .
Contrary to popular beliefs that nuclear energy is renewable , uranium is actually a rare element that carecoverleted .
In this aspect , the gas cooled fast reactor is attractive as it boasts higreactorciency in converting heat energy into electricity than conventional nuclear reactors .
This is achievable by running the reactor at 850 C , a temperature that is kept in check by the helium heat removal system .
The higher efficiency if this reactor design together with the recyclHowever ,wastes , meant that the same amount of fuel will produce electricity mathe USAtenvisionsthan the conventional reactor .
that produced by themany times more the electricityIn conclthe gas cooled fast reactor advantages of the gas cooled fast reactor looked extremely promising .
It addressesbeliefblic's concern about safety with a very comprehensive safeguard system .
Although nuclear waste remains as problematic , it is reduced to a minimum .
Above all , it shows the potential to be sustainable , an advantage that can allow it to be built on a large enough scale to shoulder a significant portion of the world's energy needs .
Therefore its research and development should supported and properly funded so that one day it can reach its full potential and alleviatemeans of the world's energy problems .
Global warming has become a concern to people due to its high emission of greenhouse gases from  energy usage .
To reduce the carbon dioxide emission , a new energy source which can provide sufficient energy with the least emission of greenhouse gases should be considered since the energy needs of every country is rising .
Nowadays ,  engineers and industries are very interested in nuclear energy , which can provide up to 80% of the electricity in France (Butler , 2004) in a cost effective way via mass production .
However , there is always a great concern held by the public regarding the safe operation of nuclear reactors and radioactive waste management .
According to a research study ,  accidents involving nuclear plants are much fewer than those involving traffic , suicides and fire (Cohen , 1990) .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF)  , a research and development group organized by ten nations to carry out research on the next generation of nuclear concepts , is identifying and selecting six nuclear energy systems with a variety of reactors , energy conversion systems , and fuel cycle technologies .
With GIF's nuclear technology , the concerns of the public mentioned above would be addressed .
Among the six generation IV reactor concepts , the most advanced concept is the VHTR (very high temperature reactor) which is a more efficient way of converting heat energy to electricity and which can provide 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel compared with other conventional nuclear plants .
Hence , with VHTR technology , nuclear energy can be a very reliable energy source for electricity in many countries .
Regarding nuclear power plants , the safety features of the plant is the greatest concern of the public .
There were nuclear accident hazards all over the world  a few decades ago; for example , the reactor core explosion at Chernobyl in Ukraine killed many people , with two people dying in the initial explosion and other deaths resulting from radiation poisoning (Gramling , 2009) .
The VHTR system has its own safety features such as a very high system temperature , enhanced goals for safety and reliability , low decay heat load , low power density with  and so on (Idaho National Laboratory) .
The core is composed of non-combustible nuclear grade graphite which has a very stable structure even at high temperatures and high heat capacity .
Thus , the possibility of explosion due to the very high temperature becomes extremely low .
Moreover ,  additional safety features such as how to minimize  damage and protect lives if an accident occurs will also be developed further (Lee , 2005) .
Another concern regarding nuclear power plants is how to dispose of the nuclear wastes which are long lasting , radioactive and toxic .
As the VHTR operates at a very high temperature , there are fewer wastes to reprocess than those of other systems .
Moreover , the reprocessing will  96% of the nuclear waste produced , which consists of plutonium and uranium , and only about 1% of long lasting elements are left as residue .
There are also additional steps of processing to convert those long lasting wastes into elements with shorter half- lives , i .e .
they may take just centuries to decay instead of more than 300 ,000 years (Butler , 2004) .
Hence , nuclear waste disposal will not be a great concern in the future .
Nuclear terrorism has always been a threat to the world since the sudden attack on Hiroshima in 1945 .
The VHTR is carefully designed to discourage weapon proliferation and to increase assurance that  are very unattractive and are the least desirable route for  ,  .
Moreover , the plutonium , which is the main ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons , produced from the nuclear waste cannot be picked up safely with a pair of gloves like pure plutonium as it is spiked with radioactive and heat-producing elements to make it easier to handle .
Hence , it would be harder for terrorists to steal or use the material  .
Since the VHTR is still undergoing research , the earliest delivery will be in 2020 (Butler , 2004) .
Further security features can be added before the delivery time .
With the  security system developed ,  nuclear terrorism can be prevented .
In conclusion , in view of the increasing global need for more energy globally , nuclear energy will become essential in the future once issues such as safety  , waste management and potential exploitation of plutonium proliferation by terrorists areaddressed .
This , in fact , has become possible after the development of the VHTR which incorporates  features that minimize the risks of accidents and enable safer disposal of nuclear waste .
Therefore , research for VHTR technology should be funded for further development to reach its optimal potential .
In our modern technological society of today , people make substantial use of electricity for their daily needs .
In the United States alone , people use close to 4 million  kwh of electricity daily .
In addition , as society grows , the demand for such energy grows as well .
The usage of fossil fuel as a fuel at power plants is projected to increase by 44 percent from 2006 to  .
In this new dawn , nuclear power is a new technology set to replace fossil fuel .
With promises of lower cost , less waste and a safer alternative , it may seem that nuclear power with the introduction of generation IV reactors such as the super-critical-water- cooled reactors is the next generation of power plants .
However , these promises are revealed to be empty promises if one looks deeper into the issue of nuclear Power .
Therefore , support of further research and development funding for nuclear power should not be continued .
Supporters claim that a nuclear plant is more cost efficient as compared to the current fossil fuel plants .
The cost of a nuclear plant can be divided into 3 main parts: capital cost , operating cost and fuel cost .
It is claimed that the capital cost of a nuclear power plant is $9 / MWh  , which is the same for a coal plant , and the fuel cost is very low at $5 / MWh as compared to $11 / MWh for the coal powered one .
Therefore , it may seem that nuclear power is a cheaper alternative .
However , what they fail to realise is that these costs are only present prices .
They will increase as time goes by .
For example , the construction cost of the nuclear power plant does not just stop there .
These plants often have design flaws which require extensive reviews and changes .
All these would incur more costs .
The operating cost of the plant includes its daily operations and also the disposal of the waste , which is not a simple affair of just dumping it at dumping grounds .
These wastes are radioactive with a very long half life .
Full disposal of it will incur very high costs in the long run which are often not factored into the operation cost of a plant .
Hence , the nuclear power-plant is not as cost efficient as it may seem .
With regard to safety , it has been reported that there are more cases of fatalities for coal powered plants than their nuclear counterparts .
In the last 40 years , 6400 individualshave died due to coal power plant related accidents while only 31 have died in nuclear powered ones .
Therefore , it is claimed that nuclear plants are a much safer choice .
However , we cannot ignore that Murphy's Law will still hold .
There will be a point in time when there will be an error which could result in an accident in anuclear power plant one day .
This single incident will have catastrophic effects and the fatality rate will be  substantial  .
In the Chernobyl disaster alone which happened on 28 April 1986 , 47 people died on the spot with 4000 more who subsequently died from cancer .
The effects of the incident are still greatly felt today with the radio activeness of the area still at a record high despite three decades of clearing up .
Hence , we only need one nuclear accident to cause the kind of damage  a coal plant would take more than 50 years to cause .
Further to what has been pointed out , nuclear power will also evoke security issues in the region .
While used as a a form of deterrence , it is also seen as a threat by neighbouring countries .
This will lead to an arms race which might inevitably cause some conflicts in the region .
An example is the nuclear program of Iran .
Iran has developed its nuclear program as form of deterrence and to build up national pride .
However , many neighbouring countries see these reasons as an excuse for the building of nuclear weapons so they feel threatened .
Hence , many conflicts have resulted .
From this , we can see that nuclear power  brings issues to not only the country which is developing it but other neighbouring countries in the region as well .
To conclude , with so many flaws in the claims of benefits from supporters of nuclear energy , it will be a wiser choice to delay if not stop further research and development funding for it .
The price for a small mistake in the pursuit of nuclear energy is too much for mankind to pay .
Alternative sources of energy should be considered instead .
Electricity has become an important component of the human world since it is needed to power and sustain technology .
However , since a large amount of electricity is needed , commercial power generators have been built to convert  fuel into electricity .
While there are many types of fuel that can be considered , coal has been the popualr choice .
Another option , which is nuclear energy , had been explored with moderate success but currently only holds a 17% share as a global energy supply (Butler , 2004) .
However , development of the technology used by nuclear reactors are still on-going with the recent introduction of Generation-IV nuclear reactor concepts , one of them being the molten salt reactor .
The molten salt reactor , while not exactly a new idea , has resurfaced after the introduction of the generation IV concepts of nuclear reactors .
The major draw in continuing the research of molten salt reactor is its potential to make converting electricity from nuclear energy much safer , more environmentally friendly and more economically viable as compared to current reactors .
One reason that impedes the continuation of research of the molten salt reactor is the general caution on the issue of nuclear waste proliferation .
A key step in current nuclear power generation , which is separation of the by-products in the nuclear reactor wastes , would yield materials usable in the creation of highly destructive weapons .
However , the design of molten salt reactors allow for on-site reprocessing of the reactor waste , followed by a direct feed of the recovered and reusable fuel back into the energy generating cycle (Uhlir , 2007) .
This will ensure that the majority of the fuel is burnt in the process , leaving very low levels of remaining enriched fuel that can be extracted for use for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .
The  alternative to replacing coal is arguably the use of solar or wind energy .
This will alleviate the current problem of emission of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal , but unlike nuclear energy , solar and wind energy is highly dependent on the weather , making it unreliable .
The heat and high amount of electricity generated by the molten salt reactor , on the other hand , can be said to be constant and can be further tapped into for the production of hydrogen (Duffery , 2005) .
The hydrogen produced by the reactor will have further uses as fuel for other systems where its combustion will not produce any greenhouse gases .
The continual research of the molten salt reactor will also result in the use of nuclear reactors being more economical compared to the current situation .
For example , the amount of uranium currently mined from the earth's surfaces have been approximated to last for another 100-200 years as fuel for the reactors (Lightfoot , Manheimer , Meneley , Pendergast , and Stanford , 2006) .
Molten salt reactors can also use thorium as fuel , reserves of which are estimated to be four times larger than that of uranium (Duffery , 2005) .
However , since the fuel is expected to be close to , or completely , burnt up in the molten salt reactor as opposed to the case for current reactors , this higher level of fuel efficiency can drive the duration for which the uranium reserves can sustain the global energy comsumption longer than estimated .
The increase in fuel efficiency will reduce operational cost since there will be less need for storage of long life radioactive waste products .
In addition , considering the development of advanced materials in the further research of molten salt reactor , the actual amount of materials needed in the building can be reduced , thus reducing overall cost .
For example , by replacing the stainless steel commonly found in reactors with other alloys that are equally strong or alloys that are stronger and more durable , and that do not use nickle , the cost of building the reactor can be reduced since the price of nickle has been increasing in recent times (Busby , 2009) .
While the use of nuclear energy raises some concern in terms of security and cost , the continuous research of molten salt reactors can address these concerns through the recycling of fuel and the use of a different variant of fuel .
However , while the research cost of a reactor is very high , this can be solved through the cooperation of more countries , especially the larger  countries like China .
In the long run , one of the benefits of using molten salt reactors would be that it can meet  energy demands while maintaining a clean environment .
In the recent two decades , whether to adopt nuclear energy as a sustainable source of energy has become one of the heated arguments in the world .
scientists state that coal and fossil fuels on earth are depleting at an alarming rate and would be running out in the next century .
Nuclear energy has thus emerged as one of the most viable solutions .
However , due to the strong oppositions from the public about the safety of nuclear power plants , many countries are caught in the dilemma of whether they should build a nuclear plant or not .
It is indeed true that a country must not ignore the safety factors of building a nuclear plant .
However , in the current situation where there are no better alternatives , nuclear energy seems to be the most suitable energy for the future and therefore one of the generation IV reactors , the lead-coaled fast reactor , should be adopted as the solution .
Firstly , the argument raised by most opponents is the safety issue .
They declare that the nuclear reactions which may be termed as nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are extremely dangerous and even fatal to human beings .
The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was a reminder of the importance of  safety .
30 people were killed (mostly by high levels of radiation) during the accident and many more were injured or adversely affected .
It was indeed a disastrous accident which subsequently made nuclear plants appear to be scientific devils .
However , the reactor used in fact lacked some basic engineering provisions for safety , probably due to technological constraints at that time .
However , with advancements in science and technology nowadays , the level of danger of the nuclear reactors would be minimised to the lowest degree .
The generation IV reactor , the lead-coaled fast reactor , is the safest one among the four being proposed .
It is operated under low pressure which means that the nuclear reactions are less vigorous .
In addition , the operating temperature allows a range of 550 to 800 degrees .
This medium range of temperature increases the functional capacity of the reactor as compared to those which only operate at a fixed temperature .
On top of that , lead which is used as the main source is a less reactive metal compared to sodium for sodium-coaled fast reactors .
Therefore , safety is ensured to the greatest possible level .
another opposing view is that the cost of building a nuclear plant is rather high .
They insist that fuel is still a cheaper source of energy than nuclear power reactors .
The fact is , however , the other way round .
Gas-fired power plants are very cheap and quick to build , but  very expensive to operate due to the cost of their fuel .
In contrast , nuclear power reactors are expensive to build but relatively cheap to operate .
It might take millions of dollars to build the lead-coaled fast reactor , but once it is constructed , it will be operating at a reasonably high capacity over many years .
Furthermore , the cost for mining out and transporting  coal and fuel is also very expensive due to their scarcity whereas the sources for nuclear power plants are much cheaper since plenty of uranium can be extracted from the earth's crust .
The abundance of uranium on earth also means that it is a more powerful way of generating electricity .
Most importantly , the waste generated by the lead-coaled fast reactor can also be recycled and thus there is virtually no pollution to the environment .
Hence , in the long run , it is more economical to adopt the lead-coaled fast reactor which is also an environmentally friendly source of energy .
The final argument advanced by opponents is that there are other  sources of safer energy such as solar energy and wind turbines , so there is no need to adopt the nuclear power reactors which are still untested .
Recent research indeed shows that the sun is a variable source of energy .
In addition , thermal energy can be stored in a system so that solar energy will still be available even at night .
However , can we really solely rely on  ?
What will happen during the rainy seasons and will there be enough solar energy to sustain our daily usage ?
The answer is most probably not .
We would still have to rely on other sources when solar energy runs low at times .
On the other hand , unlike solar energy , the provision of nuclear power by lead-coaled fast reactors does not depend on weather or location .
As long as the nuclear sources such as lead and uranium are provided , energy will be generated .
Therefore , the lead-coaled fast reactor is a more efficient and reliable energy source .
All in all , with the depleting sources of coal and fuel , lead-coaled fast reactors will be the most likely alternative energy source in the future .
With advanced technology and engineering designs , the safety of nuclear reactors will be ensured  .
It is also a relatively economical and yet efficient source of energy .
Therefore , such  nuclear power reactors should be adopted in the future as a promising source of energy .
The world depends largely on external energy to operate all activities in the society .
The world's main energy resource , which is  fossil fuel , is slowly depleting .
As a result , there is a need to depend on  alternative energy resources to satisfy our high energy demands .
Nuclear power has proven to be an effective energy source as it can generate electricity efficiently to satisfy the world's energy needs .
However , there are many controversies over the use of nuclear power , and many critics criticize its use .
Some of the gravest concerns that are widely mentioned are safety , costs and  performance .
Safety issues raised by past nuclear accidents still strike fear in the public's heart .
An example of such an accident is the "the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , during which the reactor core exploded , (killed) some 31 people immediately and (spew) radioactive debris across Europe ."
[1] The high cost of building nuclear plants is also a main concern .
Articles have shown that many experts agree that nuclear power costs significantly higher  relative to the other major energy sources .
[5] Moreover , there are still many doubts about whether nuclear power has a competitive edge over other  energy providers in terms of performance .
With all these concerns on the use of nuclear power , it seems that nuclear power poses more of a problem than a solution as a beneficial energy source .
However , with the building of generation IV reactors such as the VHTR , problems that the old generation reactors faced will be greatly reduced , making nuclear power a viable energy source .
Regarding  safety concerns , opponents of nuclear power might argue that nuclear reactors are potentially dangerous as the effects from any nuclear accident would be disastrous to both the environment and the people .
However , Generation IV reactors such as the VHTR have advanced safety mechanisms which will minimize the probability of accidents occurring .
The VHTR is capable of dissipating  heat even under severe accident conditions and its graphite structure is able to withstand high temperatures to prevent itself from self-sustained combustion .
[2] According to the "Four levels of Safety" (by(By Professor Lawrence Lidsky , MIT) , the VHTR is the only reactor that meets the level 1 safety criterion , which means that it is immune to major structural failure and operator error .
[2] Therefore , the VHTR will be a safe nuclear reactor , liable only to minor accidents .
Regarding cost  , critics might debate that the high financial costs in building nuclear plants worldwide will create a negative impact on the worldwide economy .
However , although the cost of building nuclear plants is high , future benefits from nuclear power will be able to boost the economy greatly .
For example , hydrogen produced in the nuclear reactor would be used to power the next generation hydrogen fuelled cars .
In comparison to other  hydrogen producing methods , the the VHTR produces hydrogen at a lower cost .
[4] Statistics show that "VHTR produces hydrogen at $1 .40/kg , steam reformation of hydrogen costs  $6 .30/MBtu while MHR produced hydrogen costs  $1 .52/kg .
"[4] In addition , using the VHTR to produce energy would reduce the economic costs spent on controlling carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels .
Regarding performance , critics might strongly argue that the frequent unplanned nuclear shutdowns [6] would make nuclear power the most inefficient energy among all energy sources .
However , no external energy source in this world is perfect .
For example , solar power cannot be generated at night and wind energy cannot be harnessed without wind .
Sun , wind , tides and waves cannot be controlled to directly provide either continuous base-load power or peak-load power when it is needed .
[7] Therefore , nuclear power will still be a preference to other alternatives as it does not depend on the inconsistency of nature .
In addition , the VHTR gas turbine system can generate electricity at an efficiency of 50 % whereas existing nuclear power plants generate at only 33% efficiency[3] , making it one of the best performance nuclear reactors .
In conclusion , nuclear power is most preferred as an energy source in terms of its performance and efficiency .
In comparison to older generation reactors , Generation IV reactors will have better safety and cost effective features .
The VHTR is one of the best generation IV reactors , making it one of the most reliable energy providers in the future .
Hence , further research and funding for the VHTR will definitely benefit the future generations .
It is the 21st century and the world energy consumption is on the rise .
With this prominent trend , there is a pressing need for the world to increase the amount of energy production .
Currently , the world energy consumption is supported largely by natural fuel .
According to Marshall & Robert  (2000) . , the rising costs and rapid depletion of natural fuel has led to the search for a more sustainable energy source .
Thus , countries are focusing on the development of nuclear reactors , the most viable energy source that seemingly appears to be endless .
The most promising concept of the latest generation IV nuclear reactors would be the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) .
Another popular concept would be the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) .
However , in terms of safety , costs and overall performance , the VHTR would be the best nuclear reactor to be implemented (Marshall & Robert , 2000)
According to Butler , safety is a main priority in the designs of new nuclear reactors due to the previous nuclear disasters of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
Hence , we shall first look at the safety aspects .
The Sodium-cooled Reactor boasts a passive cooling system with a large thermal inertia .
There is a large margin between the operational temperature and the coolant boiling temperature .
This would mean a relatively safer work environment in addition to the low operating pressure conditions .
However , the passive cooling system of the SFR has major flaws .
It is unsafe in the sense that it does not allow for critical intervention in times of emergency .
The cooling system will have a slower response time .
Moreover , sodium as a coolant is radio-active , which requires additional safety measures to neutralize its harmful effects (Butler , 2004) .
In comparison , the VHTR model uses helium , which is an inert gas , as its coolant and thus would be much safer than sodium .
The cooling system of the VHTR is a helium turbine system , operating separately under stringent human control and thus allowing for quicker actions to be taken in the event of overheating (US .
DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2002) . .
Cost factors are also taken into consideration given the scale of the nuclear reactors .
The Sodium-Cooled Reactor is claimed to be cheaper in terms of research costs .
Given that the technology base exists for the SFR , it is said that not much additional extensive research has to done .
However , this is not the case .
In actual fact , many technical viability issues are waiting to be resolved .
According to the US DOE Nuclear Research Advisory Committee , due to the instability and radio-active state of sodium , more research has to be done to find suitable materials for its reactor's primary core (US .
DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2002)
The Very High Temperature Reactor would be a much cheaper option as the core for its plant has been confirmed to be graphite .
As Sterbentz brought up in his report on the VHTR , graphite is a much more stable and cheaper material in comparison to the suggested cores for the SFR .
In addition , with low reactions to heat and chemical irradiation , replacement of the graphite cores only need to be done around once in five years (Sterbentz , 2007) .
According to the Austrian Institute of Ecology  ,the performance for the SFR was rated highly  for its closed fuel system which recycles 99 .9% of the actinides produced in its process .
There is close to no nuclear waste produced by the once through system .
However , the net plant efficiency of the SFR is only around 40% .
The energy output is much less than the VHTR models which will exceed 50% .
Furthermore , the VHTR produces hydrogen in addition to electricity .
This additional fuel production would mean a larger net output by the VHTR in comparison to the SFR(Austrian Institute of Ecology 2007) .
In conclusion , the Very High Temperature Reactor would be the best nuclear reactor concept to implement .
Whether it is about safety  , cost or performance level , the VHTR is a notch above its peers such as the SFR  .
The VHTR's potential as the best nuclear reactor is recognized by many countries like France , Japan and the United States of America .
It is given the most funding and research attention by these countries .
Future world energy consumption is well taken care of .
Globalization has caused the demand of oil to surge  to the extent that the supply of crude oil can not match the demand for it , hence leading to a shortage of oil .
Thus , an alternative energy source is needed .
Nuclear energy is considered by some as the most promising energy source that could replace the depleting crude oil .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) , an organization formed to further develop  nuclear energy has come up with six generation IV reactor concepts (Burthler , 2004) .
Since there are a lot of benefits in using nuclear energy , especially energy from the very high-temperature reactor (VHTR) ,  further research and development on  nuclear energy sources should be encouraged .
Nuclear energy sources have various benefits over other energy sources .
Firstly , a nuclear power plant is more cost effective to operate as compared to other energy sources .
For example , although the start-up cost of building the VHTR plant is very high , which is up to US$10 billion  , it is cheaper as compared to other fuel , such as bio fuel , in the long run .
This is because hydrogen gas is produced during the nuclear reaction process(Burthler , 2004) .
Hydrogen gas can be used as a fuel to power vehicles .
Consequently , many countries have regarded VHTR as the energy source of the future , because it produces hydrogen gas as a complimentary energy source that is reusable .
the reactor can separate hydrogen gas from water thermodynamically during the nuclear reaction at an extremely high temperature of about 700-900 degrees celcius(Burthler , 2004) .
Additionally , according to the economics concept , there is less third party cost incurred by others if nuclear power is used instead of other fuels .
It is also relatively cleaner to the environment as compared to other sources of fuels .
Thus , the sum of all the variouscosts of producing nuclear power is relatively lower than  other sources of energy .
Thus , further improvement should be made to the VHTR to increase its efficiency .
Secondly , a nuclear reactor , especially the VHTR , produces less waste as compared to other  energy sources .
It is known that a large percentage of the greenhouse gases present today is due to the use of petroleum and  combustion of fossil fuels .
The burning of fossil fuels also produces other waste products that are harmful for the environment .
On the other hand , even though the VHTR produces nuclear waste which will emit harmful radioactivity , the industry has come up with effective ways to dispose of the nuclear waste .
One such method is to bury the nuclear waste in the ground .
Research has shown that the radioactivity that is produced by the nuclear waste under the ground is equivalent to the radioactivity emitted by  cosmic rays .
Thus , humans are safe from the radioactivity produced by the nuclear waste .
That is , nuclear power , especially that produced by the VHTR , is a much cleaner source of energy to the environment , so further research and development should be done on it .
Critics may argue that the security measures used in a nuclear power plants are inadequate , and this will endanger the safety of the people living close to the nuclear power plants .
Indeed , the aftermath of an explosion of the nuclear power plant would be harmful .
For instance , it was shown from the Chernobyl incident that an explosion in a nuclear plant would cause cancerous effects on  human beings , and this effect would last for a few centuries (Caldicott , 2006) .
However , according to the GIF , the six nuclear reactor concepts being researched by them , including the VHTR , incorporate a high security-proof mechanism .
As the new plants would include safety features that are not solely dependent on any sophisticated back-up system ,  they are 'meltdown proof' , which means that they can reduce their temperature to the accepted temperature range in the event of an accident , with little human intervention .
(Burthler , 2004) .
Hence , the safety aspect of the people is well taken care of even if there is any terrorist attack on the nuclear power plants .
Therefore , more research should be carried out on the nuclear power plants .
In essence , nuclear reactors , especially the VHTR , are more cost effective in the long run as compared to other energy sources .
In addition , nuclear energy is less harmful to the environment and it is safe to humans .
Moreover , it has been shown that the VHTR is 40% more effective in producing energy as compared to  other sources of energy .
Thus , in my opinion , more funding should be provided for  research and development to further improve the production of nuclear power , and the research should focus more on the VHTR .
The usage of nuclear plants to generate electricity has been a controversial issue since decades ago , due to the disastrous incidents on Three Miles Island and at Chernobyl , which have resulted in major health issues caused by radiation exposure .
The public  has been rejecting the construction of nuclear plants due to safety concerns .
However , as technology has evolved with time , the Generation IV power plants are better in terms of security , cost and performance .
Hence , more people are accepting the usage of nuclear energy .
In 2008 , a survey showed that the number of Americans that supports nuclear energy has increased from 10% in 2001 , to around 50% in 2008 (Jones , 2009) .
Half the public is still opposing the usage of nuclear energy .
One of the main reasons stated by the opposition is that nuclear plants consume uranium and produce nuclear waste , which could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons .
Furthermore , the nuclear waste emits radiation that is harmful to humans and the environment .
However , these situations can be prevented with Generation IV molten salt reactors .
The molten salt reactors are capable of recycling the nuclear waste to produce more electrical energy , so the waste created from the recycling process will not be available for creating nuclear weapons .
This process also helps to prevent the existing practice of spending large amounts of money  to store the nuclear waste .
In addition , the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has set up necessary guidelines for  governments to ensure the highest level of security for their nuclear facilities .
The Generation IV plants are built to shut down automatically in the event of a meltdown or terrorist attack (Butler , 2004) .
To prevent the escape of radiation which resulted in the Chernobyl incident , the new plants are built with shielding that can prevent radiation from escaping into the surroundings in case of a meltdown .
Opponents have also argued that renewable energy sources are better sources of energy as theyproduced cleaner energy when compared to nuclear reactors , which produce radiation and nuclear waste .
In addition , renewable sources are also unlimited , whereas uranium will last another two centuries at most (Fetter , 2009) .
Thus , they believe that governments should spend the money on research for renewable energy instead of nuclear energy .
On the other hand , with the technology of Generation IV reactors , the radiation and nuclear waste can be eliminated .
Furthermore , the electricity produced from renewable sources like solar energy is measured in Mega watts per hour , while the electricity produced from nuclear plant is measured in Giga watts per hour , so one thousand times more energy is produced .
In comparison , the biggest solar power generator located in California is able to support half a million users , less than two percent of the city population (Wolff , 2007) , while a single nuclear plant is able to provide electricity for a few cities .
The vast difference in energy produced supports the funding for research in nuclear energy .
Another issue is that uranium is finite like fossil fuels .
By allocating more funds into the research of nuclear energy , scientists can look for possible alternative elements to fuel the nuclear plants .
Another reason mentioned by the opposition is the extremely large amount of money spent on research and construction of nuclear reactors .
Every year , governments that are supportive of nuclear energy have spent billions of dollars on it .
In 2008 , the United States Government increased their budget allocation for nuclear energy and the research and development for Generation IV power plants to twenty-five billion dollars (Barnett , 2008) .
The opposition has stated that the power generated is not worth the cost , as the cost is accumulated from  .
However , in the long term , the power generated will be worth the large amount of money , as the usage cost from nuclear plants is lower than the usage cost from fuel plants .
Furthermore , no greenhouse gas is being produced .
It is definitely worthwhile spending more to protect the environment .
In conclusion , governments should support further research and development on nuclear energy as the security concern regarding nuclear waste can be eliminated; moreover , nuclear plants are the most efficient energy source and the cost of nuclear energy is the cheapest in the long term  .
With further funding on the research , humans will be able to produce energy  in the long run without damaging the environment .
robotic surgical technology is a prototype and a new breakthrough in the field of engineering and medicine .
It enhances surgical procedures through improvements in dexterity and precision .
The robotic system uses fine , precise robotic arms and its three dimensional high resolution computed image guides the surgeon during an operation .
This advanced dexterity and precision of operation will eliminate the need for large incisions on patients .
According to a report (Guru , 2007) the rate of survival of every fifty patients of mean age 68 years old undergoing Robotic Radical Cystectomy is 98% , whereas according to Kyung Hee University , Seoul , Korea Cancer Research and Treatment (2005) , for the traditional Radical Cystectomy surgery , the survival rates are 62% for males and 39 .4% for females , with mean patient age of 62 .8 years old .
Thus , it has been proven that the robotic surgical system has a significantly more positive clinical result as compared to the conventional surgery method .
However , although the initial clinical outcomes are positive , safety is a major factor why the robotic surgical system still remains fearful to the public .
Safety concerns involve technical credibility , surgical liability and operation performance .
Even though there is no guarantee that the robotic surgical system can absolutely ensurethe safety of patients , the design of the robotic system can nevvertheless improved to enhance safety .
Currently , the robotic surgical technology has not been widely accepted by the public mainly due to its uncertainty in safety .
During an operation , the condition of the patient is unpredictable;  many tasks and decisions need to be made involving the surgeon , the nurses and the robotic system .
For example , when tools are changed , the robotic system needs to be paused in order to replace a surgical tool .
During this process , the surgeon has no direct access to the situation; the system relies largely on verbal exchanges between the nurses and the surgeon to coordinate the surgical procedures .
The differences in perspective  with respect to the patient's condition and the robotic system create safety issues , mainly due to the potential of miscommunication .
In order to enhance safety , a common ground needs to be built through ensuring similar speech patterns .
Therefore , communication between surgeons and nurses can be improved by the sharing of a common set of statements and ideology .
Although the robotic system has improved greatly in its dexterity ,  its full potential in terms of instrumental design and sensory sensitivity has yet to be developed .
This poses uncertain dangers during an operation .
According to Zorn (2009) , no credible system is currently available to assess the capability of a surgeon while operating the robotic surgical system .
Dr Kevin Zorn recalled an incident where a patient died from complications after long hours of operation using the robotic surgical system .
In order to improve the system's safety , the future of the robotic system can be expanded using ultrasound and infrared .
More ideal mechanical surgical tools are to be developed .
In addition , the surgical equipment occupies a large space which may restrict the movement of nurses and cause delays during an operation .
miniaturizing the equipment will help address the problem and also save cost in making room for the accommodation of this expensive equipment .
In the end , however , , despite all the development of ideas to improve on safety , cost is the major concern as to whether these ideas can be implemented .
The surgical system is an expensive technology whose initial cost is 1 .5 million dollars each with maintenance costs of hundreds of thousands each year .
This high equipment cost induces an increase in surgical costs of over thousands of dollars .
Moreover , laboratories are currently working on the development of new devices to enhance safety during operations .
Subsequently , this development will induce a higher capital cost of equipment .
However , if we compare the cost of conventional surgery with the cost of the robotic surgery , knowing that  most cases of robotic surgery optimize chances of quicker recovery which implies shorter hospital stays , the difference in cost imposed by the use of the robotic equipment will be balanced off in comparison to the cost of hospital stay for the conventional surgery , so cost will not be a constraint in the enhancement of safety .
During the past few years , there have been discussions on whether nuclear power plants should be built or not .
For the past few centuries , most of our electricity has been generated from coal , fuel or oil refineries .
However , as the population increases , there is a higher demand for electricity , so more raw resources such as fossil fuel have to be used .
Recently ,  the rate of depletion of fossil fuel has been increasing , leading to a higher electricity cost .
As a result , more people are turning to nuclear power  as a solution to the high electricity cost .
However , before we change to nuclear power  , there are some factors we need to consider .
The factors which would be discussed are  cost , security and performance .
Some of the reasons why people are opposed to the idea are  the high construction cost and level of danger of nuclear power plants .
However ,   because of the lower electricity cost and the ability to meet the world's demand in the future .
Despite  opposing views ,  further research and development funding for the Very-High-Temperature-Reactor (VHTR) should be encouraged .
Firstly , in terms of the cost factor , according to Michael (2009) ,  uranium , being the raw resource for nuclear power  , has been proved to be able to meet the need of world demand for hundreds of centuries .
Due to its abundance , the cost price of uranium would be cheaper  compared to that of fossil fuel .
Besides this , the mining cost of uranium Is also very cheap .
these factors result in  low operation costsof nuclear power plants .
The Economics of Power (2007) ,  shows the  of US electricity production costs from 1995 to 2008 .
The book compared the cost of electricity generated among oil , gas , coal and nuclear plant .
In 1995 , the initial cost ranged from 2 .0 cents per kilowatt-hour to 6 .0 cents per kilowatt-hour , with the increasing order from nuclear , coal , gas to oil .
However , bythe year 2008 , the cost of electricity generated from oil plant had increased to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour , whereas for nuclear , the cost had remained constant over the years .
However ,   people are claiming that the construction cost of a nuclear power plant is too high , although in the long term , the low production cost would have an edge over the construction cost .
Since the cost of fossil fuel is soaring high now , if we still continue to use it , we would have to pay a very high electricity cost when compared to the cost we would have to pay for electricity generated by nuclear energy .
Once the construction cost has been recovered ,  .
Thus , in terms of the cost factor , it is still an advantage to the public if we  use nuclear energy in the long run .
The second factor is security . .
According to Bulter (2004) , the public has highlighted the accidents which occurred in 1979 at Three Mile Island and in 1986 at Chernobyl  .
Some of the reasons that these accidents occurred are due to poor technology at that time .
However , in the case of the generation IV reactor , it has been claimed that there would be a security feature called the "Meltdown" Proof which would reduce the temperature to a minimum in the event of an accident .
As technology advances over the years , we can foresee that the chances of accidents  occurring will be reduced .
Thirdly , in terms of the performance factor ,  Bulter (2004) claims that the VHTR could squeeze 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with conventional plants .
Engineers have agreed that in order to reach such efficiency , higher temperatures would need to be generated , thus causing a higher chance of accident .
Once again , this could be resolved by the "Meltdown" Proof mentioned earlier .
In conclusion , we can see that even though there are some disadvantages of the nuclear power plant , it is still beneficial to the public if we  operate it in the long run .
The advantages of the nuclear power plant outweigh its disadvantages .
The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of the six generation IV reactors which need to be developed .
The six generation IV reactors are the vision of the future of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) .
GIF looks at the future with nuclear reactors in its mind , because it believes the current coal-burning source of energy would not be sufficient for the world's need by 2050 (Butler , 2004) .
In addition , GIF believes the coal- burning is contributing to global warming by  carbon dioxide (CO2) into the air .
The six generation IV reactors are believed to be able to replace coal mines .
These six generation IV reactors are still in the testing and research phase .
GIF is researching them in terms of their safety  , their cost effectiveness and their effect on the environment because these are the public'sconcerns about them .
First of all , the safety factor of  nuclear reactors has been highlighted over the past decades by the nuclear-averse public .
This is due to  memories of  past accidents involving the partial meltdown of nuclear nuclear reactors .
Looking back at a few decades ago , there were two accidents which brought the world's attention to the importance of safety in the nuclear reactors .
In 1979 , on Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , there was a malfunction in a cooling system which caused part of the reactor core to melt and some radioactive gas to be released into the airwas , fortunately , not enough to cause any radiation dose  .
In 1986 , at Chernobyl , Ukraine , a flawed reactor design that was operated by untrained personnel and without proper regard for safety , exploded and released at least five percent of the radioactive reactor core into the atmosphere and the surrounding area .
The two accidents  caused people who lived nearby the nuclear reactors to suffer from the radiation .
Since then , no new nuclear power plants have been built .
The nuclear-averse public oppose the development of generation IV reactors because they are afraid such accidents will happen again and cause more damage to the people who live nearby nuclear reactor plants .
However , such an argument ignores the fact that generation IV reactors have a 'meltdown proof' feature .
This feature would simplify safety features; hence we would not need to rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators .
This is because generation IV reactors can cool themselves down in the event of an accident with minimal human intervention (Butler , 2004) , thus preventing the meltdown accident from happening again .
The second factor is the cost of building  nuclear reactor plant .
The nuclear-averse public oppose the development of generation IV reactors because they are too costly to build .
It is true that a country needs to put billions of dollars into the research and development of nuclear reactor plants .
This is because it is beneficial for the country in the long run .
With the increasing  population , the demand on  energy sources will increase .
One alternate energy source which has been suggested by many  scientists is nuclear energy .
This is because with the same amount of raw materials , a nuclearreactor plant can produce up to ten times more of the energy produced by a the fossil energy plant .
Lastly , the third factor is the effect of nuclear reactors on the environment .
The nuclear-averse public oppose the development of generation IV reactors because they are worried that its waste will pollute the environment .
The waste of the nuclear reactors will last for a few years on earth before it starts to deplete .
It will pollute water and air .
However , if it is handled with a proper method , we can recycle it .
GIF is researching a proper method for recycling the waste from nuclear reactors .
When GIF have found out the proper method of recycling , the public can live with ease nearby the nuclear reactor plants .
To conclude , the nuclear-averse public oppose the development of generation IV reactors because they do not fully understand the concept of generation IV reactors .
Once GIF is able to produce the generation IV reactors , the nuclear-averse public should be able to understand and support their development .
Hence , the very high temperature reactor should be further researched and developed .
Some op21stnts arguedthe energy issuefhas becomethe nuclear reactor cannot be guaranteed , and such dangerous power plants should er be built .
They thought that the waste was radioactive and may cause health problem tothe people around .
But the real sThus , ithas becomes not as worse as they thought .
Besides , the molten salt reactor can solve these problems perfectly .
It is written in Generation VI Reactors (20 that the molten salt reactor uses liquid sodium fluoride as coolant which dissolves the uranium and circulates through graphite core .
In this way , fission products can be remd continuously and actinides as well as plutothe moltenan be fully recycled .
It meansresearchingo radioactive waste in the whole process .
Therefore , their concern about radioactive waste is not necessary .
Some opponents argue that even though there is no radioactive waste of the plant , the reactor itself is a big safety problem; the reactors maythinke likenuclear wasteeisles in the United States and causeproblemsers .
However , Aaround the reactorngHowever , Power Uprate Safety & ContainbadOverpressthink5)In additionajor safety problem for the reactor is that the balcompletelynergy generating and energy removing may be broken due to some reason .
This will cause the temperature andas the coolant ,ure of the coolant to increase .
As a result , the reathe graphite explode because of overpressure and will release large amounts of radioactivity .
But for the molten salt reactor , accordinThisto Dr . Paul Pickard (2002) , there is lower pressure in it as the boiling pothe concernn salt is 1400  .
Besides the terfoundeday cause accident is low due to the continuous removal of mobile fission product .
In addition , the molten salt can absorb lots of heat with little change in temperature .
All these guarantee that the balance cannot be broken easily .
As a result , the molten salt reactor is quite safe .
Furthermore , it is mentioned in Power Uprate Safety & Containment Overpressure(2005) that an entire system which is designed to match the energy produced by reactor and the energy removed can effectively prevent accident from happening is now used in each reactor in America .
In molten salt reactor , a better or at least the same system will be used to ensure the safety of the reactor .
the molten salt reactorhappening ,accidentsthus effectivelyand canthe reactorsystem ,be easily brokenwill notThe opponents aargueargue that the cost of the nuclear reactor is sot is not worth to be builta lot It cannot be denied threactorf nuclear reaconomics Of Nuclear Power(2008)according in America , the electricity cost for nuclear energy per kwh was 8 .34 cents while the cost of coal energy was 8 .51cents .
Besides ,generatednal cost incremovedhe polluaffectedo environment of nuclear energy was 0 .4eruo cents/kwh while for coal energy it was 4 .0 euro cents .

One major problem is to find the material which has a high resistance to the corrosion of the molten salt .
Further research and development is worth and needed to be done to oMoreover the challenge cost ,to turn this reactor into rethe environment

According to TeManysman , VHTR is able to retain "the desirable safety characteristics offered by modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactors "(Ehresman , 2009) .
Besides , it is shown in the repoin populations .
Sterbentz thathas explodedble to "increathe main source of energyr , whichndera non-renewablenditionsresource ,entz , n .d .) for VHTR .
Thus , it is reasonabthisto assert that safety in the design of VHTR is ensured .
Someall since accident happened in history andsignificant amountssed huge disaster .
They failed to consider that the broken reactors were the first generation reactors and technsogy by then wfearfulot mtheirre and well developed .
After decadthat happenedveloping , nuclear technology now is more advanced and most importantly , safety in design is largely enhanced .
It is not right to deny the future of nuclear industry simply because of the accident happened in the past .
Hence , safety is ensured in the design of VHTRa smallshould be further researched and developed .
and itthe VHTRIndeedaccidentsthe nuclearhas beenVHTR has high working efficiency .
Tthe VHTRHTR operates at about 1000 Celthe VHTR degree which is enough to produce hydrogen .
Thus , VHTR produces electricity , hydrogen and large amount of process heat concurrentlyFurthermore working process .

Nuclear power  is electrical power which is produced from controlled nuclear reactions (France , 2005) .
Although nuclear power can produce a much more significant amount of electrical power compared to other forms of electrical energy , its safety  makes the public concerned about nuclear power production .
Moreover , cost and environmental issues should also be considered .
Among many nuclear reactors built all over the world , one type of reactor is the "Sodium-cooled fast reactor" which is operated at a temperature of 550 degree Celsius under low pressure .
The power output of this reactor is electricity  .
However , nuclear power is not an efficient way if we consider the storage and safety issues of nuclear materials as well as the huge cost of nuclear power plant construction (Hannity , 2009) .
On the other hand , many countries , such as Pakistan , Japan , China , India as well as the United States are active in nuclear power production regardless of the concern of the public over the safety issue .
The World Nuclear Association has stated that on average in every 17 days , one new nuclear reactor was set up during the 1980s and this rate may increase to one nuclear reactor per every five days in 2015 .
In 2005 , 2 .1% of world energy was provided by nuclear power and 14% of electricity was produced by nuclear power in 2007 .
Although nuclear power plants' construction cost is much higher compared to the cost of other alternative sources , for example , solar panels and wind turbines , nuclear power has efficiency output and sustainable energy .
The lower initial cost of alternative sources  but  nuclear power should be considered (Gonyeau , 2009) . .
Supporters claim that third generation power plants would be cheaper as well as faster to construct than second generation power plants ,based on previous experience of constructing nuclear power plants .
However , there is also proof that some of the new generation reactors cannot fulfill their promise .
For example , Westinghouse claimed that its advanced AP1000 would cost $1000 per KW construction cost , be completed within 3 years  and would provide cheaper electricity than fossil fuel generated electricity , including Australian Coal power , with no sequestration charges .
But the promise was fulfilled ; the construction cost was over $3500 per KW which was even higher than the cost of the previous generator (Group of Physicists School of Physics at the University of Melbourne in Australia , 2009)
Since nuclear power plants do not release any harmful materials , nuclear energy is ideal  .
A nuclear power plant emits significantly low carbon while fossil fuel pollution kills around ten thousand people per year in the United States due to respiratory problems .
However ,  some opponents also claim that an average nuclear power plant creates twenty to thirty tonnes of high level waste per year and that waste has to cool on site for at least five years before they are moved .
According to oneenvironmental  group , Yucca currently fills up 2495 tons of nuclear waste  (The Charlotte Observer , Hauter , 2004) .
Some people claim that the chances of accidents at  nuclear reactor plants are very low because of advanced technology .However , the accident at the Three Mile Island Unit2 nuclear power plant which has been the most serious in the US ,  as well as the explosion at the Chernobyl power station , prove that nuclear reactors are still dangerous and not 100 percent secure .
Besides killing people on the spot , increased radiation was also detected around the area of explosion .
The number of deaths by cancer also increased because of these incidents .
Not just health and environmental facts , but psychological factors should also be considered .
The worst situation is using nuclear power as a weapon (Walker , 2004) .
In conclusion , nuclear power should not be widely produced because of security as well as environmental issues .
Alternative energy sources such as wind , solar , hydrogen as well as water should be used instead for a more secure future for the next generation .
Recently , there has been an increasing debate about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Evidence also shows that very few new reactors have been built since serious accidents took place due to explosions or meltdowns of nuclear reactors in the 1980s (Butler , 2004) .
To date , people are still suffering a lot of the repercussions from these past incidents .
However , with the expected increase in energy demand worldwide and the growing awareness of global warming , climate change  and sustainable development , the new Generation IV (Gen IV) nuclear reactors seem to be the ultimate solution to these problems .
According to Gerstner , the Gen IV nuclear reactors will promise  safe , economically competitive , proliferation-resistant nuclear power without the danger of increasing greenhouse gas emissions .
Many developed countries are starting to express interest in this new nuclear technology and some have even formed a consortium to pool their expertise and funding to carry out research on the six most promising prospects for the future Gen IV reactors .
Thus , I agree that there should be  research and development (R&D) funding for the Gen IV nuclear reactors .
According to Reuters (2008) , the Electric Power Research Council in the United States has said that there will be a need for some 35 more {nuclear power}[] plants by the year 2030 .
Finland , France and the United Kingdom are preparing for new reactor building programmes while China is planning to build 40-50 fission plants within the next two decades (Gerstner , 2009) .
As more countries are planning to build more nuclear reactors to meet the increasing energy demand and to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels  , some unprecedented construction projects are expected in the next 20 years .
Clearly , a plan is needed to deal with the resulting increase in nuclear waste .
The existing technology is to store the waste on site , but it can be politically sensitive - Yucca Mountain in Nevada is  .
Reprocessing the spent fuel is another alternative to reducing the waste volume by a factor of two or three .
However , this is expensive and inefficient and poses a nuclear proliferation threat .
The Gen IV reactors aim to develop  waste-free nuclear energy by burning up fission waste , leaving a residue greatly reduced in both volume and radioactivity (Gerstner , 2009) .
However , the challenges liein the complication of building a nuclear fission reactor and the lack of funding to carry out research in this area .
Although it would take years to develop such advanced technology and probably cost quite a large sum of money , research studies have to be done to tackle the faster mounting nuclear waste problem .
Opponents of nuclear energy claim that before the first  of the Gen IV reactors will be built , optimistically in 2030 and possibly 2040 to 2050 , solar power systems would already be highly mature and widely developed  .
However , a report ({McLaughlin}[HYPERLINK: http://www .associatedcontent .com/user/1887/brant_mclaughlin .html] , 2007) pointed out that most  solar power plants can only generate power at 20% of their average efficiency .
What that means is that most photovoltaic (PV) panels convert only about 20% of the captured {solar energy}[HYPERLINK: http://poweredbysolarpanels .com/solar-energy-advantages-and-limitations/] to electricity .
Even the most advanced designs using silicon are only able to operate at around 40% efficiency .
Nuclear reactors can produce greenhouse-gas-free energy which currently contributes to 15% of the global electric power .
They are more efficient and require less resource to operate , compared to fossil fuels and solar energy .
Thus , it is important to channel  funding to the R&D for Gen IV reactors as they provide the energy that will meet our future energy needs .
There is a profound need for a new generation of nuclear reactors as they not only bring cleaner energy for our future generations but they are also a waste-free , terrorism-proof and affordable source of energy .
Although the nuclear industry faces a lot of challenges in the form of nuclear accidents , high capital costs of constructing new plants , and the need to establish final repositories for spent nuclear fuel , the nuclear energy industry has experienced economic and regulatory recovery in many parts of the world in recent years .
As countries such as China and the U .S . are showing interest in constructing new nuclear power plants , large amounts of nuclear waste is expected in the next 20 to 30 years .
Hence , channeling funds to the R&D of Gen IV reactors is necessary as it helps to solve the waste problem .
With rapidly rising demand for eneVersus thetists and big energy companies are aggressively looking for an alternative source of energy to fossil fuel which is a depleting natural resource .
In addition , burning fossil fuel emits greenhouse gas , a main cause of global warming .
Therefore , scientists and engineers are placing high hopes on the new generation of nuclear reactors which are seen as a clean source of energy without emission of green-house gas .
However , some people argue that nuclear power is unstable , extremely dangerous and expensive based on past nuclear accidents and technical hurdles .
Fortunately , generation IV nuclear reactors are in the horizon , promising "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant" nuclear power plants ("Nuclear Power's New Dawn" , 2004) .
In this essay , I will compare two outstanding generation IV models: the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) and the sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) , and argue that the VHTR is safer , more economical and proliferation-resistant than SFR .
more proliferation-resistantIt is said that the VHTR has not achieved the goals of simple operation and transparent safety concepts because it does not have a passive heat removal system (Generation IV International forum , 2008) .
This is not true as the VHTR is develogasesg a passive heat removal system that could achieve a higher level of safety which is not dependent on human's intervention .
However , the VHTR is initially designed to use helium as its coolant which is not the gasest suitable base on past nuclear accidents and technical hurdles , some an instant passive heat removal system .
In order to achieve a more effective heacause of a superior heat transport characteristicsonAccording to "GIF R&D outlook for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems 2009" , molten salts can enable 4 to 6 times higher power density with passive safety features compared with helium .
Therefore , it is highly likely that an effective passive heat removal system would be achieved for the VHTR in the near future .
Even though the VHTR excels at safety , economical factors would still be the most crucial deciding factor .
Proponents of SFR claim that the VHTR would incur a higher capital investment .
AsForumtter of fHowever , this the overall cost of building , operating and maintaining of the VHTR is mocanst-effective than the SFR .
According to "Cost Estimating Guihuman For Generationear Energywasystems" , the VHTR has a lower overall cost of building , operating and maintaining compared with other models of generation IV (2007) .
Outdoing the SFR , the VHTR has lower fuel cost and higher hydrogen production due to its higtheir operation temperature , allowing high burnup of the fuels .
Moreover , the VHTR adopts a closed cycle to ensure thorough burning of transuranics .
In a nutshell , the V
In contrast to the SFR , the VHTR is resistant to nuclear weapon proliferation as it abandons the reprocessing process .
The reprocessing process incorporated in the SFR extracts plutonium , which is an indispensable part for nuclear weapons .
According to "GIF and geration IV" , among the six nuclear powfor thereactors , only the VHTR does not have this process .
The reprocessing process is mainly aimed at cutting down the amount of waste finally produced .
Because VHTR is operated at an extremely high temperature and within a closed circle system , high utilization of uranium can be achieved even without reprocessing .
The VHTR prevents potwhich allowsua highrburn-up ratethat the SFR may lead to .
Thus , theFurthermore , in conclude , simple operation and transparent safety concept is inherently embedded in the VHTR , ensuring high level of safety .
The VHTR is more economically competitive than the SFR by lowering the overall cost of builofg , operating and maintaining .
The VHTR also has the unique feature of proliferation resistance among generation IV reactors which would prevent potential nuclear wars .
Therefore , the VHTR is the one which is the most likely to achieve the vision of "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation rescycle" nuclear power .
Design is the basis of developing a product .
Be it a simple everyday product or a complex product like a nuclear plant , engineers will have to take into consideration  future needs while being creative and also without jeopardizing the functionality and the usability of the product .
As psychology studies human mental functions and human behavior , we are able to pin point human errors and thus  minimize design mistakes and prevent accidents from happening .
In my opinion , as the human factor always plays a part in  major industrial accidents , the use of psychology during the design process stage can help reduce these accidents .
One major engineering accident was the Eschede train accident which happened in Germany (Wilpert , 2007) .
The accident  , which happened in June 1998 , caused a total of 101 deaths and 88 injured .
This incident was not caused by failure of only one component .
Rather it was caused by the interaction of multiple factors like human error and design mistakes .
In this case , we are able to relate psychology into the factors and examine how pscyhology could have prevented it from happening .
The original set of wheels used by the train were monobloc wheels .
However , the wheels appeared to be too noisy and vibration could be felt in the train cabin .
Therefore , the engineers came up with a similar design to what the trams were using  to solve the vibration issue .
The new wheel was wrapped  with a thick layer of rubber  .
The layer of rubber helped reduce the vibration .
The design was not tested but it proved to be reliable because over the years it did not have any major problems .
However , according to Khandani (2005)  the final phase of a proper engineering design process is testing .
Prototyping is a process to test the design under real conditions .
In this process , engineers might discover design flaws and make the necessary changes to the design .
The engineers of the Eschede train made a mistake in neglecting this important step in the design process .
If prototyping had been done the accident might not have happened .
Before the derailment of the train ,  .
The train conductor or a passenger may have prevented the train accident if they had pulled the emergency brake .
The subsequent accidentwould not have happened if a passenger or the conductor had possessed adequate problem solving skills .
The passenger could have pulled the emergency brake himself instead of notifying the conductor .
The train conductor would have been able to stop the accident from happening if he had not followed the company's policy for stopping the train .
The railway line in Eschede is a quadruple track .
It separates the high speed trains  from the slower trains .
The railway track used by the Eschede train involved in the accidentwas not dedicated for high speed trains .
However , it had been upgraded  so that it could be shared between high speed trains and  slower trains .
In addition , rail switches were used to maximize the usage of the tracks .
The rail switches transferred the trains from a slow track to a fast track and vice versa .
However , seconds before the accident happened , the wheel rim which pierced through the cabin floor slammed against the rail switch , forcing some of the train cabins to disconnect  from the first cabin and switch to another track .
The entire disconnected cabin was thereby thrown off the bridge .
In conclusion ,  is undeniably desirable as it makes our life better .
However , besides focusing on the improvements offered by a new design , one should also pay attention to the possible tradeoffs .
When the improvements in a new design are unable to compensate for limitations , designers should abandon the design .
If we put much consideration of the psychological approach into the design process , many accidents can be avoided .
The use of psychology would assist engineers and designers to think creatively and better and therefore they will come up with safe and good inventions .
In addition , by exploring further  the psychological aspect and applying it in our daily routines , many of such major accidents can be prevented or minimized .
Chernobyl is not the only serious accident of nuclear plant in the past .
There was another nuclear plant accident in three mile island in US .
As these disasters happened over and over again , the problem that how to improve design process should be concerned indifferent perspectimetersow about taking account of psycholobe used

Someider wonderifeit isl as an example .
As mentioned in th .
preceding paragraph , Chernobyl was considered as the technological catastrophe .
But  ,was it just caused by technological errors ?
No , it also included human factors .
Let's take a quick view of the accident .
The normal , the Chernobyl incidenttaff at the plant were planning a test on reactor four .
The first thing working againathen is that another power pHowever ,on the circuit went down , so Chernobyl was producing more power than usual to compensate .
Then the look atff never ran the test .
Nobody ever told the night staff not to do it , so they tried to perform the test as planned .
Then , the reactor started getting out of control .
The staff tried to use an emergency shutdown mechanism that failed .
Now the had an uncontrolled nuclear reaction .
Because they didn't have the right Geiger counters , they didn't know what a serious danger they were in cause they couldn't got the actual radiation levels .
They stayed for about 3 days till the explosion , trying to pump water into the reactor to control it .
They died weeks later from radiation poisoning .
untilthe plant for aboutatwereknowdid notbecausetheyThus ,It is obvious that human factors play an important role in this accident .
Though the original cause is technical ,them was anyone find the mistake and correct it  ,waswouldn't happen .
What's more , regardless of what extent do compensate for ittiThus ,chieve , man candid not run neglected However , nobodyduction .
And , nobody can avoid mistakes , so applying psychology in design processes couConsequentlyeduce the probability of human errors , thus increased safety coefficient .
the safety coefficient of a systemincreasingsince nobodyFurthermoreunderestimatedthe role of manis achievedhave happenedNever the less , someone hold the playedion that if technology improves enough , we could get rid of thewasccident with applying pdiscoveredology in the desicorrectedesses .
Neverthelessissomeing , it is true that the consequences for the accident can be reliminateaccidentsg the nuclear technology , what mod we use to control the reaction has been improved a lot .
And through the three mile island accident , if the safety precautions make sense , the effect for the place outside the nuclear plant is very small .
But , all this improvements just make the consequence of the accident , if happening , less than before and it doesn't mean the probability is reduced .
Through a survey , 92% of all significant events in nuclear utilities between 1983-1984 were caused by people and of these only 8% were initiated by the control room operator(Stanton .N , 1996) .
So the most efficient way to reinforce the safety is applying psychology in design processes .
On 26 April 1986 , a catastrohave preventedster , which destroyed the city and killed 30 people in few seconds , fell on Chernobyl .
Massive amount of radioactive substances spread , and eventually caused approximately 270000 cancer cases and 93000 fatal cancers (Greenpeace , 2006) .
Ever since the disaster occurred , the cause of the accident was extensively looked into .
Most of the studies have shown that it was the carelessness of the operator and large amount of design errors which lead to the disastrous explosion .
Therefore , wide range of approaches arises to enhance safety in engineering process , and psychology is among one of these approaches .
Engineering psychology provides methods to enhance the safety of a system from the human point of view (Wilpert , 2006) .
While opponents denied the capability of psychology to prevent the accident , proponents insisted that psychology is applicable to enhance safety of a system .
Although some people perceived that psychology would not influence much in engineering process , I do believe that the use of psychology during design process effectively provide alternative to prevent the accident .

In fact , the scienthave pointedin Soviet Union were equipppartsith deep technical knowledge ,the accident mostlyotivated to produnumerouson for self interest .
Therefore , the ignorance of safety field evhave preventedled to bad decision during design process .
On the other hands , engineering psychology , which comprises 'decision gate' in eaweredesign phase , would effectively enhance safety from the human point of view .

Therefore , psychthe procedureengineering is definitely reforired to promote the safety throughout the desithe inputocess , especialat for hazardous syshave beenm such as nuclear plant .
With the modernization of the world , the consumption of energy has drastically increased .
Nuclear reactants have helped improve the situation in recent years .
One of the nuclear reactors is the very high temperature reactor (VHTR) which is used to produce both hydrogen and electricity .
There has been opposition which has been further research and development of the VHTR due to high costs , unsafe conditions and low efficiency of the VHTR .
However , I feel that despite these , we should still continue with the further development of the VHTR .
The main issue that the public is concerned with is safety .
The VHTR operates at a very high temperature .
There are fears that the reactor may get overheated as it operates at very high temperatures .
However , with  improvements in the machine design and materials used , the VHTR is now cooled by helium which is an inert gas .
The helium gas does not react readily with other gases , whichmakes it safe to use .
In addition , the material used to build the reactor is graphite which has a high melting point .
Graphite also has high heat capacity and thermal inertia , thus allowing it to withstand high temperatures .
It has high structural stability despite being heated up to high temperatures .
Graphite and helium make the VHTR safer to use as it now heats up less readily .
Thus , the VTHR is safe to use even though it requires high temperatures to operate .
There are skeptics who argue that the high start up cost , due to the materials of the reactor , make it not worthwhile to further research and develop the VHTR .
They feel that the government should channel the funds to produce other useful products which may directly benefit them .
The aim of the government should be revised and other important needs such as the healthcare of citizens should be considered before building these reactors .
Funds could be better allocated in order to not neglect important areas .
I agree that the start-up cost of VHTR is high as it costs about 114 .9 billion US dollars to build  .
However , the operating and maintenance costs are much lower as compared to the start up cost .
The fuel used in the VHTR produces a large amount of energy when burnt , thus reducing the amount of fuel burnt .
As the VHTR is able to produce two products , hydrogen and electricity , concurrently , it helps to reduce the cost of producing both products separately .
Furthermore , in the long run , the high cost is spread over the products , thus reducing the daily cost .
Critics also highlight the efficiency problems of the VHTR .
The VHTR uses helium as a cooling reagent .
However , helium is only able to cool a small amount of temperature in high pressure .
This means that a large amount of helium is needed to reduce the temperature of the reactor .
If the helium is insufficient , it will not be not possible for the VHTR to operate at its optimum temperature .
Other cooling agents such as water , which is able to cool reactors down readily , should be used .
However , the VHTR still has a high efficiency rate .
It uses plutonium waste to run the reactor and thus helps to recycle waste products .
The fuel used is also coated with uranium oxycarbide which aids in waste minimization .
The high temperature produced by the reactor can also be used to split water up thermodynamically and thus help to save energy to produce additional energy .
Although helium is seen to be both a good and bad cooling agent , it should still be used despite its disadvantage because it is still the best cooling agent that can be found due to its inert nature .
The VTHR is able to produce electricity which the world is in need of .
Furthermore , it is also able to produce hydrogen , a side product which is useful too .
Moreover , it has high efficiency and the reactor is safe to use .
Cost should not be an issue as it will eventually be reduced with the  overhead costs .
Therefore , research and development on the VTHR should continue .
Generation IV nuclear energy systems are very promising technologies which will probably be available from 2030 onwards .
These technologies have many advantages , such as enhancing nuclear safety , minimizing the generation of nuclear waste and decreasing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation (Gen IV International Forum ,2007) .
Although Generation IV nuclear energy systems have so many advantages and plans for four systems have been finalized(Gen IV International Forum ,2007) , public opposition questions whether further research and development are still needed for them .
However ,  and the Gen IV systems will definitely benefit most  nations .
It is essential to do more research for the Very High Temperature Reactor or VHTR which is the most promising system out of all the Generation IV systems .
Firstly ,  opponents question the safe operation of the VHTR at over 1000 Celsius degrees under transient conditions .
However , they have failed to consider the inherent characteristic of a helium-cooled , graphite-moderated core which is designed for the VHTR .
The VHTR system takes advantage of the thermal inertia of the graphite and a special property of the helium coolant which is that helium has a single phase .
Because of the effect of graphite , it manages to maintain a high heat capacity and stability at the same time even at extremely high temperatures .
In addition , helium is chemically inert so when it is used as the coolant , it hardly interacts with other materials ({High temperature gas cool reactor technology development}[HYPERLINK: http://www .iaea .org/inisnkm/nkm/aws/htgr/fulltext/29026666 .pdf] , 1996) .
Therefore , the helium-cooled , graphite-moderated core is on the whole the best design and in this way the safety of the system is almost guaranteed .
Secondly , critics argue that the VHTR is too costly and it will ultimately be eliminated in the future due to economic factors , just like what happened to the HTGR or High-Temperature-Gas-Reactor in 1989 (International Atomic Energy Agency , n .d) .
To some extent , the VHTR system is indeed more expensive than the Generation III Nuclear Energy Systems .
However , even though the one-time capital input is high , the VHTR has low operating and maintenance cost (Gen IV International Forum , 2007) .
From the economic perspective , low variable cost will finally lead to low average cost despite the fact that the fixed cost is quite high .
Moreover , the electricity generation of the VHTR system has an efficiency ratio ofhigher than 50 percent and it is much more efficient than the Generation III systems .
Such efficient electricity generation will outweigh the high cost of the engineering design and production of the system (Jaeri , 2002) .
In addition , the abundant heat produced in the VHTR system raises the efficiency of hydrogen gas production to a significant level .
Hence , the high one-time economic investment does not seem to be a problem compared with the high efficiency and the significant side product of the VHTR system .
Thirdly , some people are concerned about whether the Generational IV Nuclear Energy System will become a privilege of the wealthy or technologically developed countries and enlarge the gap between the developed countries and the developing countries .
this concern is actually unfounded since most  countries have reached the consensus that the development of Generation IV systems would be an international initiative rather than an independent investigation .
According to estimations , these systems will be available by 2030 in both developed countries and developing countries (Argonne National Laboratory) .
To sum up , even though there are concerns about the the The Generation IV VHTR system , such as the potential danger of the system , the high cost of the system and possible negative effects of the system , the advantages of Generation IV VHTR system surpass its disadvantages .
Generation IV VHTR system should be fully developed since the VHTR system intends to increase safety , efficiency and reliability as well as provide other  benefits such as hydrogen production .
its so-called danger , its waste and the fear of terrorists .I cannot deny some tragedies occurred during the exploration and development of nuclear power .

From the deny thate of safety , manhave occurred are afraid of the hypothesis that terrorists may attack the reactors because they are the best target towill still beaos and mass destruction .
Actually , the issuonly because ofonsidered in the country where these nuclear reactors are widely built .
As Pittsburgh Tribune Review January 18 , 2007 reported , US Nuclenvironmentallyy Commission said that in the future , the design of nuclear power reactors , such as SWCR , will consider avoiding the large-type aircraft collision to prevent the attack comes from terrorists .
In addition , according to a research group , concrete structure used in such kind of reactor can withstand a deliberately crash by a military jet .
Besides , most countries in the world have regarded anti-terrorism as one of their main tasks in the future .
They will try their best to avoid terrorism and spare no effect to protect their nation from being attacked .
Therefore , terrorism should not become the obstacle of the development of nuclear reactor .

There are accidents happening every year , whether due to human mistakes or design defects .
People have been putting efforts to improve engineeringdesignsto eliminate unexpected accidents .
Not surprisingly , psychology plays a crucial role in engineering design processes .
Engineering psychology can be understood as the study of human behaviors , as well as designing and building mechanical devices or artificial environments to improve human interaction with a system , and to satisfy anthropometric or psychological requirements so that people will use the devices (Wickens & Kramer , 1985) .
Up till now , the most deadly aircraft accident in aviation history has been the Tenerife accident on March 27 , 1977 , with a death toll of 583 .
In Tenerife airport , two planes , KLM 4805 and Pan Am Clipper 1736 , collided with each other .
Basically , both human errors and system failure led to this tragedy .
Although there is not one definite cause for such accidents , the correct use of psychology in certain areas , including the design of the airport , the communication procedure and the training of manpower , may help to prevent similar disasters in the future .
First of all , poor airport design contributed much to the accident .
Designers failed to consider that the airport needed to accommodate a large number of planes , resulting in parking congestion which was one of the reasons for the accident .
Otherwise , the Pan Am plane could have entered the first or the second taxi way and never collided with the KLM plane .
In addition , the plane missed the third taxi way because there was a 135 degree sharp turn , which was impossible for a 747 plane .
Furthermore , located just close to cloud level , the airport area had a very special fog pattern .
However , designers actually did not install radars .
However ,  claimed that it was not economic to build a large airport in such a small place with such few people .
This cannot be the excuse .
As Tenerife had been seeing more and more visitors , people should anticipate some contingencies , and a safe airport with the necessary facilities should have been ensured to anticipate such unscheduled landings .
Secondly , communication was also a serious problem in this accident .
Actually , the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) was using only one channel to communicate with two approaching airplanes at the same time .
The controllers did not consider that the same frequency made them unable to hear each other clearly , so that the ATC failed to get the information that the Pan Am was still on the run way .
To make things worse , as professional controllers , they should have used standardized terminologies for communication , but they actually did not .
Words such as "take off" should never have been used in an ATC clearance but they did .
The ambiguous language caused confusion such that the Pan Am pilots , the KLM pilots , and the ground controllers did not get the proper information .
Some people may argue that during those early years , having lowly educated air controllers was inevitable .
It was hard to find a Spaniard speaking English fluently .
However , people still need to consider communication as an important issue and try to find a precise and standard language for aviation communication .
Last but not least , the training of the captains and the crews also contributed to the accident in a sense .
The captain of the KLM was used to being a training captain , which means he conducted training flights more than regular line flights .
However , many operational problems only emerge during the actual flight .
Hence , when the captain encountered problems , he may not have kept calm and made the correct decision .
Though the accident cannot be entirely attributed to the captain , he had the highest power and should have been experienced enough to seek safety for all the passengers .
Hence , both theoretical and operational training should be reinforced for all training captains and crews . .
According to a BBC report , in Europe alone , there are 165 nuclear reactors .
On the other hand , there are also countries that are against this idea , such as Germany , which is withdrawing  its nuclear programme (BBC , 2009) .
The reason for opposing nuclear programmes is that nuclear accidents release harmful radiation that has adverse effects on humans and the environment .
This is seen in the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 followed by the Chernobyl accident in 1986 , which have reinforced fears of nuclear power in the people .
In addition , many are concerned that nuclear reactors are prone to being used as weapons of mass destruction by terrorists and hostile countries .
Thus , they are against the idea of building nuclear plants .
Firstly , in terms of safety , the VHTR is said to be a relatively safe nuclear reactor because it includes a back-up emergency core cooling system .
However , the MSR operates under an even safer condition .
Unlike the VHTR , the MSR adopts a passive emergency cooling system .
The method of cooling in the MSR is more efficient than the VHTR because if the MSR coolant salt overheats and overflows , the coolant salt will be transported to various storage tanks which are installed with passive decay heat cooling systems , so they are verified to be critically-safe .
Besides the storage tanks , freeze valves that will automatically open whenever they detect overheating of the salt are also installed .
As a result , heated fuel will be disposed of immediately without threatening an explosion or leakage (Joseph & Angelo , 2005) .
Therefore , the MSR is a much safer reactor than the VHTR .
Secondly , the overall performance of the MSR also surpasses the VHTR , making the MSR a better nuclear reactor .
The VHTR operates at a core outlet gas temperature of more than 900 to 1000 with output power estimated to be 600MW .
On the other hand , the MSR is able to not only operate in small sizes , but also in large sizes .
Besides the varying sizes that an MSR could work in , it is also able to operate at two varying temperatures of 705 and 1000 (Butler , 2004) .
At 1000 , the VHTR's overall plant efficiency is about 50% while the MSR's overall plant efficiency is about 60% .
This shows that at the same temperature , the MSR is at least 10% more efficient than the VHTR .
Therefore , countries should invest in the MSR which is more efficient than the VHTR in terms of overall plant efficiency .
Last but not least , waste recycling in the MSR allows better usage of materials as well as ensures a lower cost of operation .
The wastes produced in VHTR go directly to the repository .
However , in the MSR system , wastes produced from generation of electricity will be recycled .
The system collects and processes the wastes according to their physical and chemical properties , and separates the residual fuel from the wastes .
During the process , plutonium and uranium would be recovered and then recycled to produce more energy .
This in turn reduces the volume of material disposed of since plutonium and uranium make up almost 97% of the entire mass of fuel used in generating nuclear energy .
This will also lead to reduction in costs since capital spent on reactants are significantly reduced (The National Academies Press , 1984) .
Therefore , adoption of the MSR as an alternative to electricity production is a wiser choice than choosing the VHTR .
Scientists and engineers are now thinking of developing a new generation of nuclear reactors that can solve many problems such as green-house effects , the rising prices of energy and the safety of nuclear reactors .
In "Nuclear Power's New Dawn" , Butler (2004) mentions six concepts of Generation IV (GenIV) reactors .
Among them is the supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR) which is considered a popular one because of its many obvious advantages .
While some proponents totally support further research and development funding for this concept , others still doubt  the benefits of the SCWR since there are many challenging problems in the R&D process .
Three of these problems are safety , efficiency and practicality .
It is often argued that the SCWR is rather safe in comparison with other generation IV reactor concepts because it operates at rather low temperatures , ranging from 510 to 550 C (Butler , 2004) .
Although this argument is true , high operatingtemperaturese is not the only source of accidents in a reactor .
In fact , the pressure inside a SCWR can reach 25MPa which is ultra-high and dangerous .
At sucha levell of pressure ,the steel used in nuclear reactorsl is easily corroded by high temperature water .
Another safety problem comes fromthe veryy fast turbine speed of the SWCR (about 3600 rpm , twice as fast as the existing Light Water Reactor (LWR)) .
Moreover , an extremely abnormal event has been recognized which is the loss of feed water (or coolant) (GIF , 2002) .
Therefore , we must stress the importance of finding suitable materials that are stress-resistant and anti-corrosive anddevelopg a reliable auxiliary feed water system .
The SCWR has very high efficiency (about 45% versus about 33% efficiency for the current LWR) and can churn out electricity at prices that , on paper , are competitive with coal and gas , and vastly cheaper than existing nuclear reactors(Butler , 2004) .
However , one disadvantage of the SWCR is that it , in fact , is the only concept among the GenIV reactors that does not produce hydrogen fuel .
The temperature needed to split hydrogen from water in a reactor is from 700 to 900  C and even if the SCWR could produce hydrogen , separating it withe liquid water would become a big problem .
Hydrogen fuel is considered the energy for the future since it is carbon-free , non-toxic ,less of a fire risk and more highly efficienty than petrol .
Furthermore , it should be note , that if most car owners switched to fully electric cars , many countries would need to double their electricity production (Louis , 2009) .
Therefore , itwouldd be better if we develop reactors that can generate hydrogen fuel rather than ones that can only generate electricity .
The SWCR is preferred to other GenIV concepts because of its simple design , which indicates that it will be cheaper and easier to develop and operate .
However , other GenIV reactor concepts seem to be practical , too .
One example is the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) which can produce hydrogen fuel and which can be completed by 2020 (the earliest delivery for the SCWR is 2025) .
Moreover , the estimated amount of money needed for R&D activities for the VHTR is about $670 m (versus $870m for the SCWR) .
Last but not least , the efficiency of the VHTR (even higher than 50%) is also higher than that of the SCWR (GIF , 2002) .
Although the VHTR also has its own challenges in R&D , it is , besides the SCWR , highly interesting to the experts .
Although it cannot be denied that SCWR is the most practical one among the six concepts of GenIV reactors , it is not the only choice .
Developing a new generation of nuclear reactor costs us not only a huge amount of money , but also a lot of time and manpower .
Therefore , we must consider carefully when choosing whether to develop the SCWR or other concepts .
Over the years , nuclear technology has improved and in principle , created the term 'meltdown proof' reactors wherthe Generation IV nuclear reactorool themselves down in the event of an accident are the safetyl impact or  ,if any , human intervention ( Butler , 2004) .
Hence , safety of the nuclear reactors has always been the main issue disastersg the building) , longlear power plants .
Technically , it is possible to avoid a meltdown given that the new Generation IV  , and then advanced safetarestem in place .
However , human error is a factor that dtaxpayers'ther the safety system in place works in an event of a failure (Greenpeace) .
Events that clearly show the effects of nuclear meltdown arthe Generation IV nuclear reactor resulted in 336 ,000 people being exposed to radioactive chemicals and had to be relocated .
The result of the explosion had linked to many forms of cancer in Eastern Europe and Russia , as well as destroying animals and plants .
(World-nuclear , n .d)
(World-nuclear , n .d .) .to the destruction ofhas been linkedbeingWaste from the nuclear faculty is another major issue .
Although the development and research of Generation IV reactors produces less nuclear wastes , the main problem lies in getting rid of it rather than storinor minimal , .
According to Andrew Blowers , a former member of tthe safetymittee for Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) , which asurroundinge government , the nuclear waste does not decompose easily and will last for thousands if not millions of years , thus , it will impose a burden on future generations .
Furthermore , the cost of waste disposal and storage of the nuclear waste is huge on tthe of the at least 2 billion pounds required to build the nuclear plant .
(Jaa nuclear meltdown )
The cost of building a facility reactor has always been one of the biggest issues .
It is true that the cost of developing the Generation IV rewaste will result in a cheaper price tag when building future in storing reactors .
Unfortunately , no more than three of the six designs are likely to survive the feasibility testing phrase and go on to become research prototypes , each costing at least US$1 billion or more to build and test ( Butler , 2004) ,;thus , wasting taxpayer's money .
To summarize why nuclear reactor should not be built is because no nuclear reactor in the world is inherently safe as all operational reactors have inherent safety flaws , which c(Jukwey , 2008) .safety upgrading .
Highly radioactive spent fuel requires constant cooling .
If this fails , it could lead to a catastrophic release of radioactivity .
There will always be nuclear waste irregardless of the amount the development and research of Generation IV nuclear reactors can reduce .
Billions of dollars is taking place in building a nuclear reactor and not a few million .
Furthermore , there is no guaranteed in building a successful nuclear reactor .
Opponents of R&D funding for gaseseration IV reactors claim that nuclear plants are very dangerous (Abeingcroft , 2008) because of the radioactive wastes and the radioactprovide materials espreventng from the reacfromAshcroft , 2008) .
However , these two disadvantages are no longer problems for the Generation IV reactors .
It is because all the six concepts of Generation IV reactors are operating at a very high temperature ranging from 510 degrees C to 1000 degrees C and habudgetedforhighly automatic circular system , the rve waste can be minimized to a very safe level (Butler , 2004) .
Besides , unlike what the public thinks , there is almost no radioactive materials escaping from the reactors unless in an unexpected accident .
However , the new technologies applied in the new generation of reactors such as pebble-bed , in principle , can prevent any radioactive material escaping from the reactors in an accident (Butler , 2004) .
Opponents also mention that it costs too much to build and run nuclear plants (Ashcroft , 2008) .
In fact , it is true for the previous generations of reactors .
However , if the Genethat escapeV reactors really work , on paper , they are competitive with coals and gas notu2004) .
As mentioned above , the new reactorThisare operating at very high temperatures and have highly autoperatesystem , so they are more efficient .
For instance , the VHTR ( very-high-temperature reactor , one of the six concepts ofso theneration IV reactors) can produce half more electricity with the same amoIn additionresources (Butler , 2004) .
Therefore , tharecost on the resources can be significantly reduced .
Also , duexcepthe highly automatic system , the capital spent on hiring experienced operators and building offsite monitoring systems can be reduced .
Both of these make it cheaper to build nuclear plants .
FurthermoreofThe final argument advanced by the opponents is that this new generation of reactors will be morThisorist target ,cause they are more powerful (Ashcroft , 2008) .
However , the experts say that the Generaeet (GEN International Forum , 2006) .
The reason is thatoperateconcepts of Generation IV reactors contain simplified safetsystemsures that no longer depend on sophisticated operators , which means that they can cool themselves if there is anything wrong in the whole progress .
Thfifty percentore , any attempt to trigger an accident deliberately will be in vain .
deliberately trigger an accidentprocessanything goes wrongIt should be evident that argums against the setting of R&D funding for Generation IV reactors are not valid .
The high operating temperature and the highly automatic cycle system make the new generation reactors not only more inexpensive but also much safer .
Moreover , the simplified safety feature makes those new reactors be less of a terrorist target .
Therefore , in my opinion , there should be R&D funding for Generation IV reactors .
means that VHTR can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared to existing reactors .
In addition , it can be used to produce hydrogen which holds much potential as a fuel of the future .
However , reactors will need new coolants as ordinary water cannot be used under typical pressurized conditions CITATION But04 \l 1033 (Butler , 2004) .
Nuclear energy is currently not cost competitive .
A large capital  is required for the building of Generation IV nuclear reactors .
The Greenpeace report of 2005 says that the estimated costs .
for the development of the six Gen IV concepts are about US$6 billion CITATION Aus07 \l 1033 (Austrian Institute of Ecology , 2007) .
France intends to replace its ageing plants using a US$3 .5 billion Generation Three reactors (Butler , 2004) .
Better performance has to be weighed against high building and maintenance costs
VHTR systems do not use waste recycling , thus reducing the risk of proliferation .
Public opinion is against the construction of nuclear reactors due to the partial reactor meltdown accident in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine (Butler , 2004) .
It is generally recognized that it is a practical impossibility to render civilian nuclear energy systems proliferation-proof CITATION Hir05 \l 1033 (Hirsch , Becker , Schneider & Froggatt , 2005) .
The development of Gen IV nuclear reactors is necessary to respond to the upcoming scarcity of fissile material , the issue of proliferation and the requirement for safe repositories for nuclear waste .
Research still has to be done to work on a better cooling system and material that can withstand very high temperatures (Butler , 2004) .
Shortages in energy supply and insecurities caused due to  rising oil prices and the threat of climate change clearly show the need for the development of nuclear power .
Due to extreme operational conditions , Gen IV systems could even turn out to be more dangerous than currently operated installations CITATION Aus09 \l 1033 (Austrian Institue of Ecology) .
Countries should invest in the development of VHTR to satisfy their energy demands and to decrease the dependence on fossil fuels for energy .
According to Whitman (2000) , the term GM foods is commonly used to refer to crop pa severe food crisishuOne good way to solve this problemolecular biology techniques , and these food have been modified tthe uncertain effects in the laboratory .
GM foods haGMFntages over traditional plants .
Fir most of them have higher st and disease resistance .
So the usage amount of chemical substances will be largely reduced .
Besides , we can increase the crop yield by cultivating GM plants .
As the food situation is becoming desperate in today's context , these two features are significant .
However , although GM food is not a new term for us , many people are still concern about the consumption of GM food .
One major problem is that whether GM food will do harm to humansuches .
Schasists use biologin the laboratory to meet people's demandsthe genes of the plants .
Thover food frommodified genes can be unstable .
As a result , the affects of GM food via human cons , soion aill relatively unknosubstances used and proteins produced GM In additiony have unknown sidffects if consumed over long periods of time (Cardiosk 2008) .
Another problem is the environmental influence .
People are afraid of GM plants may break the balances in the nature .
They may transmit their special genes to other species or restrain other plants' growing and cause disasters .
We need to solve these problems by enhancingtoe assessment of the GM foodconcernedost of people , they just worry about the unceconcern eff of GM food .
GM foods are not like common drags or chemicals , they are more complex .
But if we can precisely evaluate the impacts of the GM food on human body and verify that they are healteffectsle would accin them .
As Anthony J . Conner (2003) said , a crucial component for a prproduced byessment is defining the appropriate baseline for comparison and decision .
One of these assessment methods is to compare the GM food and their original natural sthatcies .

Opponents of nuclear power claim that nuclear reactors are totally insecure as the incidents of Three Miles Island and Chernobyl led to catastrophes .
Another example was the technical failure in the Forsmark nuclear power plant in Sweden , 2006 .
According to the former director of that plant , it was pure luck that the plant had no meltd; otherwise , it could be another disaster (Greenpeace , Jan2009 , p .6) .
However , the possibility for a Mareo melt is relatively small compared to the old nuclear power plant .
This is because molten salt reactor has different safety approaches which can prevent the meltdown .
FiAlthoughthe molten salts have low chemical activity at the sea-level pressure .
They are also mechanically stable as their boiling point is very high .
Besides that , there is a passive cooling system which includes passively cooled dump tanks that will perform emergency cooling and shutdown in any emergency conditions (Forsberg , C .F , June2006 , p .4) .
Moreover , in a MSR , the mobile fission products are removed continuously and reused afterward .
This means that the accident rate can be reduced to the minimum .
Opponents also mention that there is no solution to radioactive waste .
Since the beginning of nuclear power , radioactive waste has remained as a major problem .
Reprocessing the radioactive waste once became a useful method .
However , according to a study published in 2001 , there was a significant increment of leukaemia among under-25 year olds who were living within 10 km of La Hague nuclear reprocessiants , in northwest France (Greenpeace , Jan2009 , p .5) .
Yet , reprocessing the radioactive waste and recycle the salts seem to be possible in MSR .
In fact , MSR would still produce hazardous waste and radionuclide .
Nevertheless , the organic components in that wasteuld be oxidized in the molten salt oxidizer (MSO) and radionuclide would be retained in the salt .
The salt would then be recycled and reused in the MSR (Gat , U . , Jun1993 , p .3) .
Some of the radionuclide still left out in this recycling process .
In order to get a shorter-lived radioactiv , the radionuclide is combined with some mixtures such as glass , ceramic and concrete .
e radioactive waste is brought to an optimum for disposal and lesser harmful radioactive waste is produced by MSR .
is stillThe final argument advanced by opponents of nuclear power is that nuclear energy is too expensive .
They describe nuclear power as "the most pensive way to boil water" .
Still , a molten salt reactor is worth for its price .
Through research , a molten salt reference plant can produce power up to 1000MWe which is very efficient .
This amount of power produced is enough to outweigh other energy sources as it can cover the increased energy needs in the futureoreover , the system of circulating molten salt recyclingxture can reduce the operation cost considerably which provide MSR another advantage .
(Kloosterman , J .L . , n .d . , para .4) Besides that , MSR has a lower construction cost as it is smaller compared to other type of nuclear reactors .
This is due to MSR system offers an integrated fuel cycle and embodying a breeder reactor concept .
(GIF , n .d .)
embodiesbecausetypes .In conclusion , despite many people are still opposing the concept of reactor generation IV , I believe that MSR could bring the nuclear power to another new age .
MSR has many advantages such as cost-effective ,nimize the danger of disposal and it has a nearly perfect safety precaution which reduce the accident rate greatly .
Hence , it has the potential to become the main source of energy in the next decade .
However ,  safety precautions and corrective actions are not fail-proof .
The likelihood of accidents occurring stays high despite these measures .
Although safety precautions are set , the tendencies of violation of the rules are not to be neglected .
The rules and regulations are drawn down with consideration of ideal behavior of system users yet it is unlikely that all men follow the same code of behavior .
Thus measures to reduce errors resulting from deviation from ideal behavior should be formulated with the aid of psychology which analyses the behavior of man .
In addition , psychology can be applied to predict errors in the designing process due to human factors and preventive measure can be taken to avoid mishaps due to these errors .
Furthermore , it is essential to note that the most damaging errors made by the engineering team is not regarding the technical aspect of the engineering process but with regard to ethic issues which often jeopardize safety .
Hence analysis of the mind and behavior of man may potentially help rule out the possibilities of such occurrences .
In the case of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse , human error was undeniably one of the most influencing factors underlying the failure of the structure .
Even though the collapse of the walkway was due to the failure of components of the structure , it would not have been fatal if the errors were identified and corrected in time .
Psychology can be applied to various stages of design processes to prevent accidents .
An area where psychology can be applied is interpersonal communication which is required in the processes of engineering .
In a large scale engineering project , communication can often be a problem .
Not only do engineers have to communicate within their team , but also with representatives from various other levels .
In times , the breakdown of the communication system can lead to disastrous consequences In the case of the Regency accident , the miscommunication between the engineering team and Havens Steel Company , the contractor responsible for manufacturing the rods , is very much accountable for the fatal accident .
Since the calculation for the structure was made according to the engineers' initial plan , adjustment will have to be made for a different material used .
The manufacturers were not informed of the possible effects of the change in material .
Use of psychology in engineering process is also necessary in predicting the possible dilemma faced by end users using the product and the possibility of wrong usage which can cause potential harm .
Study of behavior of man is necessary in the prediction and adjustment of the system to suit users .
In the case of the Hyatt Regency accident , the failure to foresee the large crowd and hence larger workload is one great mistake made by the engineers .
As a heavily advertised project , engineers should have anticipated response from the people .
Hence , it will be of importance to verify the maximum load that the walkway is able to withstand .
In the event that the crowd predicted is above the maximum load the walkway can withstand , possible measures can be taken to divert the crowd , and ensure load within a safe boundary .
In the case of the Hyatt Regency accident , the application of psychology would possibly have prevented the accident .
It is apparent that the negligence of the engineering teams was to be blamed for the accident .
Since the first use of nuclear reactor as electricity generator in 1957 , the public has been very concerned about its safe operation ({Matthew[HYPERLINK: http://www .nytimes .com/info/nuclear-energy/] , n .d .) .
Public opposition is even more intense after the accidents at Three Mile Island }[HYPERLINK: http://www .pddoc .com/tmi2/kemeny/] and Chernobyl .
But recently , vast amounts of supporters have surfaced , mainly due to the urgent need in reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
One of the proponents , James Lovelock , has even stated that nuclear power is the only green solution for global warming (James , 2004) .
As a result , six generation 4 reactor concepts were proposed by the Generation 4 International Forum (GIF) , offering substantial advancement in safety and reliability , sustainability , cost and physical protection ( Although all six concepts are brilliant , the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) should be placed above all other reactors in further research and development funding , as it has clear advantages over other reactors in the aspect of safety and security , performance , and proliferation resistance .
Opponents of VHTR might claim that Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) exhibit better safety features for its selection of molten lead as relatively inert coolant (Generation IV Technology , n .d .) .
However , the VHTR offers higher degree of passive safety; for instance , it is built undergroundanduses the earth to sink most of the heat produced .
In fact , the graphite encased fuel will not be damaged when the reactor heat is radiated through its steel vessel out of the high thermal inertia graphite moderator core (Ragheb , 2007) .
Moreover , building the reactor underground offers a greater level of security , as there are limited exit routes to the ground .
This feature would also immensely reduce its threat of being a terrorism target , enhancing the physical protection of the reactor .
Since reprocessing of nuclear waste can eminently reduces raw fuel input and conserves the world's uranium supplies () , opponents might argue that the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor[HYPERLINK: http://www .gen-4 .org/Technology/systems/gfr .htm] (GFR) , {Molten Salt Reactor}[HYPERLINK: http://www .gen-4 .org/Technology/systems/msr .htm] (MSR) , {Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor}[HYPERLINK: http://www .gen-4 .org/Technology/systems/sfr .htm] (SFR) , and LFR offer better performance with the adoption of reprocessing (Butler , 2004) .
However , the VHTR offers high thermal efficiency in supplying electricity and producing hydrogen , alongside process heat applications .
Operating at 1000 degree Celsius , the VHTR is able to produce 50% more electricity using the same amount of fuel compared with conventional plants .
The high operating temperature also enables hydrogen production using thermochemical process , with superior efficiency .
In addition , heat produced by the VHTR can also be utilized in a broad range of process heat applications , such as coal gasification (Gen-IV , 2005) .
On the other hand , reprocessing is extremely expensive , costing more than uranium fuel itself () .
Hence , it would be impossible for nuclear power to compete with coal and gas in the market for electricity .
Opponents might also maintain that GFR , MSR , SFR , and LFR provide better waste management , seeing that up to 96% of waste produced is being recycled through reprocessing (Butler , 2004) .
However , this would oppose the aim of creating a proliferation resistant reactor .
On the contrary , the VHTR does not have this issue , for it operates in a once-through uranium cycle .
Since plutonium - the main substance in manufacturing nuclear weapon - is not separated with the nuclear waste , it cannot be easily extracted to build nuclear weapons () .
The great proliferation resistance provides assurance to the society , avoiding suspicion between countries about any secret nuclear weapons program that might cause misunderstandings .
Therefore , the high proliferation resistance that comes with VHTR averts the emergence of new nuclear weapons states , and keeps nuclear weapons capability out of terrorist hands .
It should be evident that the Very-High-Temperature Reactor is the best among the 6 evolutionary concepts of generation 4 reactors .
The VHTR is equipped with superior passive safety features with its underground construction , which also greatly increases its security and physical protection .
Furthermore , the VHTR offers high thermal efficiency , while retaining the capability of hydrogen production and utilization in heat process applications .
Finally , the VHTR also provides high proliferation resistance , which prevents the production of new nuclear weapons , maintaining peace in the world .
Therefore , in my opinion , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor should be given priority for further research and development funding .
In the research for cleaner and safer nuclear reactor to meet the increasing demand for energy , new generation nuclear reactors have been researched by a consortium of ten nations .
Furthermore , it is quite necessary and urgent to set an overall direction of nuclear reactors .
Some people believe that the very high temperature reactor (VHTR) is the most phave emergedng reactor and should be largely put into use in the near future .
However , compared with VHTR , the sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) has more advantages and should be chosen as a main type of reactors in the future .
Proponents of VHTR claim that it operates at a higher temperature which is much more efficient than the SFR .
It is true that the higher temperature enables the reactor to work more efficiently; however , it also raises a huge inherent safety problem .
As a reactor which also produces hydrogen which is combustible , it is likely for the VHTR to explode at high temperatures .
Once the accident happens , the related safety components of the reactor would not work .
In contrast , the SFR does not have this safety concern for its operating temperature is jusreactorf that of the VHTR .
Furthermore , the closed fuel of SFR can utilize almost all the energy provided by the fuels and the recovery and recycle of the actinides in SFR can reach about 99 .9% , which indicate the a high efficiency of SFR .
Opponents of SFR claim that the radioactivity of its coolant sodium is harmful to the environment .
Although the sodium is radioactive and easy to have chemical reaction with water and air , the self-activated shutdown system of SFR has largely reduced the possibilities of the leakage of sodium .
Furthermore , SFR has a relatively large thermal inertia and a large margin to coolant boiling which ensure the safety of the use of sodium .
More important , there is an extra loop which is called secondary system acts as a buffer in case of the reactions between the sodium and water (Roglans , Allen & Line , 2002) .
In this way , it can largely avoid the release of radioactive elements and become safe and environmentally friendly .
Another argument advanced by opponents of SFR is that it can only produce electricity and it has shown little promise of becoming an econoeasilylehasr so far (fast reactor , N .D) .
It is true that the VHTR can produce not only electricity but also hydrogen; however , the electricity is more widely used than the hydrogen nowadays .
Actually , the hydrogen energy system is not very mature because of the limited technology so far .
The electricimportantlyilh demand nowadays and the SFR can completely meet the demand of markets for ctricity .
(M .Ragheb , 2007) .On the other hand , the cost of the research and development of SFR is only about 610 million dollars , which is much less than that of VHTR .
All of these facts show that the SFR is more economic and flexible than VHTR .
economicalmaturedIn a nutshell , it can be seen that the arguments against the sodiuooled fast reactor are inconclusive and not valid .
On the contrary , the SFR system has moreVHTR on its safety , efficiency and costs , which made the SFR a promising reactor .
Therefore , the research and development of sodium cooled fast reactor is necessary and overwhelming .
The train accident at Eschede was one of the world's deadliest railway accident to have ever occurred .
The accident resulted in a total of 101 deaths and caused 88 injuries .
The cause of the accident was due to a broken wheel that led to the derailment of the entire train ( 1998) .
Further probing into the accident revealed that although the wheels were not fully tested and commissioned , the wheels were already in service .
At that point in time , no facilities existed in Germany to test the failure limit of rail wheels , thus design and specifications relied heavily on materials specifications and theory .
Furthermore , in-depth investigations revealed that before the night of the accident , the maintenance crew did not carry out their maintenance jobs properly .
Therefore , if a psychologist had been in place during the designing , testing and maintenance phase , the chance of the accident happening would have been minimal .
From the feedback they received from customers , the company said that passengers could hear loud vibrations and dinnerware and glasses were moving across the table when the train was moving at cruising speed () .Thus , the engineers were tasked to come up with a new design to solve problem .
The engineers claimed that they have superior technical knowledge and by following the specifications on the datasheets closely , there would unlikely be any mistakes in the design .
Hence , minimal testing was required .
Moreover , there were no testing facilities present at that time to test the failure limit of a wheel .
However , if a psychologist was present during the designing phase of the wheel , he could have pointed out that the datasheets were prepared by other engineers also , and engineers can make mistakes too .
During the testing phase , the psychologist would have proposed that the engineers further test the wheel at a much higher speed , observe  problems the wheels might develop under wear and tear conditions .
He would also have said that since there were no testing facilities present , the engineers could have brought the wheel out to other countries to run the required tests .
Furthermore , Fraunhofer Institute  told the company that it is possible that the wheels would fail earlier than expected (09) .
Yet , no actions were taken by the company to replace the failing wheels .
To ensure that the wheels were replaced , the psychologist , in this case , would have constantly reminded the engineers to correct the errors present on the wheels .
The company claimed that the maintenance crew  had many years of experience in inspection and repairing of wheels .
Therefore , they were the "experts" in that area and whatever they said could be fully trusted .
At the Munich Maintenance Center , the night before normal operation , the acoustic sensor picked up an error of 1 .1mm .
The regulation states that the maximum allowed error was 0 .6mm .
Yet , the maintenance crew did not bother to repair or replace the wheel , assuming that it would only cause discomfort throughout the journey () .
The worn out diameter set by Fraunhofer Institute was 88cm but the company set it with their own value of 85 .4cm (Scribd , 2008) .
A psychologist present at the maintenance phase could have help prevented the accident by telling the maintenance crew nicely that they should not be so complacent just because they have many years of experience .
Just imagine that there may have been relatives or friends of the crew seating in the train that the crew assumed to be safe .
In the end , an accident happened , and the lives of those they knew were gone .
Thus , if a psychologist was included during the designing , testing and maintenance phase , the chance of the accident occurring would have been very minimal as the psychologist would have helped ensure that the design and testing of the wheels complied to the standards set by the organization .
During the maintenance phase , the psychologist would have advised the maintenance crew to be more serious in their  .
The safety of many lives depended on  .
They should not have been complacent just because they had many years of experience .
To end , I can say that with the inclusion of a psychologist , the chance of the accident happening would have been very minimal .
One of the important issues bothering people nowadays is the lack of energy supply and an increase in global warming due to the emission of greenhouse gases from current generation reactors .
This issue has been raised in various contexts and different views of the issue are shared and discussed .
Mainly , the controversies of the issue are on the safe and clean operation of nuclear reactors , such as the handling of nuclear waste and prevention of terrorist acts (Butler , 2004) .
In addition , the cost of constructing nuclear reactors must be  , given the economic constraints today .
One way to address this issue is to provide funding to further research and develop Generation IV reactors , particularly the Very- High-Temperature Reactors (VHTR) .
Next , the society is concerned with the safety and security aspect of Generation IV reactors .
Even though Generation IV reactors might generate threats from terrorist attacks to acts of wars , stricter laws and policies could be set in place for counter measures (GreenPeace , 2005) .
The recent Iran's nuclear disclosure to the world has threatened the equilibrium of power within that particular region of the world (Grier , 2009) .
A solution to this could be to enforce countries that are intending to build nuclear reactors to sign the nuclear pact with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or else legal actions might be taken against them .
In addition , it is reported that the generation IV reactors will quietly switch themselves off and cool down in an event of an earthquake , a terrorist attack or human errors (Brockie , 2009) .
The waste and pollution produced by nuclear reactors is a worrying issue to both the environmentalists and the public , however the U .S . Department of Energy (DOE) has already considered this issue and more attention is paid to it .
Today , we have about 270 tons of separated plutonium essentially in storage in multiple countries (LaMonica , 2009) .
Therefore , the U .S . DOE has named out a few important researches and development challenges if generation IV reactors were specifically used for nuclear purposes .
The U .S . DOE realises that nuclear energy has a reputation as a polluting technology , hence it must be addressed (Numark , 2000) .
Moreover , since VHTR is a CO2 emission free reactor , it will not contribute to global warming .
In addition , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) experts suggest that the U .S . should take time now to develop different "advanced fuel cycle" technologies (LaMonica , 2009) .
For these reasons , it is acceptable to jump into the conclusion that generation IV reactors would have the required technology to prevent the waste problem if it is going to be built .
'Design process' is a linear sequence of events that has a start and an end point while 'psychology' is the study of the mind , its mental function and behaviour .
By approaching the design process from a psychological angle , the usability , functionality , safety and required user competencies of the design product are ensured to match user expectations .
The major engineering accident chosen for this essay is the space shuttle Challenger accident .
The accident occurred on  28 January , 1986 when Challenger disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean seventy-three seconds into its flight , causing the death of its seven crew members .
Why is the psychology approach important to the design process ?
A system of machines , however advanced it is , can never operate by itself .
Everything that involves management , operation and decision-making comes back down to humans .
However , the human mind is a very complicated subject and a lot of problems might surface during the design process .
Therefore , psychology plays an important role during the design process in order to prevent any accidents from happening .
The Challenger accident was caused by faulty components and poor launch conditions .
The failure of the O-rings in its right solid rocket booster ignited a spark and subsequently , the flame impinged on the external fuel tank .
This then caused its structural failure and aerodynamic forces further brought about the disintegration of the space shuttle .
One human error , or more specifically a design error , led to the accident .
The two rubber O-rings in the booster were not resilient enough to withstand the hot high-pressure gases produced .
It was not known if the O-rings were able to seal properly at temperatures less than 12 C and the launch was done in cold weather at a temperature of -1 C . The booster's O-rings had been designated as a "Criticality 1" component which means that the failure of both the O-rings would result to the destruction of the orbiter and its crew .
The defect should have been identified and rectified first before the O-rings were used .
Other than that , there was also communication failure between the Morton-Thiokol engineers and the top NASA officials .
The engineers could only reported to their immediate managers who only report to their direct supervisors .
Because of this mindset , the engineers dared not go above supervisors with their concerns for fear that they might lose their job .
On several occasions , the manager of the Solid Rocket Booster project , George Hardy from Morton-Thiokol , was told by the Marshall Space Flight Centre engineers that Thiokol's booster's field joint design could not be accepted .
An engineer suggested that the secondary O-ring is useless with that joint rotation .
Despite that , Hardy did not inform Morton-Thiokol and it was accepted for flight in 1980 .
It is clear that communication failure was also the cause of the accident .
In view of today's environmental problems of global warming , there is an increasing necessity to introduce a clean , safe and efficient alternative energy source .
Although the nuclear power plant is considered safer and cleaner than fossil power plants , the devastating consequences of its occasional meltdowns deter the general public and policy makers from accepting it .
However , the development of technology has resulted in a continuous evolution of nuclear energy systems .
One of the latest prototypes of generation IV nuclear reactor is the Lead Cooled fast reactor (LFR) .
Unlike the previous generations of nuclear reactors which are constantly critiqued by opponents , the LFR is considered to be not only safer in different aspects , but also more sustainable and economical .
The most criticisms towards nuclear power generators arise from their safety issues .
The memories of the 1979 reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island made the US government hesitate to order new nuclear power plants (Nature , 2004) .
Most opponents claim that although rare , nuclear plant accidents are too catastrophic and should not be encouraged for power generation .
An example will be the 1986 core explosion at Chernobyl in Ukraine , in which 31 people were killed immediately and many more after years because of radioactive contamination .
However , good heat transmission of lead used for the LFR ensures low likelihood of core damage .
This in turn minimizes potential risks such as core meltdowns .
Also Lead's low vapor pressure lowers the chances of core explosion and its high shielding capability of gamma radiations minimizes potential off-site radioactive contamination ( All these factors reflect the LFR as a more reliable future nuclear power generator .
Social security is another safety issue that involves much dispute .
Since the 911 incident , there have been concerns about the unimaginable consequences of terrorist attacks on nuclear plants .
However , the LFR has made improvements on its physical structure to minimize physical damage from external attacks .
For example , the reactor uses independent , redundant and diversified Decay Heat Removal (DHR) loops to control damages and prevent potential radioactive releases (World Nuclear Association , 2008) .
There is no flammable or reactive coolant materials used to ensure that no big scale explosion occurs when being attacked .
In fact , various studies have shown that nuclear power plants can withstand such attacks better than almost any other civil constructions (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
The physical protection promises top security of building nuclear power plants like the LFR .
Despite the safety issues , opponents also assert that the government should discourage nuclear power plants because of the high cost incurred to construct them .
However , most of these criticisms arise from a lack of foresight .
While it is true that its first time investment of fuel and capital can be more expensive than that of a coal power plant , the plant sustainability and efficiency should also be taken into consideration .
Studies have shown that the average cost of a nuclear plant is about $30 per Megawatt-hour which is only slightly higher than $29 .1 per Megawatt-hour of a coal plant  The LFR maintains this economic competitiveness as lead is an inexpensive coolant and with long refueling cycle .
Moreover , supercritical water is used in the reactor to increase the overall efficiency of the nuclear plant .
Considering the efficiency , sustainability , and environmental friendliness of a nuclear power plant , these benefits far outweighs the small economic disadvantages Thus , the LFR can be the best alternative to replace coal power generators .
Nowadays , with the increasing population of the society , the limited resources cannot meet the large amount of demand of energy .
In order to overcome the energy shortage situation today , human beings have tried many ways to explore new kinds of energy , for instance , natural energy which includes wind energy and water energy .
However , the consequence is not that satisfactory , due to its low efficiency and high cost .
Therefore , scientists and publics have suggested that we can develop one kind of energy which can produce high energy efficiently , and that kind of energy is known as nuclear energy .
It seems a perfect solution to the bad situation nowadays , however , the use of nuclear energy becomes a controversial issue which causes fierce discussion among not only scientists , but also publics .
In my point of view , using nuclear energy is the right way to meet today's increasing energy demand , due to its high efficiencyand environmental emission .
There are several disadvantages of using  nuclear energy: The funds paid on developing this technology is high , the time taking to explore the technology is long and there exists dangers which can actually be solved .
First of all , some opponents may think that it will cost large amount of funds to develop this technology .
However , if we take all conditions into consideration , we may find that the argument is totally wrong .
Firstly , the fuel cost for a nuclear plant is only a third for a coal-fired plant in producing the same amount of electricity .
Due to this issue , we can save a lot of resources for our future .
Secondly , if we do not use nuclear energy , it will cause a serious shortage of fuel , which will lead to the  increase the price of electricity .
For example , in European countries , "the price of electricity from coal will double and that from gas will increase 30%" (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
The above data shows that if we use nuclear energy , it will at least save 50% cost , and this 50% implies saving a lot of funds as it is commonly known that the funds used for producing electricity is quite large .
Thirdly , if we keep using normal fuel energy instead of nuclear energy , it will weaken the quality of the gas , since it will emit green house gases .
In order to deal with  global warming , governments will pay a lot of money .
However , if we use nuclear energy , we will not have this kind of worry due to its non-green-house-gas emission .
In conclusion , using nuclear energy can actually save a lot of funds .
In addition , some opponents may argue that it will take a long time to explore this technology .
Here it is suitable to make an assumption .
If the time used to explore this technology is fixed , according to the conclusion reached in the previous paragraph , it is easy to know that if we explore  nuclear energy earlier , we can save more moneyand save more resources .
Moreover , human beings now cannot find a kind of ideal energy to replace the nuclear energy .
So in conclusion , it is better to explore nuclear energy as soon as possible .
Besides the above two factors , some opponents may believe that it is dangerous to use nuclear energy .
We use Very-High-Temperature-Reactors (VHTR) , which is one of Generation IV reactor concepts , as an example .
Due to the special design of its Helium Coolant , Graphite Reactor Core and temperature controlled system , the danger can be greatly reduced .
It is true that dangers still exist , however , with the development of the technology , it is desirable that those dangers could be overcome .
To sum up , the Generation IV reactors is a trend of the 21st century .
It will make a great improvement and progress for our life .
with the increasing demand of energy , only  nuclear energy is the correct choice as it has so many advantages as compared with other kinds of energies .
Its high efficiency is the most attractive .
The environmental emission makes it better for human beings .
Even though there are shortages that still exist , it is believed that with the development of the technology , all the problems will be solvedand all the difficulties can be overcome .
Design process is a linear sequence of events which was started by creative human act and ended with an invention of a new product .
It is also a kind of planning on how to apply the knowledge to the making of an object or a system .
Psychology is the characteristics of mental states and the science of human behavior .
It plays an important role in every human attempt in design processes .
({http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/psychology ?o=100074}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/psychology ?o=100074]) .
There is a relationship between psychology and design process which can prevent accidents from happening .
Design errors affect the safety of a product .
Unless the prevention method has been well-planned , one will not know about the shortcoming of a product until an accident happens .
Here is an example of a real major industrial accident  .
The world's deadliest high-speed train accident , which occurred on 3rd June 1998 , in Eschede , Germany .
It was caused by a single fatigue crack in one wheel which derailed the train when the wheel failed .
The steel tire on the wheel broke and peeled away from the wheel , penetrating into  the floor of the train .
This resulted in the vibration of the train .
The embedded metal was noticed by a passenger in the coach .
He quickly informed the conductor of the train but the conductor was procrastinating by investigating the case himself before stopping the train .
The train was totally damaged after hitting a bridge support .
The proximate causes were the disintegration of the wheel rim and the failure to stop the train after the wheel had delaminated .
Flawed emergency operating procedures were the contributing cause of this disaster .
({http://pbma .nasa .gov/docs/public/pbma/images/msm/derailed .pdf}[HYPERLINK: http://pbma .nasa .gov/docs/public/pbma/images/msm/derailed .pdf]  , {http://www .youtube .com/watch ?v=p_KLA2LMIeA}[HYPERLINK: http://www .youtube .com/watch ?v=p_KLA2LMIeA]  , {http://www .5min .com/Video/The-Eschede-Train-Disaster-in-Eschede-Germany-119997168}[HYPERLINK: http://www .5min .com/Video/The-Eschede-Train-Disaster-in-Eschede-Germany-119997168])
Failure avoidance and effective process and production control of complex systems determine the safety as well as the reliability of the system .
From the major accident discussed , it proves that the actual causes of an accident are the failures on the component of the system , individual action which is incorrect , team work activities that are incomplete and dysfunctional relations within the organizations as well as the extra organizational environment .
In the train accident above , the metal fatigue of the wheel was the component failure of the train .
If the wheel did not crack , no metal would have been embedded into the train and the derailment of the train would not have happened .
However , this accident was not just because of this single component failure .
Frequent maintenance of the wheel can help to prevent the wheel failure from occurring .
Beyond this point , human error plays an important role in initiating accidents .
Other than that , if the train had been stopped immediately when the wheel had disintegrated , the disaster might not have occurred and countless lives would have been saved .
Unfortunately , no one  pulled the emergency brake during the emergency condition .
All these show that decision-making and human action played an important part in the cause of the accident besides component failure . 
Design errors in socio-technical system have really made a significant difference in their reliability and safe operation .
Researches from the nuclear and chemical industry show that 20% to 50% of accidents and failures involve errors in design .
Moreover , since design errors are always corrected before they are involved in these incidents , the real percentage is actually much higher .
If corrective action is taken after an incident , it entails either the redesigning of the operational processes or the installation of another barrier .
These are feedback controls of safety .
They are just add-ons to the system .
However , it is better to use the path of feed-forward control of  ,  , to do a correct original system design right from the beginning .
To improve design safety , a  scientist is needed .
This person can help to analyze the future requirements of the system and to improve accident prevention .
Apart from this , a  scientist may also be called upon to help evaluate the prototype by using simulation techniques .
It is necessary to introduce add-ons as all possible design errors will not be discovered until the system is used . 
incidencesproblemsBased on the report provided bhimself(1990) , 92% of all nuclear utility accidents between 1983-1984 were caused byhimselfnd only 8% of them were cause by control room operator .
For instanerious incidences which are cited frequently in technical literature .
They were happened in Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
The failing for the first one include: operators are unprepared to handle serious accident due to the lack of training; complex and confusing operating procedure led to the operators' incorrect action; serious managerial problem within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
None of these deficiencies explain thwasbasic causes in terms of the 'operating error' .
Moreover Reason(1987) suggests two main reasons for this kind of incidence in his own report for Chernobyl .
The first factor related werepeople misunderstands of effect of their action on the whole system , and the second factor is kind of persistent action which is made by a small and cohesive group in the process of pursuing an unsuitable aim .
What is the most iroidences for his theories is that afterproblemsing these engineering psychology problems , quite a lot of America's nuclear institutes begin to train their staff in a psychology-related way , which indeed prevent the nuclear accidents from happening again till now .
preventedbeganHowever the operator errors during these two nuclear accidents cannot be ignored .
Although there is no nuclear incidence happen in recent years , it is too biased to say thoperatorsngineering psychology were solved the problems by itself .
One saying about the cause of Chernobyl disaster he problem in peculiarities of physics and the confailureon of the reactor (includedce Book) .
Fwho weretly , the Chernobyl RBMK-1000 reactor got a dangerous positive void .cCefficient .
This makes RBMK reacprocedures very unstable at lower power level .
Se .oThere were od of RBMK reactor is 1 .3 meters shorter than necessary , which led to an abnormal decrease of reactor output power .
These problems definitely cannot be solved from psychological view since even we had solved all human-related problem , these defects of system are relatesitalpeople'svmisunderstandingfacteffects again beeactionsidered as the main c .utT the reactor design a kindAEA's 1986 analysis (NEI Source Book) .
It seems that the boundary between the technological problem and psychological problem is important evidence
problemsTo sum up we can conclude from these two aspects that the human factors and the technical factor areonnected incidenceshave not happenedayed a role in the accident .
To simply solve one of them will contribute nothisolvethe accident .
Engineering accidents are not always caused by technical problems and the issue of engineering psychology will become hotter and hotter witht of technology in the area of advanced transportation , co-operative work , teleworking , health , pollution and leisure .

Nuclear energy has many advantages .
Firstly , it is environmental-friendly , with no greenhouse gas emitted .
Secondly , nucofhas incomparable workihumansficiency with other energy resources .
One kilogram uranium soon dry up the same amount of energy as that released by 2400 tons of standard coal .
As carbon dioxide emission soars and energy demands increase rapidly recent years , the nuclehave triedtion is finding its way to the table .
To satisfy the increasing demands of nuclear energy , scientists are desperately searching for ways to improve the reactors' work efficiency .
Consequently , generation IV nuclear systems are born , including six models .
They are Gas-cooled fast reactor , lead-cooled fast reactor , molten salt reactor , sodium-cooled fast reactor supercritical-water-cooled reachave increasedvery-highinrature reactor .
Among all kinds of nuclear reactors , very-high-temperature reactor is an advanced one and has a broad prospect .
It supplies heat with high core outlet temperatures , which enables applicwereons sucwhich includesogen production or process heat for the petrochemical industry .
This allows for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity .
What's more , the recycling system is well-developed .
Given so many advantages of VHTR , we should devote more effort in promoting the reactor development .
As the result of scary impressions left by two severe nuclear plants accidents in history , many people reject VHTR because of the security issue .
However , we should see the two accidents are both due to human factors rather than the reactors' own deflects .
What's more , many scientistsve studied the operation security of VHTR , like Hu , S . , Liang , X . , Wei , L . He reported his research results in "{Commissioning and Operation experience and safety experiment at HTR-10}[HYPERLINK: http://htr2006 .co .za/downloads/final_download_papers/D00000052 .pdf]" , on the Third International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology in South Africa and put forwards some constructive suggestions to improve the security condition of high temperature reactors .
Considering all these inspiring achievements on VHTR , we should have confidence that we will build secure nuclear reactors which will avoid tragedies happening .
forwardMana oliticians reject VHTR on the excuse that the cost is too much and we cannot benefit instantly .
They believe the money should be devoted to more urgereally do not agreewereth them .
We all know things are always hard before it becomes easy .
When high cost will eventually return us the ample energy supply and clean andnmensing on the current situation is unreasonable , long run strategies must be taken into consideration .
competitionsAfter all the above , we can see that we have many reasons to support arch on VHTR .
It deserves all the effort , no matter in terms of security insurance or work efficiency .
In other words , VHTR has the promising potential to be the future enesupplier .
Soreturnse should pay more attention on the developing progress and give more financial support .
And we should be optimistic that we can realize our dreamto build VHTR before 2020 and have absubstitutionslear energy .
The major refutan to developing nuclear power is about its threat to the safety of the public since conventional nuclear power produces radioactive waste and has a possibility of nuclear powhas becomeliferation (Public Citizen , 2006) .
However , safetn once the GFR concept is deployed .
GFR utilizes the waste reprocessing method , which minimizes the public's exposure to nuclear waste's radioactivity (Butler , 2004) .
Besides , the primary GFR core is loaded with transuranics from spent LWR fuel such that the plutonium created in waste reprocessing is diluted and consequently the proliferation resistance of the nuclear power plants is enhanced (Hejzlar , Pope , Williams & Driscoll , 2005) .
Furthermore , GFR adopts a passive cool-down system that reduces human's intervention substantially and thus enhances the safety of nuclear power plants (Butler , 2004) .
Another great concern of environmentalists is that the amount of Uranium on earth is limited , which means that nuclear power is not sustainable and subsequently less worthwhile for further development (Golay , 2004) .
Nonetheless , it has been shown that GFR achieves high Uranium utilization by breeding , also known as reprocessing (Hejzlar , Pope , Williams & Driscoll , 2005) .
Analyses also indicate that the amount of Uranium resources was increased by 15 percentages in two years to 2007 for intensified mineral exploration and iproducelso proven that Thorium can also act as nuclear fuel (World of Nuclear Association , 2009) .
As a result , the limitation of Uranium would be less of concern while considering the expansion of nuclear power .
With consideration of the current worldwide energy shortage , population expansion and global warming , it is appealing to bring about the generation IV nuclear power supply using GFR concept for its tremendous energy output and zero carbon emission .
Nevertheless , obstacles like finding irradiation-resistant materials and core design still need to be overcome by researches through hard work (Butler , 2004) .
Contrary to the opponents' concerns about nuclear power safety , cost and sustainability , it has been shown in the above that the generation IV nuclear power supply under the GFR concept is able to achieve higher safety goals , lower its building cost and make great economic contribution by splitting hydrogen , and exhibit improved sustainability .
Meanwhile , it produces immense energy and is free of carbon emission , which makes it even more ideal for power supply .
It is then predictable that the near future would witness the rise of nuclear power equipped with the generation IV reactor concept , GFR .
The Chernobyl incident on 26 April 1986 at Soviet Union was one of the most tragic catastrophes .
When the nuclear reactor exploded , tons of radioactive substances were released into the atmosphere .
The result was a contaminated food cycle and acute cancer-related illnesses .
Some of the damage reports done by scientists suggest that a minimal of 30000 deaths in 1986 were related to cancer arising from extreme exposure to the radiation .
To add on to the figures , the current death toll stands at a frightening 500000 .
According to Blackeye(2004) , the accident was primarily caused by a flawed Soviet designed reactor .
This reactor , named reactor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny(RBMK) was actually meant for producing nuclear weapons .
Design of the reactor was such that even when the rate of cooling of the reactor was insufficient to compensate the increase in temperature , it will still be operational .
In other reactor designs , either the plant or the reactors will be automatically shut down .
This tragic event could have been avoided , or at least , the resultant damage  kept minimal if psychology was implemented in the operating process and procedures of the plant .
The component that was probably the highest contributor to the risk factor was the RMBK reactor .
Soviet engineers used it even though the design was flawed and had a positive void coefficient (RBMK , 2006) .
This was probably due to the fact that the design was unique and was not only found anywhere and posed a great risk . .
Some of the strengths of the RBMK reactor would be that it could be refilled on the go and sustain no core damage for a significant length of time should there be a power loss  However , there are more weaknesses related to the reactor that may cause the reactor to be considered unsafe .
Thirdly , as mentioned by ILO Online(2006) , there was an absence of proper training and safe working environment .
The workers were not given adequate training to handle and operate the machinery involved .
While some may argue that training was unrecorded or informal , it is only proper to provide authorized and thorough training so that accidents can be avoided .
As the saying goes , it is human to make mistakes .
Based on Wilpert(2007) ,had psychology been used in this context , the explosion at Chernobyl could have been averted .
As mentioned in the previous point , funding from the government could have helped to reduce the strain on the firm running the plant .
External parties could have been called in to provide the training required .
The use of psychology in design processes reduces problems by enabling an engineer to consider the pros and cons of his decision .
With psychology as a guiding tool , engineers are able to think of the possible fallbacks of their decisions .
Most design related problems are because of the difficulty people face in understanding the consequences of their actions (Stanton , 1996) .
While opponents might argue on the impertinence of the use of psychology and its effectiveness in reducing problems , it is undeniable that the use of psychology makes all team members take meticulous care in implementing decisions and hence make the design process safer .
The use of psychology would seek to improve engineering designs by preventing  human errors associated with the process .
A psychologist will seek to understand the mindsets of various members and thus foresee human error on their parts .
Shelton (1999) discussed the impact of human error on even the simplest tasks .
With human error being the trigger to accidents (Wilpert ,2007) , it is very crucial to nip human error in the bud .
Opponents might suggest ergonomics instead .
They would challenge that the design process should be made to suit the engineer so that human error on man's part can be avoided .
This argument cannot hold mainly because human error is evident everywhere and changing the design process would only mean a new set of human errors .
Instead with the use of psychology aiding the sculpting of a safe design process  , we can prevent accidents .
.Some managers are against employing psychologists because ta psychologistnd extra money on psychologists' salaries .
If 3 psycholists serve the whole company , every psychologist can get 4000 Singapore dollars per month , and then three psychologists will get 144000 Singapore dollars includecompany for one year .
The amount is a large outcome .
Three Mile Island accident was resulead to by human error and designproblems (Backgr .under on The Three Mile Island Accident , 2009) .
The whole factory was in ruin , all the residents living in the villages that close to the Three Mile Island must move away .
It is much expensive then S$144000 , and thousands of lives were threatened .
People who do not agree that psychology is useful in engineer work demonstrate the purpose of engineering design .
The engineering design is to apply technologies to help people solving problems .
The issue of how to attract consumers is none business with engineers .
Furthermore , they think the job of design engineer is to build factoramounttuThe threeow to operate is somethingthe result of operators .
It sounds correct in sgineers must consider safe fruinsrs when they design the structure .

morehe arrangemthan of products and instructions are incomprehensible and complicated , purchasers will be confused when using these gadgets .
(Bernhard , 2006) If people do not like using the product , the product is a failure .
Design engineers always overestimate the ability of users; the design may not give sufficient help to operators .
(Bernhard , 2006) Three Mile Island's tragic consequence is caused by the inadequate structure design .
When the radioactive gas and coolant were leaked , the valve should be closed immediately in order to prevent radioactive materials draining away .
The operator thought that the valve has been closed , but there is no instrument showing the position of valve .
(Three Mile Island 1979 , 2001)Then this accident happened .
If designers have designed an instrument to show the process of cooling circuit , then operators may know that the valve had not been closed , and this disaster may be prevented .

The earth is fdeservesncrease in global temperature , which is commonly known as global warming .
This is resulted from the emissions of greenhouse gas , such as carbon dioxide , in energy generation using fossil fuels .
Besides , with the rapid development of industry and huge increase of population , there are booming energy demands in every country .
As a result , there is an urgent need to find substitute for coal and oil .
Under such circumstances , scientists and engineers find out a new kind of energy-nuclear energy .
Nuclear power technology is expected to provide clean and sufficient energy in the future .
However , there is much debate over this technology .
Cost and security are the two main reasons for opposition to nuclear power technology in many countries .
Even with these two reasons , it is still necessary to provide funding for research on nuclear power .
Opponents of nuclear power technology argue over the security of such technology .
Many people worry about radiation and other serious accidents .
According to Butler (2004) , partial reactor melted down in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , and of the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , during which the reactor core exploded , killing some 31 people immediately [1] .
However , nucsubstitutesor designers take security into account when they are designing and cohave foundung a nuclear plant .
Tcalledere are many internal and external facilities built to ensure secure operation .
Thus , current nuclear power plants are able to withstand accidents from various events based on design .
For example , in England , the controlling computers will shut down the reactor automatically if something abnormal happens .
Moreover , "Laws and statues exist in most countries to ensure the safe operation of nuclear plant" (Lillington , 2004) [2] .
Hence , security of nuclear energy generation can be guaranteed and it is no need to worry too much about security .
thereAnother reason for opposition to nuclear power is the high cost of reactor construction .
It is very expensive to construct and maintain and run a nuclear power plant .
However , scientists and engineers are trying to simplify the reactors .
In generation IV , ircritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR) , many parts can be cut from the design compared to previous light water reactLWR) , thus reducing construction cost .
According to Stephens (2006) , the US spends $1 billion on FutureGen project which aims at development of carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS) [3] .
In addition , the global warming effects may result in droughts which will reduce crop production and air pollution can result in acid rain which can corrode many properties .
The usage of nuclear power helps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas , slowing down global warming and purifying air which will in turn reduce the indirect cost of greenhouseas .
A .Finally , funding should be provided for research on nuclear power technology .
Fossil fuel is depletable energy .
It is running out at a high speed .
Substitute must be found before fossil fuel is totally run out .
Nuclear energy is a good alternative .
Currently , nuclear industry is generating 17% of the world's electricity .
If technical hurdles involved in building the next generation of reactors can be solved by scientists and engineers , then we can get secure , inexpensive , and abundant energy .
It is very likely that in the near future , nuclear energy will be one main energy resources .
In conclusion , the opposition reasons of nuclear power technology can be overthrow .
The nuclear power technology can solve not only environmental pSubstitutessed by the combustion of fossil fu , but alsrunsnergy shortage at low cost and in environmental-friendly way .
In this situation , nuclear power deserves the research funding for further development .
Supercritical-water-cooled reactor is a nuclear reactor which uses supercritical-water , water at very high pressure , as coolant .
It functions in temperature ranging from approximately 500 to 650 degrees Celsius and at very high pressure .
Many skeptics oppose the idea of building nuclear reactors as they fear that a similar incident to that in Chernobyl might happen again .
However , I believe this is not very likely as supercritical-water-cooled reactor is designed differently to avoid such an incident from reoccurring .
In addition , the benefits that a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could bring are worth further researching and funding in the supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
Many skeptics oppose the idea of building nuclear reactors due to worries of their safe operation .
One major nuclear incident was that in Chernobyl CITATION Dav04 \l 1033 (Bodansky , 2004) .
This reactor back then worked on a positive void coefficient of reactivity .
Therefore , when the control rods went wrong , the reactor entered a series of positive feedbacks and was unable to stop the reactivity of the nuclear reactor .
This resulted in continuous rise in temperature which caused the carbon part of the nuclear core to catch fire due to the high heat within the reactor .
The fire and explosion from the reactors caused the widespread of nuclear substance into the air and hence a devastating nuclear incident .
However , the supercritical-water-cooled reactor works on a negative void coefficient which will reduce the reactivity of the reactors , should any problem arise .
The nuclear reactor would be shut down if the nuclear core was to malfunction or the cooling system was to leak , thereby halting all nuclear reactivity .
These will put the nuclear reactivity under control .
Therefore the worries of the skeptics are unnecessary and further research and funding of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor should take place .
Secondly , skeptics argue that under high temperature and pressure , materials tend to deteriorate faster and become weak .
Therefore building a reactor to run under the conditions of a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could be dangerous .
I agree that under high temperature and pressure , materials generally tend to deteriorate faster and would have a lower lifespan .
However , the structure of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor is designed such that its pressure threshold rises with temperature .
(Baindur , 2008) This makes the skeptics' worry redundant as the structure is designed to specifically operate under  high temperature and pressure .
Therefore , further research and funding in the supercritical-water-cooled reactor should take place .
Lastly , the benefits that a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could bring make it worthwhile to continue research and funding  into the reactor .
The reactor is much more efficient than conventional light water reactors: the supercritical-water-cooled reactor has a thermal efficiency of 45% which is approximately one-third higher than that of conventional light water reactors  (Baindur , 2008) .
Furthermore , the supercritical-water-cooled reactor is just an improvement of the conventional water reactor , making it relatively cheap to build .
Also , nuclear power is not a source of carbon dioxide , a major greenhouse gas that causes global warming .
The high thermal efficiency and environmental friendly characteristic of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor make it attractive to build the reactor .
Therefore , there should be further research and funding into the building of supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
The world's demand for energy has increased drastically over the last few decades .
As fossil fuels and natural gas are depleting quickly , nuclear energy has emerged as a vital and strategic energy source in the world's future energy supply market .
The demand for nuclear energy has led to the initiative of developing Generation IV nuclear reactors guided by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) .
Among the six prototypes of nuclear reactors designed , the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) is one of the most promising candidates proposed in the GIF (Umeda , 2008 .
However , many people strongly oppose this new prototype due to their inherent fear about nuclear plants .
Nonetheless , the VHTR is claimed to not only offer high-efficient electricity production but is also designed 
Opponents of the VHTR have argued that developing heat-resistant materials for the VHTR is a challenge unlikely to be overcome .
However , the basic technology of producing heat-resistant materials has long been well established in former High Temperature Gas Reactors plants , such as the US Fort Saint Vrain and Peach Bottom prototypes .
Moreover , this technology has been furthermore improved to meet higher temperature requirement .
For example , Japan's Atomic Energy Research Institute based in Kashiwa has already operated a similar reactor as the VHTR which is able to reach a record high temperature of 950 Degree Celsius in 2004 (Butler , 2004 .
Therefore , developing materials that resist high temperatures is no longer a problem for building the VHTR .
In fact , the VHTR has the highest technical feasibility amongst the six prototypes so far . 
Opponents are also worried about the difficulty in controlling the temperature of the VHTR in the event of an accident .
Vivid in people's minds is the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania .
Opponents argue that the VHTR's very high operating temperature may lead to similar accidents due to reactor meltdown if it were to be built .
However , the opponents are probably unaware of the safety measures specially designed for the VHTR .
The core of the VHTR with multiple protection layers inside is able to withstand heat at temperatures up to 1600  C without cracking .
Even in the case of core cracking down , there is also a backup system in place .
Heat can be conducted from the core through air-cooled panels so that the core can be cooled down in a few seconds .
(Rachael Elder & Ray Allen , 2008) Thus the VHTR will be a very safe prototype givenitst multiple protection layers and effective backup system .S
Another reason why people oppose the VHTR is that its waste is not reprocessed , hence a growing amount of resources are required to store the waste .
However , not reprocessing the waste ensures no production of plutonium , which is a by-product in the processing , and it can be used to make nuclear weapons .
Moreover , waste reprocessing is expensive and fuel consuming as it requires continuous burning of the wastes (Declan , 2004 .
Therefore , the benefits of not reprocessing the waste overweigh the costs of storing the waste . 
In addition , the VHTR is a highly efficient reactor .
Very high gas temperatures can be achieved (900-1000  C) within the VHTR to separate hydrogen gas efficiently , thus it offers highly efficient electricity generatio .
.)
It can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared to conventional nuclear plants .

On July 17 , 1981 in Kansas City , Missouri , United States , The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse killed 114 people and injured more than 200 others during a tea dance .
It was one of the deadliest structural collapses in U .S . history (Martin , 1981 .
The accident was caused by the lack of communication between the designers and the constructors .
Although it may not be possible to avoid all accidents from happening , we can take some measures to decrease the possibility of risks .
The involvement of psychology during engineering processing is a helpful and practicable measure .
It can lower the possibility of accidents that are caused by human factors .
In the case of walkway collapse , it can be estimated that if psychology was applied during the structural processing , the collapse would have been avoided .
The design and construction of building are regarded as the work of engineers and irrelevant with psychology .
However , people are likely to make mistakes in every aspect in life , including engineering processing .
Lots of accidents are caused by human factors rather than technical problems or financial liability .
Previous research finds that about 90 percent of engineering accidents are due to human errors (Gordon & Flin , 2001 .
Hence , psychology , a human science which studies human's mental processes and behaviors can help to decrease the mistakes caused by human factors ( .
To further explain it , psychology can be used to analyse the man-made reasons which causes errors , such as engineers' attitudes , habits and social ability .
After that we can obtain some strategies from the analysis and utilize them in the engineering processing to prevent accidents from happening .
In the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse , the design was modified halfway , which was thought as a small trivial by both the designers and the constructors .
They believed that the party had rechecked the details , while in fact nobody did before construction .
Therefore it can be expected that if psychology was involved during the construction , this tragedy caused by lack of responsibility would not have occurred at all !
Some opponents argue that it is a "wise after event" or just an imagination to use psychology during engineering processing , for it is hard to combine  abstract psychology with concrete engineering processing .
However , as a branch of today's applied psychology , psychology in industrial safety is quite practical and convenient to conduct .
What needs to be done is to organize some training sessions which can make the engineers more skillful , or some meetings that cover the common mistakes in engineering processing which embed the awareness of safety in people's mind .
Furthermore , there could also be some encouraging activities which help to build the engineers' loyalty towards their companies and help them to realize their importance in the companies .
Study has proved that when employees feel they are valued during a mission , they tend to be more responsible and as a result , the safety and quantity of production are greatly improved (Kelley , 1996 .
As for the collapse accident , if somebody had been responsible and rechecked the design , it could have been avoided .
To summarize , If psychology was involved in the building of Hyatt Regency walkway collapse , which was a practicable measure , this unfortunate accident would have been eliminated at the very beginning .
As a big breakthrough , nuclear power was discovered by two Germany scientists , Otto Hahn and Fritz Stresemannin 1938 .
They found that , when they used a neutron to collide with another heavy nuclear , the nuclear broke into two parts and there was some mass lost .
The lost mass generates what we call "atomic energy" ,  .
After that , the atomic bomb came up , which led to end of the World War II .
Actually , the reason why atomic bomb killed so many people is not the explosion itself .
it is the radiation generated by the Uranium and chain reaction .
The radiation will not dissipate within 100 years .
When people began to use controlled chain reaction , they were really concerned about the radiation and the impact on environment .
From early 1960s to 1980s there were several anti-nuclear movements in United Sates , which showed people's concern about the nuclear power .
Although the Atomic Energy Commission had advocated for peaceful uses of nuclear power since the development of a atomic bomb , people were still worried about that .
Although we cannot say it is safe enough to use nuclear power , Uranium is really a clean and cheap resource compared to coal and oil .
First , it won't give off carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide , which has a positive impact on our environment .
We are really worried about the Green house gases now , there is  data to show that every year the temperature globally increases from 0 .2 to 0 .3 degree Celsius .
So , it is very effective to use Uranium to stop the Green house gases .
Second , the cost of purifying Uranium and getting coal which generate the same amount of energy is almost the same .
It is means that the cost is acceptable .
Pure Uranium is easy to transport , because only 1 ton of Uranium will  use the same energy as burning 5000tons of coal .
So , many countries , including U .S , China , Russia , France , U .K and Japan , have begun to use Uranium .
In the twentieth century , the safety of using Uranium is still under  discussion .
A few accidents have happened during the Uranium's purification  and reaction process .
Our human ability is limited .
We cannot say that we have fully controlled the nuclear reaction process , but it now can be controlled and  rate .
What our government is happy to hear is that , Uranium is still enough to support us for hundreds of years , although it is hard to be purified .
There are many Uranium mines existing underground .
One concern expressed by the public and governments is the vulnerability of plants to attack by terrorists as well as the usage of nuclear waste by product as a weapon .
Under the new SCWR power plant security blueprint , these concerns are well taken into consideration .
More patrols , stronger and more capable security forces , additional physical barriers , greater stand-off distances for vehicle checks  , more restrictive site access controls were introduced to minimize security risks(U .S .URC , 2008) .
The United Nations had also called upon the world leaders to improve security in order to prevent radioactive material from falling into the hands of terrorists .
There are also plans for a centralized , permanent , and secure waste repositories to be built and for security stationed along transportation routes to be increased(BBC , 2003) .
Apart from the increase in nuclear plants' security , enhanced scram system fitted in SCWR could shut down a reactor in less than 5 second severely deterring a terrorist force with  any intention to release radioactivity(Gonyeau , 2006) .
Lastly , the SCWR is also able to operate without having to depend on the much debated reprocessing of plutonium waste(Butler , 2004) .
Opponents perceive costs and performance of nuclear reactors as inferior to conventional reactors .
It was pointed out that the costs of constructing a nuclear plant , decommissioning nuclear facilities and the costs of storing nuclear waste are expensive .
Materials needed for the plants are also either costly , rare or do not exist yet .
Moreover , much public subsidy funding and tax expenditures are consumed in nuclear research and development projects when they could be used to invest in alternative renewable energy technologies .
However , the SCWR will actually be economically viable .
Far simpler designs , with elimination of circulation pumps , pressurizers , steam generators , steam separators and dryers reduce its capital and building costs(Butler , 2004) .
Additionally , the supercritical coolant has a high specific enthalpy and promises to deliver high thermal efficiencies of approximately 45% versus the current 33% of light water reactors(Buongiorno , 2002) .
Combination of higher operating temperature which increases power output and low fuel utilization translates to cheaper energy .
The SCWR estimates are at $900/kWe and  2 .9/kWh(Buongiorno , 2002) which can be considered to meet the economic and sustainability requirements .
So despite its high initial capital cost and operation , nuclear power is still competitive with fossil fuel for electricity generation .
If the social , health and environmental costs are also taken into account , nuclear power plants will be exceedingly outstanding compared to fossil-fueled plants(World Nuclear Association[WNA] , 2009) .
Finally , experts speculated that increasing scarcity of oil will drive oil prices up to $100 and $150 per barrel in the future(Huffman , 2009) which will lead to an increase in energy prices for fossil-fueled power plants .
It is evident that in the long run , when energy cost for fossil-fueledplantstincreasese continually , using nuclear power for electricity generation is much more economical .
To sum it all , SCWR can effectively meet the requirements of the modern globalised world  while addressing all the various concerns .
It is specifically designed to be very safe and free from accidents .
Newer technology helps to increase energy security as well as produces cleaner energy .
Many security enhancements will also be put in place to protect the plants from potential terrorist threats .
In fact , SCWR is considered to be proliferation resistant .
In addition , it is categorised as a more efficient and cheaper energy source than conventional power technologies .
SCWR could indeed replace prevalent fossil-fuel reactors by economical standards .
With continual R&D funding for development , SCWR will become a reliable and bountiful source of power in the future .
"Nuclear power is going to be an important part of our energy mix !"
declared President Obama's secretary of energy (Biello , 2009) .
To the mind of opponents of nuclear power , the construction of nuclear power plants will put Mother Earth under threat as nuclear accidents , such as the notorious Chernobyl in year 1986 , can cause massive destruction to the environment and more importantly , they are inevitable .
However , as the days go by , the number of opponents against nuclear energy is decreasing due to the advancements in technology and the realization of the need for alternative sources of power .
Out of the six Generation-IV (Gen-IV) nuclear reactors that are introduced , the supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) appears to show the most potential to be the nuclear power plant for the next generation  .
Not only is it safer and more cost efficient , but it also yields the most consistent performance as compared to the other types of nuclear reactors .
As the name suggest , the coolant of the SCWR uses water , which is safer than other types of cooling agents .
This gives people a sense of security when SCWR is used .
However , advocates may argue that water in such nuclear reactor behaves differently due to the high pressurization required for it to reach a temperature of as high as 300 Degrees Celsius .
Comparatively , other types of coolant agent , such as sodium , react more actively in air and  may cause a massive explosion and a sudden discharge of radioactive particles into the air if leakage were to occur .
(Clonemaster , n .d .) As such , water is the preferred option as a leakage will , at most , contaminate the water in the surrounding of the nuclear power plant and such an occurrence will only pose limited damage to our environment .
(Hindell , 1999) Moreover , SCWR is a modification of the proven light water reactor technology , which is operating extensively in the world currently (OECD Nuclear Energy Agency , n .d . ) .
With the absence of any major accidents involving these nuclear reactors , we can safely conclude that the usage of SCWR is more secured than the new concepts of power plants , for which their technology is yet to be fully enhanced .
The cost of electricity generated is another factor that will be of immense concern to the public .
It will be unrealistic if one has to pay much more for every kilowatt of electricity used .
Ideally , SCWR uses water which is available at a very low cost , as compared to lead and helium .
Nevertheless , critics will point to the unavailability of technology to develop materials , such as the corrosive-resistant core structure that will be able to withstand SCWR conditions (OECD Nuclear Energy Agency , n .d .) , resulting in the large amount of investments required to be pumped into the research of such materials .
The cost of implementation of the SCWR may then seem to be too steep .
In spite of this argument , the capital cost of electricity generated from the SCWR will be lower in the long run , due to the simplicity of its structure  that will make up for the high initial building cost (Buongiorno , 2002) .
This can be backed up by the fact that most nuclear power plants can operate beyond their typical design lifespan of 30-40 years with proper maintenance and the gradual improvement of technology (International Atomic Energy Agency , 2009) .
Consequently , it will be wise to choose the SCWR ahead of the other Gen-IV reactors when it comes to producing low cost power for the future .
In conclusion , the SCWR is the  ideal candidate for the next generation of nuclear power reactors .
Besides being dependable for its continuous supply of power , it is also the cheapest and the safest alternative among all choices .
As we move away from our dependency on the combustion of coal for energy , we must , at the same time , ensure that the alternative source will be able to perform as well .
In the meantime , this is impossible but at the rate which environmental organizations are progressing , I envision the day where we have zero dependence on coal for energy and SCWR takes its place at full speed !
The soundtrack , My Heart Will Go On sung by Celine Dion , was the theme song for the Oscar winning mega blockbuster movie , Titanic .
The movie was based on a true story whereby the ship named Titanic collided  with an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage .
Eventually , it became one the worst maritime accidents that occurred during peacetime .
Being the largest , most luxurious and technologically advanced liner of her time (FDS Development , n .d) , the Titanic clearly enjoyed the prestige .
However , her downfall was partly due to human error .
Since then , more attention had been given to the area of human psychology in relation to engineering design process .
In view of this , I believe that this is the appropriate direction we should adopt to prevent major accidents from happening .
Rather , we should focus on the psychology of engineers and scientists who invent and apply the technology to meet our worldly needs .
In the case of Titanic , the ship was equipped with high technology water compartment system that would shut special doors in the event of any emergency .
This led engineers to think that Titanic was the safest ship at that point of time .
The Titanic was equipped with only 20 lifeboats , so that bulky lifeboats would not take up precious deck space for the first class passengers .
There were 20 lifeboats having a total capacity of 1178 people which was only enough to hold half of the Titanic passengers (History On The Net , 2007) .
This illustrates the point that despite having improved technology , accidents can still happen due to over-confidence and reliance on technology .
Furthermore , the idea of the Titanic being "sinkable" supported the notion that people at that time were overly confident .
While we understand that technology can help to prevent accidents when applied appropriately , it ultimately falls to the management of people .
Therefore if the engineers of the Titanic were prudent in the engineering design process , they would have included a high margin of safety factor to anticipate possible failure during its construction  .
Needless to say , the fatalities of that collision would have been minimized .
Not surprisingly , many detractors suggest that the main reason why the Titanic sank was due to the fact that the terrain at which Titanic was sailing was poor .
During the night before the collision , the ocean was icy cold and was filled with icebergs .
This made navigation difficult .
There were more icebergs in the North Atlantic that year than it had been for fifty years (White Star Line , n .d) .
While it is true that we cannot control the climate to suit our needs , we can always suit the environment by taking a proactive stance in contingency planning .
By taking a proactive stance in planning , we can identify our main priority and set goals achieving it in view of a possible setback .
One of the reasons why the Titanic sank was  the fact that the safety was being compromised for aesthetics and convenience .
For instance , the telegraphers ignored warnings from other ships about the icebergs ahead .
Instead , they were so busy sending private messages for the passengers , so they did not think about those warnings that much (BBC , 2000) .
When the crew spotted an iceberg ahead , the ship was steering too fast and could not avoid it despite performing emergency procedures .
This showed that the telegrapher had a wrong mindset in the first place .
He gave priority for private messages over the safety of the ship .
This mindset was probably induced by the culture of the working environment of the Titanic .
As the Titanic was exclusive and luxurious , the culture of the staff working was to first please their occupants , then consider safety .
Such a mindset can also be seen even in today's service industry whereby "customer is always first" .
In addition , the Captain of the Titanic did not reduce the speed at which the ship was traveling in order to arrive at their destination earlier .
He had in fact been influenced to "speed up" not necessarily in order for the Titanic to set a crossing record , but to beat the Olympic's (Titanic's sister ship) crossing record (Titanic and Other White Star Line , n .d) .
These only go to show that the crew of the Titanic had set the wrong priorities .
Therefore , if we neglect the psychological aspect of any engineering application , we can be certain that more accidents will happen .
In the case of the Titanic , the accident could had been avoided if the Captain had adopted a 'safety first' culture in the workplace and had made contingency plans for any emergency .
In conclusion , we cannot deny  the fact that psychology had an impact on the way we process and manage technology .
So long as there is a human factor in the engineering process , the use of psychology is inevitable .
In fact as we rely more on technology , we place more responsibilities on the few individuals who manage it .
In addition , we need to pay more attention to the way we set our priorities .
When we set wrong priorities , we head in the wrong direction despite having the best technology available .
After all , technology only assists us in achieving our material goals but when it comes to psychology , it has no part to play .
The term sophistication has made quite an impact in the lives of people all over the globe .
Technical advancement and uplift in standards of living has resulted ultimately in the rapid consumption of natural resources .
So viewing the present situation in this ominous light , the ultimate solution we get to think of is to find new means to sustain the exploding population .
Electric power is as important to the people now as  food clothing and shelter are .
How do we meet the power needs of the growing world with this limited power sources we have ?
The solution is offered by the Generaton IV nuclear power plants .
The Generation IV concepts offer a promising solution to the power issue through their very high efficiency in conversion of thermal energy to electricity  compared to their Generation 3 counterparts .
They also offer security in the event of an onsite emergency which assures us of the non repeat of another Chernobyl incident and wins our support .
There are several Generation IV nuclear power plant concepts which can be incorporated .
What we must remember is that we do not have the luxury of time to sit and research each and every concept as time is critical .
Our resources are fast disappearing and  we have to take some radical steps now .
The safety features of SCWR are passive; they  do not need human instructions in case of an onsite emergency .
The main concept of the safety features is that when there is an emergency , depressurization of the plant takes place , i . e the pressure inside the plant decreases .
However , if there is a large break in the feed water lines , the heating of fuel will be rapid and this will result in an emergency .
Though the passive safety features will take over  ,the plant will be non operational .
The GFR has a similar passive safety feature .
It has a few elements added in it which shut down the system during an onsite emergency( Wilfred , University of Delft 2004) .Besides this , the plant is made up of materials which can withstand very high temperatures .
So there will not be any calamities possible .
And it also does not lead to problems of plutonium fuel as it serves as an incinerator which burns away the wastes .
( Wilfred , University of Delft 2004) .
Thus , on the whole , if we compare the two models on the basis of these three very important criteria , we find that very clearly the GFR  has an edge over that of the SCWR and hence it should be pursued for research and not SCWR .
The nuclear power models are chosen and approved by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) based on the aspects of their cost , security and performance .
Two popular models under debate are Gas Cooled Fast Reactor(GFR) and Super critical water reactor(SCWR) .
I prefer the GFR over SCWR for many reasons which we will discuss in this essay .
On the basis of performance the SCWR has a net thermal efficiency of 45% (Jacapo Buongiomo 2002) .
It is a simplified model of the light water reactor which is very efficient in providing electricity  .
It has both open and closed fuel cycle models which can be incorporated .
In addition to this , it can also be suited to provide hydrogen upon further modifications .
However , this thermal efficiency of SCWR is less  compared to the GFR .
A model evaluation was done by scientists Ning Dong , Yao Weida for the SCWR and it found the following problems  to which SCWR was susceptible: (i) loss of feedwater flow ,  , (ii) loss of feedwater heating and (iii) large break in the feedwater lines , which , if unmitigated , results in coolant stagnation in the core and rapid overheating ofthe fuel .
Thus as we see there seem to be many problems with it .
The GFR plant has a net thermal efficiency of 48% (Hussein Khalil , Kevan Weaver 2002) .
It uses helium as coolant which increases inertness .
And it uses closed fuel cycle , thus the used fuel can be reused  .
It can also be effectively used for manufacturing hydrogen as well as for actinide management .
Thus clearly GFR outshines SCWR in performance .
The cost of construction of SCWR plant is half a billion  .
(INEEL FY 03 ANNUAL BUDGET REPORT) Thus SCWR is regarded as a very cheap solution to the power crisis .
For this very low rate of construction and maintenance we get a good amount of electricity for a lot of people .
However , the point  I would like to make here is this .
Though the cost of installation of plant and maintenance might be less ,  the plant life is only 60 years .
In other words , every 60 years the plant has to once again be renewed .
This is a very expensive affair .
The core of the reactor has to be replaced every 34 years .
So when all factors are taken into consideration , it is an expensive reactor .
The cost of GFR plan is nearly a billion dollars (INEEL FY 03 ANNUAL BUDGET REPORT) .
However , though it might be higher than that of SCWR the plant life is longer .So we do not need to change the plant very often unlike the SCWR . .In addition to this it can produce hydrogen as well as manage actinides .
Thus the overall contribution to economy clearly justifies its cost .It is a healthy investment .
In recent years , there have been unremitting arguments on whether developing countries should proceed with building generation IV reactors .
For a developing country where the economy is rather unstable , people are facing poverty and high unemployment; thus ,  it is vital for the country to solve these problems before handling other issues like developing power reactors .
For example in Afghanistan , according to statistics , the unemployment rate is estimated to be as high as 40% in 2008 (CIA , 2009) .
Even though it is known that developing generation IV reactors will benefit the country significantly , we cannot neglect the destructive effects that come simultaneously .
Therefore , developing countries need to solve unemployment and poverty in rural areas first , before they provide huge funding to build generation IV reactors .
Opponents maintain that  developing power reactors would enable the public to benefit from low-priced electricity that can build more factories which will eventually help to create jobs for the people as well as alleviate poverty .
However , this claim only takes into consideration the operation cost in the long run and does not take into account  the high set up cost estimated in 2009 to be around 10 billion dollars for just one reactor (Travis , Johanna , & Emily , 2009) .
The maintenance cost , money required for storage of waste was investigated to be about 13 .
3 billion today (Nevada study , 2007) and money to conduct continuous research and development (R&D) is estimated around 1 .275 billion dollars (Nuclear Age Peace Foundation , 2009) .
This large sum of money would ultimately be the main reason that might lead to the termination of the development since developing countries with an unstable economy will find it too costly to provide such a huge fund in the long run (Reportlinker , 2009) .
This will then lead us back to our issue where poverty and unemployment remain unsolved and the huge sum that goes to developing the power reactor has also gone to waste .
Thus , developing countries should strengthen its economy by solving the problem for unemployment and poverty first before  developing  power reactors .
Apart from the above points , it is mentioned by the opponents that by developing power reactors , many job opportunities will be created for the people since they need a labour force  to run the plant .
However , it is important to know that the labour force that is required by plants is a highly skilled workforce (Michael , 2005) .
Examples of such positions are nuclear technicians , radiologic technicians , researchers , monitoring technicians and reactor operators .
These roles demand knowledge of physics , mathematics , chemistry , public safety and security .
In developing countries , there will not be sufficient skilledlabour to support the development since most of the people are not equipped with such skills (Travis et al . , 2009) .
In due course , developing countries will need to hire foreign talent to take up those positions .
In the end , the locals will still suffer from poverty and remain unemployed while foreign talent will have numerous jobs to choose from .
In addition , power reactor plants are dealing with very-high-temperature reactors; some  of the reactors like Gas-cooled fast reactors and Supercritical-water-cooled reactors even need high pressure to operate .
Furthermore , to prevent radioactive waste from being stolen for the creation of nuclear weapon , scientists are going to modify radioactive elements in such a way that they will be too hot for human beings to handle even with the use of gloves (Nature , 2004)  .
Under such conditions where the high temperature is not a suitable work environment , the plants must involve highly automated machineries in order for the operations to be carried out .
In order words , the plant only creates a handful of employment opportunities for the people given that the plant is functioning automatically .
Hence , by developing power reactors in developing countries , only limited jobs will be created for the local people .
In summary , if developing countries with unstable economy were to develop generation IV reactors , they would face difficulties in funding the enormous sum of money for set up and operation in the long run (Hore et al .
, 2008; Reportlinker , 2009) .
The development of nuclear generator IV requires much R&D and high  technology; thus ,  local workforce might not have enough talented labour to support the operation .
Moderately skilled and lowly skilled workers will still be unable to secure a job .
Moreover , with high technology generation IV reactors , plants are mostly computerized and automated and they require only a small labour force .
Therefore , by developing reactors it will not improve the unemployment and poverty situation in the country , hence it would be wiser to develop the country first .
Developing the country can provide funding to assist locals in setting up businesses and factories or encourage Multinational Corporation to set up plants in their country .
By doing so , many jobs will be created for the people .
This would be the most effective and direct method to resolve the unemployment issue .
After that , the poverty state will also improve gradually since the country's economy is boost up through time .
With a stronger work force and economy , the country will then be ready to support the developing of power reactors .
Nuclear power involves the energy generated from the splitting of atoms , also known as nuclear fission .
The reason why the public reject the idea of nuclear power could be due to the Chernobyl power plant meltdown , one of the most tragic nuclear-related disasters in human history .
The ramification of the Chernobyl incident is so severe to the extent that it reminds everyone of death when nuclear power is mentioned .
We cannot prevent the public from having their biased and negative perspective on nuclear power but we cannot deny the fact that the Chernobyl disaster is a result of poor management and design of the power plant (Case details: Chernobyl accident (n .d)) .
Although the public oppose nuclear power due to its dangerous drawbacks on the world and its environment , it is crucial to support and fund further research and development for Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTR) .
The public feel that nuclear proliferation is imminent and fear the danger of excessive nuclear waste .
In other words , every nuclear plant is like a potential nuclear bomb and terrorist attacks are inevitable .
However , such claims would be deemed invalid in the context of a VHTR .
Among the proposed Generation IV nuclear plants , VHTR is one of the few which does not reprocess the resultant nuclear waste .
Reprocessing involves the separation of uranium and weapon-grade plutonium from radioactive waste which sums up the fear of plutonium war .
Therefore , VHTR is proliferation-proof as it does not reprocess nuclear waste .
Furthermore , VHTR produces less radioactive waste compared to other proposed reactors .
Shropshire and Herring (2004) claim that the heavy metal radioactive waste produced in VHTR is significantly low with every unit of energy generated and this is due to the plant's high thermal efficiency and high fuel burn up .
It implies that the total plutonium generated is less per unit of energy produced .
Waste treatment plans are also in place to tackle the lingering problem of long-live radioactive waste .
For instance , in the liquid state treatment , the by-products are constantly evaporated to reduce its radioactivity (2004) .
As for the remaining nuclear waste , it is stored in an underground repository  where multilayers of anti-radiation materials are installed to shield them from the external environment .
It may be true that nuclear power , akin to fossil fuel , is a non-renewable resource .
Naturally , the public would argue that it is not worth the funding and time to develop something which does not offer a long term solution .
Although from a general point of view , it is possible to recycle nuclear fuel  it is not ideal as reprocessing is costly and generates the dreaded plutonium .
Langwith(2009) states that uranium in Canada can only last for 40 years .
The projected time span definitely does not appeal to what the public see as long term , however , it is shallow to predict the outcome to be the same as fossil fuel power plants .
Furthermore , Canada's participation in the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) to perform further research on nuclear power , particularly VHTR (Priority Area: Next Generation Nuclear Energy Technologies (n .d)) , shows that they do not share the public's myopic view on the potential of nuclear power .
In addition , VHTR offers an alternate clean fuel , hydrogen .
At 1100 degree Celsius , hydrogen production efficiency is at 50 percent compared to electrical generation efficiency at 56 percent VHTR (2002) .
There is much radioactive material on earth to run nuclear power for a long time just like how we operate coal power plants .
The difference is that it extends the time needed to find more sources of electricity , probably nuclear fusion .
Opponents may claim that nuclear power plants are incapable of making significant changes to the climate and will even appear as an environmental risk .
Nonetheless , VHTR are almost emission free as nuclear power contributes the biggest portion of the world's electricity from non-greenhouse gas emitting sources (n .d) .
Consequently , the alternate fuel source generated is also emission free .
30 percent of the world primary fuel use is to generate electricity and 17 percent of electricity uses nuclear power (2002) .
In other words , VHTR reduces the general demand for fossil fuels .
Robinson (1987) also mentioned that the amount of electricity generated by one ton of uranium is similar to that produced by 16 ,000 tons of coal or 80 ,000 barrels of oil .
The amount of waste produced by fossil fuel plants is significantly higher than that of VHTR .
that the dominant VHTR has a better plant efficiency which indirectly implies that it requires 20 percent fewer tunnels to store its waste .
Hence , the resultant land pollution caused by VHTR will be milder in contrast with that of coal power
The public opinions on nuclear power are inconclusive .
The advantages of VHTR clearly outweigh the disadvantages of nuclear power .
They directly negate the fears of nuclear proliferation due to its once-through uranium fuel cycle .
Moreover , it offers non-electrical fuel source , hydrogen , which prolongs the time needed to develop another source .
As for the environment aspect , VHTR is ultimately emission free and it causes milder land pollution compared to coal power plants .
Therefore , in my opinion , it is justified to support further research and development funding for VHTR .
Many people consider nuclear power industry is highly dangerous since the radioactive fuels can be very harmful environment and environment .
According to a survey conducted in Australia in 2009 on the public opinions of building nuclear power plants in Australia , there were 43 percsafe the public opposing the plan because of the safety and security issues with nuclear power plants .
(Munro & Strong , 2009) However , nuclear power reactors are much safer and securer than most of people can image even when the reactive temperature is very high .
Firstly , in VHTR , the fuel used is uranium dioxide in a TRISO configuration , where TRISO is the type of fuel that small amount of uranium dioxide is in the center and coated with four layers of three isotropic materials (Olander , 2009) .
The TRISO particles are either dispersed in a pebble for the pebble bed design or molded into opponentsal graphite blocks .
Such designs are able to slow down neutrons to control the nuclear chain reaction , thus the reactivity can be controlled in a reasonable range and explosions can be prevented .
Secondly , because helium is used as coolant of VHTR , unexpected reactions can be prevented .
One reason is that helium is an inert gas , which is hardly reacts with any material .
Additionally , exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive , unlike most other possible coolants , for example light water , therefore it is a safer choice of coolant .
Moreover , since the reactor can only operate under a high temperature , in case of destructions by terrorism or other outside forces , the system will cool down and automatically stop the reaction .
This function ensures VHTR is very safe under attacks .
Therefore , VHTR is a very safe and secure prototype of the generation IV reactor .
water; thereforereaction; thusOther than the safety issue , the efficiency as VHTR is also a concern for those who want to invest in the project .
A Molten salt reactor can burn 99% of initial fuel , while VHTR can burn 65% of its initial fuelopinionionless than that of a molten salt reactor .
However , VHTR is very efficient comparing with the conventional light-water reactor , which can only burn-up 5% of the initial amount (n .f .
2008) .
VHTR is not only able to produce electrical power but also produce hydrog via electroimagine of water at high temperature .
Besides generating energy , the energy generated from nuclear reaction can also be used in crude oil refining or metal production (Ogawa , & VonLensa , 2002 .) .
In this sense , VHTR is efficient in using of energy .
Comparing to a molten salt reactor , VHTR has a simpler design and this leads to another advantage which is its high feasibility .
One more factor that affects the funding of a project is the feasibility of the project in terms of techniques and cost .
VHTR seems to be the most feasible design in the IV generation reactor .
Firstly , similar prototypes such as HTR-10 have already been operated in China and Japan .
VHTR is juscomparedte of High-Temperature Reactor; therefore it is easier to bburn upsystem with the foundation of similar technology .
Secondly , there is no reprocessing in VHTR .
Although some people argue that this causes energy waste and produces radioactive waste , the lack of reprocessing reduces the cost of the power plant and makes it more affordable since the reprocessing is very expensive .
The elimination of reprocessing will notusee any probleComparedis due to the burning of fuel in VHTR is very sufficient thus the amount of waste is very little .
In addition , the radioactive waste can be stored underground .
Lastly , even though the initiation of a nuclear power plant requires about 1 billion US dollars , for the long term profit , this project is practicable .
This is because the need of electricity of humans and the relatively low maintaining fees for VHTR .
Thus , in terms of feasibility , the VHTR is a better choice for further development .
because of the needsufficient; thusefficientbecauseIn conclusion , VHTR should be chosen to proceed on for further research and development .
This is because of its relative high efficiency , high safety and practicability .
There are many researches undergoing in U .S . , China and Japan to improve the Very-High-Temperature Reactors .
Optimistically , by about 2020 , the first commercial VHTR would be in operation .
Generation IV nuclear reactorshave drawn many controversies since they were introduced in the Generation IV International Forum in 2000 .
This raises public concern , due to the previous nuclear accidents which happened at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl , in 1979 and 1986 separately .
(Nuclear Disasters and Accidents) In theory , Generation IV reactors are a set of theoretical reactors which are still being under research to replace Generation III reactors , which are in use for power generation currently .
In comparison with current nuclear plant technology , Generation IV nuclear technology brings us more benefits , according to the researchers .
To point out a few of them , the claimed benefits include minimised nuclear waste and improved safety .
(Generation IV reactor , para .
1) With this , we can reduce nuclear waste as it accumulates when we generate nuclear electricity .
In addition to that , the experts from laboratory also claimed that Generation IV reactors are able to consume nuclear waste to generate more electricity .
However , they are just theories with no solid evidence to support them .
To focus the research on Generation IV technology , we have narrowed down to two reactors , which are lead-cooled fast reactor and sodium cooled fast reactor .
According to the data I have collected , I think sodium-cooled reactor would be a better choice than lead-cooled fast reactor .
Fromsafety perspective , lead-cooled reactor has low likelihood of damage .
(Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor , Advantages and Challenges section) This is due to the characteristic of lead as a good heat transfer medium with high specific heat and thermal expansion coefficient .
Moreover , lead makes the operation reliable as it possesses good fuel compatibility and fission product retention .
This is a vital safety feature together with the ability of lead to retain released fission products that enables us to avoid offsite emergency .
On the other hand , the sodium-cooled reactor  strengthens its safety with long thermal response time and large margin to coolant boiling .
(Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor , para .
1) Sodium-cooled reactor focuses its safety in its primary system and intermediate system which operate near atmospheric pressure .
Given the fact that the two reactors focus on different aspects of safety , where the latter focuses on system operation rather than coolant , it is difficult to gauge the effectiveness of their practice based on theories .
Thus , it is inconsistent to compare when we are talking about the safety issue .
However , lead has a tendency for material corrosion at high temperature .
(Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor , Advantages and Challenges section) Thus , sodium-cooled reactor is a better choice as it has less dependence on the coolant itself .
In terms of performance , lead-cooled reactor has high sustainability .
The mentioned reactor has high sustainability due to its coolant , lead which is a low moderating medium as well as a medium with low absorption cross section that enables a core with fast neutron spectrum even with a large coolant fraction .
(Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor , Advantages and Challenges section) To compare the performance of the two clearly , we will have a look at the burn-up performance .
For sodium fast reactor , it has a tight pin structure , which in turn offers better neutron economy than lead-cooled reactor .
(Tucek K . , & Carlsson J . , & Wider H . , Neutronic and Burn-up Performance section , para .
2) As a result , when both reactors operate to acquire criticality , the average plutonium fraction in the lead-cooled reactor core is slightly higher than sodium-cooled reactor .
This can clearly show the better performer .
After safety and performance issue , production cost of the reactor plays an equally important role in deciding which reactor to put in use .
From the researchers of lead-cooled reactor , we can clearly see the economic side of the reactor .
As  claimed , the life cycle cost of the lead-cooled reactor  is relatively cheaper than any other reactor .
This claim is based on the fact that lead is not reactive with water and air .
As an additional point , lead is inexpensive , in theory .
As a matter of fact , sodium ranked as the sixth most abundant material on earth .
(Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia , 2009) .
If we take in the consideration of the supply and demand theories , lead will be more costly as the demand soars , just like what happened to  crude oil .
In contrast , sodium which is more abundant will experience less effect on its price when the demand soars .
Furthermore , sodium-cooled reactor benefits from the research which was done  earlier .
So there can be a big difference in research cost when compared to lead-cooled reactor .
Moreover , the earliest delivery of the sodium-cooled reactor  is 10 years earlier than the lead-cooled reactor .
(Butler , D .  ,2004) .
Thus , the sodium-cooled reactor is better from economic aspect .
From the evidence I have collected , I have come to the  conclusion that the sodium-cooled reactor  is a better choice than the lead-cooled reactor as it outperforms the latter in three aspects , which are safety , performance and cost .
Have you ever imagined that communication is possible with a virtual character from your television screen ?
Microsoft is now spearing the project Natal , which  involves a controller-free gaming interface , Microsoft Xbox (2009) .
The current game consoles require users to use controllers as their interface to the virtual world .
User's expressions and desires are somewhat restricted by the buttons on the controller .
Thus , the enjoyment factor is somehow limited by the controller .
If project Natal succeeds , gamers will be able to fully indulge in their will and emotions and send this information via the motion detector and video camera into the game console .
This is a concept that is still in research and has yet to be be seen in the market .
A similar product , Wii , is currently in the market .
Although it is less tech-savvy than Natal ,  the safety issues it faces might be quite similar in nature .
Let us evaluate some of the safety issues below .
As playing a game with Natal will seem so real , we could expect more serious injuries occurring compared to injuries resulting from playing Wii .
Some gamers involved in a combat with a virtual opponent might accidentally throw his punches into the television screen , resulting in his fist being trapped within .
This injury is more serious than one arising from playing Wii .
The designers could make it safer by adding a barrier between the screen and the player .
The player could also be demanded by the system to wear safety boxing gloves , and limb guards .
However , some game activists might argue that it results in Natal losing its true entertainment value that it is first set to achieve .
Wearing such cumbersome equipment makes playing games using Natal a turn off .
In addition , it will add a substantial amount of cost to the already expensive-to-manufacture console , as the equipment might have to scan for motion further a distance away due to its exaggerated setup .
As reprted by Oli Welsh (2009) ,  it is "quite expensive to begin with ."
Hence , this idea of improving safety might not be feasible as it is going to be costly and its entertainment value will be affected .
Natal gamers might also suffer similar cases of "Nintendonitis" , muscle injuries owing to excessive playing hours  spent on Sony's Nintendo Wii(Thaindian News , 2009) .
Gamers might have to jump , kick , dance , or perform some repetitive movement during the course of the game .
Injuries as stated above might arise when their muscles gets overused .
Furthermore , the player might be prone to more injuries , such as falling and twisting his ankle , when he starts to feel lethargic .
To enhance safety , Natal could use its motion detection system to analyse whether the movement of the player is alright or he should take a rest , and then send out the respective warning to the player .
This could also help to help gamers who are glued to the game to realise that they have played too much .
It has happened before that gamers die after several hours of continuous gaming .
There are reports showing teenagers' death from  stroke after hours of continuous gaming .
One such example is elaborated in a report by Pravda .R (2009) , where a teenager in the Russian city of Ekaterinburg died after 12 hours of playing computer games .
Thus by using such gizmo , such occurrence of death could be reduced .
We can conclude that Natal is actually a double-edged sword .
It may allow us to have reality in the virtual paradise , increasing our degree of satisfaction when we can fully indulge in the playing of our favourite games , but when we get too carried away , it might cause injuries or death .
Safety can be slightly improved through software tweaking , advising the user to take a rest or stop the activity when he seems unfit by the analysis of the console .
However , large scale setup of barriers and tuxedos lookalike safety suit might not be feasible as they increase the cost significantly and limit its actual functionality .
Therefore the bottom line is safety only can be slightly enhanced by an improved design and itt depends more on the self discipline of the gamers .
Perhaps safety can be enhanced by making it mandatory for gamers to attend a safety course .
Nuclear power is not a new technology to the human race .
It has been around since the 1960s , but it is not the main choice for producing energy because society has rejected it for its low security and high cost .
Although public opposition still exists , with the new generation IV reactors , public support for further research and development of higher security and lower cost plants is increasing .
Some upcoming plants are the lead-cooled fast reactor for example , which produces both electricity and hydrogen as its products .
Opponents of nuclear power claim that the meltdown of the plant is one major reason why it should not exist .
Their concern would be the safety of the public in case of a nuclear meltdown .
This is an issue especially for small countries like Singapore , which stretches about 40 km from east to west , as international safety standards require a 30km buffer zone around the plant (Lee , 2004) .
However , this does not present a very good argument as looking at statistics over the years , the number of people affected by past major nuclear disasters , only number about an estimated 600 ,000 people (Louvat , 2006) .
Compared to an estimate of 1 .2 million deaths yearly due to traffic accidents (World Health Organization , 2007) , the nuclear casualties are relatively minor .
Besides this , with technological advancement , nuclear plants now enforce multiple fail-safe systems coupled with simplistic designs so fewer things could go wrong (Butler , 2004) .
Hence , with a more efficient safety system , there is no need to be afraid of disasters from happening .
Oppositions also claim that there is an ever present threat of terrorism .
For example , terrorists could steal nuclear material out of nuclear plants as easily as in the case when a thief broke into a shipyard in Russia and stole a container of nuclear submarine fuel (Digges , 2002) .
With this nuclear material , terrorists can create what are known as "Dirty" bombs , and threaten the public .
However , this argument disregards the fact that terrorism will be around regardless of whether nuclear plants are built or not .
Even without nuclear materials , terrorists have enough technology and materials to create their own "Dirty" bombs .
Also , this emphasizes the need for a better security system and therefore supports the fact that more funds should be used for this development .
With multiple security features to prevent thefts ,  there is no need to be afraid of radioactive materials being stolen .
Terrorists can only take advantage of our complacency , as in the case of the September 11 attacks .
With a well implemented security system , terrorists have no chance of infiltrating the plant .
The final argument that opponents claim is that the cost to society is very huge .
Building one nuclear plant would cost around US $ 2 .6 billion (Capps , 2005) .
This high cost would be a heavy burden on society and might affect the budgeting for other sectors like the health care system as well .
However , this is a short term view of the situation .
Uranium has more than 10 ,000 times the energy potential than fossil fuels and thus it is cheaper to use uranium for the production of energy (Magnumuranium , n .d .) .
In the long run , the high start up cost is covered by the savings made from the reduced cost of energy .
Many countries that depend on oil are also placing hopes on hydrogen as the new generation fuel for cars and perhaps home use (Butler , 2004) .
With hydrogen produced as the secondary product for the lead-cooled fast reactor , one can only expect energy prices to drop further as there is now an abundance of energy sources .
Hence , we would save more than what we would have initially spent on the building of the nuclear plant over time .
Looking at all the arguments that opponents have made against nuclear power , it can be seen that most are trivial and short termed .
With better technology , one can only expect the research and development to increase in cost .
In the long term view , society will benefit from the research and development of nuclear power .
The advancement in technology will allow nuclear energy to be harnessed with increased safety and efficiently .
Also , more jobs would be created which in turn would aid the country's economy .
Terrorism , safety or high costs are the factors we should base our research on and not be the reasons why we should not further develop nuclear power .
So in my opinion , funds should be injected into further research and development of nuclear power , to create a new generation of cleaner , safer and cheaper power to solve the looming energy crisis .
The world today depends heavily on fossil fuel to generate energy .
However , the burning of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases which contribute to the effect of global warming .
In addition , experts have estimated that the remaining fuel reserve can only last a maximum of another 120 years (McLamb , 2008) .
With energy demand worldwide projected to increase by 44% in 2030 (International , 2009) and the worsening effect of global warming , researchers have proposed the concept of nuclear power .
Despite the benefits promised by Generation IV nuclear reactors , it still requires much effort to convince the public to accept this technology .
This is partly due to the negative memories from the 1986 reactor core explosion at Chernobyl in Ukraine , which resulted in the instant death of 31 people and radioactive debris spewed across Europe (Bulter , 2004) .
Yet , further research and development funding for the Generation IV nuclear prototypes , in particular the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) which is safer and can output greater electricity , should be supported .
Opponents of nuclear energy argued that nuclear power plants increase the health risk of workers and residents living in the vicinity of the reactor .
The long-term effects , they claimed , include potential for increased risk in cancer .
However , a survey conducted by the National Cancer Institute in the United States revealed no strong relationship between nuclear power and the risk of cancer (Excess , 1996) .
While there have been occurrences of leaks and safety incidents , including several in Japan , none of them resulted in severe death tolls (Critical , 2009) .
Similar to the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accident , most nuclear accidents are consequences of human errors .
In modern nuclear reactors , passive safety systems which seek to eliminate the possibility of human errors have been installed .
This is a feature that will activate the safety measures by laws of physics in the event of an emergency , even without the aid of electronics and operators (Life , 2008) .
With VHTR , it should be even safer as helium gas , which will not react with other substances even at high temperature , is used as the coolant .
Hence , safety should not be an issue with modern nuclear technology .
Furthermore , economic viability and stability of nuclear power generation is challenged by the adversary .
They maintained that compared to coal or oil generators , building and operating nuclear facilities are more expensive and worried that the cost might be passed down to consumers eventually .
The construction and operation cost might be high , but this is so in order not to compromise the quality and safety of the plants .
With countries planning to impose carbon taxes on carbon dioxide emissions , producing electricity from coal or oil combustion might not remain cheap forever .
The depletion of oil supply and increasing difficulty in finding new oil reserves will also further increase the cost of electricity generated from coal or oil .
In contrast , nuclear energy might prove to be more reliable as uranium , the raw material for nuclear fuel , can be supplied by politically stable countries like Australia (Critical , 2009) and can last for more than 2500 years when used with more efficient reactors (Nuclear , n .d .) .
Indeed , experts have concluded that the nuclear energy will be competitive enough when the price of oil rises above USS60 per barrel (Limits , 2008) .
Finally , an argument advanced by anti-nuclear advocates is that although nuclear reaction does not produce greenhouse gases , harmful radioactive waste that must be stored for as long as a thousand years are generated instead .
Despite that , proponents argue that with proper storage and appropriate protection measures , the nuclear waste should not pose any health risk to the public .
In addition , most nuclear wastes are only hazardous for a few tens of years .
High-level waste , the most dangerous of all nuclear waste , is secured tightly in glass or ceramic before being isolated in storage facilities .
The structure of the glass and ceramic is so rigid that the dispersion of radioactive waste by terrorist will be difficult (Radioactive , 2009) .
The fact that there is no solution  for disposal of nuclear waste also suggests that there is a need to continue funding further research in nuclear technologies .
In conclusion , it is undeniable that nuclear power is costly .
However , it might be economically viable with the cost of fossil fuel expected to increase .
The safety concerns of nuclear plants are also addressed in the design of new nuclear reactors .
The radioactive wastes produced might not necessarily incur health hazard if they are properly stored .
Therefore , nuclear power is a trustworthy technology whose further research and development funding should be supported .
As technology continues to advance at an ever increasing rate , energy is also being consumed at a rapid pace .
Oil is still the main source of energy that drives the economy despite its ill effects on the environment .
Furthermore , it is projected to be depleted in fifty years' time .
Therefore , the global issue of today has to do with clean and sustainable energy .
The six Generation IV nuclear reactors that are currently being researched under the supervision of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) are the answers to this very problem .
As of now , the Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) and the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) appear very promising and will likely be the main choice of nuclear power plant in the near future .
However , further comparison of both the reactors based on cost , performance and safety actually revealed (LFR) as the better option .
Advocates for the (SFR) often claim that the cost of running the (SFR) is low due to the fact that it uses hybrid loop-pool design that allows for use of a smaller Intermediate Heat Exchanger .
This will reduce the cost of building it (Zhao , 2009) .
1 However , the savings only amount to  about 10-15% of the final cost  of construction .
Instead , (LFR) can ultimately have the lowest cost among all  kinds of reactor because intermediate coolant loop is redundant for it .
Besides that , low refueling cycles of up to 15 years can bring down the total cost of constructing and running the (LFR) (Tucek , 2005) .2 Builders of the nuclear power plant should not just focus on the one-time cost of construction; rather , they should be looking at the long term running cost of the plant .
Therefore , Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor is clearly the better candidate here .
Regarding performance aspect of the reactors , studies often argued that SFR with multiple reheat and inter-cooling can allow the operating temperature to reach  650 degree Celsius while having thermal efficiencies of between 39% and 47% (Peterson , 2008) .3 However , as a result of the higher operating temperature  of (LFR) , it is definitely able to convert electricity more efficiently as compared to the former (Butler , 2004) .4
Furthermore , (LFR) produces hydrogen as part of its processes which (SFR) does not .
If fact hydrogen is also an alternate form of clean and efficient energy .
Ultimately , if we are talking about performance based on the total power output of the plant , (LFR) definitely has an edge over (SFR) , which operates at lower temperature and does not produce hydrogen as part of its process .
Safety plays an important role in deciding whether a reactor will be chosen over of its rival .
(SFR) in this sense has vast amount of operation experience under its belt .
In fact , Sodium as a coolant in a nuclear reactor has actually been around for quite some time .
This is the reason why many believe that (SFR) should be considerably safe and measures must have been in place to prevent any accident .
However , in terms of chemical property , sodium itself is  very reactive and any leakage during an accident will put the plant operators at risk .
Lead on the other hand has a lower burn-up (Tucek , 2005) .
In the event of an accident , the damage to the whole plant will be considerably lesser .
Furthermore , lead's superior neutronic properties and its small coolant temperature reactivity coefficient means that it could be easily controlled when there is an accident (Hejzlar , 2009) .5 For example , in the event of an accident , the natural circulation in (LFR) is enough to take away the nominal power of the system .
However in the case for (SFR) , the lack of natural circulation means that the reactivity of the coolant will increase , leading to a possible meltdown of the reactor (Tucek , 2005) .
In conclusion , based on the three most important considerations of a Generation IV reactor , it is clear that Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor is far  superior to the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor .
Despite the fact that (SFR) is slated to be delivered earliest by the year 2015 , more research needs to be done to proof that (SFR) is indeed better than (LFR) .
However , it would be more logical to channel more resources to the research of (LFR) so that it could be delivered earlier .
In addition , the production of hydrogen as a by-product is indeed very attractive for tomorrow's energy market .
The original lead-bismuth proposed for use in the (LFR) will also be replaced by lead , further decreasing the cost of the coolant by 10 times (Tucek , 2005) .
Therefore , Lead-Cooled Fast reactor is the obvious choice .
Global warming and energy shortage are two of the most discussed topics nowadays .
We are earnestly looking for solutions to these problems , and nuclear energy , has been proposed as a solution to solve these two problems at once .
The production of nuclear energy does not have carbon dioxide as a by-product; thus  it can reduce the effect of global warming , which is the reason for many other problems , like rising of sea levels .
Nuclear energy can also satisfy the increasing demand of energy , thus solving the problem of energy shortage .
However , choosing nuclear energy as an alternative here has many drawbacks in the areas of cleanliness , safety and cost , this can also be reflected in the very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) .
Hence , I do not support the building of new nuclear plants and use of nuclear energy .
Some people argue that nuclear energy should be used as it is a cleaner source of energy compared to coal and fossil fuels .
It is true to some extent as no carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are produced during the production of energy through nuclear power .
Nevertheless , we should not neglect the unique wastes which can be produced by nuclear power plants alone during its energy production process .
This refers to nuclear wastes .
The unique thing about nuclear wastes is that it is radioactive , like naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) , which is not only radioactive itself , but will also produce highly dangerous radioactive radon gas .
(What is nuclear waste , n .d .) It is very hard to recycle or dispose of those wastes due to their unique nature , like the wastes produced by VHTR .
The radioactive wastes will affect the health of man-kind , animals and plants when they are exposed to it .
The consequences are hazardous .
Even if it is buried underground , it will take hundreds of years for its effect to go off due to its long half-life .
The land used by nuclear power plants cannot be used for other purposes after the plants are decommissioned , as excessive radioactivity is present in the area .
There have been suggestions to solve this problem by using helium , which is not radioactive , and abundant helium can be found on the moon .
However , there are a few things we should address: the practicality  of mining on the moon and the cost of mining on the moon .
There is no doubt that it is extremely expensive to fly to the moon and do the mining there .
At the same time , the technology to dig on the moon , and even use helium as a fuel is still not available yet .
Thus , nuclear energy is not a good alternative .
There are also some other people who argue that nuclear energy is safer .
However , looking at the incident of partial reactor meltdown in 1979 , which took place at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , and the notorious nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986(Butler ,2004) , people may rethink  the statements they have made .
The result of Chernobyl accident is disastrous as the radioactive debris spread across Europe and affected many people in different countries .
Some infected people later developed all kinds of diseases , and some new born children are deformed as well .
Generally , they die at a very young age .
Nuclear power plants also pose safety problems as they are always targeted by terrorists .
( Carl B . and Mark H .  ,2005) .
Some people argue that the deaths per year in nuclear plants are much fewer than that in coal mines .
Nevertheless , once a main accident in nuclear plants occurs , the impact will be enormous , long term and wide spread  , while the impact of a coal mine accident is immediate , which takes place in limited areas only .
Hence , nuclear energy should not be accepted .
One more argument for nuclear energy is that it is cheap .
However , the nuclear power plants are all operating at low temperatures now , rendering them inefficient , due to limitations of technologies .
The cost advantage of nuclear energy is not so obvious here .
However , if we take into account  the set up cost of the nuclear plants , which are more high-tech than coal plants , they are definitely much more expensive .
The equally expensive maintenance cost covered will in the end together contribute to the average cost of producing nuclear energy , which is now much higher than that of coal and other sources .
Optimists say that the cost will be greatly reduced when generation IV reactors are developed as they will work with much higher efficiency .
Nevertheless , the technology required is not readily attainable and it will take a long time to be realised .
Thus , nuclear energy should not be accepted .
In conclusion , nuclear energy may have some seeming advantages; however , the problems associated with it are not negligible , specifically the high cost , radioactive wastes and the safety concerns .
Therefore , nuclear energy may not be a desirable  alternative .
We should put more of our focus on better energy sources like solar power .
Many accidents happened over the past decades , some related to design flaws while others to human errors .
Reasons for human errors range from emotional wellbeing , to the inability in handling the pre-accident situation (Charles , 1999) .
These accidents may have been prevented should psychology be encompassed into the design process .
The Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 illustrates this notion .
On the 25th of April 1986 , reactor 4 was scheduled for a shut down , and an experiment was planned to test a safety feature during this process .
delayed the test past midnight resulting in it being conducted by a less proficient night team .
Before the test , an unexpected drop in power resulted in operators retracting control rods in an attempt to restore power .
The reactor however , appeared stable after the retraction although it displayed abnormal readings .
The operators ignored this abnormality and proceeded with the test .
Subsequently two explosions occurred resulting in massive losses (CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT , 2009) .
Supporters related the accident to a lack of understanding in human psychology during the design phase (Reason , 1988) .
The test was approved only by the director of the plant , without the coordination of the reactor's chief designer or scientific manager (Nuclear Energy , 2009) .
Opponents claimed that approval was appropriate as the reactor was muffled at the start of the experiment and should not have devastating effects on its safety (Reason , 1988) .
Proponents however , argued that the plant director had insufficient specialised knowledge .
The use of psychology would enable designers to acknowledge that operators may encounter faults beyond their abilities and thus gear the design towards user friendliness .
Moreover , a psychologist should be able to relate a high competency requirement to the test and thus limit its handling to upper management .
In this manner , there is a high chance that the accident would not have occurred since the most qualified personnel would have been managing the test .
In addition , these reactors require highly skilled professionals (Reason , 1988) .
Opponents were firm that should the test be conducted by the more proficient day team , the accident was unlikely to occur (CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT , 2009) .
On the contrary , proponents refute this , stating that psychology encompasses the understanding of human reaction during panic stages (Wilpert , 2007) .
The design of the reactor could thus include simple idiot-proof automated safety mechanisms without relying on operators' competency .
This way , the operators would not have retracted the control rods during the pre test stage since the system would have been automated .
Therefore , the accident may not have occurred .
Opponents countered the use of psychology as they felt it stifles creativity in the design process (Wilpert , 2007) .
They believed that feedback may end up counterproductive and deter engineers from verbalizing their creations in fear of evaluation .
Moreover , they stood firm that the psychologist' lack of relevant knowledge may divert the focus of engineers and lead them away from designing a relevant product .
Proponents agreed to the possibility of limiting creativity should psychology be used in the entire design process .
As such , they suggest the intermittent intervention of psychology or simply the introduction of psychology only after the main design outline is formed (Wilpert , 2007) .
This way , the main focus of the product would not be altered and the critical design phases could be assessed through the use of simulation or operators .
This would possibly uproot errors during the entire design sequence thereby preventing the Chernobyl accident .
A Germany's Inter-City Express (ICE) train derailed and slammed into an overpass , killed 101 people and injured 200 people in June of 1998 , (Castellano , 2007) .
The causes of the accident were traced back to a damaged wheel that disintegrated just before the train passed over a switch track .
Upon further investigation , people discovered the evidence of poor wheel design , poor bridge construction , insufficient failure detection system , ineffective emergency procedures and insufficient design verification testing .
As a result , safety improvements and major engineering changes were implemented in order to prevent such disaster from happening again , which include the studies of psychology in design process .
Hence , the use of psychology in design process could have prevented the accident .
First of all , the use of psychology in the design process could have prevented the accident by revealing the need of adding several failure detection systems on the train .
According to the research that has been done by the German national railway company , Deutsche Bahn (1998) , the ICE train did not have a system installed to detect wheel failure and bring the train to an emergency stop .
According to Wilpert (2007) ,  inherent safety which links the design process to safety concerns must be taken into account .
However , in this situation , the engineers did not identify the inherently safer options (as cited in Wilpert , 2007) which led to a lack of failure detection systems that were installed in the train .
One example that highlighted this situation is the bullet trains from Japan .
The Japanese bullet trains are equipped with a detection system that can alert the train operator about wheel deformation and failure during the operation so that the operator may manually activate the emergency brake .
If the train had been installed with this system , the accident might not have happened .
Secondly , the use of psychology in the design process could have prevented the accident through activating the emergency brake despite the company's policy that did not allow the train manager to do so .
During the journey on the train , a large piece of metal came up through the floor and was witnessed by a passenger .
The passenger tried to warn the crew but was refused by the train manager due to the reason that he needed to investigate the problem  himself first .
As a result , valuable time was lost and the accident happened .
In this situation , the problem of psychopathology of design was revealed .
According to Wilpert (2007) ,  the designer 's and the user's conceptual model of a system or a device must be matched in order to reduce the problems that might occur during the time of using it , in this case , the train .
If the company policy was made with reference to a common sense that was agreed by everyone , such as , the train services in Singapore and the United Kingdom that made the control of emergency brakes available to the travelling passengers , the chain of failure would have been broken .
It is unlikely that the subsequent events could have occurred had the train been stopped immediately .
The third and most important thing to use psychology in the design process in this accident is that , it could have revealed the poor design of the wheel that caused the accident .
The ICE trains were equipped with single-cast wheels; after the accident , the engineers realized that the design of the wheels could make the metal to fatigue and cause out-of-round conditions that vibrate at cruising speeds .
According to Norman (as cited in Wilpert , 2007) , the appropriate system image must be ensured by the designer and this is one of the problems of psychopathology of design .
According to the research by Deutsche Bahn (1988) , the design of the wheels that were used did not reveal the actual durability and reliability of the wheels .
Hacker (as cited in Wilpert , 2007) points out that the quality of co-operative performance depends on the nature of the task at hand .
He says that a design task cannot be solved individually since each person has his own limitation in knowledge .
In this situation , if there were more designers involved in the design of the wheels , the poor design of the wheels could have been spotted and the accident would not have happened .
To sum up , with the use of psychology in the design process , the problems such as lack of failure detection systems that were installed in the train , company's policy that did not allow the train manager to stop the train , and the poor design of the train wheels would not have occurred .
To conclude , the train accident that happened  in Germany could have been prevented with the use of psychology in the design process .
A major accident does not usually happen with merely one error and the accumulation of all the errors will be catastrophic .
For instance the Nicoll Highway incident which occurred on Tuesday 20 April 2004 is the result of this which in turn caused four deaths .
The collapse was due to the retaining wall not being able  to handle the stress of supporting the tunnel and it gave way (Andrew , 2005) .
Hence , the opposing party argues that this failure is largely due to the technical aspect rather than the human errors .
Nevertheless , there are substantial points to suggest that psychology  can prevent the accident from happening if it has been implemented in the design stage .
As stated , the opponents claim that the collapse was due to the design of the structure .
The design of the structure itself was not well-built and the use of the weaker materials further exacerbated the failure (IES , 2005) .
Moreover , the opponents insist that the design was in fact approved by the Land Transportation Authority (LTA) .
Though the design was approved , the blueprint was in fact designed by engineers .
According to Wilpert .B (2007) , engineers do make design mistakes and this is known as an erroneous individual action .
The Nicolle Highway incident clearly illustrates this action when the contractor's engineers of Nishimatsu-Lum Chang (NLC) use the inappropriate soil simulation model for the design calculations (Andrew , 2005) .
As a result , the structure failed the safety criteria .
In addition , the use of the weak materials is due to the wrong mindset of the NLC wanting to earn more profits by cutting input materials cost , which is seriously a wrong attitude and perception .
Besides , the problem of psychopathology of design also arises when the NLC's engineers overestimated the basic technical ability of the LTA's personnel (Wilpert .B , 2007) .
Therefore , the lack in engineering knowledge of the LTA's personnel resulted in the approval of the blueprint which in turn resulted in the collapse .
Nonetheless , the supporters still argue another fact about the structure being used merely for a short period of time .
Thus there is no strict law imposed by the government about how a temporary structure should be built .
Furthermore , the supporters insist that the higher management within LTA and NLC had stringent control of the design phase despite the fact that the structure was used temporarily .
The wrong attitude about temporary structure causes them to let down their guard and become ignorant of the risk that the weak structure might pose .
Besides that , the NLC's design engineers ignored its failed risk assessment and continued to proceed with the blueprint without revealing the actual data to LTA (IES , 2005) .
This behavior is considered dishonest and immoral .
This is because NLC would want to complete their job within schedule  to avoid paying penalties to LTA (IES , 2005) .
Thus the over-eagerness and the time pressure exerted on them often lead to short-cuts and worsened the failure further (Wilpert .B , 2007) .
Lastly , the opposing party argues that all workers involved in this project had a strong sense of safety culture since it is compulsory to attend the Construction Safety Orientation Course (CSOC) before commencement of any construction work (MOM .Compulsory , 2007) .
Therefore the opponents emphasize that the failure was not due to the inadequate knowledge about the safety aspect but the failure of the technical aspect .
Although they had attended the CSOC , there were dysfunctional relations within the organization (Wilpert .B , 2007) .
The incapable the project management team failed to address the warning signs present in the early stage and implement corrective measures .
Thus , the failure was further aggravated .
Hence , the negligence and breaching of the project management team statutory duties indeed caused the collapse (MOM .Committe , 2007) .
In conclusion , one would realize the collapse of the Nicoll Highway is mainly due to human errors rather than the technical aspects .
Nevertheless , one would also recognize that failure of the technical aspect is due to the presence of human errors .
which is important in all human endeavors .
Thus , having certain knowledge about it will definitely aid in the understanding of human behavior and the reasons  why human makes mistakes .
As a result , it is vital to implement psychology in the design stage so to prevent the occurrence of any catastrophic accident .
The most serious concern raisedthe energy shortage problemlity of accidents .
In the event of leakage , numerous people are probably left dead , much more affected in a long lasting period ever since .
People can still recall "oone of the most 1979 , the Three Mile Issourcesuclear power plant experienced a partial meltdown .
Cleanup of the accident required $1 billion and longer than 10 years to complete ," as depicted by findingDulcinea Staff(2009) .
A community of misfortunes have happened , mainly resulted from a failure in control of pressure and temperature .
Chance for SFR to get out of control is relatively smaller because SFR "operates near atmospheric pressure , and intermediate sodium system between the radioactive sodium in the primary system and the power conversion system" as revealed by Generation IV International Forum .
In contrast , the other five designs of reactors , which are Gas-cooled fast reactors , Lead-cooled fast reactors , Molten salt reactors , Supercritical-water-cooled reactors , and Very-high-temperature reactors , operate either at high temperature or under high pressure or even both .
Besides , double-wall piping and high reliable SG with double-wall tube are designed for prevention of likely sodium chemical reactions .
All these back-up system going wrong , SFR still can pull through safely as passive reactor shutdown system and decay heat removal by natural circulation are still in their position as a line of defence .
the passive reactor shutdown systemgosystemsIf all thesePeople may also tremble at the long-lived radioactive waste .
The waste , if not handled carefully , may pollute the will probably be left ter and remain there for long .
Moreover , conventionhenceforthssing recovers plutonium and uranium from waste , as worried in Plutonium Wars(2004) .
The proliferation , an essential step of reprocessing , does generate weapon-grade plutonium .
However , the anxiety can be repoted in findingDulcinea Staff (2009) .
n attributes .
Generation IV International Forum reresultinghat "the envisaged SFR capability to efficiently and nearly completely consume trans-uranium as fuel would reduce the actinide loadings in the high-level radioactive waste it produces .
Such reductions would bring benefits in the radioactive waste disposal requirements associated with the system and enhance its non-proliferation attributes ."
The research on waste disposal and reprocessing are still going on for the envisaged SFR to realize .
The final statement made by opponents is the high construction cost of SFR .
I agree that it is a major challenge for SFR .
However , it can be offset by a more efficient utilization of fuel resources .
Generation IV Intisational Forum remarkedl cycle empWars (2004) .
actinide recycle with three major options .
The options range from a large size(600 to 1 ,500 Mwe) to a small one(50 to 150 MWe) .
The fuel cycles employed also differ in the reactors of the three scales .
Customers can choose to bear different costs to their own needs .
This reduces their potential cost in the construction of a reactor which is larger that they need .
The SFR's fast spectrum also makes it possible to use available fissile and fertile materials (including depleted uranium) considerably more efficiently than thermal spectrum reactors with once-through fuel cycles , as told by Generation IV International Forum .
Such reduction in fuel to be realized the problem noted by MIT(2003) that "economically , new nuclear plants would not be able to compete with coal and gas ."
Apart from benefit from considerable technological experience , SFR , also offer the potential to operate with a high conversion fast spectrum core , with the resulting benefit of increasing the utilization of fuel resources as Generation IV International Forum highlighted .
offersSFR alsoMIT (2003)solvesreportedthanaccording toIt should objection raisedt none of the opposing statement is valid for SFR .
SFR operates at low temperature and low pressure and has multiple systems to back up safety .
The radioactive waste can also be sustainably used in the fuel cycle with reduction of environmental burden .
High construction is offset not only by multiple construction options , butsize (600 efficient utilization of one (50 esources .
More importantly , research is carrying on for SFR , the most promising generation IV reactor .
The Chernobyl disaster  was a major engineering accident that occurred in the year 1986 .
The causes of the accident were classified to be design flaws of the nuclear reactor system as well as violation of safety regulations by the operators before the accident .
Some people believe that the use of psychology during the design process might have corrected all the flaws of the system , thus preventing the tragedy while others argue that this incident occurred due to severe breaches of safety regulations by the operators .
Therefore psychology plays no role in preventing this accident as the causes were due to human errors .
In my opinion , I trust that the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident .
The use of psychology would rectify the design flaws and safety mechanism implemented to counter human errors .
Opponents  might argue that human errors occur on a random basis; therefore they could not be prevented .
It was this violation of safety rules by the operators prior to the accident that caused the explosion; thus  psychology during the design process would not contribute anything beneficial to the operations .
An experiment was conducted before the nuclear reactor was due for maintenance .
Before the test , the emergency core cooling system was shut down .
The first human error committed was to continue with the test .
The power of the reactor continued to drop below the lower limit for the experiment .
Control rods which act as absorbers were withdrawn from the core to increase the power of the reactor .
This was human error two .
All the circulating pumps were connected to the reactor that had its control rods withdrawn .
This caused an unstable thermo-hydraulic status .
The experiment started in these undesirable conditions .
Power began to rise and the absorbers were sent back to the core to control the reaction; however  they were unable to plunge fully into the lower stop due to mechanical fault .
The decision to cut off current that holds the absorbers to ensure the falling of rods caused the explosions .
It was through this series of human errors committed prior to the moment that caused this incident .
The impact of human errors could be minimized if appropriate safety mechanisms were installed on the system .
Psychologists could brainstorm for possible human errors that could be committed by the operators and recommend counter measures .
One possible counter measure against human errors could be to configure the system in such a way that whenever safety has been compromised , the system will be automatically shut down .
The use of psychology will bridge the gap between designers and operators as the system will not be overly complicated for the operators to work on .
All operation knowledge and training should be properly imparted by the engineers to the operators so as to guarantee system operation efficiency and safety .
All these measures taken will reduce the human errors to an insignificant level; thus those mistakes committed might not cause such a huge impact and Chernobyl accident might not have occurred .
A report published by IAEA Nuclear Safety Advisory Group stated that the actual causes were due to design errors .
The reactor constructed for the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant was the second generation nuclear reactor which was almost identical to the first generation .
Engineers failed to rectify the design errors found in the first generation; thus  all shortcomings were modeled into the second generation reactor .
The reasons that engineers failed to challenge the errors could be their large working group .
Studies have shown that considerable productivity loss is found when people of different background work together .
Factors affecting a group include evaluation apprehension , free riding and blocking .
The result of all the problems faced by the design engineers was a nuclear reactor which carries several design flaws .
The water channels run through the core vertically where a temperature gradient will be built up .
This causes the reaction within the core to increase greatly .
The control rods end tips were made of graphite which is a more potent neutron moderator and greatly increases the rate of fission reaction when the rods are initially inserted into the reactor .
This defeats the purpose of the control rods .
The use of psychology from the start of design process would rectify all the faults found .
Psychologists are able to give a more objective view on the integrity of the project .
Psychologists , being the middleman , will connect all the engineers together to design the new reactor .
Therefore all the features that compromise safety would be eliminated during the design process .
Therefore the use of psychology during design process would reduce design errors in the new reactor created .
Human errors are unavoidable .
Psychologists must be present to give their safety judgments to incorporate additional counter measures against possible human errors .
The use of psychology could also remove all the design flaws and add in a desirable mechanism to the system , thus creating a more efficient reactor for both the engineers and operators .
Therefore the use of psychology during the design process could have possibly prevented the Chernobyl incident .
Almost every day when we read the newspaper , articles about energy saving or increasing oil price will jump into our sight .
Actually , global warming and energy crisis have been  extremely popular topics these years and large proportion of the governments'  revenue has been spent on the research and development of new energy resources , such as solar energy and tidal power .
Among these new energy resources , nuclear power is highly favored by researchers due to its abundant base materials , low quantities of waste and comparatively cheap fuel costs .
CITATION Why06 \l 2052 (Why use Nuclear Power ? , 2006) Such a situation indicates that the new dawn of the nuclear power is at the corner although it means that the public have to struggle to restore their confidence ruined by the past appalling accidents of nuclear power plants .
Safety is always the thing that matters most .
After the Chernobyl disaster in Soviet Union , many people started to reject the proposal of wide usage of nuclear power .
But actually , no energy sources can be said to be free of risk .
Coal and oil have brought us problems like global warming and acidic rain; hydro projects have deteriorated the environment of  flooded and downstream areas and can lead to great economical loss and mortality once dams collapse; the mirrors and panels used for solar energy production can affect the environment too .
CITATION Com09 \l 2052 (Comparisons of various energy sources  , 2009) Hence , what we should concentrate on now is how to make the nuclear power production safer instead of arguing whether to reject it or not .
The good news is that the basic technology for VHTR has been well established and has been tested by many nuclear plants vendors and national laboratories .
Furthermore , the VHTR concept requires "the lowest risk technology development" to "achieve the needed commercial functional requirements" CITATION Ver09 \l 2052 (Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR)) among the six Generation IV reactors .
Therefore , safety is highly guaranteed in the development and application of VHTR .
Besides safety , people are concerned much about the work efficiency .
Nobody wants to spend so much of their resources to develop something operating poorly .
In fact , "the VHTR system is designed to be a high-efficiency system and that can supply process heat to a broad spectrum of high-temperature and energy-intensive , non-electric processes ."
CITATION Ver09 \l 2052 (Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR)) The pebble-bed and prismatic design of VHTR makes no intermediate refueling necessary .
And due to high temperature , the reactor generates electricity and hydrogen simultaneously , superior to the sodium-cooled fast reactors and critical-water-cooled reactors which can only generate electricity .
In addition , the high temperature exchanger and electrical heater of a VHTR system prevent significant efficiency loss .
Therefore , the VTHR system can meet our efficiency requirements undoubtedly .
Last but not  least , every technological innovation should be feasible not only technically but also economically .
As far as we know , the ultra-long life VHTR systems can be developed with minor actinides .
Minor actinides used can incinerate burnable poisons or fuel materials to obtain high levels of burn-up , which could "facilitate development of new fuel cycles and support sustainability of a fuel source for nuclear energy" .
CITATION Pav09 \l 2052 (Tsvetkov) So the cost of maintenance and fuels for VHTR can be highly reduced compared to other Generation IV reactors .
Besides , the earliest delivery time for VHTR is 2020 , earlier than that of other Generation IV reactors except Sodium-cooled fast reactors .
The earlier delivery means the earlier alleviation of these impending problems and more payback .
Hence , the VHTR systems are highly practical economically .
In conclusion , to solve the global warming and energy shortage problems , we need the exploration and better utilization of nuclear energy .
And among the six proposed new generation nuclear reactors , the VHTR systems are the best in consideration of various factors .
The strong technological backup provides adequate safety; the specific innovational design of the system ensures high work efficiency; the ultra long lifetime and early delivery brings comparatively lower cost .
Therefore , VHTR is the one which deserves further research and development funding most .
On the 6th of March 1987 the freight ferry 'Herald of Free Enterprise' capsized just ouside the port of Zeebrugge .
The accident took the lives of 150 passengers and 38 crewmembers  .
(Pijnenburg &Duin ,1990) .
Could this accident have been prevented or to be specific could the use of psychology during the design process prevent this accident from happening ?
Major accidents besides Zeebrugge such as the 'Three Mile Island' incident and the 'Chernobyl 'disaster are said to be caused by human error .
Statistics show that close to 90% of all accidents is caused by human error .
(BI-ME staff ,2009) The major companies have given the excuse of cost and time as the reason why they have not considered implementing psychology during the design process .
Although these major companies have not shown a high enough level of interest to invest in the use of engineering psychology , I believe that engineering psychology can help improve on the safety of operation in their industry and eventually reduce accidents .
I will look into the 'Zeebrugge' incident in detail to prove that it could have been prevented if psychology were used during the design process .
In the case of the 'Zeebrugge' incident , there were many things wrong with the design of the ferry .
For instance the ferry's design is a huge hull for which its purpose is to load and unload cars at a very fast pace .
Although it might seem a good idea at first  having a huge hull means that the boat can easily turn over when there is water on deck (Noyes  & Stanton ,1997) .
This matter has been brought into attention to the Board of Directors but they were not willing to waste money to have the engineers sketch up a new design .
Another design flaw is there were no light indicators to give notice of the status  of the bow doors .
Once again  ,the idea was rejected because of cost issues .
Considering that one of the reasons that the accident happened is because the bow doors were still open when the ferry left the port  ,it makes us wonder whether the accident could really have been prevented if proper precautions were taken .
During the design process , it is important to ensure that the product design is safe and user friendly (Wilpert ,2007) .
When designing a product or even a system , engineers must make sure that there are safety measures or considerations taken in the design .
Another cause of the ferry capsizing is the lack of communication within the organization .
Critics claim that it is important to establish a professional relationship between the workers and make sure the workers do not step over their scope of work .
This way of thinking however is inexcusable as when working in an engineering industry , most departments rely on each other .
When water started to flood in the 'Herald Of Free Enterprise' , one deck hand noticed it but did not report the matter because he thought that others may have noticed and it was not his job .
If there were proper interaction between the workers the 'Zeebrugge' incident could have a different ending .
Apart from that there is also the matter of the management's role into the 'Zeebrugge' incident .
The management is said to be pushing their workers to work double shift just for their own profits .
Critics mentioned that the welfare of the workers is not important .
As long as they are being paid for their extra work , it is fine .
That way of management is very harsh as the workers' safety and their health are very important .
Looking in the 'Zeebrugge' incident , the worker who was supposed to make sure the bow doors were closed , was asleep .
Because the higher-ups forced the workers into exhaustion an engineering accident happened .
The workers' psychological state and physiological state must be good in order for him to perform his job .
When the workers' mind is in the right place , then he will be happy and content when working (Carpentier & Cazamian ,1977) .
This will undoubtedly reduce human error .
It is without question that the 'Herald of Free Enterprise' would not have capsized if psychological approach is taken during the design process .
Not only the incident at 'Zeebrugge' , but many other major  from this approach in design .
The fundamental issues when designing is that it should match its expectations and also be safe to operate (Wilpert ,2007) .
Although it is impossible to totally remove human error from operations , the  next best thing we can do is to reduce it and by using psychology such a goal can be achieved .
In the past few decades , nuclear energy has been considered as a futuristic and exotic technology which requires much research and experimentation in order to develop these farfetched ideas .
Nowadays , reactors in operation around the world are generally considered second or third generation systems , with the first-generation systems out-dated some time ago .
Our next step will be to innovate generation IV reactors which are cheaper , safer and cleaner compared with the current nuclear reactors .
This mission is put under the responsibility of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) where ten nations will come together to research and plan the nuclear reactors of tomorrow .
Among the six generation IV reactors concepts , the Very High Temperature Reactor concept deserves further research and development funding for it .
As an introduction , the Very High Temperature Reactor concept uses either a prismatic-block or pebble bed reactor design graphite-moderated core with uranium fuel cycle to generate electricity and produce hydrogen through a thermochemical process .
This high temperature reactor uses inert helium to keep the reactor cool and can be considered as passively safe .
Experiments have been carried out by Japan's Atomic Energy Research Institute based in Kashiwa to test its feasibility by operating a similar high-temperature engineering test reactor at Oarai , Tokyo .
Its first test run had a quite satisfactory result by achieving its goal of 9500C without having any sign of partial reactor meltdown .
Hence , this reactor is practical and has a high potential to be the next generation nuclear reactor .
Generally , nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that does not pollute our environment with tremendous amounts of toxic gases such as nitrogen oxides , sulfur oxides and carbon dioxide .
Compared with fuel oil and coal combustion , nuclear power not only meets the increased global energy demands in the future but also avoids global warming issues .
In Taipei , Taiwan , the government would rather  extend its oldest nuclear plant's life and is willing to take the risk of public safety just to cut down the greenhouse effects .
However , we cannot deny the fact that nuclear energy will produce radioactive wastes that raise the concern of the public .
In fact , nuclear power plant will only emit a very small percentage of radioactive wastes to the air during its operation and the possibility of nuclear wastes leakage is very low .
This safety issues arises because of the huge information gap besides the lack of communication and understanding between the experts and the public about the safety measures taken during the operation of nuclear power plant .
In terms of performance , the Very High Temperature Reactor  is able  to generate 50% more electricity compared with other conventional plants such as Pressurized Water Reactor .
This is because this reactor is designed to run at temperature 10000C which is the highest temperature used among the generation IV reactors to generate electricity  using the same amount of fuel .
Basically , high temperature operations are more efficient to convert heat energy to electrical energy and can avoid wasting of energy in other forms .
This reactor does not have a waste recycling process  and instead , the waste goes directly to the repository .
Although reprocessing can decrease the quantity of waste produced , the generation of weapons-grade plutonium is still not a beneficial product to human kind .
We should cut down the amount of plutonium present and not increase its quantity for further development .
There is no doubt that up-front cost of nuclear power plant building is relatively expensive compared to those associated with fossil fuels .
In fact , there are many ways to mitigate these costs .
The Very High Temperature Reactor is considerably cheap compared to other reactors .
It does not run the conventional reprocessing which is rather expensive and it is among the earliest delivery of generation IV reactor .
Hence , this reactor does not need a very long research period and cuts down the unnecessary development funding .
In conclusion , nuclear energy brings many advantages to our society .
It not only decreases the world's dependency on fuel oils to generate electricity , but also acts as an environment protector .
Although there are a few drawbacks of nuclear power , we can reduce these negative effects by using the latest technology in newer reactors and placing emphasis on public safety .
As long as we use it wisely and efficiently , I believe that nuclear power greatly surpasses other type of energies .
The chief issue that the public have against nuclear reactors is of course it's safety .
Past events such as the incident in Chernobyl serve as a grim retheirder of the dangers that comes with a nuclear reactor .
On top of that , VHTR require a relatively high areerating temperature and pressure for optimum function .
To ensure that VHTR does not suffer the same fate as reactor 4 inA nuclear plant ew materials such as nickel super-alloys and chromium steel are being looked at as potential candidates for reaction vessels as these materials are capable of withstanding the extreme conditions of VHTR .
The reaction itself , unlike other generation IV plants , is moderated by uranium oxycarbide coated graphite , a naturally safe choice , capable of retaining radioactive waste .
BesideHowever , helium , the coolant of choice in VHTR is chemically inert .
So , it is not affpromise radiation , unlike other coolants such as water .
The public tend to moan about the higwithmical cost necessary in buildintheird maintaining a nuclear plant .
In fact , each of the generation IV reactors will require a staggeringcomellion USD in construction cost alone .
Apart from that , there is also the research cost as well which requires consideration as it also contributes to the overall cost of the plants .
But then again , people tend to overlook the benefits that these reactors yield as future investments .
For one , constant research and testing ensures that the safety of these reactors are not compromised .
Despite the relatively high volume of researchunlike that in other generation IV plantsother nuclear reactors , the fact that researchers are able to reassure its delivery by the year 2020 , five years earlier than most ofhelium , the coolant of choice in VHTR ,search work on VHTR is much simpler compared to the other reactors , costing less .
to that on the other reactorsThe performance of generation III nucleeconomics have also raised concerns .
In a generation III nuclear plant , only 5% of uranium input is actually converted into electricity while the rest of it turns into nuclear waste .
Compared to other means of generating energy , users will have to pay more for the same amount of electricity generated via nuclear means .
On the other hand , VHTR is said to be able to convert up to 65% of uranium into energy .
That means only less than half of the uranium input will now go to waste .
In addition , due to the his temperature and pressure involved in VHTR , conversion rate is improved and this produces hydrogen gas as well which can be used to fuel green cars of the futuensure
Among the six proposed generation IV nuclear power hasts , VHTR is by far the most promising choice .
Firstly , due to the research already being done on known materials to serve as reaction vessels , safety is no longer an issue as they are capable of withstanding the operating conditions of VHTR .
The cost of building each generation IV nuclear reactor is about the same .
However , the cost of research on VHTR is less than most of the other candidates .
Plus , generation IV nuclear reactors are much more efficient than those of generation III because of the higher energy conversion rate that they have to offer .
At the same time , VHTR also produces useful hydrogen gases as by-products .
In conclusion , unless the world decides to live completely in the dark , a new method of generating electricity needs to replace the constantly depleting fossil fuels that we current rely so heavily on as an energy source .
The best alternative approach on the table at this point in time is nuclear energy .
Despite the current economic downturn , it is only a matter of time before the energy crisis is resolved .
Necessity and the sense of urgency will alMoreover be the best motivator .
currentlyfastAnnex
In a time where energy sources are depleting rapidly , a call for new alternate energy has been made by several countries and a large amount of effort and money has been poured into this new cause .
Nuclear power energy has been claimed by many as the most desired new energy source for the new age (Butler , 2004) .
However , in my opinion , other alternate energy sources like solar and hydro energy have more potential to be the new dawn for energy as they have far more advantages than nuclear energy and with lesser risk involved .
Firstly , there have been reports that the use of nuclear energy is much safer as there are much fewer accidents happening in nuclear plants compared to the number of accidents that that happened in conventional fuel-burning energy plant .
Indeed , there might be a decrease in the number of accidents in nuclear plants , in contrast to the thousands of death that happened in conventional energy plants .
However , in the event of a nuclear accident there are usually hundreds of thousands who will be affected (Wald , 2000) .
The sheer number of people affected in one nuclear accident is far more than the number of accidental deaths happened in conventional energy plants over the years .
Furthermore , the adverse effect of the radiation that remains behind after a nuclear accident will cause devastating effects on the environment and the human population in the area .
These effects can range from immediate death to nausea , vomiting , and radiation  burns .
Moreover , these are just the immediate effects on human health; some indirect effects include death in ten days , leukemia , cancers , genetic damage to offspring and even premature ageing depending on the amount of radiation received (Amory , 2009) .
A major concern in the use of nuclear energy is the issue of safety .
Many researchers like Butler assert that the energy produced by nuclear power plants is safe and it can generate a large amount of energy which will solve the pressing problem of depleting fuel sources .
One of the generation IV reactor concepts is the 'very high temperature reactor' with operating conditions such as high pressure and temperature Celsius (Butler , 2004) .
These operating conditions can severely injure any worker on-site if there are any leakages .
Another major issue with the nuclear plant will be the security aspect of the use of nuclear power .
It is a well-known fact that the by-product of the nuclear plant , mainly the nuclear waste has been used for developing nuclear weapons (Wald , 2000) .
The development of nuclear weapons has been condemned by several countries and organizations like the U .N (United Nations) .
Although some might claim that  ,  it is almost impossible to guard against such cases (Butler , 2004) .
Moreover , the ever increasing risk of terrorism will result in a much threatening situation if the nuclear weapon is  stolen .
The amount of damage that will occur is unimaginable  if the terrorists are able to get their hand on a nuclear power plant .
Lastly , the impending cost factor of researching and building a generation IV reactor is regarded as insignificant compared to the amount of money that can be generated when nuclear energy replaces current energy sources (Butler , 2009) .
In fact , this is not true at all .
The amount of money that is required to build these is usually an astronomical amount (James , 2002) , not to mention  there are many underlying costs such as the nuclear plant maintenance cost , the land required to build a reactor and the waste management system .
The maintenance cost that is required for each nuclear reactor is much higher than for a conventional energy plant as the safety measures for these plants are much more detailed since it is handling highly reactive substances .
After a certain amount of usage or a period of time , a nuclear reactor will have to be decommissioned and the cost incurred is not  just large sum of money , but  land spaces are needed as well .
All these costs incurred by the nuclear reactor are much more hurting to the economy rather than easing the financial pressure for countries .
In conclusion , all the following aspects such as the security , safety and costs component for a nuclear reactor indicate far more disadvantages and risks compared to the advantages that the nuclear reactor  brings about .
Thus , in my view , there are much better technology and sources than nuclear power around , so there should be more emphasis and support for other technologies .
It is beyond doubt that the Earth has been recently getting warmer .
The most devastating effects of global warming was the South-Eastern Australian heat wave which brought temperatures soaring above 43 degrees Celsius according to the  (2009) .
One of the main contributors of global warming is the burning of coal and gas to produce energy .
In the year 2007 , it was proven that the coal-generated power plants were the largest source of global warming (Environment News Service , 2008) .
However , we can reduce global warming by using the Generation IV (Gen IV) reactor concept nuclear plants .
One such reactor is the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) which can produce large volumes of energy cleanly , reliably , safely and affordably .
This would therefore provide future price stability and have environmental attributes .
These characteristics demonstrate why the VHTR is such an imperative in the United States (Wallace , 2005) , but due to public opposition , nuclear reactors are perceived as dangerous and unreliable .
However , we should clear the misunderstandings of nuclear energy and learn to accept it and use it to save the Earth .
Furthermore , there is widespread information that nuclear energy is the most expensive and unreliable source of energy .
On the contrary , a team of energy experts from various governments , academic and private sector research units noted that wind and solar powers are not very reliable as they are only generated when the wind is right or when the sun is shining (Science Compass , 2002) .
Furthermore , they are also very difficult to store hence making it a very unreliable source of energy .
In addition to this , solar and wind technologies are four to ten times more expensive than nuclear energy sources like the VHTR .
For example , a VHTR costs 2 billion dollars and is able to supply electricity to billions of homes whereas one wind energy system for one home costs 25 ,000 dollars .
In comparison , VHTR supplying electricity is much cheaper (Martin , 2009) .
In short , Wind and solar power are intermittent and unpredictable and they simply cannot replace coal generating power plants .
Therefore , building a Gen IV nuclear reactor like the VHTR is not as unreliable and expensive as perceived by most .
Another issue widely discussed by the public is the issue of nuclear waste .
It is true that the generation of electricity in a nuclear power plant produces nuclear waste which is difficult to dispose of and harmful to the public as the effects are devastating .
However , according to the {International Atomic Energy Agency}[HYPERLINK: http://www .iaea .org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa .html] (2005) , there is research being conducted to develop a technology where the VHTR will be powered by using fuels originating from reprocessed nuclear-waste .
This technology would not only destroy most of the nuclear waste , but it would also make the existing waste a very valuable source of energy .
Furthermore , it can also be used to deliver ten times the energy of an original fuel .
Hence , with more research and time given to develop the technology , nuclear waste would not become a  anymore .
In conclusion , the VHTR can be seen as a safe , reliable and  affordable way to produce electricity since electricity has become a necessity in our everyday lives .
To confront global warming , Gen IV nuclear reactors like the VHTR should be seen as a solution .
According to a study by MIT in 2003 , it was concluded that the use of nuclear energy may be needed to meet future energy demands and to reduce carbon emissions as energy demands continue to rise annually .
Yetsubstantialfixed; thus a nuclear plantprovidingIn conclusion , the different factors of costs , mainly construction costs , operating costs and decommissioning costs contribute to almost the whole cost of building nuclear plant .
The total cost is a very huge figure as compared to other types of power plants .
As such , I do not support the further R&D ftong for it .
This is backed up by the fact that no new nuclear power plants have been ordered in the US since 1978 as the high costs have caused many problems such as bawouldptcies (Clayton , 2009) .

In a world where technology has fitted seamlessly  , the threat of global warming and rising energy needs which affect the future of our planet has never been greater .
Given the gloomy forecast on global warming due to the environmental impacts caused by greenhouse gases , it is not surprising that countries are turning towards nuclear energy as an alternative .
The only issue that stands in the way of the government turning towards this alternative is the memories of past incidents such as the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , and the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania (Butler , 2004 , para .4) .
However , over the recent years , research is starting to show that such issues can be overcome , and together with the launch of generation IV reactor concepts , we may be on hand to witness the revival of nuclear reactors which are safer , more valuable and more energy-efficient .
According to a statistical review of world energy consumption done by the EIA (Energy Information Administration , 2009) , the total world consumption of marketed energy is projected to increase by 44 percent from 2006 to 2030 .
Given the fact that the current rate of fuel consumption is already causing damage to our planet , such statistics is indeed alarming .
This leads to an increased urgency to turn to the usage of alternative energy such as nuclear energy , as the waste produced does not contain any greenhouse gases , thus it will help reduce global warming , as well as climate change .
As stated in Butler's article (Butler , 2004 , para .9) , the production of nuclear power plants may cost up to a hefty US$1 billion , yet it may end up as the cheaper alternative  compared to the rising cost of oil and fuels , since fossil fuels are getting scarcer , and hence more expensive .
Generation II's reactors are known to be less efficient  compared to the energy generated by fossil fuels , which has led to the decrease in the production of such plants , to the point that countries have resorted to using more fossil fuels instead of relying on the nuclear plants .
However , one of the generation IV reactor concepts such as the Gas-Cooled-Fast-Reactor (GCFR) has new functions which are turning the heads of investors and the government .
The GCFR has a 50% increase in efficiency as compared to Generation II's reactors .
Studies have shown that nuclear fission , the splitting of a heavy atom's nucleus , releases great amounts of energy .
(N .D . Alternate Energy Sources) For example , the energy it releases is 10 million times greater than is released by the burning of an atom of fossil fuel .
Besides , it would take many hectares of land covered with solar collectors , wind farms or hydro-electric dams to equal this power .
The fact that it is also able to produce both electricity and hydrogen makes it all the more practical .
Hydrogen can then be converted to produce electricity; without this conversion , demand from US transport alone will cause the nation's oil imports to soar by 78% (Butler , 2004 , para .15)
The damages caused by global warming may be causing the birth of nuclear technology , and given the benefits that it brings , it comes as no surprise that extensive research is constantly being done to ensure the smooth delivery for this renewable source of energy .
Being equipped with this self sufficient form of energy , mankind can then continue to come up with cutting edge technology without the fear of harming our planet .
Public unease over the safety of nuclear technology has historically been the principal opposition against its utilisation .
Indeed , a burnt child dreads fire .
The nineteen-eighty-six Chernobyl accident killed thirty- one people and resulted in significant damage to environment and population health in large parts of Europe .
However , as pointed out in a 2008 report by the World Nuclear Association , "to this day , the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents remain the only major accidents to have occurred in more than 12 ,700 cumulative reactor-years of commercial operation in 32 countries" .
Furthermore , statistics from the same report placed coal as the type of energy generation which caused the most related immediate fatalities from 1970 to 1992 with a total death count of six thousand and four hundred .
In contrast , nuclear power industry only resulted in thirty-one for the same period .
Moreover , the safety of nuclear technology was demonstrated during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
The survival of all three directly affected nuclear plants illustrates the high preparedness of the nuclear industry for operation under harsh conditions .
Crucially , when extrapolated to the event of a hypothesised terrorist strike , it showcased the capability of current technology to work during emergency .
Further research into VHT reactors would improve safety standards and ease public concern .
Next , opponents are concerned about the cost of nuclear energy .
They argue that investing resource into constructing the related facilities is not economical .
Studies from the Nuclear Energy Institute showed otherwise .
In the United States in 2008 , the cost of electricity from nuclear production was 1 .87 cents per kilowatt-hour , lower than that produced with coal or gas  which was 2 .75 and 8 .09 respectively .
Furthermore , the indirect economic cost from global warming would be catastrophic as recently seen in world-wide increase in frequency of natural disasters and their ruthless damage to property and human life .
Moreover , a reason why such facilities are budget taxing is due to lack of construction expertise .
As one of the aims of VHT reactor research is cost reduction , the proposed research and development in this field will draw in resources and bring about a decrease in construction and production cost .
Another reason for opposition is the disputed performance of VHT reactors .
Opponents regard Generation IV reactor as mere concepts which work only in computer simulations .
However , research into enhancing reactors in the last two decades has led to improvement in production efficiency in current plants .
The average capacity factor for plants in the United States was fifty-six percent in 1980  compared to ninety-one percent in 2008 .
Nuclear power has always been a very controversial topic over the past  few decades .
The proponents emphasized  its high energy potential while the opponents were so much concerned about its radioactive nature that might cause harm .
As energy resources have become more and more precious and our technologies keep advancing , the supporting side of nuclear power seems winning in recent years as nuclear power plants are increasing in numbers in America , China , Japan and other countries .
Butler (2004)says that the Supercritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) should be used .
Hence , it is necessary to have further research and more development funding for nuclear power due to its cost-efficiency , security and safety issues .
Firstly , nuclear power is superior to other energy resources due to its cost-efficiency .
Global warming has drawn people's attention nowadays .
Al Gore's documentary film "An Inconvenient Truth" and the Kyoto Protocol ratified by nations have shown that it is urgent to find a future energy alternative .
Nuclear energy will be the one as nuclear power can produce 50% more electricity compared to coal and it emits less  dangerous oxides such as  carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide and so on .
For instance , 790 to 1182 grams of greenhouse gases are released by a coal plant if 1 kilowatt- hour electricity is generated while only 2 to 59 grams of it is emitted by a nuclear power plant .
(Nuclear vs . Coal , 2007) The cost for coal and nuclear energies are generally comparative , $300/Mw-hr for nuclear energy and $29 .1/Mw-hr for coal respectively .
SCWRs are also cheap and efficient to run and build .
Thus , nuclear energy is more cost-efficient compared to existing energy resources and it is more environment-friendly .
Moreover , the nuclear power system  is much more secure than other energy resource systems .
The establishment of a nuclear plant is  .
Once the plants are built up , safety precautions will be installed and working staff will be carefully selected .
Hence , it is indeed not easy for terrorists to attack the plants as they will be spotted and stopped by the high-tech security systems before they do so .
Abuse of nuclear energy is also less likely to happen among countries as international organizations such as United Nations will hinder the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
For instance , North Korea has announced plans to be  a "powerful nation" by 2012 in terms of nuclear weapons .
(Klingner , 2009) America , China and other big countries and organizations have stood up and criticized this action .
Many nuclear power projects are not implemented under pressure such as the one initiated by Korea Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) .
From the hindered growth of nuclear energy in North Korea , we can see that the abuse of nuclear power such as SCWRs is less likely to happen nowadays .
The atomic bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 will definitely not happen nowadays as they will be strongly opposed due to its inherent immorality and military unnecessariness .
On the other hand , nuclear energy is much safer than other energy resources .
Governments have spent large amounts of money in maintaining the safety of nuclear power plants .
Technologies are kept upgraded to ensure the smooth running of the systems .
The following statistics can illustrate that nuclear power is much safer than others .
The number of immediate fatalities from 1970 to 1992 for nuclear power facilities is 31 and those for coal and gas are 6400 and 1200 respectively .
(Ball , 2001) We cannot deny the fact that nuclear disasters have happened in the past such as Chernobyl disaster in 1986 .
(Jaworowski , 2004) However , as compared to coal plant accidents , SCWR is still a superior choice due to its sophisticated safety systems and that is why the governments should have development funding for it to achieve zero nuclear disaster someday in the future .
To sum-up , the nuclear energy is much more environment-friendly and it is a better choice compared to coals and gases as more electricity can be generated by the same amount of nuclear energy with comparative costs .
Nuclear energy is also under protection of high-tech security systems .
Hence , we should support further research in this area and increase the development funding for nuclear power .
Since the nuclear reactor accident at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl , it has been two decades before the issues regarding conventional nuclear power were brought up once again due to increasing cost of power generation .
Generation IV nuclear energy systems offer advantages in the areas of economics , safety and reliability , sustainability and could be deployed commercially by 2030 (Cogeneration Technologies , 2002) .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) has selected six nuclear systems which have the potential to be used for commercial electricity generation and in my opinion , the supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR) and the very high temperature reactor (VHTR) are the better ones compared to the rest of the reactors .
Further , I think that the VHTR deserves further research and development funding compared to the SCWR .
On safety features , the SCWR operates at a lower temperature (510C - 550C) than the VHTR (1000C) which gives the impression that VHTR is more dangerous than the SCWR .
But the fact is that the VHTR uses a graphite-moderated core with specific design optimizations (Sterbentz , 2007) .
Thus , the core has large thermal inertia which means it is not easily corroded even in high temperatures .
It also has high heat capacity and structural stability .
VHTR uses helium gas as coolant which does not react with other substances even at high temperatures (Chang , 2007) .
Further , the VHTR will be built on hard rock surface and this will minimize the effect of natural disaster such as earthquake .
Besides , it will also be built in a confined building that will protect the reactor from terrorists' attacks .
With these safety and security features , the VHTR is safer and more secure than SCWR .
The reason for using nuclear power is because power generated from fossil fuel is getting more and more expensive due to scarcity of fossil fuel .
Therefore , we must be able to produce nuclear power  at a cost lower than conventional power plants .
The capital cost of a SCWR is approximately USD 1 billion and VHTR is from USD 1 .8 billion to USD 2 .4 billion which means building a SCWR is much cheaper than building a VHTR (US Department of Energy , 2004) .
The reason for the higher cost in building a VHTR is because of its safety features .
In addition , VHTR uses high-strength alloys with protective coatings that could significantly improve the service life of high temperature reactor components .
Furthermore , the capital cost of VHTR will be lower for the second and subsequent reactors than the first one (DOE , 2004) .
In addition , VHTR has a low input cost which will lead to low processing cost that will produce cheaper electricity .
This feature alone already fulfills one of the main objectives of GIF which is to produce low cost electricity .
The reactor's performance is also one of the main concerns of GIF .
SWCR has a higher efficiency compared to the current water-cooled reactor by having a burn-up of 45% but VHTR has an even higher burn-up which is 65% .
Another advantage of VHTR over SWCR is the ability to produce hydrogen without consuming fossil fuels or emitting greenhouse gasses (Forsberg , Peterson & Ott , 2004) .
Hydrogen production needs a high temperature of 700C , so heat from VHTR can be transferred to hydrogen production plant but SWCR does not produce high enough temperature .
Experts see hydrogen as the future fuel and large amounts of hydrogen are needed to convert heavy oils and tar sands to liquid fuel .
Hydrogen is also needed in fertilizer production .
Hydrogen is getting increasingly important because of its potential to be used in fuel cells .
Therefore , the ability of producing hydrogen is a great advantage to VHTR .
could have helpedtrainpreventAmong those opposing views , there is a common misconception that psychology has nothing to do with dhave becomeprocess .
This point of view is not true since design processes are human activities and human activities are always accomplished by human errors .
Psychology , by studying human behaviours and activities , is able to detect these human errors and help avoid and eliminate accidents (Stanton , 1996) .
In the case of the Eschede train disaster , the design of the wheel tire only underwent limited tests (Semmens , 1994) and the tire's performance under extreme conditions was only proved theoretically .
The practice of psychology would help spottininvolvementgligence and the accident would probably be avoided .
As such , practice of psychology should be involved in design processes to help eliminate human errors and avoid accidents .
Some engineers argue that practice of psychology in design processes is redundant since safety regulations and norms are already established in the spoting field .
However , engineers seem to be more focused on technicalaccompanied as effectiveness and efficiency , and safety components are usually overlooked .
For the Eschede train disaster , it was lapreventevealed that the Fraunhofer Institute had observed possible tire failure as early as 1992 , however the problem was ignored until the disaster happened (Hall , 1987) .
Other accidents in engineering history also revealed the lack of enough attention of the consequences of errors in engineering field .
Hence , even with the established safety regulations in engineering , the practice of psychology is essential in re-examining and evaluating the design producpreventr hidden dangers to prevent disasters .
Another opposing view expressed by some managers is that the enrollment of psychologists in design processes will increase the cost and time spent .
This is a valid concern; however it cannot deny the significance of practice of psychology in design processes .
The additional cost spent is far less significant than the payoffs if accident occurs .
In addition , this problem of extra cost can be minimized if managers carefully analyse the nature 1992; however ,ry and decide how far psychology should be involved in design processes .
For example , for industries where design processes are compd consequenons of errors are tremendous , enrolment of psogists may be integrated , while for other industries which involves less complicated designs , psychologists may step in only after each design stages or at the end of the designs .
Some engineers have further argued that the presence of psychologists may hinder creativity due to lack of engineering knowledge .
This problem can be perfectly solved if engineers are educated in psychology .
stageinvolveengagementIn conclusion , the practice of psychology is undeniably signiinvolvementengineering design processes as it can help eliminate human errors and prevent accidents .
Considering the increment in cnegateof production , psychologists may be enrolled in various degrees according to the nature of the industry and the respective products .
Foan accidentries where professional knowledge is required , engineers educated in psychology should be involved in design processes such that safety factors can be given enough attention while innovation process will not be influenced .
The first nuclear reactor was built as part of the Manhattan project back in the 1940's to build an atomic bomb (Gilman , Newton , N .D) .
After World War II , nuclear reactors became power generators , providing electrical energy .
However , people opposed the usage of nuclear power .
The opposition can be categorized into three main groups; the public , the government , and the industry .
The public are concerned about health and safety , governments are concerned about security , the environment , and space constraints , and the industries are concerned about profits , the environment , and operation stability .
To address these concerns , experts proposed several designs for the next generation of reactors .
These designs are flawed , failing to resolve some of the concerns people have .
However , with fossil fuel depleting fast (Howden , 2007) , alternative sources of energy need to be explored; hence research on nuclear power as an energy source should be carried out .
In addition , the Lead-cooled fast reactor (LCFR) design is the best solution to the people's concerns , so research should be concentrated on this design .
First , the LCFR operates in a moderate temperature , low pressure condition (Butler , 2004) .
This characteristic is advantageous as operating a reactor under such conditions is simpler compared to the extreme conditions such as high temperature required for the other designs .
Also , according to Butler (2004) , at such temperatures the conversion of heat to electricity is efficient , thus producing more energy than present nuclear plants .
Thus the expenses to develop and operate the LCFR are cheaper than the other designs , increasing profit .
This addresses the considerations industries have for profits and operation stability .
Furthermore , with stability , accidents are unlikely to occur , and therefore it resolves  the concerns people have for safety .
Next , the LCFR enables waste recycling .
The advantage is the maximized use of uranium , the fuel for nuclear power .
As uranium is a non-renewable resource , wasting should be discouraged , as uranium reserves will deplete as rapidly as fossil fuel .
This is critical as one motive of looking for alternative energy sources is to have a long lasting source; thus this property should be prioritized .
In addition , with waste recycling , the amount of radioactive waste to be disposed is reduced .
This dispels the environmental concerns that governments and industries have .
However , waste recycling is dangerous , as plutonium is separated .
Plutonium is a key ingredient of nuclear weaponry , thus causing the government's security concerns .
Nevertheless , this can be resolved by implementing restrictions on nations , preventing nuclear weaponry development .
Hence this property should be present in the future nuclear plant .
Another property of the new nuclear plant is the production of hydrogen fuel together with electricity .
As hydrogen is capable of replacing fossil fuel as an energy source (Bose ,  Malbrunot , 2006) , having nuclear plants that produce hydrogen will relieve us of our dependence on the fast depleting fossil fuel for energy .
This will benefit the world , as carbon emissions will then decrease , slowing down global warming .
However , considering the large amount of space taken up by a plant and its hydrogen output , governments will debate over whether it is worthwhile to use so much land to produce enough fuel for the nation .
In addition , for small countries such as Singapore , there is no room to even construct a plant to power the country .
Nonetheless , land constraints may be resolved by situating the nuclear plant offshore , which is  listed as  one of the considerations by the government of Singapore (Li , 2008) .
With alterations to the operating temperature , pressure , waste recycling ability and power output of present nuclear reactors , the LCFR design is able to address many concerns the world has regarding the utilization of nuclear power .
In addition , with the advantages of the LCFR design heavily outweighing the possible problems it may bring , the LCFR design is arguably the most suited solution amongst the six designs to the concerns the world has towards nuclear power .
Therefore , more funding should be provided for research and development to be carried out on the LCFR design .
Nuclear power has always been a dilemma to humans .
As it is a very promising energy source , it is not a wonder that nuclear power is extremely enticing to mankind .
This advantage , however , comes with a price .
The danger , which nuclear power holds , is a big concern and it has held the development of nuclear technology back for decades .
The radioactive waste produced in a nuclear process is also dangerous and lasts for a very long time .
After years of development , the scientists published six generation IV reactor concepts which should solve most of today's problems in nuclear plants .
The most promising would be the sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFR) because ,  safety wise , SFR needs low pressure and temperature to operate and it does not produce hydrogen which is volatile .
For the product , only electricity is produced , making it one of the most efficient reactors .
In terms of safety , SFR is safer because of its necessary condition , like temperature and pressure , to operate and the waste it produces .
SFR operates at a temperature around 5500C which for a nuclear plant is considered a low temperature for a nuclear plant to operate .
The low temperature indicates that we do not need to manufacture a new kind of material to withstand the temperature .
; most of the concepts are operated at almost twice the temperature SFR is operating at .
SFR is also operating at a pressure around atmospheric level so it is safer because the high pressure will increase not only the stress on the walls of the plant but also the damage if an explosion happens .
Using radioactive material such as Uranium238 , plutonium and lanthanum , the SFR runs a full cycle which nearly consumes all the material to produce electricity .
This means that no radioactive waste is released  to the public and also no hydrogen is produced as a byproduct .
As no radioactive waste is thrown out , there is no danger of radioactive poisoning .
The risk of explosion is lowered because no hydrogen is produced but we still need to be cautious as we are using sodium as a coolant and sodium not only explodes if it is in contact with water but also burns if it touches air .
Operating at low temperature and pressure also means that this model is efficient as less heat is being transferred out of the system and the energy is turned to electricity .
The fact that radioactive source are being processed repeatedly until it changes into non-radioactive compounds and no byproduct produced also indicates that this model has high efficiency .
SFR has  a high capital cost due to the necessity to use magnesium oxide as the container of sodium to prevent it leaking .
This problem deters many countries from pursuing the SFR model further but if they manage to build an SFR plant , the profit that comes from building one will cover the capital cost in just several years .
Right now , there is research to reduce the cost by improving the design of SFR and the most prominent is probably by improving the design of the core of SFR .
Other concepts may have lower capital cost but they also have a lower efficiency .
From all the advantages like the low pressure and temperature condition , almost no radioactive waste and no other byproduct like Hydrogen , it can be seen that SFR is the most promising and advantageous model compared to other reactor concepts and it is worth every dollar spent to pursue deeper research and development .
This model's weaknesses like the high capital cost and the danger of using sodium are actually solvable by producing a new metal that is incapable of reacting to sodium .
Nuclear energy has been a topic of discussion among the society given the memories of the partial nuclear meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , during which the reactor core exploded (Butler , 2004) .
The radioactive effects of the aftermath can still be felt even years after the accident with common side effects that include deformities in newborn babies .
The issue of safety is of utmost concern in the debate of whether nuclear reactors should even be in operation .
The world's natural resources are depleting rapidly  and there is a need to search for alternatives to meet the ever increasing energy demands of the world .
Generation IV reactors may just be the solution to meet these demands .
In addition , their new designs will address safety issues .
Two of such Generation IV reactors include the very high temperature reactor (VHTR) and the gas cooled fast reactor (GCFR) .
Both of these designs incorporate helium as a coolant and produce electricity as well as hydrogen as their energy output (Butler , 2004) .
However , the favourable VHTR has advantages in performance , safety and cost that outweigh those of the GCFR and thus should be given support for further research and development .
Firstly , the VHTR has better performance than the GCFR .
The GCFR produces less waste than the VHTR (Khalil , n .d) .
However , with less waste produced it means that the same fuel is reused several times .
As a result , the fuel loses its properties to generate energy over time .
In contrast , the VHTR uses fresh fuel each time and therefore , output efficiency remains high .
Furthermore , the VHTR has a higher operating temperature , which is essential in achieving better efficiency , as energy output is dependent on temperature (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002) .
This will result in the VHTR producing more energy with the same amount of fuel .
Secondly , the VHTR incorporates a safety feature that is not present in the GCFR .
The GCFR operates at a much safer lower operating temperature compared to the VHTR .
In contrast , the VHTR operates at a higher operating temperature .
However , the VHTR has a temperature monitoring system that constantly monitors the temperature of the core to prevent any meltdowns from occurring , and it has a proper back up system that continues producing energy during a malfunction .
This is particularly important for a country like France where 80% of its energy depends on nuclear source (Butler , 2004) .
Moreover , with such a system , human intervention can be avoided during emergencies .
Also , we have to understand that every system is bound to fail .
Relying on visual inspection of the core will not be adequate for the GCFR to meet safety standards .
In addition , the issue of waste recycling in GCFR will pose a huge problem .
Waste recycling will produce plutonium and uranium in its pure form , which is an active ingredient used in the making of nuclear weapons (Butler , 2004) .
This problem is not present in the VHTR that stores waste instead of recycling it (Very High Temperature Reactor , n .d) .
In conclusion , the VHTR should receive further funding for research and development given the advantages it holds over the GCFR .
The VHTR has a better performance in terms of higher energy output , a safer design that meets safety standards and ultimately a more cost effective solution .
On July 17 , 1981 , the interconnected second level and fourth level hanging walkways in the Hyatt Regency in Kansas City collapsed , killing 114 and injuring an additional 200 more (Hotel Horror) .
The reason for this disaster boiled down to gross negligence by the project engineer for not checking with the calculations before agreeing to design changes as a result of material constraints .
In the case of the accident at the Hyatt Regency , the introduction of a psychologist to the errant architecture design firm could have brought to light the negligent behavior of the engineer in question .
However , the identification of this particular problem through behavioral observation by a psychologist may not be a good method given that the multitudes of other problems that might occur , thus leaving much the fault-finding process to chance .
Indeed , the application of psychology in the design process should not only be in the form of adding personnel well-versed in psychology .
The implementation of safety orientated intervention practices as discussed by Geller(2001) can  help cast a wide net of control over the domains of possible human errors .
Geller's article , albeit written in the context of occupational safety , advocates the use of behavior-based safety (BBS) techniques as tools to help members of a working unit to take better control of their safety performance .
One particular way of implementation , the "Actively Caring Model" , shows promise of cultivating a work attitude of actively caring for the associated benefits of others through promoting the effects of various psychological states of mind like self-pride in ones' field of work , the effects which could have prevented this accident .
Additionally , there is a need for the application of psychology to create a standardized design process where measures for the purpose of ensuring safety can be explicitly listed and made compulsory .
An effective measure can be mandating a 'design check' by a competent and independent third party before construction , which could have prevented the accident .
This is where  it is necessary for a psychologist to compliment the design process , by looking out in the directions where the design process is unable to cover .
The operation hierarchy of the engineering firm is highlighted as there is only one person who is responsible for approving the designs .
Given the importance of this task and the possible stresses of the job , it can be very risky to have only have one person in charge .
The utilization of elementary psychology would have prevented this accident as these types of windows of opportunities for risk could have been easily identified and rectified if the firm employed introspective reviewing of its operation .
First of all , if psychology approaches were introduced in the design process , product safety could be better guaranteed .
It is very often that managers of large projects tend to believe that engineers would never make mistakes .
However , the fact is human errors widely exist in engineering designs process , which may result in the failure of product functions (Wilbert , 2007) .
In thhappened of Eschede train causeder , tdeathswly d injured 88gh-speed wheels were used for operation without physically tested ( HYPERLINK "http://www .ndt .net/index .html" NDTnet , 2000) .
A single fatigue crack later contributed the most to the train accident .
It reveals the fact that engineers spropose neglect certain steps of design process .
If the wheels were tested and improved before pmight have helpedservice , the accident would likely to be prevented .
Therefore , a human scientist is in need to analyze the design process and ensure every step is completed before the product is commissioned .
In addition , human scientist will focus on factors that are closely related to the design , such as the environment in which the product will be implemented .
Companies hire engineers to design certain product and they expect them to consider every detail related commonly design .
But in reality , engineers often focus on the product itself while ignoring the environment .
In the case of high-speed train , the track is important to analyze .
The limit of the track , upon which the Iwithout being physically tested was exceeded by the train's maximum speed .
Besides , when travelling from high to low speed track , the train passes through a switch points which caused one carriage to stray from the straight-line .
It is analyzed by scientist that it is likely that the traibefore they were put vtossed safely under the bwould have likely been  was plain (ICE High Speed Train Disaster , n .d .) .
Suppose a human scientist was present during the design process , he probably would remind the engineers to consider the track and the accident would be prevented .
would have beenwould have remindedhad beenFurthermore , psychologist can help analyze and improve the operating system and company policy of large engineering projects .
Just before the Eschede train disaster occurred , valuable time wasa certain product efficient feedback system .
The train staffs did not stop and exam the problem when a passenger reported strange noise and a large piece of metal coming up through the floor .
Engineers and project manager may not be experts in designing operation rules .
A human scientist can assist them and improve the system .
If the "stop and examine" rule was suggested before the accident for dealing with danger signals , the disaser will be prevented (Single Line Tablet Instruments , n .d .) .
could have beenhad beenTo conclude , psychologistslogy approaches during design process will help improve product safety as well as the efficiency of operating systems .
Human scientists are able to analyze each step of the process and remind engineers the important fac staffhat they ignore .
Mexaminemajor accidents might be prevented if psychology is involved .
Therefore , it is vital to introduce psychology into engineering design process .
It has been argued for a long time whether the use of  nuclear power should be encouraged or opposed .
In recent years , scientists have developed a new concept of nuclear energyGeneration IV reactors .
Generation IV reactors have features such as high operation temperature , simplified safety measures , and proliferation-resistance (Butler , 2004) .
One type of Generation IV reactors would be the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) .
Many people think that there should not be any more funding for the research and development of VHTR because of its high cost , low reliability , as well as its potential threats .
However , by considering the tremendous benefits it will bring , funding for further research and development of this reactor should still be encouraged .
One reason that causes the public to disapprove of the idea of providing funds for the research and development of VHTR is the high expenses on it which most believe that many countries cannot afford .
In fact , even a prototype of VHTR will cost US$1 billion to build (Butler , 2004) .
However , despite the actual construction cost in building the reactors , VHTR would be economically beneficial because of its high efficiency in electricity and hydrogen production .
It has been proven that the amount of electricity produced by VHTR will be 50% more than that produced by the older nuclear reactors (Butler , 2004) .
In fact , many of the developed countries such as the US and Europe have already started the research and development of VHTR and plan to finish it by 2021 (Kirk , 2006) .
Therefore , if we consider the future benefits that VHTR will bring , the funding would be trivial .
Lastly , despite all the safety measures implemented , it is still believed that the nuclear reactors are potentially dangerous .
It is doubtless to say that there is a possibility that radioactive leak will occur .
However , the VHTR has been developed into such a stage that in an event of accident , the reactor  is able to shutdown itself without human intervention (Miyamoto , 2005) .
This will greatly reduce the possibility of a radioactive leak and make the nuclear reactors safer than ever .
Another problem may be dumping the nuclear waste which , if not carefully considered , may cause serious consequences (Madan , 2008) .
However , VHTR has its unique design which makes the disposal of nuclear wastes convenient and safe .
It has a corrosion-resistant repository which collects all the nuclear wastes before they start decay (Butler , 2004) .
On the whole , the VHTR has shown great potential in becoming the future source of energy .
It is not only more efficient in generating energy , but also more environmentally friendly than those conventional sources of energy .
Therefore , despite the current challenges for this new energy source , the society should provide funding for the research and development of VHTR .
The cost of this technology is high compared with traditional treatment .
Since the purchase and the update of the machines are expensive , and ta robot ," x procedures require specialized surgeons , the expense for this robotic surg75 years; however ,eloping the technology can reduce the cost of machines and simplify the whole systemcommunity because this technology appears to be quite controversial regarding the cost , time required and safety .
all as well .
Actually , the total cost for the patients should not be much more expensive according to Dr . Michael Argenziano at New York Presbyterian Hospital (Disadvantages of Robot Surgery , 2009) .
Because the recovery time of patients becomes shorter , patients will have to pay much less on nursing .
The size of the machine is too huge , making it impossible for assistant surgeons to help perform the surgery .
Moreover , the vara  higher risk lved in the surgery are too many for a machine to handle .
With the development of new software and hardware , minimizing the size of robots can be achieved (Thomas ,2007) .
The role of robots in the surgery is just to help the surgeons instead of performing the surgery by will be performed any situations happens during the surgery can be handled by the trained and experienced surgeons .
In addition , robot arms may contain more checking functions to help check the inside of tissues .During robotic surgery , the surgeon can more easily see the area being operated on .
More importantly , less blood lose , less infection and small incisions make the procedure safer and less painful .
smallerlossAlthough this nascent technologlarges its disadvantages regarding cost , time and safety , both technological and non-technological solutions are almost possible to overcome those problems .
Researches in this field , increasing training of surgeons , and improvements of other significant issues are conducted to achieve better acceptance of this technology .
Given more time , this technology will prove its efficiency by giving us situationethat happensresults and evidence-based outcomes .
Hopefully , robotic surgery will possibly improve our surgical practice and bring high quality of surgical care to patients .

While the demand of energy is constantly increasing , earth is running low in coal , oil , and gas supply .
Based on 2003 rates of production of fossil fuels , the global oil , gas , and coal reserves were predicted to be exhausted in the next 41 , 67 .1 , and 192 years respectively (Lincoln , 2005 , p . 622) .
Due to the scarcity of fossil fuels , nuclear power made its way back onto the table .
The concept of Generation IV reactors was introduced and  several countries in the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) were in favor of the Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTR) .
However , safety , cost , and performance are the three main reasons for opposition to the VHTR .
Even with these three reasons , there is still a need to do further research and development funding for it .
Another reason for opposition is the danger of the operation of nuclear reactors .
Haunted by the memories of the catastrophe at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and Chernobyl in Ukraine , the public requires some convincing (Butler , 2004 , p . 238) .
One of the main safety principles for Generation IV reactors is the concept of defence in depth .
This concept involves several "overlapping layers of safety and multiple barriers , such that if one safety provision should fail , another will be available to prevent unacceptable damage from occurring" (The Risk and Safety Working Group Of the Generation IV international Forum , 2008) .
Hence , with multiple layers of safety measures , operation of VHTR would not pose any threat to the public .
The final argument  by opponents is availability of the coolant of VHTR .
VHTR uses helium as a coolant which is extracted from natural gas reserves .
Given the fact that natural gas reserves are depleting , the same applies to helium as well .
Hence , VHTR will not be able to function in the absence of helium .
The characteristic of helium as an inert gas had made helium recyclable (Bowe , 2004) .
Furthermore , having helium exposed to radiation in the nuclear reactor does not turn helium into a radioactive compound .
VHTR could recycle their coolants and requires minimal addition of helium from time to time .
In a nutshell , the opponent's reasons are debatable .
Energy generated by VHTR is abundant , inexpensive , safe and reliable .
Nuclear energy will do more good than harm to  mankind .
Therefore , further research and development funding for the very-high-temperature reactors should be supported not only by GIF but also other countries as well .
The first nuclear power plant provided electricity to the power grid in the 1950s .
What separates the first nuclear plant from the recent one is the reactor , which has undergone a series of advancements .
The reactor has evolved from Generation I to Generation III over the past five decades with Generation IV being the next prototype .
However , the one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built over the years is public opposition .
(Butler , 2004 , pp .
238-240) Despite the public claiming that nuclear energy is dangerous , an expensive form of energy or of poor performance , the use of molten salt reactor can address their concerns with new designs of the reactor and a cheaper , cleaner and sustainable form of energy .
Thesis statement
The major reactor meltdown happened in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and in 1986 at Chernobyl , Ukraine .
Close to a hundred people died and a few thousand people developed cancer over the decades due to exposure to radiation from the reactor meltdown  .
(Bock , Hofmann , Hoffmann , & Logan , 2005) In the new reactor the radioactive materials are contained within the chamber and if there is a reactor meltdown , the release of large amount of radiation can be prevented .
Most of the public has the misconception that nuclear energy is expensive , therefore  opposing it .
However , it is easy to conclude without substantiating with a proper cost analysis .
The cost of building a nuclear plant is admittedly more that for than other kinds of power plants but the consideration should be based on performance and cost per unit energy .
According to statistics from the Nuclear Energy Institute , nuclear power plants have achieved increasingly higher capacity factors with the same or greater levels of safety over the past two decades .
In the United States , for example , the average capacity factor for nuclear plants in operation in 1980 was 56 .3 percent .
By 1990 , it had risen to 66 percent , and in 2007 to 91 .8 percent .
(Eerkens , 2006 , pp .
19-29)
Some opponents of nuclear energy argue that coal reserves can last another 120 years and funds should be spent on researching technology for coal .
However , this is based on the assumption that coal is used solely for producing electricity .
In fact , coal is an alternative raw material to manufacture plastics in place of oil which will be depleted in 40 years , meaning that coal will last much less than the alleged 120 years .
Unlike coal , nuclear energy uses the fission of atoms to generate electricity .
There are many types of elements and their isotopes available for fission like Thorium , Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 , and reprocessing is possible , resulting in at least a thousand more years for nuclear energy .
The burning of coal also produces carbon dioxide and other air pollutants , contributing to the global warming .
(Eerkens , 2006 , pp .
19-29) Thus , nuclear energy could be a long term solution and it does not contribute to global warming .
It is evident that the claims from the oppositions of nuclear energy are flawed .
In spite of them claiming that nuclear energy is unsafe , costly and of low output , there is research and data to show otherwise with Generation IV reactors .
In conclusion , it could be a wise decision for the public to evaluate nuclear energy as a form of energy and eventually , support further research and development funding for it .
Nuclear reactors are often believed to be accompanied with the danger of leak and explosion .
However , few people know that the Generation IV Reactors , which will be put into use in about 10 to 20 years' time , will produce energy that can be "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant ,"  just like what Spencer Abraham , one of the US energy secretaries , said at the 2002 gathering of GIF (Generation IV International Forum) representatives .
The VHTR (very-high-temperature reactor) is one of these reactors .
It can produce heat and hydrogen simultaneously with an outlet temperature as high as 1000 C . Although there are still many peopleconcernedg about the safety andeconomicy factors , the VHTR is indeed one of the most advanced and valuabledesignsn in the world and deserves further research and development funding for it .
Even among all the Generation IV Reactors , the VHTR has the highest operating temperature .
The higher the temperature is the higher heat resisting level the materials must achieve .
So some people worry that the existing materials can not meet the needs  .
And in case of accident , the very severe reaction may be difficult to control .
In fact , the VHTR uses Helium as the coolant and graphite as the material of the core .
Helium is a kind of inert gas and will seldom react even in the very high temperature .
Numerous tests and calculations have shown that it is nearly impossible to burn high-purity , nuclear-grade graphite , since graphite could be heated to more than 1650  C without incurring ignition or self-sustained combustion .
Therefore ,underge normalcircumstancese , there will be no problem for the materials to stand therequiredg high temperature .
Moreover , the reactor adapts the self-regulating system .
If there is some trouble , the reaction will automatically stop and the temperature will gradually cool down to avoid dangers .
The earliest VHTR will not appear on the earth until 2020 while the research has been ongoing since 1990s  with a total research funding of more than 1 .6 billion dollars .
Opponents may argue that it will cost too much to put the design into use .
It is true that the early investment of VHTR is much higher than the existing normal nuclear reactor or others; however , the VHTR could produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with other conventional plants , and its deign life is as long as 60 years compared with 40 years of the normal nuclear reactors .
Besides , the VHTR can gain hydrogen through regular running , which could be converted into electricity for cars and homes .
In other words , the by products are worth a great deal of money .
So , it is easy to find that after a long period  of running , the total cost of VHTR will not exceed that of other existing reactors any more .
In conclusion , the VHTR has its own safety features , such as very high system temperature , enhanced reliability , low system pressure and so on .
The early research and development cost might be high but in the long run there seems no obvious difference .
So it is worth developing and investing .
The two general IV nuclear reactors that we will be discussing are very high temperature reactor (VHTR) and gas cooled fast reactor (GCFR) .
I personally feel that VHTR deserves more funding and research than GCFR in terms of performance , safety and cost .
The similarities between these two reactors are that both  use helium as a coolant , do not need working at high pressure and produce the same output of hydrogen and electricity .
(Butler 2004) .
We will be considering which reactor should have more emphasis to have further research and development funding for it .
In terms of performance , Gas cooled fast reactors are dependent on VHTR in terms of modification in design and characteristic , minimizing the effort required for GCFR .
(www .nextgenerationnuclearplant .com) .
The waste material produced by GCFR is being recycled .
As a result , there is a decrease in efficiency as it is being used many times and loses its capability to generate the same amount of energy .
(http://www .neutron .kth .se/courses/GenIV/GenIVreactors .pdf) .
In addition , according to theory , we know that output efficiency is dependent on temperature .
So a higher operating temperature of VHTR would allow for more electricity to be produced  compared to gas cooled reactors .
Besides that , the waste material being produced by gas cooled fast reactors is pure plutonium and this material is mainly used for weapon production .
This is dangerous if it goes out of hand .
In terms of safety or security , there is a temperature monitoring system in VHTR to ensure safety .
It monitors the reactors to avoid any meltdown .
Such system does not exist in gas cooled reactors that operate at lower temperature .
(http://www .cogeneration .net/very_high_temperature_Reactor .htm) .
VHTR has a better back-up system .
In the event of sudden shutdown due to malfunction , VHTR can still produce energy .
(http://www .anl .gov/PCS/acsfuel) .
It is especially useful for countries like France , where 80% of the electricity generated is dependent on nuclear energy .
(Butler 2004) .
For GCFR , there is a presence of safe accommodation of low thermal inertia and poor heat transfer properties of the coolant .
In VHTR , waste is not recycled but instead stored away .
In terms of cost , VHTR can be  implemented five years earlier than the gas cooled fast reactors .
As a result , this can save money for many years of project planning and research .
(Butler 2004)Currently , there are no operators for the GCFR in the  market .
Money will need to be invested in the training of operators for this new type of generation IV reactors .

Firstly , the main public concern on nuclear power is its safty .
After the partial reacter meltdown in 1979 at Pennsylvania and the 1986Inccident in Chernl .
The protential hazard of nuclear reactants has been recognized .
Moreover , due to its far-ranging influence , the nuclear reactants can be model targets for terrorists and military attsafeThe molten salt reactant has a advantage in this aspect .
It retains three barriers of the containing fussion products(Moir , R .W . , 2008) .
The first barrier is the fuel clad ,the second one is the ractor vessel and piping , the final one is the containment buliding which was bulit 10 meters ungerground .
In case of the accidents or spills of radioactive material , the buliding ungerground will be nicely isolated and the "gravity barrier" can prevent the leakage from reaching outside .
In addition , MSR is free of pressure and easy for fuel dumping , which is its own property .
( [pic]Mathieu , L . ,2006) Although MSR work in relatively high tempreture it can still be stable ,for example , for FUJI-12 , The maximum fuel temperature for two rod insertions of 0 .344%dk/k was 1220K at the rated power .
This result violates the high safety limit .
( Reactivity-initiated-accident analysis without scram of a molten salt reactor  ,2008)
worksFor the consideration of Economic motivation , the Oak Ridsafetytional Laboratory (ORNL) has made capital and operating cost estimates based on detailed conceptual studies of various MSRs .
The result showed that the capital of MSR(20% enriched) is 20 .1 $/MWh and the total cost is 38 .4$/MWh .
Compared with 15 .8$/MWh and 41 .9$/MWh of normal coal reactants the MSR is actually 7%anlower than the pressurized water reactant(PWR) and 8% lower than coal , which gave an encouraging result .
(R .W .
Moir  ,2007)Nevertheless , the capital cost of MSR is relatively much higher than common reactors , which may be the overwhemling limitation for developing countries .
First of all , occupational mistakes is the main reason of triggering accidents as well as in mitigating consequences , so appllatterpsychology can help people make less mistakeswith timents from happening .
On 20 , April , 2004 , the Nicoll Highway collapsed when a tunnel was being constructed for use by MRT , which killed four people and injured three .
It was one of the largest failures of a civil engineering project under construction in about 50 years (Whittle , 2008) .
The main fault is the original design misinterpreted the local geology and overestimated the soil shear strength , which results in the falling down of the whole structure (Levey , 2008) .
People who oppose applying psychology may argue that this accident is due to technical problems , having nothing to do with psychology .
However , the misinterpretation of local earth is a typical incident of occupational hazards which is at the center of psychological attention .
Psychology help engineers find the root of the problems instead of staying on the surface of the problems .
Applying psychology , engineers can analyze the reason from a more objective and more scientific angel .
After a complete analysis and a better understanding of mistakes , the possibilities of making mistakes can be reduced , thus can prevent accidents from happening .
as hasof causingFirstly , opponents may doubt the safety and reliability of SCWR .
This doubt arises from the lack of knowledgewhich occurreddesign of this reactor .
The nuclear accident happened at Chernobyl was mainly because the nuclear plant utilized positive void coefficient of reactivity , causing it impossible to stop forrking process when things went wrong .
(Bodansky , 2004) On the contrary , SCWR uses negative void coefficient instead , which could effectively reduce the possibility of this kind ofS DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee & the Generation IV International Forum , 2002) .
Moreover , opponents may also argue that the notion of SCWR is rather a pure theory with no prototype , so that this reactor may not be as effective as stated .
This-argument is sensible but not totally true for SCWR .
Actually , the notion of SCWR is an add on of two current techonologies .
One is light water reactor (LWR) , which is currently under use all over the globe .
The other is supercritical fossil fuel fired boilers , which is also under use now (Idaho National Laboratory , 2007)accidentre , it wouee of these practical experiences .
Thus , although SCWR has no prototype yet , it actually has some reliability for implementation .
Finally , SCWR has a higher thermal efficiency of 44% compared to LWR of 33-35% (Baindur , 2008) .
However , opponents may point out that this high thermal efficiency is achieved at the expense of operating under very high temperature and pressure , which could increase its potential danger .
This concern is necessary but SCWR has overcome this issue .
The coolant in the SCWR system is supercritical water , which has very high specific heat , so that in very effective acting as a coolant .
Besides , this system is simple to construct and control since only one phase of coolant is present throughout the process (Generation IV International Forum , n .d .) .
Therefore , the safety issue concerning high temperature and pressure is overcome to some extent .
To sum up , although there exists disagreement of the use of SCWR due to its issue of reliability and safety , SCWR is worthy for further research because it bases on two current technologies , which increases its reliability , and its design principle improves its thermal efficiency compared to LWR and reduce the possibility of causing nuclear accidents .
Hopefully , SCWR could be better improved on current problems in the future development .

Given the memories of the two accidents which happened in 1979 at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and in 1986 at Chernobyl of Ukraine , some people may still have not recovered from the great horror when they hear nuclear power .
However , instead of nuclear power , the fossil fuels people have been using are bringing various challenges to human beings .
On the one hand , people are facing the challenge of energy shortage because fossil fuels are nonrenewable .
On the other hand , burning fossil fuels produces the "green gases" such as carbon dioxide that have resulted in serious problems like global warming .
Therefore , some high-efficient , sufficient and environment-friendly energy is urged .
And because of high-efficiency and cleanliness , nuclear power is coming back into human consideration .
Recently , the generation IV International Forum (GIF) came up with six generation IV reactor concepts .
Among the six reactors , the Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) stands out and may probably be the first choice as future fuel although some people may worry about its safety and cost .
Opponents may claim that the safety of VHTR cannot be controlled , which allows potential accidents .
However , VHTR is much safer compared to the past nuclear reactors .
First of all , instead of using water as coolant , VHTR uses helium gas .
Hence there is no need to be concerned about the safety of the reactor coolant .
The advantage of using helium as the nuclear reactor coolant is that helium is an inert gas which is single phase , and it will not chemically react with any material (International Atomic Energy Agency , 1997) .
In addition , exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive , which is quite different from most of the other possible coolants (Youchison et al . , 1987) .
Secondly , for the material of VHTR , the ongoing 30-MWth HTTR project in Japan is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of reaching outlet the temperature up to 950 C coupled to a heat utilization process .
Thirdly , there are two unique designs of VHTR , which enhances the safety .
One is that the reactor and the gas turbine system are separated fromthe hydrogenn production plant , which is aimedatoisolatinge the hydrogen plant fromthe reactorr system during the abnormal events ofthe hydrogenn production plant .
The other design is that there are three control valves to mitigate the thermal variation of helium gas , which can automatically control the power generation rate when some abnormal events occur in the IS process such as process pump trip (Japan Atomic Energy Agency , 2007) .
In this case , the number of the accidents caused by human factors would be decreased .
To conclude , it should be evident that the arguments against the safety and cost of VHTR are invalid .
Since VHTR uses helium as a coolant , the research of the materials for VHTR is also ongoing , and also there are unique designs for VHTR , the safety of VHTR would be enhanced a lot .
Besides , compared with other generation IV reactors , VHTR costs less .
Furthermore , VHTR produces hydrogen as future fuel , which is environmentally-friendly and can effectively solve the energy shortage as well .
Therefore , VHTR is a promising and practical form of power .
Secondly , the reactor has been designed with a lot of safety concerns in mind .
After seeing the incidents at the 3 Mile Island athe reactornobyl , people are worried about having a nuclear reactor in their country and have questioned the safety of the Generation IV reactors .
The VHTR is designed to operate on a pebble bed core in which the fuel is coated with silicon carbide which ensures that the radioEwing Jack ,September 2009pheres or pebbles (Andrew C .Kadak , MIT study on the future of nuclear energy) .
The reactor is helium cooled and uses graphite moderated core , which takes advantage of the fact that the helium coolant is inert and has no reactivity effects and that graphite has a high thermal inertia and is stable at high temperatures (VHTR , Idaho National Laboratory) .Also , any waste produced goes directly to the repository and this means an additional waste recycling process can be avoided(Butler , NuclCorwin Bill ,2003 .
)f any failure the damage does not spread to the surrounding regions but is contained within the plant itself .
Lastly , most of the technology involved in the VHTR is already in its development phase and the reactor can be shelled out as early as 2020 Butler , Nuclear Power's New Dawn , 2004) .
This is a deciding factor as the current reserves of fossil fuels won't last long and the sooner we make nuclear power the mainstream source of energy , the better it would be for us and Mother Nature .
Although people might suggest the use of Carbon Capture and Storage in the existiKadak .C .Andrew)missions to a great extent , it should be pointed out that this is merely a solution to delay the problem that we would eventually face .
In summary , it can be concluded that nuclear power is the answer to the current energy crisis and the VHTR is an ideal candidate because it (Butlerlyectric energy efficiently but also provides hydrogen which can help decrease CO2 emissions .
It is also much safer than the current generation reactors and has been well designed to counter any possible error that might occur due to human or technological factors .
Clearly , the reactor is the future of nuclear power generation .
There was a train disaster which occurred on the 3rd of June 1998 near a small town in Lower Saxony , Germany .
No one would have thought it would happen .
Such a super fast , state-of-the-art Inter Express trains of German Railways rolled out of the tracks and split in two , due to a bridge falling onto the train .
It resulted in 101 dying and 88 being injured .
Although there were many causes to be pointed out for this train accident , I think the biggest cause is that no one was aware of the importance of the use of psychology during the design process .
It was reported that the direct cause was a wheel with a composite construction which is relatively common on light railway transit vehicles , but are unique to ICE 884 in high speed trains which replaced the original wheel .
Furthermore , those replaced wheels just were inspected regularly .
However , it has still carried out some of discussion about the difficulties of such inspections and the frequency with which they take place to be used to debate with the method .
It cannot be denied that this is a human mistake which can be avoided by applying  psychology .
Psychology can make engineers aware that they are not only  normal persons , but are also professionals .
Their professional specialty can change other people's life , even save a life .
If they understand that , I believe that the engineers would not have used those composite construction wheels and used wheels which had not been checked properly and approved  .
Observing the pictures which recorded the scene of accident , there was at least one  car was detached from its underframe .
It showed another construction problem of the train - the car's ability to contain its occupants was severely compromised .
It was reported that the construction of ICE did not follow traditional practice .
The floor forms parts of the underframe were welded onto the body .
In order to pursue the high-speed , the bodies were made from aluminum extrusions instead of steel to achieve light weight .
However , the heat-treated method for achieving light weight affected and reduced the tensile strength at the site of the weld .
If designers considered more about that for the high-speed trains must take into account the forces to be absorbed in the event of the vehicle being in a collision , there would not be so many people who were thrown through the air 
Considering only the construction of trains is not enough , the environmental element can affect the result as well .
The designers never anticipated that a bridge which was expected for lightly use , demanded a less substantial structure than if it were to carry a major truck load .
They completely ignored environmental elements which was the speed and weight of the train passing under the bridge which resulted in such a horrible disaster .
To sum up , any design process  can minimize a probability of danger , even can be avoided by applying psychology .
Because all design processes are to fulfill needs of human; and all products are produced by humans .
Therefore , anything as long as it is people-oriented will get the biggest benefits .
Of course ,  avoiding an accident  is the biggest benefit to people .
With present day technologies , the Generation IV International Forum has proposed six new and advance nuclear reactors .
The six nuclear reabuild are not only sustainable and economically viable solutions; they are also safe and reliable source of energy .
Among the six concepts of nuclear reactors , the Very High Temperature Reactor , (VHTR) and the Gas Cooled Fast Reactor , (GCFR) are quite similar , but has more benefits than VHTR in terms of performance , sustainability and cost .

Nowadays , since  fossil fuel is running out at a very high rate , people are seeking another alternative energy resource to replace the traditional fossil fuel resources , which have been used by humans for hundreds of years .
One of the alternatives is nuclear power .
However , the public is very concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Actually , with the improvement of technology , the generation IV reactors are safe enough .
Moreover , these generation IV reactors are also very economic and promising .
Amongst these generation IV reactor concepts , I think the lead-cooled fast reactor is very competent and should get further research and development funding .
With regard to safety , people are usually afraid of the accident caused by the nuclear reactors .
This is because  once a nuclear reactor accident happens , it would be a huge disaster to both the creatures and the environment within that area .
A very famous accident , which is also used by the public to oppose building nuclear reactors , is the accident at Chernobyl which happened on 26 April 1986 .
As a result of this accident , 28 people were killed either immediately or within a few years , and 17 more died during the next ten years .
Moreover , according to the estimation , there would be thousands of people dying from cancer in the next forty years .
Another famous example is the accident which happened at the nuclear power station at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania on 28 March 1979 .
Although at Three Mile Island the discharge of radioactive material was too small to cause any harm , it still caused a great public reaction (Kletz , 2001) .
But for Lead-cooled fast reactors , people do not need to worry much about safety .
The temperature needed to operate lead-cooled fast reactors is about five hundred and fifty to eight hundred , which is relatively higher than today's light-water reactors and can avoid the risk of coolant boiling , and the pressure is rather low (Butler , 2004) .
More importantly , unlike some other materials like sodium , lead does not react with either water or air .
These features give lead-cooled fast reactors a significant safety advantage .
Furthermore , as the technology has improved so much , even if an accident happens , the damage is probably not that big .
For example , in the Three Mile Island accident , nobody was killed  or injured .
All radioactivity was contained as designed .
Therefore , lead-cooled fast reactors are very competent in this aspect of safety .
Besides safety , the economy is also a very important aspect which people should take into consideration .
At present , to build a nuclear reactor is still costly .
According to a study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) , even reducing completion time to just four or five years , and lowering construction costs by a quarter , would still not put the nuclear plants in contention with coal , and would just barely match the price performance of a combined-cycled natural gas-powered plant (Nivola , 2004)  .
However , since we can eliminate the need for an intermediate heat transport circuit in lead-cooled fast reactors , and lead is relatively cheap when compared with other materials used in other fast reactors , a large part of cost would be saved through this .
In addition , the high temperature of the lead-cooled fast reactors can also be used for thermochemical hydrogen production , which would contribute to reducing the cost as well .
The ChernobylFirst of all , some designers may argue that theteamsign process has its own considerations and rules of safety and those rules have been practiced for many years .
Therefore a psychologist is not of great use in terms of preventing accideThe Chernobylver , though with such rules , accidents still happens consecutively aThe Chernobylyears .
Thiswhich happenedse implies some imperfect of the safety gatekeepers now .
To find this imperfection , one static result may tell the truth .
20% tn factors .
CITATION Ber06 \l 2052 (Wilpert , 2006) Those human factors mainly include the irresponsibility of operatat presentror during the desiuserocess .
It there is help from a psychologist , such errors may bit isreduced to at least half .
Just as in argueernobyl accident , if psychological considerations are involved , the operathumansll be giventhe possibillity introduction of the importance of the position and the waynecessary ,em work .
Chances are this accident may not happen .
To follow up , some designers may also consider that a team member without strong technical background may become a disturbance during work or decreases the efficiency of the team .
Therefore they may cause more problem than they can solve .
This point is quite true to some level .
However , inhappenters are always from differentimperfectionsTin terms of safetyesign requires consideration from all aspects .
A team with single major cannot satisfy such requirements therefore will lose the ability to compete ng all those facts , a psychology can never be a disturbance in the team .
Rather than , the presence of psychologist in a team can keep the members work at their best condition and avoiding the chance of having human error in design process .
What's more , as psychologists are just representatives of common people in terms of new technologies , therefore they can point out what common people will feel about the new design products .
By doing thave happenedopefully there are chances to prevent accidents because of misuse caused by the misunderstanding of instructions , like the operator in the Chernobyl accident .
will bethe designavoidoptimumhelpa psychologistpsychologistand thereforespecialitiesLast of all , designers , especially the group leaders may worry about the cost of employing psychologists in their teams .
However , considering decreaseus results of Chernobyl accidents and other engineering accproblems such wondering is of no point .
After all , the lives have no price .
And by decreasing the accident and failure rate of the products of one despecialitiesroup , they will eaore chances and reputation .
Such results will lead to more profits .
In conclusion , psychologists may become new gatekeepers of engineering design process by helping correct the human error in design process and increase the team efficiency .
Together with the present rules and laws of safety design , the presenuse psychologists decreases the chance of having future failure and accidents .
And the increasing safety will make people enjoy the benefits of engineering design products much better .
First of all , psychology serves as the crucial connection between social and technological factors .
Design itself is to combine human expectations and standards with technical specializations .
No matter what the designers are to work on , complex systems or everyday products , psychology is helpful to gain insights of problems that may be encountered or prevent undesirable aapproaches .
For everyday products design , it is quite understandable that if the technical configurations are similar for all , psychology could help designers make a difference by humanly consider making improvements that are more user-friendly in design .
More impactful consequences of not applying psychology in design are that serious failures can happen in complex projects and systems hence cause loss of life .
For instance , the collapse of Nicall Highway , two stretches of highway road linked by Merdeka Bridge , located in the Central Region of Singapore (Vernon , 2000) , could have been prevented if psychological approach were adopted in the design and construction process .
For the Nicoll Highway incident , some argue that it is merely constrained by technology and only causes are engineering problems .
While it is true that the restrictions set by technology limitations are direct cause for the engineering failure , the application of psychology could help to overcome the negative effects of technology difficulties .
In compto preventtems like the Nicoll Highway case , management and balance amongst understanding of technical level , small parts of operations , and control of the whole working process is crucial (Wilpert , 200consideringrnals written by engineers and professionals analyzing this disaster were all very absorbed by civil engineering details and theories after Nicoll Highway collapsed , but the disaster was concluded to causingexpected as technology should have been suffiNicollfor this construction project (Thansnanipan & Aung , 2005) .
This means that it is not shortcomings in technology that necessarily lead to engineering failure , but lack oapproacheslhad beenal analysis .

When some were arguing for objective difficulties in technology , it a  directmitted by the main contractor that major cause is the overload temporary works and their low quality (New Civil Engineer , 2005) .
The contractor admitted that they had foreseen the potential problems that might be caused due to overloading temporary work and their reckless plan , but they somehow still did not pay enough attention and continued with it .
It consequently led to lack of time for examining everything with enough caution and designers even misinterpreted building codes in such a rush .
the Nicollwere not for the inappropriate workload distributed and carelessness misinterpretation of building code by design engineers , such failures could have been avoided .
In conclusion , psychology plays a significant role in the design process , as it serves as essential connections between social and technological factors , influences and reflects social expectations , it can be applied to avoid technical errors athe majorilures in complex systeof temporary used to optimize design plan .
Applying a psychology approach when analyzing or planning a design is crucial and beneficial to ensure safearisel as quality .
It is known that global warming and rising energy consumption are the major challenges for people to solve in the near future .
In order to resolve such problems , a few nuclear reactors have been built in the past decades .
As it is not sufficient to provide energy power and not environmentally friendly , a new set of theoretical nuclear reactor designs are currently being researched to satisfy the requirement of energy .
Research into these reactor types was officially started based on several initial goals .
The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety , efficient thermal performanceand reduce cost .
Many reactor designs are being considered to  meet the generation IV goals of today .
Two of the generation IV reactors called Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor and Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor are highly appreciated and accepted in modern nuclear power plant systems .
In terms of performance , securityand cost cost , both  reactors are well designed .
However , to compare the two fast reactors specifically , it is better to choose Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor as the new reactor to meet the generation IV nuclear plan instead of Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor .
To begin with , truly speaking , Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor has high thermal efficiency which converts the raw material to the power energy with range from 39% to 47% .
(M .J . Lineberry & T .R .
Allen , 2002) compared to the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor , Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor has the thermal efficiency about 48% , which is generally higher than sodium-cooled fast reactor .
(W .F .G .
van Rooijen , 2009) In addition , under the high performance , both  reactors need to work under high temperature .
Specifically , for Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor , the temperature is about 550 while the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor is about 850 .
(Butler .D , 2004) Hence , from general chemical knowledge , it is more convenient and efficient to convert energy under higher temperature .
In thermal performance , both  reactors have good  features especially for energy conversionhowever , the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor may have additional advantages .
Secondly , it is appreciated that the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor has some safety features .
It includes a long thermal response time which is a large margin to cool boiling .
Then , it is a primary system that operates near atmospheric pressure .
Meanwhile , Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor is based on safety countermeasures for self-controlled shutdown function and controlling function .
(M .J . Lineberry & T .R .
Allen , 2002) The Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor ,  not only includes a basic self safety control functions but also has many safety approaches  applied to the system to make it work safely under high temperature with additional safety devices being added to the equipment .
Recent research and development with in depth studies for safety shows that , , the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor system has through experiment demonstrated its security aspect .
(T .D .
Newton & P .J .
Smith , 2007) Hence , it is safer when it works properly .
Furthermore , in terms of cost , the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor was economical  with the use of high burn-up fuels .
It uses advanced materials and innovative design options to reduce  power plant capital cost and lower operating cost .
However , the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor is also well designed especially for waste recycling; GFR tries to minimize the release of gaseous and liquid effluents to the environment .
It takes into account that the management of waste from equipment is also important .
GFR systems are designed to allow for self-treatment by applying fuel manufacturing operations .
In addition , GFR can direct energy conversion .
Hence , it makes best use of energy and reduces the entire cost .
(T .D .
Newton & P .J .
Smith , 2007)
In conclusion , both the The The Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor and the the the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor achieve generation IV primary goal to satisfy the requirement of energy .
Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor works with  good thermal efficiency under a lower temperature when compared to Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor .
Moreover , it is designed well in terms of safety and cost .
Similarly , the GFR system offers significant potential to advance generation IV sustainability goals through its thermal efficiency , direct energy conversion , safety arrangement and proper cost .
Over all , Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor has advantages over Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor with respect to thermal efficiency , security  and cost .
Psychology isThe Cambridgey of the behavior of human's mind .
In most of the accidents , the main causes are errors in human judgments or simply known as the human problems .
For example , the faulty design of "wheel-tire" in the Eschede incident .
If the engineers were more careful or responsible during the designing stage of the train wheel , they woulaccidents-y have designed a safer wheel .
Howehad , there is no guarantee that a psychologist can trigger a better mind set among the descontributed Wilpert mentioned in his articwas human can make mistakes .
What about psychologists ?
Aren't they human too ?
Yes .
Psychologists might make mistakes but at least they can lowithr the probability of errors caused by human's irresponsible act or carelessness .
There is notho much" in taking precautions against any possibility of accidents occurring .
Besides that , it is found that accidents arthe humanly caused by chactions of a series of factors according to Heinrich Domino theory .
Since humaproblemproblemevitably a large portion in this of theain reactions , the removal (or the minimization) of the human factors will undoubtedly , prevent or reduce accidents .
In the case of Eschede train accident for instance , if the wheel of the train was designed in a better way or well maintained , or if the train could be stopped at the right moment before the crash , the accidhumansould probably be avoided .
But on the other hand , not all factors are within the control of human's capability .
Unfavorable environment and natural disaster are the best examples .
Bad weather conactsions , earthquake , and et cetera are all hard to be predicted .
To control them is even more ridiculous and impossible .
Therefore most people think that accidents are unavoidable .
It is quite true that these factors are beyond human's control but we do not have to prevent them from happening .
All we have to do is taking all the necessary steps and precautionary methods to prevent these "uncontrollable" from triggering an accident .
All these steps are to be done during the designing stage , which means that the psychology approach will play an important role .
As mentithis in thas been very first paragraph , accident is usually unexpected .
Despite its unexpectedness , signs or symptoms will always come first no matter how small or unnoticeable they might be .
Moments before the accident of Eschede happened , one of the passengers on the train had noticed that the tire on a wheel broke and peeled athe Eschedem the wheel , punctured the floor of the train .
He informed the conductor about what he saw but the conductor insisted to further investigate the incident and thus refused to pull the emergency brake .
Psychave beenlogically , the conductor did not want to be involved with any troubles becahumanling the emergency brake would definitely cause much hassles .
If he chose to give safety the most priority , he would he emergency brakapredictcident could probably be prevented .
However , when things come to emergency , the most important thing is often the individual ability to react rationally to resolve thumanlem .
How andy pecannotsibly remain calm when facing a sudden emergency ?
Htake , this ability can be gained through intensive training .
Practice makes perfect .
The factors from one gets trained , the more readily he is to face an emergency .
able toindividualsanan emergency ,when ithave beenhasslehave causedastroubleget intoinvestigatingonConcisely , the approach of psychological knowledge aren prevent or at least reduce the probability of accidents occurring .
Studies of human behavior , stages of an accident , investigation on industrial accident , together with some neced suitable psychological approach would definitely help in minimizing the occurring of severe accidents , especandally those that are due to errors in human judgments .
The drastic industrial development and advancement in science and technology has led to the rising energy demand  .
Searching for alternative energy sources becomes the main effort of the whole world , especially those industry-developed countries due to the dwindling energy supplies from coal and fuel .
The past few years have seen repeated calls from some of the world leaders to introduce nuclear energy as an alternative energy source to replace fuel and coal in the near future .
Generally , nuclear energy is generated through the process of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion of radioactive elements .
The energy loss in this process is dissipated in the form of heat , where it can be used to generate power and electricity .
The invention of Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) is one of the latest Generation VI nuclear reactors that have high potential to replace  coal and fuel as an energy source .
Nonetheless , debate on the using of this nuclear reactor has become a hot issue today due to the negative effects that would be brought to humans as well as other living organisms on the earth .
On the whole , further research and development funding for SWCR should be provided as all these weaknesses of nuclear reactors can be overcome via evidences and discoveries from the research done .
First and foremost , The Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) has a good security system and is safe to be used .
Much has been said about the danger of using nuclear reactors as power generators such as emission and leakage of radioactive waste and explosion of nuclear reactor , where Chernobyl and Three Mile Island emerge to be famous for that reason .
(Nuclear power's new dawn (2004)) However , research and current technology have improved the safety of using SWCR .
According to Nation Master (2007) , the coolant of this reactor is supercritical water , which has high specific heat capacity .
This helps to minimize the heating effect of the reactor .
Furthermore , this reactor's pressure vessel is incorporated a core arrangement with three passes to avoid the overheating effect and thus , minimizing the probability of the explosion of SWCR .
Emerging plasma surface modification and grain boundary technologies are also applied to modify the near surface chemistry , microstructure and stress state of alloys used , which reduce the corrosion of the body of SWCR .
(Nation Master (2007)) Obviously , all these improvements have overcome the weaknesses of nuclear reactor's security system , thus making SWCR into a safe power generator .
Moreover , the cost of construction of The Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) and cost of its power output are cheap and reasonable .
It is undeniable that uranium oxide , the main input for SWCR , and the construction materials used are expensive .
However , due to the plant simplification , its design is far simpler , that is , without the circulation pumps , pressurizers , steam generators and dryers .
This will help to reduce its cost of construction as compared to other power generators .
Also , its coolant is water which is cheap and can be obtained easily .
Although uranium oxide is expensive , it has a very long  life , about 24000 years .
(Generation VI technology (2007)) Therefore , it promises a continuous energy supply in the long run .
This also helps to reduce the cost to search for alternative input material for SWCR .
Last but not least , The The Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) has high efficiency in term of electricity and power generation .
According to Nuclear Engineering and Design (2007) , Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) promises to have high thermal efficiencies of approximately 45% , which can generate about 1 ,700 MW of thermal energy per hour .
Besides , the simplified once- thru direct cycle of coolant also helps to increase its efficiency in power generation .
As a result , less energy is being dissipated as heat and energy wastage can then be prevented .
This will also help to produce low-cost electricity as its cost of generating power is lower .
In conclusion , despite the evident harm nuclear power can cause , we should not immediately rule it out as a possible source of power in the future .
Further researches have shown that The Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) can achieve great safety by its design modification , lower and reasonable cost of its construction and power generation and has high efficiency in terms of electricity and power generation .
Therefore , further research and development funding for the Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) should be provided as it stands in  good stead to become the future's power generator in the near future .
Most scientists have agreed that we have to reduce the emission of green house gases as the impact of global warming becomes more serious .
Simultaneously , the demands of energy are increasing rapidly .
Hence , it is a matter of great urgency to seek an alternative power source .
Nuclear power will not produce the green house gases and it will provide vast amounts of energy .
However , The U .S gave up building reactors since 1979 because of the defects of nuclear power and as the cost of a reactor was high , since there was no appropriate coolant for reactors  and as the waste recycling system was not perfect it sparked a significant controversy of whether the nuclear power should be reconsidered .
Firstly , SCWR is still facing a financial problem .
To build a nuclear reactor and its prototype will cost over US$1 billion .
If the government uses this money to build more fossil reactors , the increasing fossil reactor plants will help the situation of lack of energy .
However , in a long term , nuclear reactor plants will reduce the cost compared with fossil reactor plants .
It is true that the initial cost of building a fossil plant is low , but the long-term costs which keeping it working are high says PBMR Company international marketing manager Gert Claassen .
Furthermore , the SCWR reactor's efficiency and relatively simple design ,  would be cheaper to build and run than normal reactors .
Therefore , the cost is not a problem for SCWR .
Secondly , it is too difficult to find an appropriate coolant for nuclear reactor .
However , the coolant of SCWR is supercritical water .
Normally , the critical point of water is the point at which the water exists as a combination of the liquid phase and vapour phase .
The condition of this point is at temperature of 374centidegrees and a pressure of 22 .1Mpa .
However , for the supercritical water , the critical point is much higher than the normal water .
It is about 510centidegrees at 25Mpa .
Therefore , the coolant can sustain under the high temperature and do not have any phase change .
Thus , it can produce a great amount of energy .
For that reason , to find a suitable coolant will not be a problem because there is no difficulty to find water in earth .
Thirdly , people are worrying about the waste of nuclear power , because the waste of reactor is normally radioactive .
If we are not able to handle the wastes well , the nuclear pollution will trigger the catastrophe .
Nevertheless , SCWR could work out this problem .
The coolant for SCWR is supercritical water and the waste of water is still water as well .
Therefore , this waste are not radioactive and it is much safer compared with the wastes of previous of reactors .
Moreover , SCWR has built a system for water purification through supercritical oxidation .
This system is to convert the waste water into potable water .
Then the reactor can reuse this water as coolant again .
To sum up , the supercritical-water-cooled reactors solve general problems which the normal nuclear power reactors have .
Therefore , the SCWR is feasible and reliable .
The SCWR 's revival would benefit the whole population .
For the public , the problem of global warming and other environmental problems caused by emissions of fossil fuel will be eliminated .
Politically , the nuclear power will maintain their energy source independence and reduce the conflicts of energy possessing .
To engineers and scientists , the applications of nuclear reactors would encourage them to find more efficient way to generate energy from reactors and the improve the safety of reactors in case of any accidents  .
Generally speaking , the nuclear power will be the fuel for the future .
People will obtain safer cleaner and cheaper energy generated by nuclear power reactor .
We are now marching into a new era of nuclear age .
Generation IV of nuclear power is now undergoing development and research .
Very-high-temperature Reactor (VHTR) which is operated by open fuel cycle is one of the six concepts of Generation IV reactors .
It has an operating temperature of 1000 C and uses high pressure during reaction stages .
VHTR is one of the best substitutions for coal plants from a science perspective as it does not pollute the earth and it does not need to use as much fuel as other forms of energy .
The question of whether we should have nuclear powerplantst as an energy resource is controversial .
People stand against it as they havelittle knowledgea about the nuclear power plant .
Cost , safety and performance are three major aspectsofr opposition to this technology; nevertheless , there is still an unyielding need to support further research and development funding for VHTR .
People believe that it would be costly to start up a new nuclear industry .
It is true though .
According to Mansilla (2008) maximizing the system efficiency does not guarantee a minimum cost .
Still , in point of fact , nuclear power plants can reduce the expenditure in producing more energy in the long run .
compared to conventional plants , VHTR can bring out 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel .
Since that VHTR uses a lower amount of fuel to produce higher amounts of energy , it is much more economic than other power plants regardless of the start up cost , as the start-up cost can be compensated in the long run .
Needs for energy are neither going to decrease nor are sources of energy going to increase .
Therefore , when sources of conventional plants are severely depleted , its cost will soar up  and become uneconomical; on the other hand , VHTR uses half the amount of fuel to produce an equal amount of energy , hence it can last longer .
Safety of a nuclear plant is the issue that concerns the public the most .
The reactor core explosion at Chernobyl in Ukraine was a catastrophic failure .
It raised public's uncertainty about the safety of developing new nuclear power plants .
However , VHTR is being designed to avoid such circumstances .
VHTR is coated with a layer of graphite which can be used to slow down neutrons in order to control the nuclear chain reaction and it is covered with an ultra hard ceramic layer .
Furthermore , it uses helium , an inert gas as a coolant .
Therefore it can avoid any radioactive material from escaping if an accident happens .
Moreover , a back-up emergency core cooling system (ECCS) has been designed .
ECCS can remove excess heat and avoid damage to power plants in emergency situations , such as terrorism .
In addition , VHTR would be able to function without the need to reprocess plutonium waste .
This would be able to prevent the creation of nuclear power weapons as plutonium is an ingredient to produce advanced nuclear weapons .
People assume that VHTR has lower performance when compared to other kinds of Generation IV power sources .
According to research , VHTR is a thermal reactor which relies on moderators to slow down neutrons while Gas-cooled Fast Reactor , Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor and Lead-cooled Fast Reactor are relying on fast spectra .
This gives people a wrong assumption that VHTR  .
However , the performance of reactors also depends on operating pressure and temperature .
Researchers anticipate that VHTR's cycle efficiency could reach above 50% while comparing to Molten Salt Reactor , for instance , which could only reach around 44% to 50% .
Furthermore , VHTR is designed to efficiently produce both electricity and hydrogen at the same time .
In conclusion , the opposing reasons for not supporting further research and development for VHTR are arguable .
The initial cost for VHTR is high but it can be covered in the long run by its quantitative energy output .
Likewise , VHTR is being designed with adequate safety precautions to prevent a tragedy from happening .
It has better performance as well since it has high efficiency and both electricity and hydrogen as its reactive product .
Concepts of nuclear power plant in generation IV have shown substantial improvements in cost , safety and efficiency especially VHTR .
Consequently , more research and development funding should be given to VHTR .
SFR basically to use the sodium as coolant to produce nucincreasesrgy .
On the other hand , very-high-temperature reactor is working under a very high temperature environment (Very high temperature reactor , 2009) .
On cost , building a SFR is estimated at US$ 610 million , while the VHTR would cost US$ 610 millionU .S .
Department Of Energy Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee2002 .
While , the initial cost of constructing the VHTR is higher than the SFR .
In terms of running cost , VHTR is a more cost-effective reactor than the SFR .
With a high efficiency in transferring heat into power , the VHTR costs only US$1 to produce 1 kilogram hydrogen , which is much lower than SFRU .S .
Department Of Energy Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee2002 .
Therefore , in a long run , the VHTR is more economical in producing a large amount of energy .
theSome people also the useaofhe efficiena coolanthe SFR is about fifty percent at a temperature of 500 centigrade degree .
It is higher than the VHTR which is about forty percent at 500 centigrade degree (Very high tempcost wise reactor , 2009) .
However , it is not a fair comparison .
For the SFR 500 centigrade degree isr it is fifty percent .
However , for VHTR , the suitable working temperature is about 1500 centigrade degree .
At such a temperature , the efficiency of the VHTR is about 65 percent , which is much higher than the SFR (Very-High-Temperature-Gas-Cooled-Reactor-Systems , 2009) .
Under the same standard , we 
For the safety factor , which is the most important one , some people claim that the whole processing of SFR is degrees , even though the coolant is sodium .
As an engineer , we cannot simply assumedegreesth What we should do is to plan what should we do when bad things happen .
Ifdegreesipe of the cooling system is broken , the liquid sodium will leak out .
As we know , sodium itself is very active , and it can easily react with water and cause fire .
Besides thatdegreesan also do harm to the human beings .
But for VHTR , the coolant is helium gas , which is a kind of inert gasesdo any harm to the environment and human beingsthat thebviously , choosing an inert gas as the coolant is much safer than choosing an active element as a coolant .
(Butler , 2004)
leaksTo conclude , the initial cost of VHTR is higher , but in a long run its cost is much lower .
Besides that , its efficiency is much higher under its rated working temperature .
In addition , the coolant of the VHTR is much safer than the SFR .
By considering the cost , efwe should do safety factors , we can judge that the very high temperature is a better choice in a long run .
thetheatheReference:
First of all , opponents of VHTR doubt whether it is cost-effective and achievable .
As they state , in order to generate as much electricity as it is expensed in the U .S . every day , almost 400 nuclearspeedylants should be constructed and utilized .
Howrise inoday only about 410 nuclear power plants are the world .
The great discrepancy as if draws the end of VHTR's devehas beenpment already .
In fact , this analysis is dthe utilizationis-illustration .
One fact need to be clarified is that the opponents misuse the capacity of the chas begun tional plants rather than that of VHTR .
Scientists suggest that the new generation reactor can seeze 5conceptelectricity from the same amount of fuels compared with the conventional plants .
By applying this figure , the number of plants calculated by the opponents can significantly be minimized .
Moreover , the opponents misunderstood the distribution of eshow thatrthe VHTRower generion .
No matter how excellent one method is , the world's electric power generation can never simply depend on one method .
Instead , this should always be a combination of complex methods .
In that case , whether VHTR can fulfil one country or even the global needs of electricity is unnecessary to be concerned .
As long as the concept is feasible and is better than the old ones , VHTR deserves for further research and thus can bring more advantage to the society .
aboutleaksitsTo sum up , the opponents' opinioconcernedppose VHTR are not valid .
It is cost-effective , feasible , and safe .
In that case , we can safely draw the conclusion that VHTR is worth of further research and development .
We have confidence that it can bring great advantage to the world when technology is mature .
In order to prevent such accidents happening , psychology is suggested to be inwereduced to the design process .
Psychology studies the human mind and behavior .
For example , cognitive psychology focuses on ways tto dieprove memto be injured how to increase deciwas investigated intoaccuracy and social psychology are interested in the impact that social environment and interaction has on attitudes and behaviors (Kendra , V .W .
Psychologyrodseories , Guild to psychology , from {http://psychology .about .com/od/psychology101/u/psychology-theories .htm}[connected: http://psychology .about .com/od/psychology101/u/psychology-theories .htm] ) .
As human action plays a major role in the design process , psychology can designed it on papers .
For instance , if we introduc
According to Bernhard Wilpert(2007)from happeningcing psycholoshouldard control of safety--- in the beginning , forecast human errors that will trigger accidents and take measures to avoid these errors .
Maybe this method will do some work .
However , does it work every time ?
This only works isn the problem can be foretold , whereas many technical installations are becoming more and more comrent ones .
The more complex the process is , more difficult to predict the problems .
In a new and complex technical installation , many problems are unexpected .
Sometimes only after the process is impwould have communicatede problems will be known .
The six designs in the new generation reactors also need to do many tests before they become prototypes .
will the problems be known .Psychology studies human mind and behavior .
Introducing psychology in the design process only makes a difference in human behavior , but many industrial accidents are not only caused by a single human error .
For example , the "Prestige" oil spilling was mainly caused by the rainstorm .
Prestige carried 77 ,000 tons of heavy fuel oil and was traveling on the sea near Spanish when it met rainstorm .
One of the 12 gasoline boxes exploded , but the Spanish Authorities refused the tanker to anchor in their bay .
Finally ther s59429_1043815 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://www .xooob .com/359429_1043815 .html] ) .
Manthe moreher industrial systems are much more complex and many factors can influence the system .
Psychology only can deal with human error , not other factors .
the othercaused an oil spillImprovement of communication , teaching of social and human relation skills and methods of dealing with problems are applications of psychology .
So the use of psychology during the design process can prevent some accidents .
It cannot prevenspille accidents , as accidents are not only caused by human errors and as for some new designs , they must be tried to see wSpainll the problems happened .
they must attempt to assess where problems are likely to occur .Refrences:
Firthe 28th oof Januaryreparation of psychology in design processes could have saved the Space Shuttle Challenger .
Actually , from the time it was first scheduled to lift off on January 22nd , to the when it was finally launched on January 28th , liftoff was delayed several times for various reasons .
Obviously , the preparation for this project was not good at all .
Arguers may say that no matter how good the preparation was , there were still some unpredictable factors that might lead the mission to failure .
Well , it is true that the errors cannot be prevented completely; nevertheless , we should try our best to reduce theoccuro the least level that we can accept .
Apparently , the condition of Challenger was not what we can accept as safe .
Furthermore , if the preparation was well done and the "O-ring" problem was fixed during the process , Challenger could have been saved .
Secondly , should the decision-making system be made better , the tragedy could have been avoided .
Faced with the choice of whether to put off the mission for safety or to carry on the misn at risk to save money , the oon thei28th of Januarythe latter one , which was a big mistake .
Furthermore , they also had policy failure on competitive bidding for manufacturing company and defects of supervision system .
All these factors contributed to the unreliability of the safety of the mission .
Although NASA have to face the pressure from the public and the political , they should aware the consequences of the failure , which might make the situation evone thatorse .
If the highest levels of NASA had made The Challengeron more objectively and scientifically with the help of psychology in design , putting the mission off like before , the disaster could have been prevented .
Finally , thadmunication between the NASA beenls and engineers was not good enough .
The NASA officials seemed neither to have been warned adequately of the danger of launch in cold weather , nor be told emphatically enough the need of redesigning the O-rings .
Besides , the warning of air blast from a Boeing 757 ain terms ofcraft was also ignored before the liftocompaniesmunication diin thenot flow effectively , which indirectly led to the tragedy's happening .
I know that the NASA officials were too busy to lihad toen to the voices before the launch; howfrom politiciansod communicatihave been aware ofstem had been established before thad time to listen to the voices and therefore probably prevented the disaster .
As discussed above , the Challenger disaster's causes lie not only on the technical factors , but also on the human factors .
In my opinion , the root cause is the human factoa launch wrong decision made by the officials .
Though it was indirect cause , its influence is so large that it was morean airportant than the technical factor .
Psychology in design processes , whose significance has been showed in this accident , should be paid moretragedyn to in the future engineering design .
Only in this way , can the safety of projects be improved efficiently and guaranteed .
There has been a debate between two Generation Four reactors , the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and the Supercritical Water Reactor (SCWR) , as to which  reactor has superior performance .
On the one hand , engineers use the most advanced technology and concept to design the VHTR .
On the other hand , the technology applied on the SCWR is developed from conventional technology of an older type of nuclear reactor , Light Water Reactor (LWR) .
The supporters of VHTR attack SCWR for its "obsolete" technology and its incapability of generating Hydrogen as a co-product of electrcity .
Nevertheless , I believe the most practical thing ends up being the most useful thing .
In my opinion , the SCWR outmatches the VHTR at both performace and cost .
When people compare the two types of reactors , they tend to focus on the temperature at which reactors operates .
Then , they discover that the VHTR is operating at a temperature level which is almost twice as that of the SCWR .
As a result , a misleading conception arises , which is that the VHTR works much more efficiently than the SCWR  .
Indeed , temperature is an indicator of how efficient the reactor is .
However , it is by no means the only indicator .
According to Prof Mirko Ascic's scientific journal (ASCIC , 2005) , the energy of neutrons in the reactor is the dominant factor that affects the process of converting heat to electricity .
The fact is the SCWR has about four times as many neutrons in the energy range above 6 .2 MeV and about 16 times as many neutrons below 0 .1 eV .
These two energy states of neutrons are closely related the fusion of two fuels , U235 and Np237 .
As a result , The SCWR has a higher performace up to 4 percent compared to the VHTR .
For people who are obssesed with the VHTR , one main reason would be it allows an easy way to generate a clean natural energy , Hydrogen .
It is unnecessary to describe how huge the amount of fossil fuel the world consumes everyday and the influence of burning the fuel on the whole environment .
Scientists have been searching the most suitable and the most economical surrogate for fossil fuel for decades .
And reactors with super-high operating temperature seems to be the ultimate answer .
However , in my opinion , reactors that can generate Hydrogen are just "gimmicks" .
After all , electricity is also a perfect energy which has no side-effect on the environment .
Furthermore ,  using Hydrogen , which has just begun developing and is far from matured , electricity has been with human beings for over a hundred years .
The technology of electricity can be found everywhere  and big automobile manufacturers have started to discuss the possibility of replacing fossil-fuel-powered cars with electricity-powered ones .
Thus , the critical question arises .
How to produce electricity economically ?
In my opinion , the SCWR is the answer .
The SCWR is built  of low-cost electricity .
In addition , the two technologies needed to build the SCWR are already at hand , which are widely-employed  by current Generatioon Three LWRs .
Unlike the VHTR which uses rare gas Helium as a coolant , the SCWR simply uses water to cool down the system .
As a result , the SCWR costs much less to build and greatly simplifies the nuclear plant .
In conclusion , the most advanced technologies may not be suitable in a certain condition .
The SCWR has proven itself to be more capable at both high performance and low cost .
In this sense , the SCWR is a better nuclear reactor compared to the VHTR for our future .
Competitive costs and financial risks of nuclear energy systems are constantly being compared .
In the case of the Very-high-temperature reactors , the cost of running the plant is lower when compared to Molten salt reactors .
The efficiency of the VHTR is also >50% as compared to conventional reactors .
VHTR produces hydrogen as a byproduct , thus increasing the chances of utilizing the reactors for other energy sources .
There is no doubt that the world is moving towards nuclear energy development in the future 20 years from now .
The current race to develop the best reactor for use is still questionable as all the reactors have their own strengths and weaknesses .
However , with the current VHTR's achievable research goals , it will probably be the generation IV reactor to lead the pack in years to come .
Using nuclear processes to produce energy is not a new concept .
Since the first poweractor was built in the Sovietfornion in 1954 , there are consumedear power plants in operation at present .
(IAEA) Meanwhile , nuclear power has not risen to be a top choice because of worries about leakages of radioactive substances from the plants .
For example , the explosion of reactor 4 in the Chernobyl power plant resulted in 237 deaths due to radiation .
In another accident in the Three Mile Island in the US , 140 thoand people living within a five mile radius of the plant evacuated after the meltdown of a cooling system .
Moreover , in this post 911 era , many worry about nuclear power plants becoming the terrorists' targets .
Acknowl(Pachauri , 2007) nuclear power to meet the world's energy appetite , several countries have formed the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) to research on the possible nuclear technologies and to mitigate the risks posed by them .
Two of the six short listed systems are the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) and Super Critical Water Reactor (SCWR) .
Both of these systems , especially the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor , promises higher efficiency , lower operational cost and enhanced safety measures over current generation of reactors .
In the SCWR , liquid water , which is used as coolant for the 650oC reactor core , is pressurized to 2500 times the atmospheric pressure , to the supercritical state .
Firstly , at this high pressure , water has a larger range of operating temperature .
Thus , the reactor can function safely within a greater range of temperature .
Secondly , supercritical water also has the highest heat capacity .
This means that water can absorb a higher amount of energy for the same volume of water , thus having a better rate of heat transfer compared to the current generation of reactors such as Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) and Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) .
Better heat transfer also allows the coolant to have a slower flow rate of the coolant , thus saving cost by using of smaller pumps and piping .
Thirdly , water does not change phase within the coolant cycle due to its increased boiling point .
This would allow the coolant to have a laminar flow , increasing the efficiency of the coolant .
Hence , the plant would have 45% thermal cycle efficiency .
On the other hand , SFR uses molten sodium as a coolant for the 510oC reactor core .
As compared with the SCWR , the sodium can be kept at normal atmospheric pressure .
This eliminates thepresent (IAEA , date ?
) .ng from having to maintain a pressurized coolant .
Also , the reactor core is at a lower temperature , thus relatively easier to manage .
Hence , these results in a comparable 45% thermal efficiency , in spite being a newer technology compared to water .
Finally , they are highly sustainable due to their closed loop cycle , having an added advantage of actinide management and fuel consumption of 99% .
Moving on to the cost , SCWR do offer much savings .
As it is developed based on current reactors , such as Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) , a lot of research could be done on existing facilities .
For example , research focusing on accident management could be done at some of the out of commissiofacilities , without building up a prototype from ground .
Also , research on water chemistry that was done for BWR could be capitalised for SCWR .
Consequently , the research could be focus towards developing irradiation resistant materials to be used for the reactor .
Conversely , SFR also utilises expertises from existing reactors such as BOR-60 , JOYO , Phenix , and BN-600 in the US and Japan .
Like the SCWR , SFR would require several areas of research to make it suitable for development .
Researches into fuel cycle and physically stronger and more radiation resistant structural materials would minimise the operating costs with improved operations and performance .
Also , with support of countries such as Japan , France , and Russia , the cost of research is shared .
In fact , the SFR system is the most technology developed system of the 6 Generation IV systems .
(SFR) Furthermore , it is estimated to be deployable by 2020 .
the supportResearchRegarding the safety aspects of the nuclear reactors , the GIF has set high targets Comparedcto .
For the SCWR , the use of water at the supercritical state allows the coolant to be functional and effective at a right range of temperature .
The absence of a change in phase would also make the reacand thus safer to operate .
All this is possible with the highly pressurized water .
Meanwhile , SFR does not have the problems regarding maintaining the coolant at high pressure .
Instead , the challenge lies in keeping the sodium coolant from direct contact with air .
As sodium is highly reactive , it reacts violently with the airdoesrom the environment .
This difficulty is overcome by using a two-step cooling solution , whereby sodium is used to cool the core , and a secondary coolant , such as water , is used to cool the sodium .
Also , SFR has the added advantage of closed fuel cycle , which helps in the management of highly radioactive actinides .
This wfocusedprevent the proliferation of the nuclear waste .
Finally , nuclear-enriched materials being kept at high temperature would prevent them from being stolen and use as weapons by terrorists .
usedkeeping nuclear-enriched materials at a In conclusion , SFR stands as a more viable option to be the solution to the world's energy crisis .
Though the deployment cost is high at present , the burden will be shared by the many countries support the technology .
Also , the performance of SFR is ensured based on the findings of the various researches conducted .
Finally , well-planned safety measures and actinides management would ensure the SFR would function safely within its use .

Nuclear accidents like the Three Mile incident and the Chernobyl disaster left a bad aftertaste in the eyes of the public .
Furthermore , the constant threat of nuclear terrorists and the issue of radiation leakage made nuclear energy even more unpopular .
However , as mankind evolves , nuclear energy could possibly be making a comeback .
Facing the issues of rising oil prices and the long term availability of fossil fuels , governments are now rethinking their national energy strategies .
One of these strategies is harnessing nuclear energy .
Going nuclear would provide the growing economies with a constant and steady supply of energy to sustain their economic development .
Furthermore , it also addresses the issue on global warming as it does not produce greenhouse emissions which could further aggravate the situation .
Though the public may be concerned about the safety of operating a nuclear plant , we should continue to develop nuclear energy as its economic and environmental benefits outweighs its risks .
Ever grumbled every morning about the exhaust fumes , produced by fuel vehicles ?
The harmful fumes are part of the cause of the hole in the ozone layerlayer ( Jacob , n .d) mentioned that 20% of greenhouse gas is caused by automobiles , in U .S .
In order to resolve this situation , researchers and developers are trying to come up with cleaner and greener ideas .
Hence the birth of the electric car , which Marshall (n .d .) explained that its automobile fully powered by electricity only , which reduces the harmful emissions by no emissions , which results in a cleaner and greener environment .
Oppositions agree that the design the electric car is safe enough for driving .
However many commuters are concerned about design nature of the electric car , which includes mainly on safety concerns , and also others like cost and performance .
In recent years , despite the contentious debate of using nuclear power to meet our ever-increasing energy needs , the world has started to consider nuclear energy as a future fuel source which is believed to  more environmentally friendly  compared to fossil fuels .
Hence , late in 2002 , Generation IV International Forum (GIF)  announced the selection of six reactor technologies which they believe represented the future shape of nuclear energy .
These were selected on the basis of being a clean , safe and cost-effective means of meeting increased energy demands on a sustainable basis , while being resistant to usage of materials for weapons proliferation and secure from terrorist attacks (US Department of Energy , 2009) .
In this essay , I would present my argument to support further research and development funding for the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) as opposed to the Supercritical Water Reactor (SCWR) , from the perspectives of security , performance and costs .
Firstly , proponents of SCWR claimed that the very high-temperature concept of VHTR reactor can be detrimental to safety if a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) occurs .
This means that if there is a break in the pipe , coolant will be lost and cause the reactor to heat up very quickly , resulting in the release of toxic gases and fission products into the environment .
However , this may be an unfounded concern in years to come when we consider the fact that the Korean and the US governments have worked for the past three years on developing and validating advanced computational methods for simulating LOCA in a VHTR , in an attempt to prevent such an accident from happening (Chang , 2006) .
Proponents of SCWR also claimed that VHTR produced high volume of nuclear waste which can be a potential source of nuclear weapons for the terrorists .
However , this claim may not be entirely valid because the waste produced , though in high volume , is considered low-level (low in radioactive content) .
The fuel pebbles used in VHTR are also very 'durable' in the sense that it is very difficult to extract the trapped fission products inside which render it a less favorable choice as a nuclear weapon .
In addition , it is important to note that VHTR is a much safer reactor also because the radioactive content of the fuel is contained even if the reactor reaches temperatures in excess of 500 C more than the normal operating temperature (Norman , 2007) .
VHTR also adopts a passive safety feature in which in the event of an emergency ,t does not require operator's action to shutdown the plant safely .
Furthermore , the fuel pebbles are coated with an impermeable layer of silicon carbide which would not rupture easily , and the plant is also equipped with a reaction vessel that is free of oxygen .
Both features prevent the occurrence of a fire .The concernn of graphite being an easily-combustible material is also addressed by experimental results that have shown that graphite can be heated to 'white-hot' temperatures (~1650 C) without incurring ignition or self-sustained combustion (Lee , 2009) .
Next , VHTR has better performance than SCWR in three main aspects .
Firstly , in terms of burn-up rate of the fuel , for VHTR , it is possible to burn up to 65% (US Department of Energy , 2008)of its initial fuel as compared to SCWR which is capable of only burning up to 45% of the initial fuel (Buongiorno , 2003) .
Secondly , due to the high operating temperature of VHTR , the large amount of heat produced can be used for many purposes , ranging from providing domestic energy supplies and refining crude oil , to providing energy for hydrogen production .
This is unlike SCWR , which can only produce electricity .
Hydrogen production ,  an energy--intensive process , is important as hydrogen holds enormous promise as a power source for the future generation .
This is also one point that makes VHTR a more economical plant than SCWR .
Lastly , VHTR uses graphite as the moderator , which according to nuclear experts , is an excellent moderator as compared to water which is used in SCWR (Cogeneration Technologies , 2002) .
VHTR also uses helium gas as the coolant which is an inert gas .
Hence , the plant can be operated at high temperatures without having to worry about corrosion of the plant pipes .
This is different from SCWR , which uses water as the coolant and hence there is a possibility of the pipe's corrosion by water .
Lastly , proponents of SCWR claim that the construction cost of VHTR plant is much higher than SCWR due to its high operating temperature .
This would not be a valid claim if we consider the fact that VHTR is built to operate at a long life span of 60 years (Lee , 2005) which is much longer than that of VHTR .
Hence , this makes it justifiable to spend more money to build VHTR plant .
Some people claim that Gen II and Gen III reactors are safe enough for operation .
Despite the accident in Chernobly , Ukraine , which was mainly caused by man-made operating errors (Chernobly accident , 2009) , no major accident occurred in the past two decades .
Compared with funding the Gen IV reactors , they think that governments should rather use the money to reinforce the safety of currently operating reactors .
However , malwastions that had the risk of being disastrous happened from time to time .
For instance , in 2006 , part of the Forsmark-1 reactor in Sweden failed to startlbecameesulting in a catastrophic meltdown .
A Belgian reactor experienced a similar problem in the preceding year (Nuclear reactor safety , 2007) .
Such incidents imply that the potential risks of the Gen II and Gen III reactors cannot be ignored .
The Gen IV reactors can significantly change this risky situation .
Take the VHTR reactor as an example .
In this new design , the fuel pellets used in nuclear reaction are fused in graphite pebbles and coated with ceramic layers which effectively prevent the radioactive materials from leaking .
In other words , no radioactive damage will occur even if there is a meltdown (Butler , 2004) .
Therefore , the Gen IV reactors are more reliable than the previous generations .
In order to achieve safer operating environment , government should fund the development of the Gen IV .
Opponents also argue that the Gen II and Gen III reactors have already achieved excellent performance , so it is not necessary to develop the new generation .
As a successful example , France obtains over 75% of its electricity has occurredlear power .
The low cost aRather than fund r energy has made France the largest electricity exportergh the result appears favorable , this performance is only based on the short term effects .
Other factors should be included for a more objective estimation .
Gen II and III reactors produce high level radioactive wastes at a rate of 12000 tons per year around the globe .
These wastes take thousands of years to lose their activity , thus they are not environmentally friendly in the long term (Radioactive wastes , 2001) .
Moreover , the storage of the wastes is both money and labor consuming .
A repository built to store the wastes could cost up to $90 billion , like that in Yucca Mountain , US (Tetreault , 2008) .
However , these problems can be solved using the Gen IV technology .
In one of its designs , VHTR , the used fuel pebbles can be automatically selected , and those with some life left are recycled (Butler , 2004) .
This process reduces the amount as well as the radioactive level of the final wastes .
Therefore , it will lead to more sustainable performance in the long term .
This advantage proves that it is worthwhile to fund the Gen IV technology .
Opponents also suggest that Gen IV reactors have no commercial benefits .
For example , building and testing a Gen IV nuclear plant costs about US$1 billion , which is a considerable investment (Butler , 2004) .
On the other hand , the cost of generating electricity from current nuclear reactors is already quite low (2 .3 pence per kilowatt) , which is competitive with other major sources (The cost of generating electricity , 2004) .
As a result , it is not worth spending additional money funding the new designs .
However , a typical Gen II reactor can only operate at an efficiency of around 30% , meaning that a large proportion of the energy is wasted .
But with the tecactivity .
Thus IV reactors , the efficiency can be improved to 45% to 50% due to extremely high operating temperature (1000 degrees Celsius) (Daniels , 2007) .
Numerically , this increase in efficiency can be reflected by a cut in costs of approximately 30% for the same amount of electricity generated .
Moreover , the heat produced by the Gen IV reactors can be used to produce hydrogen from water or supplied to petrochemical industry (The very-high-temperature reactor , n .d .) .
The cogeneration and applications make the total efficiency even higher , thus further reduce the operating costs .
From these statistics , it is obvious that Gen IV reactors are more profitable in the long run compared to the old generations .
Thus , Gen IV reactors should be funded by the government .
reducingthe petrochemicalThough the Generation II and III reactors have been maturely adopted in electricity generation , the drawbacks in their designs largely confine the potential power of nuclear energy .
In order to optimize its power to meet the increasing demand of electricity as well as to maintain long term sustainability , governments should fund the Generation Icomparableinstead of the old generations .
generation onesReferences
One of the most common viewpoints against nuclear power is the fact that nuclear facilities are easily subjected to catastrophic attacks by terrorists (Passero ,they006a) .
The public is worried that nuclear waste or nucleacrisis , rials during transportation or storage could be stolen or sabotaged by terrorists .
However , this is hardly possible in real life .
Nuclear waste or nuclear materials meant for energy production is not suitable to be used as nuclear weapons (European Physical Society , 2007) .
Furthermore , newer generation of reactors , like the VHTR , produces much less nuclear waste at terror-proof facilities (Butler , 2004) .
Therefore , with these improvements in technologfuture .
Hencee to minimize or even eliminate these security issues facing nuclear generators .
Hence more research and development should be put in to nuclear reactors .
The second issue that is of concern is the environmental effects brought about by nuclear power plants .
Concern has been raised about the nuclear waste being produced by nuclear power plants , and also the health effects on the workcould be stolen or sabotaged by terrorists during transportation or storage  .d from nuclear facilities or nuclear waste .
Furthermore , carbon dioxide , Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and radioactive isotopes are being releaind into the air and water by nuclear power plants (Passero , 2006a)the newerrocessing of nuclear waste is also not effective as it is harder to process compared to uranium fuel (Passero , 2006b) .
All the factors mentioned above maybe true and hence put nuclear power plants in a bad light .
However , it has aconcerningen proven that reprocessing nuclear waste cuts down greatly on the radiintove life of the waste .
(European Physical Society , 2007) .
Hence , problems such as nuclear waste is harder to process can be solved with sufficient funding for research and development of nuclear power plants .
At the same time , research can also be done to solve the problem of greenhouse gases and radioactive isotopes emission .
Therefore , it would be wise to spend more money on research to solve these problems in order to produce nuclear power .
The third factor that is of concern is costs .
It has been a known fact that nuclear power plants require high-start up costs .
Funds have to be inserted so as to support the high technology machinery and also create a safe environment with proper safety guidelines protecting the reactors .
addition , leaksing licenses have to be bought from the government , so as to ensure safe operation of the nuclear power plants .
Furthermore , in order to fully support our energy needs , a lot more nuclear reactors have to be built around the world (Butler , 2004) .
However , once the basis infrastructure has been laid down , nuclear power turns in to a readily accessible and cheaply rtrue ,erable source of energy (European Physical Society , 2007) .
Hence , it would be able to last us a much longer time compared to fossil fuels .
Furthermore , with 4 of the 6 Generators-IV reactors being able to use reprocessed radioactive waste (Butler , 2004) , it wprocess , no surprise if nuclear power is able to last much longer than we expected .
Hence , it would be logical to support the research and development of nuclear power plants .
expectFinally , the last issue would be on the performanise nuclear reactors .
It is widely known fact that nuclear power is able to produce much more energy compared to traditional fossil fuels .
This is simply due to the nature of nuclear fuel being to produce muchforgy .
Hence , it would be unfair to compare the nuclear generators with traditional powerts .
In this case , comparison should be done between nuclear power plants and those of other renewable sources .
Similarly , nuclear power plants are superior as we can produce nuclear energy constantly whereas basic sources are less predictable .
Furthermore , comparing thintoeration-IV reactors with older nuclear reactors , the new reactors are much more efficient , some of them like the VHTR produce hydrogen at the same time (Butler , 2004) .
Therefore , support should be given to develop nuclear power .
VHTR ,  producethem ,efficient .
SomeIn conclusion , there is no one source of energy that will fulfill the needs of furta widelynerations .
Nuclear power will make an important contribution to our future energy needs together with other alternatives (European Physical Society ,2007) Hence , in order to produce nuclear energy more effectively and cleanly we must put in more support and funding for the research and development of nuclear reactors .

The most awaited Tata's Nana car was finally unveiled at the Auto Expo 2008 .
It was a very proud moment for Tata as it was the cheapest car compared to all other cars found around the world (Massey , 2008) .
The target of Tata was to make a car which most of the citizens in India can afford but it came out to be a big talk among car dealers too .
They were very much surprised by the unique design and  amazed by the stunning price .
It just costs about one lakh (Rs 100 ,000) which is US2500 dollars (Darukhanawala , 2009) .
Although it was a surprising package , both positive and negative arguments about the car were presented at the Auto Expo 2008 .
The main issue discussed was  safety .
There were mixed reviews concerning the safety of TaTa's Nano among car dealers .
The big question raised was whether Tata's Nano was safe to drive on normal roads  .
So , my stand as a reviewer is that Tata's Nano lacks safety .
There are three important reasons for my stand .
Firstly , the most important point is that it is not able to withstand high loads .
Tata claims that despite its low price and compactness , the Nano car is able to meet all Indian safety regulations .
They prove that it is able to withstand a crash on a solid steel bar at a speed of 48 km/h .
Besides that , Hichman , designer of Nano , explains that their target was to construct a modular body where structure was added to the base of the vehicle so that Nano will be able to meet the European safety regulations (Schedel , 2009) .
Moreover , a test was even done at Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA) in the UK to prove their claim .
Although much supporting evidence was given by Tata , it is said that Tata made critical modifications specifically to meet the European and Indian test norms .
So , the vehicle which is being sold in the market may not be the same as the one which went through the tests .
Besides that , Americans feel that the test was not sufficient as it was only done at a speed of 48km/h .
Many vehicles travel at much higher speeds especially on highways (Jenks , 2009) .
Another thing to be considered is the warranty for the car .
Tata  provides warranty for a period of only 18 months , which is much less compared to the other cars .
This implies that cheap material could be used not only in the interior but also in the exterior structure .
So , it is very clear that Tata's Nano has poor crash resistance .
Secondly , the car lacks safety features .
It is a big surprise that Tata has just neglected some of the most important features like the airbag , parking sensors , fog lamps and traction controls in its design .
Many who bought the car are complaining especially about the safety aspects of the car .
For example , a citizen of India  stated that there are not enough safety features and that the Nano is a very bad design (Gangadharan , 2008) .
The designer of Nano claims that even designs such as a car without lights and doors were considered during the design process .
This really makes everyone feel that Tata's main intention was to make a cheap car and the safety issue was not a big concern for them .
But their argument was that these features were not a necessity on Indian roads (Massey , 2008) .
However , Tata should realise that the car is not only going to be sold in India but  marketed in other countries .
So , if other countries are not willing to purchase the car because  it lacks safety features , then it will be a big loss for Tata .
Thirdly , there are some flaws in the design .
Only one side mirror is found in the design (Daily Mail , 2008) .
Tata should understand that it is not safe with only one side mirror .
Drivers will definitely have difficulties spotting the vehicles which are coming from behind and this may even lead to accidents .
Besides that , the wheels look small .
It seems that it lacks stability .
So , while travelling on slopes or heavy traffic , it could be dangerous .
There are also complains that the car is not comfortable .
The most important thing to be considered when designing a car is comfort .
The more comfortable the driver feels , the more easy he will find it to drive the car .
Thus the journey will be smooth and accidents could be prevented .
So , clearly it seems that there are some features that need to be changed .
To conclude , Tata's Nano needs modification .
It would be better if tougher materials could be used , more safety features  added and some required changes  done to the current design .
These will really improve the safety aspect of the car .
Tata may argue that these will increase the price of the car .
But I strongly feel that those who want to purchase the car will not mind paying a little more if it is going to provide a safer ride on the roads .
A nuclear reactor is an apparatus that produces nuclear energy by performing nuclear reactions ("Nuclear reactor ," 2009) .
The reactor was invented because of the increasing demand for an alternative source of energy that could substitute crude oil .
Nuclear reactors can produce cleaner and higher energy than  crude oil .
However , there is always an intention for the public to reject the idea of using nuclear reactors .
The public is concerned about safety in the operation of nuclear reactors .
The disaster that happened at Chernobyl , Ukraine , in 1986 is one reason of the public's anxiety .
In the disaster , the nuclear reactor exploded and spread the radioactive debris across Europe .
As a result , thirty one people were killed in  disaster (Butler , 2004) .
Nonetheless , a VHTR (Very-High- Temperature Reactor) , which is one of the generation IV reactor concepts , has the technology to prevent the disaster by using helium as its coolant and by producing waste with low radioactivity .
The VHTR can also produce both electricity and hydrogen through a very efficient process , so the cost of running a VHTR will not be as high as other reactors in the long run .
Therefore , the development of the VHTR should be supported .
First of all , opponents argue that helium , which is used as a coolant in the VHTR , could explode because of the high operating temperature and pressure of the reactor .
This argument may arise because of the lack of knowledge about  helium .
Helium is , in fact , an inert gas .
Therefore , helium will not react with any material due to its stability (Youchison , 1987) .
This is also why helium is widely used to fill blimps .
In addition , helium will not become radioactive as other coolants do when they are exposed to radioactive radiation .
Thus , helium is safe to use as a coolant in VHTR .
Secondly , opponents claim that an explosion may occur because the materials used for constructing the reactor are not strong enough to overcome both high operating temperature and pressure .
They argue that currently there is no existing material that can maintain the high operating temperature and pressure of the VHTR .
This is indeed true .
However , the ongoing HTTR (High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor) project in Japan gives us a clue that it is not impossible to develop a new strong material in the future .
Currently the HTTR has successfully overcome up to 950oC (The U .S . DOE , 2002) .
In other words , we already have materials that can stand 950oC .
The VHTR operating temperature is more or less 1000oC .
Thus , it is not impossible to find a new material that can stand 50oC more .
Thirdly , critics argue that the nuclear reactors are producing radioactive waste and this waste can harm the environment around the reactors .
It is true that the waste that contains high radioactive material , such as , plutonium , can affect the environment severely .
However , the waste of the VHTR is less radioactive than the other reactors .
The VHTR has high thermal efficiency and high fuel burn up .
This is why the concentration of the heavy metal radioactive matter in the VHTR waste is relatively low .
The waste of the VHTR will then go to a repository after being reprocessed and meeting the certain acceptance criteria (Shropshire , 2004) .
In addition , the operation of the VHTR does not depend on  plutonium reprocessing , which is a controversial issue (Butler , 2004) .
Thus , the VHTR waste is much safer than that of the existing nuclear reactors .
Lastly , opponents claim that the cost of building a nuclear reactor is very high .
They say that the money that the government spends on building the reactor can be used for other purchases .
This is indeed true .
However , , the cost of building a VHTR is in fact not as high as the other generation IV reactors .
The total cost of building a VHTR is about US$670 M . It is much lower than the cost of building a Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor , the next more expensive reactor , which is about US$ 870 M . Moreover , due to its high operating temperature (1000oC) , the VHTR can operate with a high efficiency to produce electricity .
Data show that the percent efficiency of the VHTR is more than 50 percent while other generation IV reactors range from 30 to 50 percent (The U .S . DOE , 2002) .
This means that the government will spend less money on fuel in the VHTR compared to the other generation IV reactors .
In addition , the hydrogen that is produced by the VHTR can be used in fuel cells .
Thus , by using this hydrogen , the government can reduce the cost of importing oil .
Therefore , in the long run , it is profitable to build the VHTR because it can produce both electricity and hydrogen through a very efficient process .
To conclude , in spite of claims that nuclear reactors are dangerous and costly , the VHTR with its improved design , can overcome these issues .
The VHTR can produce electricity and hydrogen efficiently in a much safer way without producing hazardous waste .
Hence , the development of the VHTR should be supported .
Mention nuclear power and the general consensus are fear and rejection , and Chernobyl comes to  mind .
Dirty power , they will say , and it is not worth the risk , despite ironically being much cleaner and powerful than the current fossil fuel-guzzling power plants .
However with the formation of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and its six new reactor designs , it is hoped that nuclear power can be tapped upon with full consent of the public .
These reactors , still in the designing and testing phase , excel in areas of sustainability , safety , economics and proliferation resistance (Bouchard and Bennett ,2008) , all which are specially intended to address all issues and challenges that nuclear power faces in a world combating the production of greenhouse gases , but in the safest possible way .
Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) emerges from the six as one of the most promising and is currently being heavily researched on .
But is it worth the funds and efforts when safety concerns are still present and worse , unaddressed ?
Or is the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) design a better option ?
For its performance level , the operating core temperatures of the reactor is capable of reaching  an almighty peak of  1000 (Chapin , et al 2004) , figures that will not only raise questions about its viability as well as the safety measures in place for such a high amount of energy , since temperature is directly proportional to the energy level of a closed system .
And because of the heights in the Celsius scale , the materials used in the reactor cannot be of regular quality , much less inferior .
The use of high temperature creates an extremely volatile and sensitive situation which , on the one hand raises output efficiency (OECD Nuclear Energy Agency , 2000) , but also requires a precise state-of-the-art monitoring system that further increases the production prices .
Much effort will be needed to reassure the public about the operation of the nuclear plant if it is to be commissioned .
The six new reactors  mainly differ only in their choice of coolant used in the system .
VHTR , being a descendant of the Generation II gas-cooled reactor , uses helium gas .
While a tried-and-tested choice , it is puzzling as there are better coolants proposed among the new designs and yet not favoured .
Helium gas is abundant on the Sun's atmosphere but only at trace levels on the Earth's surface (AIR LIQUIDE , 2009) .
Furthermore its common extraction is from fossil fuels , so one can imagine our source of helium when the oil wells eventually run dry .
In addition , helium is not the only coolant that is chemically inert with the fuel; molten lead is another viable option and is plentiful on the Earth's crust .
Last  but not least , gaseous coolants have low thermal transfer properties , hence requiring an intermediate heat exchange with a larger surface area (Chapin , et al 2004) .
From the performance requirements , it becomes apparent that VHTR will eventually be a massive power plant , an outcome that is not favourable for developing countries which are in need of enhanced energy output for economic growth .
LFR on the other hand , is more suitable .
The relatively smaller scale of operation and hence energy output , may be inferior compared to VHTR , but it is not feasible and unsafe for a large nuclear plant in a developing country where security and social unrest are issues .
LFR is a more portable option , thus more resistant against terrorism and weapon conversion since it is too stable to become a destructive tool  .
Maintenance costs for VHTR will also be a tight spot for a growing nation , an area of concern which can be resolved by the use of LFR , which requires refueling once every 20 years .
Even the cost of coolant is different; every 100g of helium (Elert , 2007) can fetch around the same price as 500g of lead (MetalPrices .com , 2009) .
The system core temperatures of LFR can reach up to 500 (Idaho National Laboratory , 2005) , almost 50% lower than that of VHTR and present significant differences in the operations of the plants .
Even though thermal efficiency of LFR is lower , 43% compared to up to 50% for VHTR (OECD Nuclear Energy Agency , 2000) , it is offset by offering a higher likelihood of reassurance to the public .
The use of low temperature means LFR can actually be built using the current technology , though some improvements may be needed .
Molten lead , compared to helium , is a superior and cheaper heat transfer medium , hence increasing the portability of the power plant by reducing the need for a large intermediate heat exchanger .
In conclusion , LFR may not be as proficient in energy production when compared to VHTR , but it addresses critical issues that VHTR fails to  Therefore LFR is a more suitable Gen-IV reactor .
As the population's reliance on technology advances and grows , a greater need for electricity energy to power these computer gadgets has since sparked an inevitable concern as many worry that fossil fuels ,  being used over the years to generate electricity , are not sufficient enough to accommodate all the needs .
Moreover , global warming  has been growing at an alarming rate , thanks partly to the excessive air pollution generated  by fossil fuels .
Therefore , a search for higher efficient and safe energy supply is desperately needed and it is already on the agenda of all countries .
Nuclear power has since expanded to replace conventional fuels because of the higher efficiency it can provide to the world .
Many concepts are reviewed to improve the already competent nuclear reactors and so far , generation IV reactor concepts are among those which have stood up among the crowd that are worth developing Personally , in my opinion , Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is by far the best nuclear reactor concept to be chosen for funding of research and development .
One of the reasons why Very High Temperature Reactor is better for funding is because of its safety factor .
Safety factor is heavily considered because if an accident occurs at nuclear reactor sites , it can result in massive releases of radioactivity .
Therefore in this context , safety design in VHTR has been introduced to take care of all the uncertainties and accidents which might occur with the ultimate goal of protecting the environment and people from being exposed to radiological hazards of potential release from the nuclear power plants .
And it includes the development of passive heat removal systems , low power density and easily cool-able geometry .
Helium is used in the heat removal system as a coolant because it is an inert gas and it will not react chemically with any other material .
VHTR will also be equipped with graphite-moderated core with specific design optimizations .
The graphite has tiny pellets of uranium fuel encased in it and they will absorb heat without failing and releasing radioactivity .
As VHTR would be expected to operate at a very high temperature , all these are essential to prevent the reactor from being over-heated .
However some have argued that VHTR is unsafe as it is operating at a higher temperature and it would easily be the target of terrorist attacks Since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in New York on September 11 , 2001 , the risk of threats of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities cannot be regarded as negligible .
And some have also put doubts on the ability of a passive heat removal system because if it fails to remove heat in the reactor , leakage of radioactive components will occur .
Certainly ,  disasters which happened in Three Mile Island , Tokaimura and Chernobyl should never be repeated .
But , according to Forrest J . Remick , professor emeritus of nuclear engineering and a former associate vice president for research at Penn State ,  VHTR is safe and this concept has been demonstrated in several test reactors in the United States , Germany , China and South Africa .
Therefore as all the tests have shown , the potential of leaking and being unstable during operation can be rendered as zero .
However , some experts have pointed out that if such high temperature is stimulated within a reactor , a new hardy alloy may be necessary to protect the inside layer of the reactor .
To get those alloys  would already cost millions .
How about the construction cost of the entire power plant which is still unknown  ?
Furthermore , it is easier and cheaper to build other generation four nuclear reactors compared to VHTR .
For instance , for supercritical water-cooled reactor , it is relatively cheaper to build because it uses water as coolant instead of helium in VHTR .
So , the process of handling the phase change of helium to another state is not needed and this kind of simplification can largely reduce the cost .
When the cost is reduced , cheaper electricity can be provided to the public .
But in terms of performance , VHTR is a more efficient concept compared to others in generation four nuclear reactor concepts .
Even though it might prove costly at the beginning  it pays off well as it produces both electricity and hydrogen fuel instead of electricity only .
High temperature processed in the reactor can be used as a condition to yield hydrogen from sulphur-iodine cycle , which is a series of thermo-chemical processes that will fail without a sufficient source of heat .
Hydrogen fuel produced can be used in vehicles as its onboard fuel .
Also , as it is operating at higher temperature , it produces more electricity compared to the rest .
In conclusion , VHTR is a very promising energy system to provide us electricity and hydrogen cogeneration .
Currently , VHTR development is in the early stages .
There are enormous items left to do in order for this concept to succeed in future .
Therefore , more research and development should be carried out so that in future this concept can become the energy supply for everyone on this earth .
The Chernobyl nuclear accident , which occurred on 26 April 1986 , had resulted in massive radioactive fallout into the atmosphere that affected millions of people .
Because of the catastrophic effects of a nuclear accident , no nuclear reactor has been built since then .
However , as global warming is becoming a more pressing issue , we have now turned to nuclear reactors to provide us clean energy .
Which generation IV nuclear reactor we should choose ?
Although some have chosen lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) over very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) because of the various benefits LFR has over VHTR , there is some evidence that VHTR is much better than LFR .
Supporters of LFR claim that LFR is much safer than VHTR .
One of the main reasons for LFR being safer is LFR , which operates at around 550 degree Celsius , has a lower outlet temperature than VHTR , which operates at around 1000 degree Celsius (Butler .
2004) .
It is believed that the higher the temperature , the greater the risk of a nuclear meltdown .
However , VHTR is designed to work at such a high temperatures .
In VHTR , its graphitic core structure , helium coolant , and coated fuel particles allow VHTR to withstand high temperatures (Chapin al te .
2004) .
Thus , it is able to attain thermal stability .
In short , operating at 1000 degree Celsius is not much of a safety issue since VHTR is safe and reliable at high temperature .
In  terms of the coolant used by the two reactors , VHTR is safer than LFR .
LFR uses lead as its coolant .
Lead is corrosive and may form polonium , which is a radioactive substance , when exposed to radioactivity (Loewen al te .2003) .
Given the presence of the radioactive polonium and the corrosiveness of lead , it is not safe to use lead as a coolant .
On the other hand , VHTR uses helium , which is a chemically inert .
Thus , it reduces the safety hazards which can arise due to the corrosion and the irradiation of the coolant .
Supporters of LFR also maintain that LFR is much cheaper than VHTR .
In terms of cost to build the reactor , LFR costs around US$700 million (Neil W . Brown .
2006) while VHTR costs around US$1 .1 billion (Butler .
2004) .
In addition , in terms of the cost of coolant , lead costs around US$0 .24 per 100 grams (MetalPrice .com) while helium costs around US$5 .20 per 100 grams .
In terms of these two factors , LFR is much cheaper than VHTR .
However , there are other factors that will also affect the cost of operating the reactor , such as maintenance costs .
For instance , since VHTR is specially designed to operate under a very high temperature , it will produce hydrogen , which is a source of clean fuel .
The economic production of hydrogen (H2) by thermochemical cycles ,  can reduce the maintenance cost for operating the VHTR .
The final argument advanced by the supporters of LFR is LFR performs much better than VHTR .
Unlike VHTR , LFR will reprocess its nuclear waste .
Thus , LFR can use the nuclear reactant to its maximum before disposing it .
However , recycling of nuclear waste will result in the production of plutonium , which can be used for nuclear weapons (Butler .
2004) .
In fact , United State has refrained from reprocessing of nuclear waste .
Hence , recycling of nuclear waste is not safe in terms of security .
In addition , VHTR is more efficient than LFR .
It is because the higher the outlet temperature , the greater  the efficiency of electrical generation .
As VHTR is operating at a higher temperature , there is an efficient conversion of energy from heat to electricity .
From data , for the same amount of fuel , VHTR could squeeze 50% more electricity compared to conventional plants (Chapin al te .
2004) .
Furthermore , VHTR produces hydrogen fuel that can be used to produce electrical energy .
VHTR generates electrical energy in two ways , from the nuclear reactant directly and from hydrogen fuel .
In conclusion , VHTR is safe because it is designed to attain thermal stability and it uses an inert coolant , which is helium .
In addition , it is cost effective because of its economic production of hydrogen .
Furthermore , it is also efficient because it is operating at a very high temperature .
Hence , it should be evident that VHTR works better than LFR in terms of security , cost and performance .
Since VHTR is one of the better options among the generation IV nuclear reactors and it is feasible , we should invest in and support  further research and development on VHTR .
energy producerreactors ,dominantare safer and more efficienta greatera survey ,AccordingNuclear powerare beginning runThe VHTR , just as it name implies , the temperature needed is as high as 1000 C . This reactor is a graphite-moderated , helium-cooled reactor with a once-through uranium fuel cycle(studsvik) .
VHTR can provide convenientnding features while the rests cannot , or VHTR is an extremely becomeciency reactor with a good security guarantee .
The VHTR system isitsighly ranked inneeds temperatures use of its high nuclear production but also the large hydrogen production , and such kind of by product can also be used in many other industries .
The basic reason is that unwhichuch arest temperature , water can be electrolyzed smoothly , turning into hydrogen and oxygen .
For VHTR , water will be electrolyzed more fully compared with the other ones , so the hydrogen production is the largest .
Actually , according the report from DISCOVERY: VHTR plants could even produce hydrogen for fuel using high-temperature steam electrolysis , which breaks apart the bonds of water molecules; this process is 50 percent more energy-efficient than existing hydrogen production methods .
In 2005 the Department of Energy authorized INL to build a VHTR plant .
The prototype should be completed sometime between 2018 and 2021(New Tech Could Make Nuclear the Best Weapon Against Climate Change , Elizabeth Svoboda) .
In addition , hydrogen is not the only by product , heat and electricity will also be generated during the nuclear processing .
The heat will be transferred to relevant nuclear reactions .
The electricity , of course , will be used as electric power , supplying to the society .
Base on the information form DISCOVER: The VHTR should produce electricity about 40 percent more efficiently than do most reactors in the United States(New Tech Could Make Nuclear the Best Weapon Against Climate Change , Elizabeth Svoboda) .
Then we can conclude that actually the production of electricity is also very large indeed .
fromBasedpower .molecules .
Thisto the Yes , the efficiency of VHTR is really very high .
Considering the nuclear power it produces and the large amount of useful by product it generatea VHTR should be thought highly of .
Nevertheless , the advantage of VHTR cannot be confined to the aspect of efficiency , the high level of safety is another huge advantage over other reactors .
fromwill be lessAs termsan see , the two major advantages efficiency and safety imply the VHTR should be a very promiful nuclear reactor system .
Actually , it has some other wonderful features , for instance , its proliferation resistance and sustainability .
Both of them pprocessbenefit .
But thing is not always perfect , the cost of this reactor is very high and we still get some technology gaps for the VHTR , for example , chemical process and the nuclear heat source to each other with regardto becomemunstable .

Though there's still a long way to go before the accomplishment of VHTR , scientists and engineers will try their best to realize this great plan .

After more than 20 years of evolution , medical robots have becomee one of the great inventions in this  technology driven world .
In the past , medical robots helped the surgeons to diagnose the patients' internal organs and perform minor surgerys .
But in recent years , due to the technology advancement on the medical robots , prototypes of these robots surgery systems are now able to perform more precise , accurate and complicated surgery , such as reaching for untouchable tissue on the patients with the surgeons controlling them remotely .
Moreover , the surgeons are able to reduce their stress levels while performing surgery and the robotic surgery systems are able to maintain the stability of their arms for long hours of surgery .
However , there are many issues revolving around the use of the robotics surgery system compared to traditional human operated surgery 
The first issue is that the public is concerned that robotic surgery will be expensive . .
This is the first thought that appears in their mind when they heard of such surgery for the first time .
However , this is true for medical fees , especially surgery , and it is even more expensive when compared with traditional methods .
This may be the only disadvantage that the patients are going to have but there are lots of advantages for them if they are willing to use medical robots to perform surgery .
"Patients experience less trauma , blood loss , risk of infection , scarring and pain .
Hospital stays are also generally shorter ."
This is quoted from one article by Debra S . from Reuters .
Another article from Newsweek , reported by Jennifer B . mentioned , "Forbes was walking within hours of his surgery and was discharged the next day .
By midweek he was walking three miles daily .
In 10 days he was back at work .
After three weeks he was playing golf again ."
From these , we can see that patients are definitely benefiting in many ways especially when the they are able to go back to their normal daily life within a  shorter recovery time .
The public is also concerned about the safety and reliability of the robotic surgery system , for example , the system breaking down in the process of surgery .
They are worried if this would have happen to them during surgery .
However , the public can rest assured on this matter because the hospitals have always been doing maintenance of the robotic systems .
As a matter of fact , this is the biggest downside for having a robotic system in the hospitals .
An article in The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists mentioned "The system costs hospitals about $1 .6 million and requires an annual $100 ,000 maintenance contract , according to Dr .
Advincula ."
"Da Vinci system costs $ 1 .4 million and annual maintenance costs of $ 100 ,000 with a lifespan of five years ."
Another article added .
This shows that the hospitals always have engineers around to maintain the robotic systems regularly to prevent any failure from happening .
The last issue of public concern is  that the surgeons are not well trained in controlling the robotic surgery systems .
This is a valid concern as the patients are placing their lives in the surgeons' hands .
However , the public , especially the patients , do not need to worry about this issue , as there is a robotic surgery training center  in Singapore to train the surgeons .
The surgeons are responsible for proper training and follow training standards for using the equipment .
The surgeons are encouraged to have more practices before operating on the patients .
"The more you do , the better you're going to get , said Dr Kevin Zorn" 
In brief , with the advancement of medical technologies , the robotic surgery systems  definitely benefit both the patients and the surgeons .
While the patients are able to recover quickly and return to their normal lifestyle , the surgeons are able to perform more surgery as they spend less time on each patient and requireless manpower in the operating theater .
In my opinion ,  robotic surgery systems help to extend the lifespan of one human being .
Therefore , the public should not fear  the robotic surgery and should have confidencet and trust  the surgeons and the technologies they are using .
meetwere raisedhas becomeThe nuclear power industryVHTR cannot ensure safety .
They probably assume that all nuclear reactors must have great possibility to cause disasters .
However , this is not the fact .
The VHTR concept makes use of a helium-cooled , graphite-moderated core with specific design optimizations (Futterer , 2006) .
As it is well-known , the helium , which is used for coolimadeas inherent safety characteristics to enhance the security of the whole reactor system .
Thus , it largely reduces the possibility to cause explosion or other accidents .
The VHTR system , if successful , will prevent most accidents to occur .
Moreover , a few oppositions raise doubts on the efficiency of the VHTR system's performance .
Theoretically , the new concept of VHTR can be so efficient that it can produce 50% more electricity than the conventional plants .
Practically , Japan has already put the concept of VHTR into tests and has been successf Theever , the efficiency of performance must be proven from more different kinds of researches and tests .
From this point of view , the further research and development fuof explosionsed .
Finally , many people are worried about the high cost of establishing such kinds of the VHTR systems .
This may be true , but the value the VHTR system can raise and the benefit it will obtain cannot be ignored .
Firstly , the VHTR system can largely contribute to easing the energy throughis that is widely spread all over the world , which could save a large amount of financial budgets .
As Butler (2004) mentioned , the very high temperature reactors can be used to sp hydrogen from water thermochemically , which can meet the need for hydrogen fuel of the future .
As the energy crisis becomes worse , the energy demand will cause US nation's oil imports by 78% without a proper method to convert water into hydrogen .
Therefore , the VHTR system has the positive potential of reducing the rising rate of the oil fuel and resolving the problem of the energy shortage .
In addition , the VHTR system has a perfect design for the waste recycling .
The fuel used in the VHTR system is uranium dioxide or uranium carbide pellets called TRISO fuel .
It is difficult to remove the product because the pellets are durable , and this design discourages weapon proliferation , which makes the waste easy to concentrate and recycle .
(Stanley , 2007) According to the figure given in Butler's journal , the VHTR system produces no waste because it goes directly to repository .
Hence , such a design for the waste recycling can reduce the cost for the waste processing .
Furthermore , a number of researches are needed to develop the VHTR system , including new materials such as heat resistance , and new techniques such as temperature control .
Once these researches have been done , it is not only the VHTR system will benefit , but also many other industries .
Therefore , the great value and benefit from developing the concept of VHTR is far more than the high cost it requires .
It is necessary for the further research and development funding for VHTR .
arenot only would the VHTR system benefit ,hasthis researchresistantresistance onesmore research isIn conclusion , in terms of safety , efficiency and cost , the new concept of VHTR is the best design and the first choice for the nuclear industry .
The devriseent of the VHTR siobtained only benefit the fuel industry , resolve the energy crisis , but also encourage the development of new heat-resistant materials and temperafor the research and development of the VHTR concept is needed .
The first generation of nuclear reactors was built in 1950 .
Since then , continuous researches has been done to produce a better generation of nuclear reactors .
There are 436 active nuclear power plants in the world and 53 nuclear power plants are under construction .
Nuclear power plants represent more than 70 percent of our non-carbon generated electricity and consist of 17% of our world total energies consumption .
The benefits and usages of nuclear power plants are undeniable .
Nuclear power plants have been widely deployed in many leading countries in the world such as United States , Japan , and China which use the nuclear power plants as one of their main power sources to propel the energy industry .
The usage of the nuclear power plants is widely recognized and they are being integrated as part of those countries' promising energy sources .
Nuclear energy is the most concentrated source in terms of energy generation .
One kilogram of uranium can release the same amount of energy as that released by 2400 tons of standard coal .
It is a good alternative energy source which not only reduces the greenhouse effect ,but also helps solve the problems of limited fossil fuels .
For countries with limited natural resources , nuclear power plants serve as a dependable energy source .
According to the report from GIF (Generation IV International Forum) , tripling the number of nuclear power plants worldwide to 1000 plants could avoid the production of 1 billion tons of carbon emission per year by 2055 .
Nuclear power  is deemed to be a promising energy source for the future .
However , the nuclear leak incidents which  happened in the past few decades in countries such as Three Miles Island , Pennsylvania , Chernobyl in Ukraine , and Bhopal in India have posed doubts on the reliability of the nuclear reactors .
"It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option .
However , before an expansion of nuclear power can be considered , key issues must be addressed including: security of nuclear fuel and waste , waste storage , and proliferation ."
Obama said in his energy plan that addressing certain key issues are needed before deciding to build more nuclear plants .
In response to this , the creation of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) came into being .
It is an organization formed by 9 leading countries in the world: Canada , China , Euratom  , France , Japan , Republic of Korea , South Africa , Switzerland , and United States .
The organization tries to resolve security issues posed by the current nuclear reactors .
100 international experts from GIF and other world leading nuclear power plant research centers have gathered together to find the most promising nuclear systems .
This led to the proposals of the six Generation IV Systems which offer the most promising performance , in terms of sustainability , proliferation resistance and physical protection , safety and reliability , and cost .
The six Generation IV Systems are being designed to counter the problems faced by the current nuclear reactors .
These state-of-the-art nuclear reactors will be able to minimize nuclear wastes and reduce the long-term stewardship burden posed by traditional nuclear reactors .
They have integrated safety design and back-up systems to prevent accidents due to human errors and carelessness , therefore reducing the likelihood and degree of vector core damage .
Besides that , the new designs will have a much better life-cycle cost advantage over other energy sources .
The most important thing is that , they will not be an attractive route for diversion or theft of weapon-usable materials .
The physical protection of the new nuclear reactors will also prevent  acts of terrorism .
The six Generation IV Reactor are revolutionary designs of nuclear reactors .
Out of the six proposals  in the Generation IV Reactor , Very- High-Temperature Reactors (VHTR) stands out for its potential capability to achieve an excellent thermal performance .
This is the only reactor that is researched by all the partner countries in GIF .
It is technically realizable and technologically well established by vendors and national laboratories .
The great breakthrough in the research also suggests that the VHTR does not require intermediate refueling , therefore eliminating the likelihood of accidents .
The reactor operates by using a high temperature exchanger and electrical heater to avoid efficiency penalty and  enable the generation of electricity and hydrogen at the same time .
It iss also known that the ultra-long life VHTR systems can be developed with the use of minor actinides (MA) .
The Generation IV Reactor will be established after 2030 .
With today's high demand of energy sources , one can say that nuclear energy is an inevitable energy source of the future  .
Many people mistakenly equate nuclear power to nuclear weapons although , in fact , they are in basically different categories .
Nuclear power , for a long time , has been one of the most useful inventions that served the people .
The Generation IV International Forum , which was attended by  the ten nations specialising in nuclear power ,  introduced the six new reactor concepts ("Nuclear power's new dawn ," 2004) .
One of them , the Molten Salt Reactor , has a prospective application though there are several objections with respect to safety , cost and performance .
The first opinion that opposes the building of nuclear plants is the people's fear of danger .
Some think that nuclear plants emit radioactive waste into the environment , which may cause both pollution and genetic mutation; others are afraid of the safety system , meaning the plants might explode easily .
These thoughts are due to the history of some nuclear accidents , for example , the meltdown of a nuclear plant at Three Miles Island in Pennsylvania .
However , nuclear power as well as the new Molten Salt Reactor system , in fact , is safer and useful .
According to Declan Butler (2004) , the Molten Salt Reactor system mainly uses fluoride salts , which also belong to heat-and corrosion-resistant materials , as coolant , which can operate for a very long time and is also  safe and reliable .
The salts can keep the reactor's temperature at around 700 oC , which is acceptable in comparison with the others .
One advanced benefit from this system is its low pressure so that the reactor wall can handle good protection .
Another advantage of nuclear power is its green emission .
Current nuclear plants (known as Generation III) and also future ones emit only hot steam while other electricity producers like coal plants pollute the environment with CO2 and SO2 .
In short , the Molten Salt Reactor system is safe to operate and friendly to the environment .
Some people relate nuclear plants to buildings for research rather than for producing electricity , and the cost for producing is high .
In fact , among other Generation IV Reactors as well as electricity generators , the Molten Salt Reactor seems to be the cheapest way to produce electricity  .
This is because the coolant (molten salts) is cheap and recyclable .
Molten salts can be easily found in nature , and the purification technology used for them is simple and less costly than , for instance , lead-bismuth , sodium and helium .
Osman Kemal Kadiroglu (2006) noted that the cost for the same amount of power produced by nuclear plants is cheaper than any other power generation technologies .
He compared them in terms of the availability to build , cost to produce power and area of land occupied .
For example , the cost (in US dollars for fuel used per Megawatt-hour energy is $5 for nuclear and $11 for coal plants ("The Virtual Nuclear Tourist ," 2005) .
A nuclear plant can be built anywhere , which does not require natural resources .
Other sources of energy need natural resources to operate: swift water flow for dams , strong blast for wind turbines , sun beam for solar panels .
Hence , their availability to build up is limited .
Besides , land used for a nuclear plant is less than other alternatives .
Solar or wind power need a lot of land to produce the same amount of energy .
Performance is one of the most concerned factors that people  But nuclear power , especially the Molten Salt Reactor system , should be ranked as the first ("Ranking Power: Scorecards Electricity Companies ," 2004) .
The power , an amount of energy generated in a unit of time , of a nuclear plant is highest among the others' .
As Roger (2007) stated in his statistical data , the average amount of energy generated per hour  varies among kinds of plant: average 4000 MW for nuclear , 1000 MW for coal or oil-fired and 700 MW for hydroelectric generating stations .
From these numbers , it is obvious that the performance of nuclear plants is sufficient  to support the consumption of a large population , which helps the nations lacking in natural resources be independent of coal or oil import .
Particularly , the power output of the Molten Salt Reactor system includes both electricity and hydrogen , which can also be used for other purposes .
In short ,  cheap material , additional product (hydrogen) and high performance (property of nuclear power) make the Molten Salt Reactor system as well as nuclear power most efficient .
In conclusion , nuclear power is safe , clean and effective , which most  people seem to forget .
With the cheap , safe , recyclable , low pressure , having-additional-produce and high performance properties of the Molten Salt Reactor system , it is one of the most potential electricity generators for the future .
IThe LFR has better safety features compared to SFR .
The eldangerodium has a low boiling point of 1156 Kelvins , compared to lead's higher 2023 Kelvins , which is dangerous it becomes overheated and starts to boils(Hejzlar , 2009) .
In the event of an unprotected total loss of power , the LFR's core is able to passively quickly cool down , due to its low pressure drop and simple coolant design (Tucek , 2005) .
Compared to the SFR , it has a high pressure drop and thus its temperature would increase dangerously beyond its bpromiseoint .
Additional safety devices have toand betterplemented (Hejzlar , 2009) .
On another note , the low reactivity and inertia of lead allows safe removal of fuel if the fuel rod pins fail during installation .
On the other hand , lead can become radioactive and therefore harmful to life during refueling when the Kelvin exposed .
While research is beingKelvino control the lead's because itdioactivity , it is assuring that rboiling is done every 8 years in large plants and every 15 years in smaller plants .
The risk of radioactive leakage is therefore minimal over its span of usage .
Cost has become a very important criterion in the world today; in this case , the LFR fits the bill very well .
Considering the economics of scale , the cost of building materials such as steel and concrete will increase significantly , hence the size of nuclear plant has become a consideration .
The LFR's smaller core and lesser required cooling systems , such as the omission of an intermediate cooling link , saves significant building costs as compared to SFR .
In fact , the lead/bismuth-cooled SVBR-75/100 is the cheapest to build amongst other types of fast reactors .
(Hejzlar , 2009) Furthermore , it costs less per kWh of electricity compared to SFR .
Another strong advantage is the scalability of LFR that allows it to be used in developing and hard to reach places , for instance , Africa .
(Tucek , 2005)
On the contrary , the research on the use of pure leis therefored of a lead-bismuth cooling agent may outweigh the economic benefits of LFR .
It is also important to note that if SFR's research on reassuringtivity of sodium is successful , a better cost saving SFR power plant can be built (Zhao , 2009) .
Also , the SFR is projected to launch 10 years earlier than LFR .
For the time being , LFR has the advantage of having to cost less today .
In e performance capability of LFR does not disappoint .
LFR do neconomiese maintaining high pressures in the core unlike SFR .
Also LFR has better fuel efficiency than SFR as LFR has lesser a nuclear plantr , 45kW/kgHM compared to 65kW/kgHM of the SFR .
(Tucek , 2005) .
lessOn the other handFR does have some good points .
Sodium is four times more effective as a cooling agent than LFR , because of its better thermal hydraulic properties .
(Tucek , 2005) .
Furthermore , SFR has better net efficiency than LFR , 46 .2% versus 34 .6% for the latter .
SFR has been the mainstream for nuclear power plants inbe launchedast years and therefore more familiar and accepted .
However research is ncosting the capability of sodium in high temperatures , as it has a low boiling point , which will result in a complex design .
atis thereforeAll in all , the overwhelming advantages of LFR as a future implementation of the new generation IV nuclear plant , proves that it is better than the SFR in all of the above aspects .
Therefore , we should push for development of LFR nuclear power plants .
According to statistics provided by the World Coal Institute , the remaining coal and natural gases reserves will only be able to last us for around 122 years and 42 years respectively .
Due to vast development and urbanization in both developed and developing nations , these resources are rapidly depleted to generate electricity in power plants .
Hence , to meet the world's energy needs , scientists are re-addressing the potential benefits of harnessing power through nuclear reaction , in which uranium is split to release energy .
The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) based its operations on the concept of generating electricity through such a process .
As a result of operating at a very high temperature , 900 degree Celsius , the VHTR functions at 50% higher thermal efficiency which allows it to generate more electricity .
Moreover , the processed heat that the nuclear reactor produces can also be used in other industrial areas such as hydrogen production , water desalination and the treatment of crude oil (Jacques , 2008) .
Despite the apparent benefits from harnessing energy through VHTR , the public continues to harbor doubts over the reliability and effectiveness of this technology .
Environmentalists claim that green energy such as solar , wind and hydro energy are the trusted technologies which we should focus our research and funds on in meeting the increasing energy needs .
While it is understandable that such technologies are everlasting , cheap and clean to adopt as resources used are free and renewable and the processes do not emit any harmful materials into the environment , we notice that these technologies cannot be readily implemented throughout the world .
This is because they rely heavily on weather conditions which vary drastically according to location and time or may be even unpredictable at times .
On the other hand , with its simple design and high efficiency , it is fairly cheap to build and operate the VHTR .
The VHTR can be built anywhere on an empty plot of land .
The fact that uranium is also widely available in ample supply is in contrast to the trend of the rapidly depleting coal and natural gases reserves .
Henceforth , nuclear power has limitless potentials for us to look into and the cost of its usage is fairly cheap .
Anti-nuclear activists believe that as the waste from nuclear processes are being recycled to retrieve unused uranium , plutonium , a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons is also being separated and recovered .
In addition , the leftover waste is radioactive in nature and if not handled properly ,  creates pollution and poses great threat to the ecosystem of the world .
Their concerns are valid but with the advancement in nuclear technology , the VHTR is able to counteract these effects .
Firstly , the VHTR does not recycle its leftover from the nuclear reaction .
Instead the waste is  discarded at the end of the nuclear process .
As a result , plutonium is not recovered .
Secondly , new forms of reprocessing radioactive waste are being researched and developed to shorten their half-lives (Butler , 2004) .
This means their hazardous effects will only be short-lived .
Lastly , despite conventional beliefs that nuclear power causes pollution , the truth is that the VHTR actually produces less carbon emission as compared to power plants fueled by coal or natural gases .
Its effects on global warming are less prominent .
It can be seen that the usage of the VHTR is in fact environmentally friendly and responsible to the society .
In response to the mounting threat of terrorism , country leaders are concerned with the security and safety aspects of nuclear plants .
They are afraid that if terrorists were to sabotage these nuclear plants , their act will lead to a catastrophic disaster which will affect the nation's economic and social health  According to Thinkquest , their worries are not unfounded as the lapse in safety of nuclear reactors led to two devastating nuclear accidents which happened on Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , in 1979 and at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 .
To prevent the repeat of past events , the VHTR has enhanced safety features and components1 that do not rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators to function .
In the event of an accidental power trip or a planned sabotage , the VHTR is able to cool itself with minimal or even zero human intervention .
Therefore , the VHTR is 'meltdown proof' and it provides maximum safety and reassurance .
To conclude , nuclear energy is relatively cheap , environmentally and socially responsible , and safe to use .
Most of the participating nations and organizations of the Generation IV International Forum are supportive of this new technology and they have pooled US$500 million over the next 5 years to fund its further research and development (Jacques , 2009) .
It is imperative for us to accept and embrace this new form of technology in order to meet the world's increasing energy demand .
An accident is often an unintended action which results in vast effects .
One example will be the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 during a non-routine operation .
There was a sequence of events that caused the explosion of reactor number 4 that led to the release of radioactive fission products to the atmosphere .
This resulted in many deaths , including those who died from the accident , those firefighters and majority who were exposed to radiation .
(Chernobyl .info) There were a number of reports published that summarized this accident , concluding that the sequence of events was due to human error and design faults .
There are arguments that the lack of knowledge of the operators and the technical failure of equipment could not be solved with the application of psychology .
However , it seems otherwise since psychology is a study of the human mind or behavior .
This incident occurred during a non-routine operation to test the ability of the turbine , in times of power failure , to produce sufficient power .
For that , all backup systems were switched off to avoid disturbance .
One main factor that resulted in the explosion was the activating of the emergency button by operators .
The operators were inadequately trained .
They did not know that with the activation of the button , there will be a sudden surge of power before dropping reactivity .
It is thus argued that psychology may not be helpful in this case as the behavior of the operators is beyond the control of the design engineers .
However , considering the mentality of the operators , it was logical for them to do so since it was meant as an emergency action .
This shifted the responsibility to the design engineers .
A successful designed process is one that is foolproof .
The behavior of operators should be anticipated and thus engineers could have reduced the complexity of the task by providing short and efficient procedure guidelines .
The failure to do so showed that the engineers had overestimated the operators' knowledge of the process (Wilpert , 2007)  .
In other words , it is unfair to blame the operators  when accidents happen Furthermore , the testing of limits of the reactor was not a routine operations , thus the lack of knowledge to react is considerable and should be anticipated and counteracted .
Even so , many still think that psychology may not come in handy in preventing accidents  , especially when it is due to technical faults .
In the Chernobyl case , the positive coefficient of the reactor is one major technical fault .
This characteristic will cause reactors to be unstable at low power levels .
It was due to the instability of the reactor that there was this rapid power increment resulting in explosions .
(Engineering .com) Despite this dangerous feature , engineers still chose this type of reactor as they deemed it as the best choice .
Another fatal technical fault was the chosen design of the control rods .
These control rods will cause a sudden surge in power before reducing reactivity .
It was thus argued that psychology is not useful as engineers were aware of the consequences but there was no better solution .
While it may be true that there was no better choice with the level of technology then , the engineers could have improved the designs .
According to Wolfgang Botsch , a similar error with the positive coefficient of the reactor had already occurred in Lithuania in 1983 .
However , sadly , this experience was not passed down to the design crew of Chernobyl .
Therefore , it is not right to say that the reactor was the best choice to be used in the plant .
If they had adopted the use of psychology , they might have reviewed safety records of that type of reactor in the industry before deciding on it .
Furthermore , the typical approach by the engineers to find solutions often starts with a fixed plan with the application of their knowledge .
However , in this process , there may be partial failures in the system which the engineers failed to identify and were thus unable to improve safety of the system .
Therefore , a systematic thinking is recommended , where engineers constantly analyze their own approach and decisions so as to take corrective action to improve the safety of the whole system .
By doing so , we are adopting the path of feedforward control of safety .
This is preferred to making corrections only after an accident has occurred .
It will be too late .
This evaluation is also part of psychology application , where the mistakes from the engineers are reduced as much as possible to safeguard the complex high hazard system .
(Wilpert .B , 2007)
Many factors have contributed to the costly figures of owning the aeroplane However , should its design safety be compromised so as to balance out the other factors like performance , cost , environment and social requirement or needs ?
Safety is regarded as the most important factor in designing a vehicle(SYL , 2006) .
On September 29th , 2009 , car manufacturing giant , Toyota Motors announcedrecall 3 .8million Toyota and Lexus vehicles due to a safety issue that resulted in the death of a family of 4(Post Chronical , 2009) .
From this incident , we can see the importance of safety and that it cannot be tolerated .
Motorists consider performance as an important factor when purchasing a vehicle .
However , other interested buyers may think safety comes first .
Althougcouldt may be true that redundant safety systemwith easee removed and the Skycar still remains safe for usage but when accident happens , no one can ever be too safe .
Besides that , the loss of life and the cost of safety systems which could have prevented the accident cannot be compared .
For example , the cars used in Formula One are much more heavily equipped with safety features since the death of driver , Ayrton Senna da Silva in 1994 , where his car was already very much equipped with safety precautions during his accident .
Since then , no one else has died in Formula One Races .
thoughSome enthusiasts have voiced out that it is simply too costly to own a Skycar .
Equipped with 8 engines , 4 main and 4 for ency , the Skycar stays on flight even if any engine fails .environmentalre is just one of the many expensive systems that elevated the cost of the Skycar .
However , money spent on safety should not be counted in terms of figures but in terms of benefits .
If the benefit is to save a live , it is likely that anyone is willing to pay any amount .
Safety of bystanders is also considered where design safety is concerned .
The Skycar has its engine and fans enclosed in nacelles to prevent injury to bystanders .
Equipped with auto-releasing parachute , it allows enough time for bystanders to evacuate when the vehicle fails .
In the year 2005 , of the 43443 people killed in vehicle accidents in the US , more than 5000 were will still remainanders(Stats , nd) .
Therefan accidenting more to get a vehicle with sufficient safetatures is important not just to the owner , but also to the surrounding environment .
a auto-releasingThe safetySome consumers commentremarkede structure and shape of the Skycar should be modified as it looks weird and seems to be out of logic .
However , do these people know that the structure of the Skycar is designed to provide the best aerodynamic stability ?
Although the designers modified the airfoil at the expense of rising it's cost , if the vehicle were to be less stable , will the consumer still be interested in the product ?
From various examples and historical facts , we can safely say that most consumers will not purchase a producty features that are up to standard .
Therefore , where design safety is concerned , it is of the utmost importance .
The Skycar has since passed it flight test and awaiting its approvedraisingthe Federal Aviation Administration to be recognised as commercial vehicle .
As the market of such vehicle grows , mass production is likely to take place which will in turn lower its cost price .
In near future , we should be able to purchase one at the price of a regular car .

The rapid development of countries and expansion of population have created a world that is increasingly unable to meet the demand of energy .Additionally , fossil fuel is criticized as the main contributing factor for green house gas effect .
As such , there is a pressing need to search for alternative renewable forms and energy which is comparatively more eco-friendly and highly effective .
In such a context , nuclear energy created by using the Generation IV (Gen IV) reactor is able to replace  fossil fuel , which is believed to be the main cause of global warming .
One such reactor is the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) which can "supply electricity and process heat to a broad spectrum of high-temperature and energy-intensive processes"  .
Some may argue , with skepticism , that the safety issues of this reactor are still imminent and hence , nuclear power should not be supported .
However , in my opinion , on the whole , the benefits gained from VHTR will far exceed the problems created .
Some opponents have raised  doubts of the performance of VHTR .
However , VHTR has proven itself as a high-efficiency system .
First , VHTR performs under very high temperature , thereby allowing for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity .
For example , Butler (2004 , p . 238) reported that it "could squeeze 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with other conventional plants" .
Besides , VHTR can also be used to split hydrogen from water thermo-chemically .
Nowadays , there is an increasing demand for energy due to fast economic development .
Thus we need a power generation method that would be sustainable in the long term .
Actually , fossil fuel is also possible but with the spike  in energy consumption in the past few decades , fossil fuel is predicted to be depleted by 2040 .
Moreover , the fossil fuel's emission of carbon dioxide , which contributes to soaring green house gas levels would not happen with nuclear power .
In short , I believe that with further research , the efficiency of the nuclear power can be increased , making it a potential  energy resource in the future .
Some skeptics feel that the building of VHTR is a risky investment , complaining that VHTR is an expensive source of energy , hence unfeasible .
Yet , although the fixed cost of building is high , it is myopic to merely look at the short run cost while neglecting the long run benefit .
Due to low maintenance , the fixed cost would be lower in the near future  .
Zheng L . reported that China is planning to install nuclear power capacity of 86 gigawatts by 2020 , up nearly 10 fold from the capactity it had by the end of 2008 .
The fact that China , one the world largest consumers of energy , is willing to spend high proportion of money for this project shows the  long run benefit that nuclear power can bring about , especially since the Chinese government has been always very pragmatic .
The final argument advanced by the opponent is that while high temperature makes electricity and hydrogen production easier , it also poses a threat of explosion .
For example , two incidents-an accident in 1979 in which the reactor core lost coolant and partially melted , and the 1986 catastrophe in which a reactor exploded and released radioactivity into the atmosphere(Sandra M) greatly increased concerns about the safety of nuclear power .
Yet , VHTR is actually still safe and reliable to operate , with improved accident management and mitigation and reduced off-side response with little human intervention .
Last but not least , some will question why helium with low thermal conductivity is chosen as its coolant given that some other coolant , for instance molten salt , allows better electric conversion efficiency than a helium-cooled VHTR operating at similar conditions .
However , the selection of coolant is based on many factors .
First , "helium gas provides a nonreacting cooling medium with a low nuclear cross section that can either directly drive a turbine for power production , or can be directed to process" (Gen IV) .
Second , VHTR uses helium as a coolant for safety purposes .
Helium is an inert gas , so it will not chemically react with any material , and exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive , unlike most other possible coolants .
Balancing all these factors , Helium is still the overall best coolant .
Hence , this selection proves the safeness of VHTR .
Thomas Malthus , a famous demographer , published a theory that population growth will eventually outstrip resources .
Hence , the research for alternative energy is necessary .
Although there is certain undenied limitation of VHTR , I am strongly convinced that with the current technology advances , the limitation will be solved .
With more funds channeled into research into  this  area , the potential of VHTR could be maximized .
The world is concerned with the safety of nuclear power plants andsibility of nuclear arms proliferation .TS Past incidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (Bodansky , 2005) had left many in doubt of the technology .
In recent news , both North Korea and Iran have been told to step back on their plans of a nuclear power plant in fear power , whichme radioactive materials used for energy generation will be used in nuclear weapons .
The VHTR design does not include the controversial method of waste recycling , whereby plutonium is extracted in a pure form (Butler , 2004) .
Hence , this design reduces the probability of nuclear arms proliferation .
Within the VHTR reactor , the nuclear fuel is enclosed within pebbles of silicon carbide and pyro-carbon (Olander , 2009) which are able to contain the radiation .
The coolant used is helium gas instead of water .uperior because it will not get irradiated and does not undergo volume expansion phase change .
Even if the reactor body is breached , there will be no explosive dispersion of radioactive materials .
Therefore , the VHTR design is safer than current nuclear reactors and less susceptible to nuclear arms proliferation (Hylko , 2008) .
Moreover , detractors have argued that the high temperature generated in nuclear reactors is not fully utilized anconventional non-nuclear energy generation methods have better perfohavence in terms of theraboutl efficiency .TS ERecently ,r plants have thermal efficiency of approximately 33% (Olander , 2009) compared to 70% and above forr non-nuclear power plants .
Firstly , the VHTR operates at close to 1000 C compared tproducing nuclear00  C in current nuclear reactors .
This higher temperature translates to the extraction of 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel (Butler , 2004) .
Improved engineering and design will further increase the thermal efficiency of the power plant in the future .
Secondly , although the thermal efficiency of nuclear plants is lower , the actual amount of power generated per unit mass of fuel is actually much higher than that of fossil fuels .
Hence the method of using thermal efficiency for comparison is not practical .
Lastly , because of the higher temperature , it is possible to produce hydrogen gas from water thermochemically (Elder and Allen , 2009) .
There is a demand for hydrogen gas which may become a fuel for cars in the future .
Therefore , the VHTR design is superior as it produces more energy and hydrogen gas
Another objection is raised by the taxpayers; they are not convinced with the heavy investment of building a nuclear plant .TS A nuclear plant costs on average , a billion dollars and is designed with a lifespan of sixty yes (Butler , 2004) .
Although the price is high , the nuclear plant will not produce any greenhouse or acidic gases .
Acid rain had caused deforestation and affected fisheries , the damages amounts to millions per year .
Global warming has been linked to the more frequent occurrence of natural disasters .
These disasters created uncountable losses in terms of damage to infrastructure , economy and lives .
In rebuttal to the "limited lifespan" of the nuclear plant , in sixty years , this nuclear plant will have produced much cheaper electricity and caused less harm to the environment .
These two advantages are definitely significant .
amountedIn conclusion , funding for researchtaxpayers .
Theyst be supported .
This is because the VHTR is much safer due to its superior design and "proliferation-proof" process .
The VHTR will in fact produce more and cheaper energy than existing power plants .
In addition , the VHTR produces useful hydrogen gas and is environmentally friendly .
As such , there is no doubt that this technology isfisheries .
The damages
Since psychology is closely related to safety in design , whether the input of psychology could have prevented this accident is an interesting topic .
Psychology in design process involves both the study of human behavior at human-machine interface , and the analAm .
KLM organizational systems (Wilpert , 2007) .
Hence the supporters argue that the improvement in regulationaccident .
However ,nd an emergency plan could have prevented this disaster .
However , I do not think the use of psychology in design would have worked in this case since psychology could not prevent the human error factors effectively and there were too many haphazard factors .
Other than human errors , the Tenerife accident is also a combination of various accidental factors .
Firstly , the terrorism attack was difficult to predict .
For the technical part , the centerline lights were out of operation which diimposed stricterhe two planes from seeing each other; the single channel radio made the response inaudible and there was no ground radar (ALPA , n .d .) .
Besides , the thick fog formed worsened the situation .
The adoption of psychology in design might have taken a few of the factors into consideration , but it was unlikely to have anticipated al and hence there would still be potential hazards .
Furthermore , the terrorism attack would reduce the effectiveness of improvements in equipment .
The airport was so crowded that the normal routines were blocked (Weick , 1993) .
With the combination of the fact that the controllers were bad at English and unfamiliar with handling Boeing 747s (Weick , 1993) , there was a high chance that accident would happen even with contingency plans .
In fact , the Pan Am was told to turn at exit C-3 which was impossible for a 747 so the captain decided to turn at C-4 and collided with KLM between C-3 and C-4 exits (ALPA , n .d .) .
allother .
ThepreventedTo sum up , the use of psychology in design would not be very helpful in the special case of Tenerife accident due to the human errors and accidental factors that were difficult to anticipate and prevent .
The first reason some people are afraid of nuclear energy is because they cannot get rid of the influof effortfintoccidents like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (Butler , 2004) .
But , something they mayclear about is in the half century of Nuclear Age , only about one or two deaths per year are attributed by nuclear energy accidents .
Compared withenergy sources the number of coal mine accidents deaths is much largerit reaches 7530 per year .
Besides that , nuclear power plants are safer than coal mines due to the reason that designers and engineers use the high-tech in buildinthen , for example ,lant and there are strict rules of operation .
So it is easier to guarantee the safety of nuclear power plants because if workers follow the regulations , no accidents will be caused .
Comparatively spebringg , many illegal coal minethoseith simple and crude facilities are still running underground .
It is the real hazard trouble .
And consider with one of the six generation IV reactor (A Technology Roadmaop , 2002) , lead-cooled fast reactors; scientists are trying to use lead-bismuth as new coolant .
It can keep nuclear reactor operating under lower temperature and pressure .
Thus it will make the nuclear core even safer .
From the above reasons , we can see that nuclear energy is not as dangerous as people expect , contrarily , it is one of the safest energy humans being can use in modern society .
Secondly , as I mentioned above , the scientists are trying to develop the lead-cooled fast reactor , however , the enormous size of investment have prevented most countries from this kind of research .
And many countries are still wondering whether to build nuclear power plants because they cost a lot of money and citizens are not willing to pay their tax for that .
But the government should foresee the grealargerireachinguilding nuclear power plants .
Nowadays 442 nuclear power plants are working all over world , contributing about 19 percent of the world's electricity supply .
Another case in point is American , "They produce much of the electricity that fuels our economic growth .
They power new industrial technologies that boost our Gross National Product aoccure our global competitiveness" (Nuclear Energy: Benefits for All Americans  , 2001) .
And with modern technologies , nuclear power plants cace consumed in the nuclearly 1950s (Nuclear Energy & Society , n .d .) .
Thus to sum up , nuclear power plants can produce electricity with higher efficiency and larger amount compared to fuel or coal burning electric geexpect .
Contrarily , can bring great economic benefit .
Theyplantselectricityamountsin largershowLastly , the lack of technology teal with the disposal of nuclear plants which are radioreactor .
However ,y toxic is the last reason preventhasuntries from using nuclear energy .
Officers are afraid of terrorists who acquire a substantial amount of nuclear waste could construct a so-called "dirty bomb" which may affect the country's safety .
But the truth is technology is developing every day .
Scientists have found other ways to reuse the nuclear wCurrentlyorder to make more benefits (Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors , 2008) .
And if government can reinforce the management of where the nuclear waste Americaer using , people do not have to worry about the attack from terrorists .
the governmentand couldIn conclusion , nuclear energy is not dangerous to human being so thawasteshould make full use of nuclear energy to benefit the whole preventingnd .
It is said that the world's population will expand from the current 6 billion to around 10 billion by the year 2050 (GIF , 2002) , which will push us into an even more serious energy shortage position unless we successfully find new kinds of energy as soon as possible .
In fact , human beings have been seeking for the solution to energy issues for a long time .
So far we have already developed solar energy , wind energy , nuclear energy and many others .
However , none of these can be the ideal energy to us now due to the technological problems , economic concerns , or potential dangers .
Among all these new kinds of energy , nuclear energy is regarded as the most controversial one which has been the hotspot since its appearance .
Whether to develop and promote the use of nuclear energy has triggered firm discussion among both experts and common people .
In my opinion , we should give more support to nuclear development because of its high efficiency , none-greenhouse-gas emission and its valuable by-products during the reaction .
Some opponents may argue that other kinds of energy can also be environmentally friendly , such as solar energy and wind force .
There is no need to spend so much on nuclear energy development .
However , in terms of efficiency and economic value , nuclear energy has great advantages over both solar energy and wind force .
The Generation reactors are expected to increase the efficiency of electricity production to as high as 50% while the efficiency of solar energy is no more than 40% in the lab (U .S . Department of Energy , 2006) which means its actual efficiency of industrial application will be even lower .
Besides this , in the process of nuclear reaction , a large amount of hydrogen can be generated for the use in petroleum refinement and also as new advanced fuel in transportation (Vilim , 2007) .
It is said that for America , the energy demand of transport alone will cause increase of oil imports by 78% by the end of 2025 if it does not switch its dependence on oil to hydrogen (Butler , 2004) .
So the Very-High-Temperature-Reactor (VHTR) is believed to play an important role in America's energy crisis , because it can help to reduce the dependence on oil for its over 2 million normal cubic meters hydrogen production per day .
Though solar energy and wind force can also contribute to environment protection , nuclear energy indeed has its unique advantages which they cannot rival  .
Apart from this , opponents may be worried that the nuclear reactors would become the target of terrorists because of disastrous consequences after its ruin .
However , the new advanced feature of VHTR can effectively protect itself from the damage of terrorists .
Normally , the terrorists attempt to make an accident by shutting off the coolant or power supply of the system .
But they will not expect that the meltdown proof in VHTR can cool itself down when accidents happen and minimize the interaction with human beings (Butler , 2004) .
So , nuclear reactor would not be a desirable target for terrorists any more .
To sum up , the Generation reactors have made great improvements compared to the older generation ones in terms of both technology and safety features .
On one hand , nuclear energy has the advantage of high efficiency , non--greenhouse-gas emission and the by-product hydrogen , which is supposed to be another ideal energy .
On the other hand , the fact that nuclear power plants contribute about 16% electricity to the world , which is the largest share among all the new developed energy sources (NEA , 2006) , indicates that nuclear power has become more and more essential to human beings .
Given both the advantages of nuclear energy and the current situation , it is practical and urgent for us to put concerted efforts to the development of nuclear energy .
The electric vehicle (EV) is not new on the road .
In fact it has been on the road for more than a century  .
EV became unpopular since the birth of the gasoline powered vehicle which offers high performance and low cost .
However , the idea of EV is revived mainly due to peak oil and climate change .
EV is powered by huge rechargeable battery packs and propelled by only an electric motor .
For that reason , EV is also labelled as the zero-emission vehicle .
However , there are safety issues on the newly developed technologies that the electric vehicle carries such as the volatile Lithium ion battery , massive battery weight problem , and the silent electric motor that might cause unnoticeable hazard to the pedestrians .
Despite all the safety issues , steps have been taken to enhance the safety of the EV .
In my opinion EV is safer than a conventional gasoline vehicle .
Although numerous articles claiming that EV is unsafe , there isevidence of improvements  made to make EV safe to drive .
There are claims and myths that the Lithium ion rechargeable batteries that power the EV will explode and cause massive damage to the vehicle and the driver .
To ensure safety , carmakers are rigorously testing their batteries .
Nissan and Mitsubishi , for instance , expose the batteries to extreme temperatures , continuously charge and discharge the batteries , and smash them to experiment real road accidents (Rowley and Hall , 2009) .
Besides that , carmakers also improve the materials of the battery to minimize the risk of overheating .
An anti-impact cage is added to shield the battery from being crushed .
In order to prevent over charging and discharging , advanced microchips will be used to monitor the batteries' capacity .
With these improvements , Osamu Masuko , president of  Mithubishi Motors says that gasoline is relatively far more dangerous than batteries .
The electric vehicle carries large and heavy battery packs to increase the mileage per charge .
These heavy batteries result in an EV being much heavier compared to an identical gasoline vehicle .
However , if the weight of the batteries in the vehicles is arranged correctly , the EV should be able to achieve higher stability .
Other than that , in a crash test , the occupants of a lighter vehicle  suffered from higher damage compared to a heavy vehicle (insurance Institute for highway safety , 2009) .
In comparison , an accident involving a 1400 Kg vehicle will cause about 50 percent fewer injuries than a 900 Kg vehicle .
Therefore , the weight from the batteries brings safety benefits .
Recently , there have been debates on electric vehicles posinga hazard to pedestrians , especially to the blind or visually-impaired road users (Nuckols , 2007) .
EV is propelled by an electric motor in which torque is produced by electromagnetic forces .
Vibration and noise is minimal compared to an internal combustion engine .
Therefore , EV travel on the road inaudibly , hence the EV could surprise or cause an unexpected danger to the road users .
Tests have shown that the noise level that the EV produces while operating below 30 km/h is not noticeable for all types of road users .
Beyond that speed , more audible noise is formed by the air displaced by the body of the vehicle and friction on the  .
Thus , the European Commission and the US Congress are taking the initiative to set up a minimum level of sound for the EV , and the Japanese may add noise to the quiet vehicle (AFP , 2009) , so that the pedestrians and blind people are able to detect oncoming EV .
This shows that initiatives have been taken to make the electric car safe for the drivers and the pedestrians .
From all the weaknesses of the EV mentioned above , we can actually see that they are no longer a threat to the EV drivers or pedestrians .
EV batteries have been improved to prevent over-heating , controlled charging and discharging .
The casing has been fortified to ensure the batteries are not seriously damaged after a car crash .
The weight problems were countered easily by properly aligning the batteries such that the weight will give more stability to the EV .
Innovative idea such as adding artificial noise to the EV has effectively eliminated the hazard posed by the silent electric motor .
In conclusion , we can see that manufacturers have greatly improved the EV to a standard that EV is safer than the conventional gasoline vehicle .
Heartmate II is a battery operated electronic pump attached internally onto a patient's heart inside his or her chest cavity .
It is connected to an external power source , running on batteries or a power console , carried by the patient .
Heartmate II is the successor ofwork ,rtmate , which was a previous prototA hearthat needed to be improved .
However , even as Heartmate II solved issues of incompatibility and durability , there is still much to improve in terms of safety , performThis proves to be very difficult , and tmate II is operating at a 70 .6% success rate with the remainder resulting with reoperation or mortality .
The causes of mortality were primarily due to sepsis , bleeding issues and device related complications2 .
I feel that there is much room for improvement for the design to enhance Heartmate II's safety and performance and efforts should not stop till a much higher percentage success rate is achieved .
Battery life is one of the main concerns that need to be addressed for toHeartmate II .
Currently , the external battery pack of two AA sized batteries supports the Heartmate II for a good five hours3 .
Though extra batteries can be brought to sustain the appliance , this may be insufficient and can be an area where human error occurs to cause fatalities due to power shortages .
As such , I propose an improvement in battery life by having a better power source , one that would last for more than half a day so as to keep the changing of the battery as minimal as possible .
This would lessen the possibilities for power shortage accidents to occur .
However , an improved battery life could lead to a compromise in the size of Heartmate II .
The bulkiness of the device could reduce the mobility of a patient and in turn increase the possibility for bleeding issues internally .
Essentially , what needs to be achieved is a compact and less bulky battery with longer life span .
Another factor to increase the safety of Heartneeds II would be the alteration of the materials used to manufacture the appliance .
Firstly , it has been reflected that users are facing problems with regard to issues surrounding water resistivity externally3 .
Being caught in a rain would prove to be fatal to a Heartmate II user .
Upgrading the material's water resistivity would make Heartmate II safer .
Furthermore , users could even enable the user to take a proper bath , instead of being restricted to just wiping themselves clean with a wet cloth .
In addition , the materials of the wall of the internal artificial ventricles and pump have to be made to have none or negligible resistance so as to ensure smoother blood flow rate .
Lastly , a lighter material should be preferable for the Heartmate II to reduce any strain whilst being attached to its users internally and externally .
All these elements are crucial to the performance and safety of the Heaa longere II .
There exist many more avenues that can be explored to improveusers Heartmate II and the invention of an artificial heart is still in early stages of its development .
Amidst this discussion , I feel that the cost should not be a determining factor in the construction and application for such health devices that could determines ones life and death .
Issues of security and performance hold the highest priority for mechanges could be made todesigns like the Heartmate II .
I strongly feel that the strife for more development and research should be done for the sake of creating a more durable and lightweight Heartmate III .
Over the decades , the quality of life has improved tremendously in terms of technologies .
People are now living in a world filled with technologywith every edge of the world powered by electricity .
This shows the significance of electricity as compared to the past .
However , the day when people use more electricity than they produce is approaching .
According to Butler , the global demand for energy is expected to double by 2050 (Nature ,2004) .
This forces people to resort to producing energy through nuclear reactors which have higher outputs .
One of the nuclear reactors of Generation-IV nuclear reactor concepts which are highly discussed is the molten salt reactor(MSR) .
Fundings should be allocated for further research of MSR as MSR is able to address the issues of safety ,cost and performance which are the main public's concerns .
Firstly , the public has always held the view that nuclear reactors are unsafe to use as they emit substances which are hazardous to people's health and the environment .
An example of nuclear explosion as quoted by Arlington National Cemetary Records: ''3 January 1961: A reactor explosion (attributed by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission source to sabotage) at the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho Falls , Idaho , killed one navy technician and two army technicians , and released radioactivity "largely confined" (words of John A . McCone , Director of the Atomic Energy Commission) to the reactor building .
However , this tragedy is very unlikely to happen for MSR .
As MSR has a liquid fuel , the reactor has the unique safety advantage that in the event of an accident , the fuel salt is dumped to critically safe , passively cooled storage tanks .
Moreover , molten salts are effectively incompressible .
Consequently , a failure of a heat exchanger in the chemical plant will not pressurize the plant .
In contrast , if helium or other gases are used in the heat transport systems , a heat-exchanger failure can pressurize the chemical plant , with the potential for large releases of toxic materials .
Also , the public is afraid that the nuclear reactor will be misused for development of nuclear weapons .
This does not concern MSR , as it is able to operate with non-weapon grade fissile fuel which gives  no chance for people to misuse the research to develop nuclear weapons .
These features make MSR exceptionally safe compared to other reactors .
Secondly , it has always been a general perception of the public that the cost incurred to build a nuclear reactor is always huge .
This results in not much effort being taken to initiate a nuclear reactor project as they believe the project is not feasible .
Another related concern is the amount of cost incurred for the maintainence of the reactor .
However , MSR is known to be among the cheapest nuclear reactors .
From the table shown by R .W .Moir(Nucl .
Tech .
139 (2002)) the cost incurred by MSR is 31 .3$ for every megawatt of energy generated per hour which is the least compared to the current technologies used .
Also , MSR will be using thorium as fuel as thorium is so abundant in the world as compared to current technologies which mostly use coal as fuel where coalis expected to last just for another 146years according to Energy Information Administration (EIA) .
These show that MSR is economical and should have cleared any doubts regarding further research on MSR as it is a feasible project in the long run as it makes use of resources which are abundant .
Lastly , the public has doubts about the performance of MSR .
Among the issues highlighted were whether it has higher output than other reactors and the technologies required to fully utilize MSR .
As the power required to overcome heat-exchanger pressure drops in a molten-salt system is typically about one-twentieth of a helium system , MSR has higher efficiency than most reactors .
Also , the size of a molten-salt heat-transport loop is only a small fraction of those using helium and is small relative to those for other coolant which leads to usage of a smaller area .
If funding is provided for research on MSR , there is no doubt that MSR can be fully utilised .
Although MSR generally generates less energy as compared to other nuclear reactors , the less space it requires can make up for it .
Thus , the efficiency rate is still very comparable to other reactors of high efficiency rate .
In conclusion , it is evident that MSR is worth the funding for the research given the attributes it possess .
If further research is  done , there is no doubt that MSR will be able to improve its weakness in having higher output as well as further refine  its strong points which are economyl and safety  .
First of all , the biggest advantage of VHTR over othert reactors is that it not only generates electricity but also Hydrogen .
dioxideration of Hydrogen brings about two improvements of the reactors .
The first one is that the efficiency of the conversion of the heat genearguing nuclear fission increses a lot .
In other words , the heat is more fully used .
The other one is that the Hydrogen provides a good fuel to substitute peway .
The Hydrogen powered cars remain the combustible engine .
Unlike elctrical cars' battery engine which needs more twasraised .
It isarged , the Hydrogen powered cars need much less time to be filled with hydrogen fuel .
Apart from this , the hydrogen fuel has higher combustion energy and lighter weight .
Acoording to scientific measurement , the energy genrerated by per unit hydrogen is about 2 .6 times than fossil fuel .
(Hydrogen , 1995) Moreover , there are four realities suggesting that the current energy system is not sustainable .
The growing energy demand , the tense political situation caused , too much emission of carbon dioxide and the susceptible third world economies all point out this unstainbilty .
(A sustainable energy economy , 2007) .
Things must be done to change this energy system .
And the huge generation of electricity and Hydrogen decides the essentiality to develop VHTR .
Some opponents will say that large sum of money may be spent on the research and be pessimistic about the result .
However , the cost is what we should not consider .
According to an American report , USA spent about 25 billion dollars only on the oil report last year .
(Reducing America's oil dependence ,2008) .
That is to say about 385 dollars tax will be imposed on every person in America .
Comparing to the huge cost , the money spent ink at problem in the long term .
We must know clearly about the benefit VHTR will bring to us once the research is successfully done .
Henceforth , our energy supply can be guaranteed .
Safety may be the most controversial point .
Indeed , we can never deny that nuclear power is dangerous .
However , generateddiscontinue the research on the VHTR justgreater thanause it is dangerous .
Actually , in our modern world , many beautiful things are dangerous .
We enjoy the excitement brought by the roller coaster and the convenience and the enjoyment brought by cars .
They all have dangers .
Accoding to car crash states in America in 2005 , there were nearly 6 ,420 ,000 auto accidents and about 40 ,000 people are killed .
(Car accident statistics , 2005) .
However , we never forbid people from driving cars .
Instead , we make traffic rules to make drivers drive more carefully to avoid accidents .
Similarly , although we know the nuclear energy is too huge to be safe , the unstainable energy system forces us to make full use of it .
And because we know very clearly that it is dangerous , we devote very much effort to monitor the whole process in case accident happens .
Hence , we can feel safe to use the electricity and drive cars powered by Hydrogen which is supplied by VHTR .
happenaccidentsweredangerousoverthe problemIn conclusion , energy is the a largeo keeping our society and economy development sustainable .
So far , the nuclear reactor especially VHTR maybe the best choice to supply the energy .
Undeniably , nuclear power is always dangerous .
However , we must realize that the probability is very low and many measures have been taken to guarantee the security .
Thus , it is essential to do research on VHTR and it will deserve the effort and the funds we spend in the future .

The very high temperature reactor , belonging to the new generation , has a high efficiency of energy conversion and the applications can be extend to hydrogen generation .
Firstly , it uses graphite as a moderator , a substance which neutrons collide with , so that the efficiency is demandd .
During the process , the moderator is one owayshe important ingredients .
A good moderator is the one that should not absorb too much energy when the neutrons bounce off nor absorb the neutrons before they split .
Graphite is nucleare comparExpertsdinary moderator which is water nuclearphite is hwhich  are resistant .
So using graphite increases the efficiency of the usage of uranium and reduce the lost of energy .
Secondly , operating at very high temperatures , a much higher proportion of the energy from the core can be turned into electricity and a much higher proportion of the U235 can be split .
Besides , due to the high temperature , hydrogen , which can be used in transportation and other industry is also produced from water splitting (Elder , 2009) .
While , People still wonder if safety is guaranteed after the accident related to the VHTR basic design which has a potential to cause the destruction of the reactor core (Takeda , 2001) .
However , several factors can help ease people's concern .
First is the choice for the coolant .
Helium , an inert gas , can reduce the risk from loss of coolant accidents .
Helium can be used at verygh temperatures without concerns about corrosion and without affinity to a chemical reaction .
Additionally , when it is exposed to radiation , it will not be radioactive .
Besides , the grawater , , used as the moderator , has large So ,ermal inertia , a high heat capacity and a stable structure even at hireducesperatloss .
Moreover , the fuel is coated uranium-oxycarbide , which permits high burn-up and retains fission products .
Therefore with these design , the risk could be lowered .
In addition , now computational methods can be used for simulating air ingress in the VHTR to help prevent the accident (Kim , 2009) .
fpeoplefety issue , in order to implement the very high temperature reactor , people also concern about the economic factor .
Without arguing , it is more expensive to build a new clear plant , while , after the start-up , the operating cost is cheaper because of ofh-efficiency , lower-cost high-temperature reactor for electricity and hydrogen production .
Reported by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , the overall operating costs for nuclear power plants is roughly the same as the recent coal-fired plants and below the costs of operating most gas-fired generation units (Forsberg , Peterson , Zhao , 2006) .
Besides , a technoeconomic optimization method has developed and can be applied to the power conversion system of a very high temperature reactor , taking both investment costs and operating costs into acthis (Mansilla , 2008) Concerning over the energy resonewe availability , climate change , air quality , and energy security issue , nuclear power may take an important role in future .
The very high temperature reactor , being one of the possible systems of new generation power , which is aim to achieve improvements in economic competitiveness , nuclear safety , is promising to be implemented in the future .
Firstly , people wonder whether scientists can find a suitable material that can withstand such high temperature , more than 1000 , comparing to that of the current nuclear reactor which is less 330 .
(World nuclear association , 2009) .
It is true that there is a huge jump between these two levat does not necessarily mean impossible .
In 2004 , Japenergya test on a nuclear plant in which the temperature reached 950 .
(Declan Butler , 2004) Besides the encouraging practice experience , scientisif there exists ame amazing ways to reach much higher temperaturare concernedetically .
Scientists can use a certain way to significantly increase the thermal property .
They can even get a kind of materialZrCwhich has a melting point of 3540 .
(James W . Sterbentz , n .d .) .
It is estimated that the first VHTR can be built around 2020 .
If the research in the material is financially supported well , this material obstacle will be overcome by that time .
Secondly , some people concern about leaking of radioactivity after a period of running although the reactor maybe good enough to comparedradioactivity inside at the beginning .
Scientifically speaking , this problem belongs to the life of material area .
As mentioned in the last paragraph , the material that will be used to bumean it is impossible can withstand the high temperature .
Consequently , the only aspect left is the corrosion factor .
The most serious corrosion factor is due to the radiation .
That is why engineers have set the timeline to replace some certain parts of the reactor that maybe not safe after some years .
For instance , the graphite should be replaced every 4 to 10 years .
(U .S . DOE nuclear energy research advisory committee , 2009) .
The other common aspect that may have some influence in the safety area is the reaction between coolant and the crust of the reactor which may directly results in radioactivity leaking and even explosion .
However , it is not a big problem for VHTR because the coolant of this reactor is helium , which is an inert gas .
It does not react with the crust even though it is under the high temperature .
That is to say , the possibility of radiation leaking closes to zero in the VHTR .
explosionsleakageradioactivemay not beThirdly , some people dare concernedhink thleakagean get enough benefit if we build this reactor at such high expense .
It is indeed quite expensive to build such a reactor but we cannot look down upon the benefit that we will get after the reactor works .
According to the design , VHTR could squeeze 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel comparing to the traditional reactors and it also can produce hydrogen at the same time which is considered as an ideal energy .
(Shuwen "Eric" Wang , 2005) .
VHTR is worth building .
With  rapid industrialisation , the energy requirements of the world are increasing exponentially .It has increased to a point where the conventional sources of energy are no longer able to meet the demands .
There is also the problem of pollution which is becoming graver everyday and threatens to eradicate life altogether on this planet .
This calls for rapid steps to be taken .
The present idea is to substitute these fuels to an extent with nuclear energy .
The problem with nuclear fuel is that it is extremely hazardous and painstaking research into effective tapping of the nuclear energy continues everyday .
After the Chernobyl disaster involving the radioactive substances escaping the nuclear reactors and killing several people , the world has realised it wants an effective  , clean and safe way to tap this dangerous energy source .
The VHTR can not only supply heat to a broad range of high temperature and energy intensive processes but also produce electricity to meet the modern demands .Also in the end , hydrogen is produced , which clearly is a huge benefit as the energy required to produce pure hydrogen is really tremendous .
The coolant used in this type of reactor is not water but helium .
Helium is an inert gas .
Hence exposing it to radiation does not make it radioactive , thus averting a major health hazard .Because of helium being used as the coolant very high temperatures such as 1000C are possible , thus increasing its efficiency manifold .
The fuel which is used in VHTR is uranium carbide pellets which are extremely heat resistant .
One of the major reasons for accidents in a nuclear power plant is the meltdown within a nuclear reactor .
With the fuel being so thermally inactive that it doesn't break down even in the event of a meltdown clearly poses as a major safety advantage .Another advantage is that the VHTR does not require frequent refuelling which extracts a heavy toll on the human labour  .
This takes care of a potential risk , human error .
In fact , the refuelling in this type of reactor can be achieved when it is still running .It is so highly efficient that a single pebble can last upto three years .
(U .S Department of Energy)
A hundred percent safe and efficient design for a nuclear power plant is theoretically impossible .
However with the present level of research we shall be safe to set our hopes on the Generation 4 reactors  , with their advanced design and coolants  .
The use of nuclear fuel has always been received with some scepticism  , which is actually beneficial as it isn't yet a safe energy resource .
But with the fossil fuels drying up so fast  , we don't have any other choice .
With the green house effect threatening to cause severe climatic changes  , it is really wise to switch from burning fossil fuels to nuclear fuel .Research still proceeds everyday in perfecting this .
Maybe several years from now there will be an even more efficient way to tap the nuclear energy .
Till then let the innovations keep pouring in .
Nuclear power promises a viable source of energy which is far cleaner and more cost effective than conventional thermal power stations .
However , there have been strongly differing views .
This is primarily due to safety , security and cost issues which can affect the public adversely .
The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of the new Generation IV reactors that is currently under research .
This new generation nuclear plant has been designed to deal with imminent concerns so as to prepare us for the nuclear power era .
Hence , there are plausible reasons to fund research and development projects pertaining to this area .
Critics of nuclear power maintain that the production of nuclear power is dangerous as there is a dangerous possibility of a radioactive leakage .
However , due to technological advancements in the VHTR , this is no longer an area of concern .
The coolant used in VHTR is helium , an inert gas that does not react chemically with any material .
Exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive .
As such , a leakage would not be radioactive .
The VHTR is a safe reactor which has a 'pebble bed core' .
Spherical fuel elements are termed as 'pebbles' .
Each pebble , containing thousands of micro fuel particles , is essentially a mini nuclear reactor made of graphite .
These pebbles are coated with multiple layers of hard ceramic  which results in the pebbles being extremely heat resistant .
If a meltdown were to occur , the pebbles will not crack easily or release harmful radiation or fission products .
As such , a leakage is unlikely to be radioactive in nature .
Another argument from the opponents of nuclear power is that nuclear waste is non-biodegradable and that radiation from the waste is deadly for those who are constantly exposed to it .
However , the amount of nuclear waste and its negative effects will be greatly reduced with the use of VHTR .
The VHTR has the ability of using existing nuclear waste to produce electricity .
This will considerably reduce the amount of nuclear waste produced .
The half-lives of these nuclear wastes will be shortened to just a few decades instead of the few millennia with the existing technology .
With future technological breakthroughs  , nuclear waste disposal  will no longer be a concern .
Lastly , the public is concerned about the high price related to the production of nuclear energy .
The energy produced by the VHTR can be kept low due to the substantial amount of nuclear energy being produced compared to other energy sources such as coal , oil and wind .
According to statistics , the cost of producing per kilowatt-hour of nuclear power is only slightly above 2 cents in recent years , the lowest as compared to gas , coal and oil which are the three main energy sources in the world .
The implicit cost of pollution that we have to pay is also essentially zero .
This is because the only emission to the environment is steam , which does not pollute the environment in any manner .
Thus , cost should not be an area of concern for the general public .
The most defining issue regarding robots is  safety  .
It is not uncommon for people to experience a machine breakdown halfway through an important process , which can be frustrating and may sometimes lead to significant losses .
The breakdown may be a result of a mechanical part failure or a lack of power supply .
In the case of robotic surgery , a breakdown in the middle of an  operation can be disastrous .
The sudden discontinuation of the robot may hamper the proceedings of the operation , increasing the chances of infection and possibility of death .
To counter these problems , robotic systems like the Da Vinci System have in place a self-check mechanism that allows proper shutting down of the system in the event of a failure in either the self-check or the power source (Safety , 2008) .
This allows the surgeon in charge to be able to continue  with the surgery conventionally .
In this way , there would not be a huge time period where the patient is left with an open incision , thereby keeping any possible chances of infection to a minimum .
Although there may be many doubts on robotic surgery , the benefits of it should not be overlooked .
As robotic surgery is also known as minimally invasive surgery , it does exactly what its name suggests .
The incision required for this operation is much smaller than traditional methods .
This signifies a massive improvement in recovery time and less pain endured by patients (Young , 2007) .
Also , as machines can be sterilized more effectively than humans , there is a lower chance of them being contaminated by external factors , which means less chance of the patient being infected .
robots for surgery is still in a developing stage .
It is vital that the safety aspects of the system be ameliorated before they can be implemented on a wider scale .
With the constant upgrading of the robots and surgeons , the time is nigh for humans to embrace robots as the new generation of surgeons .
First of all , people who do not support the development of nuclear power are worried about the safety during the nuclear powhave turnedrocessing .
Chersourcesaccident givpeople a big shock .
However , I think that people should not judge the thing by their own view .
For example , even though the accicomingrate of train is much higher than that of airplane , many people are still afraid of travelling by air .
There are two major safety problems of building nuclear plants .
Fhealth .
Comparinaccidents ,other five generation cexplodingthe waste in VHdyingwill 1986 ,ctly to repository so that we would not worry about the radiation .
Second , the big accident during the reactor processing will destroy "capital assets" , and people will lose nfidence in nuclear power research CITATION The03 \l 2052 (The Future of Nuclear Power , 2003) .
It seems that VHTR might be very dangerous since it needs high temperature and high pressure .
However , the "inherent safety features of the fuelproblemsactor" make VHTR become more reliable CITATION SMM03 \l 2052 (Modro , 2003) .
In short , VHTR has good safety control
conttrol .Secondly , some people may think that nuclear reaction will spend a lot of money on building a large factory aitsechnology equThe Chernobylspecially gaveHTR , it will spend large amount of money on special materials that thingsd high temperature and high pressure .
However , in the long round , trainsar factories will produce morairplanes than other reactor concepts .
At first , since the VHTR has been arrange in to a direct cycle , it will save much money to build a waste recycler .
Second , the high efficiency up to 50% , which is the highest among six generation IV reactor concepts , will bring a lot of economy profit to factory .
Last but not least , VHTR will not only produce the electricity but also the hydrogen .
Therefore , we can get a lot of benefit through VHTR .
Besides the safety and economic issue , some preactorse worrrequirebout the performto buildhe VHneedes graphite-moderated procesThe VHTR will require large amounts of money to be spent VHT09 \l 2052 (VHTR , 2009) .
Itprovideases the temperature to 1000 degree by using "high core ouruntemperature" .
This high-efficiency system is wildly used in the "high-temperature , energy-intensive and non-electric processes" .
Even though VHTR still needs further research in heat-resistant fuels and materials , it has developed fast though early cold fast neutron reactor and Pebble Bed Modular Reactor .
Cons the large the factoryc benefit VHTR can bring , governments tend to put to the first place tovelop .
It is predicted that this system cabenefitsrformed by 2020 .
as top priorityIn conclusion , VHTR has a high-eissuesency system that can produce electricity and hydrogen , and reactorsigh rank of safety .
With the effort that the scientists and the engineers put into development of nuclear power , I believe that nuclear power will supplant the fossil-fuel and become a major power in our daily life .
a highReferences:
Advocates and committees formed around the world to reduce global warming have been very active in the recent years .
Looking into every single opportunity to decrease the greenhouse gases emittedg into the atmosphere , we realise energy sources may be one of the emphatic points to be revised .
Many of the energy producing sources produce inadmissible air pollutants and greenhouse gases which are very harmful to the environment .
Nuclear power is one of the alternative energy sources that is being considered to arbitrate these problems due to its efficiencies and environmental friendly processes .
With the new generation IV reactor concepts , Lead-cooled fast reactor is the paramount choice for producing nuclear power as it surpasses the other reactors in terms of different aspects (Butler , 2004) .
With further research and development , Lead cooled fast reactors will be the future energy source which make security , cost and performance problems precedent .
Nuclear reactors haven been mistaken for a time bomb waiting to explode anytime because of the tremendous pressure contained inside .
It is also believed to cause a catastrophic accident that is very disastrous with any slight technical or human error .
Rebutting , it is actually not true as a power plant is too big to convert a part of its U-235 or plutonium into fission fragments and generate enough heat to fly apart .
On the contrary , a bomb is a compact object so the neutrons need not travel far to hit another fissionable atom which is what makes it so powerful .
This is a fact based on the fundamentals of physics on how fast fission neutrons travel (John , 1995) .
Lead-cooled fast reactors are also built with superior materials to resist strong knockings and vibrations to prevent any leakages of radioactive substances into the atmosphere .
It has been a strain to convince the public to allow nuclear reactors as they involve large amounts of radioactivity .
Accidents that have happened and serve as evidence of the dangers involving nuclear reactors .
However , accidents involving nuclear reactors have been relatively small , compared to cave-ins in coal mines which often kill hundreds .
Nothing is perfectly safe but nuclear energy is definitely safe enough to be relied upon as an energy source .
(John , 1995) Furthermore , lead-cooled fast reactor will be much safer compared to the conventional plants with  better and more comprehensive safety features .
It also operates at lower pressure compared to other contenders .
On top of that , according to Donald W .M .
(2004) , not only are low to moderate doses of ionizing radiation  not harmful , they stimulate the immune system and check oxidation of DNA through a process known as "radiation hormesis" , preventing cancer too .
The costs of the nuclear power may be astronomical as it involves the construction cost , operating cost and cost of waste disposal from the plant .
people may expect design flaws in the plants and calculated the maintenance to incur more costs in a long run .
Nevertheless , nuclear power now is substantially cheaper and it is expected to be even lower in the near future through further research and development .
It has been substantially proven from the improvement of the 2nd generation to the 3rd generation reactors by reducing the cost to produce per kilowatt of power from USD $1400 to below USD $1000 .
(Nuclear info , 2009)
Other favoured energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines are strongly encouraged by some .
They are claimed to be "safer" energy sources as the probability  accidents are deemed to be lower .
Altercating , they are much less efficient and less reliable compared to nuclear power produced by Lead-cooled fast reactors .
Having the need of finding the strategic locations and  producing energy only at certain time of the year , they are not preferred in reality .
For instance , compared to the 19 percent of the toal energy the nuclear reactors in US produced , solar panels and wind turbines contributed only 0 .1 percent .
(Donald W .M . , 2004) Recognising the efficiency , India also planned to raise the amount of power it generates from nuclear energy by a hundred times in a 3 stage strategy by 2050 .
(Ravi , 2009)
werein1Depletion of project integrity
Normally , the public criticize engineers for their carelessness and strongly suggest raising engineers' level of responsibility .
In my own opinion , it is absolutely right to be responsible and alert when controlling and handling .
However , in many cases , engineers' carelessness results from their overworking .
For example , in Chernobyl's case , on the day when the accidentsts had been working for as long as 24 hours .
It is conceivable that any mistake could be made at that moment .
Actualdecidedwadays the rapid-developing technology and resultant economic effect over-focus on the impvto preventhe equipment and machines , which strictly requires human's adaptation to them .
From psychologists' point of view , the engineers have to take on more pressure which finally causes all sorts of negative impact on them and certainly do nothing effective to their daily work .
Moreover , in many coucriticiseshe governments usually do not pay enough attention to engineers except when one must come out to take the consequences .
This is unfair to engineers , the most important founders of modern world .
As it is suggested by psychology , providing favorable working conditions and environment for engineers can be an important element in preventing accidents from happening .
Yet the design of environment of workplaces is just the very process which is neglected by most of the governments and industry directors .
The glarerapidly-developing temperature , vibration , high humidity , acceleration and other physical factors can seriously affect the performance of engineers and both their p and mea psychologist'sTherefore , psychologists can play an irreplaceable role in designing workplaces by analyzing the structure of users' physical and mendoesl system so as to guarantee that workers can perform in a good condition from start to finish .
Relieving fatigue and restores vitality should be the best way for engineers to prevent accidents .
restoringsystemsThird , the public criticism upon engineers needs to be more objective when referring to the theory of possibility .
Just like whbear/  face .Wilpert have illustrated in Psychology and design processes , engineers are humthe modern it is possible for human to make mistakes , in other words , engineers need more understanding from the society in a sense .
In theoretical speaking , everything must eventually fail to perform its given function .
The possibility is there .
That is why accidents are called "accidents" and that is why human are called "human" not "god" .
In conclusion , study of psycofgy regarding prevention of accidents is necessary under this people-oriented situation .
as should nothase been over-expected; after all , engineers are also ordinary people and have limitations of human as well .
As human , they need relaxing , they need working in sound conditi and they t Theoreticallyng and recognition of the society as well .
Only if the key players , engineers , are concerned and given due attention can the world of engineering run in the righhumansectiot is the best approach to prevent accidents .
Fortunately , a new subject named "Engineering Psychology" has already started to boom recently , which is concerned with adapting the equipment and environment to people , based upon their psychological capacities and limitations .
From the development and achievements of this subject in not-too-distant future , the choice for a better design and the way to prevent accidents can be directly obtained .
First , opponents claim that the VHTR requires materials to reach high standard and currently there is no suitable candidate .
It is true that the requirement for the materials is tough to meet .
Materials used in the internal core structure are required to withstand at least 1000 degrees centigrade which is much higher than the melting points of most materials .
In fact , there is still a small number of ceramic and metallic materials with high melting temperatures and they are the potential materials for VHTR , such as carborundum with a melting temperature of 2730 degrees centigrade and tungsten with a melting temperature of 3410 degrees centigrade (Callister , 2007) .
Besides , aerospace materials are a source of reference for scientists .
The surface temperature of a space shuttle can reach more than 2000 degrees centigrade and certain materials have b successfully used .
Currently scientists are doing research to find new high-temperature-resistant materials .
In general , we are confident to develop suitable materials for VHTR .
Secondly , skeptics argue that there is potential safety hazard .
Ia high reasonable that people concern a lot about the safety since the Chernobyl accident and Three Mile Island accident happened .
Nuclear accidents are deadly disasters , causing economic losses as well as huge damage to the environment and people's health .
According to McCarthy (2009) , the VHTR is quite safe due to its special design which is different from reactors of the Chernobyl type .
Having a negative temperature coefficient , the VHTR can automatically slow down the nuclear reaction inside the core when the temperature rises .
This feature ensures that the temperature in a VHTR core can never be high enough to trigger a meltdown .
With this special design , the VHTR can shut down itself once anything abnormal happens .
Therefore , safety can be ensured for the VHTR .
Accidents like the Chernobyl accident will never happen to the VHTR .
Thirdly , critics argue that the construa potentialthe VHTR is too expensto assumese of the neware concernedlogies applien the reactor design and high standard for materials , new materials and vessels , which may cost millions of dollars , are used in the construction .
However , the benefit attained from the VHTR can cover the high cost .
Scientists pointed out that the VHTR is a highly efficient system .
It will produce electricity about 40 percent more efficiently than most reactors in America do now and its hydrogen production is about 50 percent higher than the existing methods .
Besides , the heat it generates is also useful for refineries , perochemistry and metallurgy (The Generation IV and Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative Programs , para .3) .
Thus , although initially the construction expense is high , later more profit can be achieved .
more profit can be achieved laterinitialalthough theIn conclusion , obstacles like lack of materials , safety problems and high construction cost all can be overcome .
The VHTR is a safe and profitable nuclear reactor with excellent prospect .
Thus , the VHTR is worth further research .
Hopefully , it will be widely used within a decade .
Opponents of roboticwasuperformedintain that this surgery is of high danbyr , such as incorrect tools ,n and fault of its running program which can result in inevitable consequence .
Actually , safeissue is also the major factor for scientists doing research on robotic surgery to consider , since any tiny mistake means a life at risk .
Before a robotic surgery machine is put into use , stricameraspection will be imagesed on it to ensure enabling .
Meanwhile , the outcomes of robotic surgery also reveal that it is ahave also raised concerns aboutAmerica , with the approval of FDA (Food and Drug Administration) Intuitive Surgical (Mountain View , CA) have studied the use of its robotic surgery system on 113 patients , and then compared it with those of 132 patients who undertook the conventional surgery .
Results have showed that robotic surgery was comparable to conventional one in safety and effectiveness , according to FDA .
(Tracy , 2001)
For the cost issue , robotic surgery indeed requires large chighly dangerous .h IncorrectThis is because extremely sensitive elemere used to captdisastrousconsequencesation during the suissuesaren addition , to train surgeons how to operate the equipment is also a large expenditure .
However , robotic surgery has the advantages over conventional surgery which are worth the cost , such as precise cut , ldoneod loss and short recoverOn the other hand As robotic surgery gains acceptance , the more manufacture of it will reduce the cost .
There is a large market for robotic surgery and in the U .S , 80000 robotic surgery cases were complethasn 2008 (Reuters , 2009) .
According to Robin (2006) , hospitals have been picking up the difference in costs in order tunderwentitaff trained on the systems so 
Some people doubt the performance of robotic surgery .
They claim that robots lack flexibility and can only perform what the designers have put in the program .
So when unknown situation happens robots cannot cope witrainingn fact , thurrent robotic surgery system serves as assistance in surgery .
The main role is still human surgeon who will make judgment , and the robot itself cannot do anything without human operating .
The completely artificial intelligent robot is not available atincreased production of such machineshould not be worried about no human presence .
The future of robotic surgery is prospecting .
Continuous advances in technology on one had will bring down the possibility of error occurring , on the other hand allow an unknownhine to shut down safely if any emergency happens .
In Canada , with vast land and remote rural counto assistment has been investing in remote roa human surgery to improve its healthcare level (Robin , 2006) .
This is also a new orientation instructionsic surgery development .
In summary , the opposing viewpoints are not valid .
On the contrary , many people have really benefited from robotic surgery .
It does not mean thand robotic surgery will one day fully replace the conventional human surgery but it provides an alternative and attractive way of doing surgery .
The combination of the two will also make modern surgery up to a new level .
According to surgeons , patients' feedback on robotic surgery has been very positive (Tracy , 2001) .
Therefore , in my opinion , robotic surgery is worth developing and trusting .
Opponents of nuclear power claim that the funding for designing and operating a nuclear plant is huge and yet it is undeniably a fact , but they losetooksight of the crucial point of the highly efficient electricity generating system in a nuclear plant .
For example , according to WASHINGTON , over the first 14 days of August in 2007 , the average daily capacity factor of the nuclear power industry , 104 nuclear power plants in the U .S was 98 .3 percent .
(WASHINGTON , August 27 , 2007) More important , compared with 33% efficiency for currenpower water reactors , the high thermal efficiency (about 45%) and considerable plant simplification maweapons .
But promising advanced nuclear systems .
(Idaho National Laboratory , SCWR) Cheaper and more efficient , the features of SCWRs are superior to others of Generatioextending
Another significant opposition to nuclear power is the potential nuclear leakage issue .
People have been confused with fears of reactor accidents , while the probabilities of reactor accidents have been determined and they are very small indeed .
(Bernard L . Cohen .
The Nuclear power Advantage) Loss of life expectancy (LLE) due to various risks in U .S . shows that compared with cancer 980 LLE (days) and heart disease with 2300 LLE (days) , nuclear is much safer and ranks the last with 0 .0importantlyys) .
A generally acknowledged fact of clean energy is another important advantage for nuclear energy .
No carbon dioxide emission and no contribution to aciarain or global warming , makesystemar energy fully deserve energetic support .
The last argument raised by opponents is about the prepotency of other sources , such as solar and wind .
Since wind and sunlight is free with zero-waste , it seems better to focus on the development of these green sources .
Nevertheless we cannot neglect the current technology of wind or solar power is not available to meet our needs for abundant energy .
Moreover , the facilities of wind and solar power are so expensive that they are even dangermpetitive than coal and gas .
These renewable energies like solar heavily depend on the activity of the weather .
As for nuclear power , there will be power once uranium is supplied , which makes the anxiousness about interruptions to the electricity generation pdeserving of energyicance .
(Michael Ashcroft , Reliable) Furthermore , SCWRs is the only one of Generation IV whose coolant will be water , which means that it will be more practical than others owing to the wide distribution of water .
In brief , the energy generation of SCWRs is the most operative mode .
Contrary to the opposition to nuclear power which is not convincing , nuclear power has advantages in many areas .
The form of thearenergy generation is the most efficient .
Nuclear power is also friendly to the environment .
Independence with the wneglect the fact that wind or solar power might not always be available .t promising energy source .

Many people doubt the safety of nuclear plantsamountshus oppose the construction of new nuclear plants .
However , the VHTR has resolved smaller of the safety concerns and proved to be much safer .The VHTR can be a pebble-bed reactor like HTR-10 in China .
The fuel is in the form of small pebbles with uranium dioxide (UO2) inside and a graphite coat .
Each pebble can perform as a "mini" reactor independently .
"The pebble-bed reactor has high safety and relbility griss due to the inherent safety features of the fuel and reactor .
It also gets good ratings for prwereferation resistance and physical protection (Hylko , 2008)" .
Furthermore , it has been proved that with all the supporting machinery failing , the reactor will not crack , melt or explode .
"It simpobtainss up to a designed "idle" frommperature and sTo date ,here .
In that state , the reactor vessel radiates heat , but the vessel and fuel spheres remain intact and undamaged" .
(FHSST Authors , 2005) .
"Even after decommissioning , the VHTR can still discharge surplus heat and do not need additional safety systems like other types of reactors do" .
"The HTR-10 was subject to a test of its intrinsic safety in September 2004 when it was shut down with no cooling .
Fuel temperature reached less than 1600  C but there was still no failure" (World's First Commercial High Temperature Nuclear Reactor starts construction in China in 2009 , 2008) .
doesEfficiency is another problem that challenges many nuclear reactors .
But this is no problem because of the nature of the VHTR .Running at very high temperatures of about 700-900 C , the VHTR can supple energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen , providing hydrogen for the nation's industry .
According to Hylko (2008) , the VHTR has relacoatingly higher efficiency for heat transfer and hydrogen production .
"It can squeeze 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel" (Butler , 2004) .
Moreover , bearing the property of running at such high temperatures , the VHTR can also realise "deep-burn" , during which up to 65% of the initial fuel is burnt .
This shows great advantage over the conventional reactors who possess burn-up levels of around 5% .
"Moreover , instead of 95% of the uranium going into nuclear waste , this kind of reactor would only turn 35% of it into waste" (TendersInfo , 2008) , which will help with theundamaged" (FHSST Authors , 2005) .us radioactive wastes .
whichIt is understandable that many people doubt if there is anyone willing to inject money into this new reactor since is costs great amounts of money and time .
However , as is mentioned , the VHTR asupplythe design of pebble-bed , making it possible to realize the concept of "modular reactors" .
Modular reactors are reactors that can be deployed part by part and each part can work independently .
Therefore , the initial invest to build the reactor can be controlled at an acceptable level , so is the construction period .
All these will make the VHTR more competitive in the fierce competition of today's energy market (Renkai , 2000) .
investmentTo sum up , the VHTR is highly safe and reliable .
It can perform high efficiency with an acceptable initial invest and construction period .
As a result , the VHTR is more favourable among the 6 Generation-IV concepts and further research and development funding should go for it .

Nevertheless , according to Idaho National Laboratory's study (2009) , the VHTR system should be high-efficiency .

In short , the performance of VHTR is excellent through using so many advanced technologies .

developmentenergy needsReference:
The Chernobylgineering Design Process , Ertas and Jones (1996) notes that engineering design is the process of devising causeda total of system or process to meet desired needs , and it is a decision making process .
Design is a human activity , and human may make mistakes .
Therefore , designers may make mistakes in the design process .
Psychology is the scientific investigation of humans' mental process and behavior .
(Kowalski & Westen , 2005) Using psychology to analyze how the designers think can point out the flaws in their thinking process .
In this way , psychology could help designers to minimize their mistakes in the design process (Wilpert , 2007) .
Thus , possible accidents may be prevented .
In The Truth about Chernobyl , the author , Medvedev (1991) , notes that one of the reasons which cause Chernobyl accident is the inadequate operators with insufficient knowledge operated the reactor inappropriately .
It is true that the operhumans not happened in the design process .
However , the use of psychology in the design process could prevent inappropriate operations from happening .
In the design process , designers should consider the user of devices , components or systems under development , which includes people who maintain and repair the product as well as who operate it (Ertas & Jones , 1996) .
However , the high technical knowledge of the designers may make them overestimate competence of the users .
Therefore , they give insufficient instructions to the users to equip them with equivalent competence (Wilpert , 2007) .
Obviously , in the case of Chernobyl accident , the operator did not have a well-designed instruction manual and was not adequately trained .
If psychology was used in the design process , it would point out this flaw and advise designers to provide an adequate instruction manual including the operations in emergencies so that operators would know how to operate the reactor when facing emergencies .
In this way , Chernobyl accident may be prevented .
Medvedev (1991) mentions in his book that the RBMK reactor in Chernobyl had a dangerously largecausedtive void coefficient and a defect in the design of the reactor protection aoperatingol system .
The designers was aware of the defects of the reactors , however , they did not make efforts to correct them .
Some people argue that these defects caused the Chernobyl accident , psychology cannot solve them .
Technically , psychology could not solve the technical problem for engineers .
But , psychology could point out the potential danger and consequence of the problem so that enoperates would search for better options .
If the designers know the severe consequence of the accident , they would try their best to prevent it .
Psychologists could also indicate the flaws in the design process and advise designers to lower the positive void coefficient and enhance the protection and control system in this case .
Thus , the disaster may be prevented .
would have triedknewIn conclusion , Chernobyl is a result of flawed design of reactor and inappropriate operation by inadequate operators .
However , the use o f psychology in the design process would be helpful to preventdesigners werel disaster .
The errors in the design process and the operation process may be prevented with the help of psychology .
Nowadays , developed countries and developing countries have invested huge funds to develop nuclear power as nuclear energy is regarded  to be the potential energy source for the future (Butler , 2004) .
However , the large amount of R&D funding needed for Generation IV nuclear reactors has made the development of nuclear power a controversial issue .
From a long term perspective , there should be R&D funding for the development of Generation IV reactors since Generation IV reactors are safer , cheaper and cleaner .
First of all , nuclear power is a sustainable energy source in the long term when developed properly .
Generation IV reactors are much cleaner than previous generations .
They will help reduce carbon dioxide and subsequently reduce the effect of global warming (Jacques & Ralph , 2008) .
Jacques and Ralph claimed in Generation IV Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems: "According to Princeton University's Carbon Mitigation Initiative , increasing the number of nuclear power plants to 1000 worldwide-more than double what it is today could avoid one billion tons of carbon emissions per year by 2055 ."
The statistics have shown that the success of development of Generation IV reactors will bring a great improvement to the living environment for human beings in the future .
In the long term , funds should be given to support the development of Generation IV reactors at current stage .
Some may argue that until now , the scientists and researchers are still researching new materials to reduce radioactive leak and wastage (Butler , 2004) .
The success seems to be too far away for the public to feel .
However , this is the reason why more funds must be given to support further research for Generation IV reactors .
Scientists and researchers should be given financial support to overcome difficulties they face during research rather than give up half way .
Therefore , the development of Generation IV reactors deserves R&D funding .
Thirdly , Generation IV nuclear energy systems operations will make further improvement in safety and reliability (Michael , 2005) .
Safety  is one of the most priorities of Generation IV International Forum (GIF) .
The revolution in fuel utilization in Generation IV reactors will reduce the radio toxicity by a large extent (Jacques & Ralph , 2008) .
The public may not trust the ability of scientists and researchers to ensure their safety since they still remember the nuclear power accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and at Chernobyl in Ukraine which caused many people to die (Butler , 2004) .
However , Generation IV reactors are designed to be safer than the previous generations .
Safety issues will be handled with extreme care by all GIF member counties .
Researchers from different countries are doing collaborative research to achieve this common goal (Jacques & Ralph , 2008) .
Thus , the public should look forward to Generation IV reactors' performance rather than oppose it .
Given the advantages mentioned above , I believe that R&D funding should be given to Generation IV reactors .
Even though the fund is limited and by allocating funds for Generation IV reactors , we have to forgo other possible benefits such as spending the same amount of money to solve poverty or terrorism .
I support to explore new and advanced technology , Generation IV reactors , to solve environmental and energy problems .
{Generation IV reactors}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactors]are a set of nuclear reactor designs being researched currently .
Current reactors in use around the world are considered 2nd or 3rd generation systems , with the 1st generation systems having been retired a long time ago .
TheSupercritical water reactor(SCWR)is one of the generation IV reactors .
The concept is that uses{supercritical water}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid]as the working fluid .
Supercritical water-cooled reactors (SCWRS) are the most advanced nuclear systems .They can generate high thermal efficiency .
The main mission of the SCWR is producing of {electricity}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Electricity] .
(Nuclear power plants , 2009) .The proliferation of the new nuclear technology is causing considerable controversy and concern .
Opponents say that nuclear reactors may be a serious threat to the world populace as well as the environment .
However , there are two sides to the coin , in my point of view , the generation IV Supercritical water-cooled reactor is worth building in the near future by analysing the pros and cons .
Opponents are apprehensive about the hazards of nuclear reactors .
There are few nuclear reactors which have  been built in the past decades in many countries .
They cite examples of the nuclear devastations in Chernobyl and the atomic bomb  at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .
(The Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , 2008) .These areas are still adversely affected by radioactive contamination , which is fatal to flora and fauna , after decades . .
The meltdowns at Three Mile Island (TMI) in Pennsylvania and Chernobyl accident in 1986 both were caused by design errors; it was not really the nuclear reactors' fault .
(Backgrounder on the Three Mile Island , 2009) If the governments reject developing the nuclear technology due to these accidents from human error , that is not a valid reason .
Everything has its disadvantages  , even for the new alternative energy , such as wind power , hydro power , and tidal power .
They have their own drawbacks .
The hazards could be avoided if operated  in a proper way , so in my opinion , theSupercritical water reactor(SCWR)
Furthermore , opponents reckon that countries that embarked upon constructive use of nuclear technology tend to also develop nuclear weapons .
Therefore , opponents fear that nations like Iran and North Korea will also procure weapons of mass destruction (WMD) .
For instance , North Korea performed their missile test a few months ago to threaten South Korea and other countries .
This will seriously impact world peace and stability .
However , that is the bad way of using of nuclear technology .
The nuclear reactor can be used to develop cutting-edge medical technology , for instance , in cancer treatment , gamma camera , radiation therapy and so on .
(Nuclear power plants , 2009) .
TheSupercritical water reactor(SCWR)
Finally , opponents also claim that a nuclear reactor should not be built due to its high cost .
If the government spends so much money on building the nuclear plant , it will cut costs on education and health , and even raise taxes .
But they ignore the enormous benefits of nuclear power There is one proverb saying  "No pain , no gain ."
In the near future , it is viewed that the world's energy consumption will be heavily reliant on nuclear power .
Unlike its fossil fuel counterparts , that is petrol , gas and coal , nuclear energy does not cause pollution .
In addition , it is more efficient and productive .
The SCWR design is  simpler than current designs .
The nuclear reaction releases a lot of heat which can used to convert  water into steam .
To be environmentally friendly , build theSupercritical water (SCWR) .
It maymay be costly in the short term , but will procure significant benefits in the long run .
The government can not stop theSupercritical water reactor(SCWR) 
People have always been concerned about the development of nuclear energy .
Today , 104 reactors produce about 20 percent of the United States 'electricity (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
However , it is still a big question whether Generation IV Reactor projects should be funded .
In this case , I'm confident that Generation IV reactors in general and the VHTR concept in particular deserve to be funded around the world .
For a very long time , many people have been worried about the safety of nuclear energy .
Accidents such as Chernobyl have destroyed the Chernobyl-4 reactor and killed 30 people , including 28 from radiation exposure .
However , if we look on the whole , there has not been a serious accident in the nearly 30 years since the Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania experienced a partial core meltdown .
VHTR is the safest concept among other nuclear reactors , due to low decay heat and non-combustible nuclear-grade graphite , which is virtually impossible to be burnt .
Therefore , the use of VHTR is safe and we can believe in the further development of such GenIV nuclear reactor concepts .
Secondly , global warming is what we are concerned about .
It demands a profound transformation in the ways we generate and consume energy .
Our current sources of power like coal and gas are producing Carbon Dioxide , which make the global warming problem worse .
In addition , these sources of power are being used up and we should find  alternative sources of power .
Scientific research concludes that the world must reduce global warming emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 to avoid the most dangerous effects of global warming (UCSUSA , 2009) .
Nuclear power could play a huge role in reducing global warming emissions because nuclear reactors emit almost no carbon while they operate and have low life-cycle emissions .
New generation of reactors such as VHTR will produce relatively cheap electricity while solving the threat posed by global climate change .
U .S power producers have proposed building more than 30 new nuclear reactors and some proponents have called for building as many as 300 plants by mid- century (UCSUSA , 2009) .
Therefore , using GenIV nuclear reactors is a very efficient way to reduce the effects of global warming .
The third concern is whether nuclear power concepts such as VHTR can be widely applied to the whole world .
There are some barriers that may prevent nuclear energy from developing: it is expensive to build a plant , there may be human errors and it still produces radio-active wastes .
However , there are lots of positive features that we can count  .
VHTR produces a high-efficiency electricity production with a broad range of process heat applications , while retaining the safety characteristics in both normal and off-normal events .
VHTR is performed under very high temperature (from 500 to 1000 degrees Celsius) , therefore allowing for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity .
A single power plant can produce a large amount of energy compared to the amount produced by wind so in total , the nuclear energy is a cheap kind of energy .
Finally , the energy power concept like VHTR helps prevent the effects of global warming .
It is safe and efficient , so therefore it can produce a lot of energy and is able to replace traditional sources of energy .
It is clear governments should fund the VHTR nuclear projects to develop it further , and nuclear energy will definitely be the energy of the future .
Some people say that GFR is not safe because it produces plutonium waste which can be used to make nuclear weapons .
Plutonium in repository remains radioactive for several thousand of years ("Energy Resources : Nuclear Power") .
Because of threactors development of GFR is obstructed .
Although GFR produces fuel waste types contains plreactors , it reprocesses its fuel waste such that the amount of waste produced can be cut by about 96 percent of its usual amount ("Fuel Cycles" , page 33 , table 4 .3) .
The plutonium produced from reprocessing of waste stays at a high temperature , making it too hot to be stolen .
In addition , as the fuel waste is recycled , there is no need to replace the fuel for a few years .
For comparison , VHTR can not reprocess their fuel waste , and because of that , the amount of fuel waste that it produces is getting bigger and bigger as the electricity's demand increasing (Rohrer , 2007) .
These prove that GFR is safer and more environmentally-friendly than the VHTR .
Another group of people say that the performance of this reactor is still under VHTR .
Different from VHTR which can work on 1000 degrees Celsius , GFR can work only on 850 degrees Celsius .
They say it makes the energy GFR produces less than VHTR .
In reality , there is no need for reactors to work on 1000 degree Celsius , because the chain reaction of the fuel (in this case Uranium-233's reaction) can be done perfectly only within 850 degreehis means that the amount of energy GFR and VHTR produce is almost the same , although there is 150 degrees difference in their temperature .
This proves that GFR works more efficiently than others such as VHTR .
One more important information that there is no need for GFR to be manually itsated because GFR has already used Thorium which can absorb fast neutrons and decay into Uranium-233 ("Gas-cooledelectricity") .
Thisincreases is cheaper to maintain and safer than VHTR which is needed to be checked every time in order to make it operate safely .
needsis thatIn conclusion , based on the above mentioned points , GFR is proven to be a better option for future deVHTR ,pment .
The reason is because GFR allows its waste to be reprocessed .
Thus , it produThey say GFR produces less energy than VHTR .lso more efficient than other reactors , because it can produce the same energy as VHTR with just 850 degrees for temperature .
atBibliography
Nuclear power can be defined as any nuclear technology that is designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions .
In 1951 , the world's first experimental nuclear reactor station that produced usable amount of electricity from nuclear energy , Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-1) , was built (Nuclear Technologies , n .d) .
Since then , Nuclear power was often seen as the best alternative energy source as it has no carbon emission and can theoretically produce an unlimited amount of energy since nuclear fuel is inexpensive and abundant on earth .
Currently , 15% of the world's electricity supply comes from nuclear power reactors (World Nuclear Power , 2009) .
With the advancement in nuclear technology , the upcoming generation IV reactors , such as the Sodium-cooled fast reactors , will be even safer and more efficient , making nuclear power the best option in providing mankind with enough electricity for now and the future .
However , after major nuclear incidents such as the Chernobyl disaster , the general public have became skeptical about the safety of nuclear power .
Furthermore , nuclear power is often associated with terms like radiations , weapons of mass destruction , high maintenance cost , and targets for terrorism .
This stigma against nuclear power has led  people such as the general public and environmentalists to favor other alternative energies namely wind energy and solar energy , as they are deemed as better choices .
As such , even though mankind are in need of much more energy , the rate of further development and research on the generation IV nuclear reactor , such as the Sodium-cooled fast reactor , still depends heavily on factors such as cost efficiency , safety issues , and environmental friendliness .
The cost efficiency of a power plant is one of the major considerations in deciding whether a power plant should be built .
It is a common fact that nuclear reactors have high set up and maintenance cost .
The decommissioning cost of a nuclear reactor can sometimes be higher .
For example , the Chernobyl reactor requires lots of maintenance even though it is unable to produce any electricity as there are still lots of nuclear fuel left in the reactors .
Lots of money is also required for the clean up process during the decommissioning of a nuclear reactor (More cash for Chernobyl , 2008) .
Many people would thus argue that this money would be better spent on other alternative energy sources such as wind farms and solar panels as these power plants would incur less economical cost .
However , many of these arguments are based on  short run expenditure that one would face when building a nuclear power plant .
In the long run , after considering the higher capital cost , financing costs and operating costs of a nuclear reactor , a nuclear reactor would still produce much cheaper electricity when compared with other alternative energy sources such as wind energy .
This is because a typical nuclear power plant would produce around 3 to 10 billion kWh per year (World Nuclear Power , 2009) .
This amount of electricity produced is more than the total quantity of electricity produced by a collective of few thousands of wind turbines , since a typical wind turbine produces 0 .5 to 3 million kWh per year (Annual energy output , 2003) .
Furthermore , with the new generation IV nuclear power plants , more energy will be produced , increasing the cost efficiency of nuclear power .
In addition , nuclear power plants do not require specific areas for construction , unlike other alternative energies such as wind farms , which will require areas that have sufficient wind speeds , or hydroelectric plants , which will require a large river for the dam .
Having little restrictions on the construction site , the cost of building a nuclear plant is lowered , making it more competitive economically .
It is thus inevitable that nuclear power is much more cost efficient as we look towards the future .
Besides the cost of electricity , it is important for us to excogitate the safety issues regarding the nuclear power plant .
After the Chernobyl accident , one would commonly assume that nuclear reactors are extremely hazardous .
This is because the Chernobyl accident caused many direct fatalities in the explosion and future fatalities due to the effects of nuclear radiation .
The nuclear radiation caused genetic defects , leading to cancer , leukaemia and other body defects for current and future generations (Pflugbeil & Claussen , 2006) .
Besides reactor accidents , nuclear reactors may also be easy targets for terrorism as many nuclear reactors appear to be vulnerable to any form of terrorist attacks .
In addition , nuclear wastes are dangerous as well as they contain high levels of radiation and can be used for weapons of mass destruction as tons of plutonium nuclear waste are produced by nuclear reactors each year and are often recycled to make nuclear weapons .
Furthermore , lots of secrets about nuclear power plants are often kept away from the public due to economic interest of government bodies and private companies , leading to people choosing other alternative energy as they are seemingly much safer .
On the other hand , since the Chernobyl accident  23 years ago , there has not been any other major nuclear power plant accident .
In fact , the numbers of deaths caused by nuclear power plants accidents are much less compared to coal , hydro or natural gas power plants each year (Safety of nuclear , 2008) .
Moreover , Generation IV nuclear reactions , such as the sodium-cooled fast reactors , excel in many safety aspects such as having the ability to withstand up to a magnitude of 8 .2 on the Richter scale and to shut down safely if any accidents were to happen (Nuclear Power Plants , 2009) .
These new reactors are also more reliable and resistant against proliferation , and are able to use their fuel more efficiently , thus producing less plutonium waste (Generation IV , 2009) .
With the technological advancement in nuclear power in mind , nuclear accidents and disasters would be a thing in the past as nuclear power plants will become safer in their operations .
As our earth suffers from the adverse effects of global warming , everyone would probably want to have clean and green electricity .
It is thus important for us to consider whether nuclear power plants are environmental friendly .
Environmentalists would often suggest the use of alternative energy such as wind , hydroelectric , thermal and solar energies as these energies are known to have little emissions of any kind of pollutants .
Nuclear energy is often seen as a bad alternative as it produces lots of radioactive wastes .
These radioactive wastes require special storage areas , which can either take up land or sea space .
Areas used for containment will thus be subjected to contamination after some years if there is any leakage of radioactive waste , which could destroy ecosystems in the areas .
These environmentalists would thus believe that nuclear power's benefits to the environment are insignificant (Nuclear power undermining , 2008) . . On the contrary , these beliefs are often biased against nuclear power .
Nuclear energy , like all other alternative energies , produces no air pollutants or greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides during its daily operations .
Although nuclear wastes will be produced , these are solid wastes that can be stored away safely with current technology .
Nuclear wastes are also under high surveillance that ensures safe transportation and storage (Nuclear Power and the Environment , n .d) .
Furthermore , the nuclear power plants require less land area when compared with other energy sources .
This allows more land areas to be conserved for wildlife and other purposes that benefit the environment .
As such , it is clear that nuclear power is environmentally friendly and should be used so that we can reduce our carbon emissions .
In conclusion , more research and development of Generation IV nuclear power plant should be done as the many benefits of nuclear power  clearly outweigh the disadvantages in many important factors such as cost efficiency , safety issues and environmental friendliness .
The Generation IV sodium-cooled fast reactor will most likely be able to provide mankind with abundant and affordable clean and green energy with minimum risks , and thus removing the stigma on nuclear power .
Generation IV nuclear reactor will allow mankind to fully realize the potential of nuclear power , thus encouraging further development on nuclear technology .
With the sharp increase demand for fuel by emerging economies in the world , it was predicted by some analysts that the world will reach peak oil , the point where half of the world's supply of oil is left , by 2012-2016 (Peak Oil Netherlands Foundation , April 2009) .
As a result of fewer fossil fuel supplies left to be extracted , oil companies will either search for smaller oil fields that will inevitably increase the cost of production of oil or look for unconventional sources of oil such as tar sands that will increase the level of carbon dioxide emission and pollution (World Oil , National Geographic , June 2008) .The increasing demand for oil and the rising level of carbon dioxide emission , which contributes to global warming , have prompted the energy market to search for alternative energy sources .
Nuclear power seems to be one of the promising solutions to the above problems .
The use of nuclear power also faces opposition from the public .
The public is very concerned about the safety of nuclear power plants , the storage of radioactive waste and the cost it has to pay for nuclear power .
In contrast to  public opinion on the adverse effect of building a nuclear power plant , the latest generation IV reactor , Very-High-temperature reactor (VHTR) , is designed to overcome these problems faced by the public .
The public is very concerned about the safety of nuclear power plants and fears that any factors that trigger the explosion of a nuclear reactor will have devastating impact on the people living in the region .
Ever since the partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 and the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 , the public feared that any similar incidents would have grave consequences to the people living around  nuclear power plants .
Pertaining to these concerns , the 'Defense-in-Depth' approach adopted by VHTR consists of prevention and control of abnormal operation and failures , detection of failures , protection against accident progression and mitigation of the effects of severe accidents and substantial amount of released radioactive materials .
Through the implementation of 'Defense-in-Depth' approach , not just safety barriers are protected , but also predicted types of accidents are prevented and mitigated (Source: CEA) .
In addition , the production of hydrogen during the process does pose hazards to the nuclear plants .
This is because the explosion of hydrogen could damage the nuclear reactor .
Consequently , safety measures such as implementing a maximum of 100kg storage of hydrogen near the nuclear reactor and transporting hydrogen gas in double-walled pipes away from the reactor to storage plant at a safe distance (Satyen-Baindur , 2008) .
All these measures are implemented to meet the safety expectation of the operation of nuclear power plant .
Furthermore after 9/11 , nuclear power plants have become the target of terrorists .
Any successful terror attacks on these nuclear plants will have disastrous health and psychological impact on  surviving victims .
Regarding the threat of terrorism on nuclear power plants , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has stepped up measures to tighten security around nuclear power plants .
These measures comprise regular 'force-on-force' exercises to test the plant's ability to react to attacks made on it , vehicle inspection at greater safety distance away from the plant , improved communication among different government organizations and stricter  access to restricted sites (Source: NRC , February 2005) .
Other measures include bullet-proof barriers in important areas , intruding detecting devices , detection zones that are illuminated , well equipped and trained security personnel on daily duty and protection against intrusion of network by outsiders (Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) , July 2009) .
The purpose of these stepped up security measures is to deter any potential terrorist attacks on  nuclear power plants and to have a contingency plan in the event of any attacks .
Another reason why the public and environmentalists oppose  the building of nuclear power plants is that  radioactive waste produced by nuclear power plants will remain radioactive for hundred over years .
When the radioactive waste is not properly stored in location that is of safe distance away from people , the people may be exposed to harmful radiation resulting in serious health effects .
Without proper storage facilities , there are chances of leakage of radiation that will pollute the land and damage the ecosystem .
The public does not need to worry about the large amount of radioactive waste produced by  VHTR because  VTHR spent fuel is contained in a repository that is very resistant to leaching of radioactive materials .
Also the recycling of used fuel also minimizes the production of radioactive waste .
Thus , the process in VHTR produced only electricity and hydrogen and radioactive waste is not disposed and buried underground (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems by US DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee and the Generation IV International Forum , December 2002 , page51-53) .
The public is worried that nuclear power tends to have higher operating and maintenance costs which will result in them paying a higher price than that of coal and a gas power plants .
Such worry is unfounded .
According to the World Nuclear Association , the price of nuclear power is actually competitive with other types of power plants .
For instance in 2007 , the cost of electricity generated by a nuclear plant is about 2 .87cents per kilo-watt hour in comparison with 17 .8 cents per kilo-watt hour in the case of oil power plant in the United States .
The cost of nuclear fuel is as low as 0 .5 cents per kilo-watt hour which is one quarter of that of gas power plant .
As compared to conventional nuclear power plants , there is greater efficiency in generating electricity because VHTR can produce fifty percent more electricity output using the same amount of fuel (The Economics of Nuclear Power by World Nuclear Association , July 2009) .
The process heat can be provided by VHTR to support other industrial activities such as refiningand manufacturing of fertilizers and plastics .
Therefore , the high operation cost of VTHR can be offset by extra revenue earned from these services (Idaho National Laboratory , 2009) .
Moreover , VTHR does not require the disposal of radioactive waste and the cost required for radioactive waste disposal can be minimized .
As the future of oil prices continues to rise due to the scarcity of supply and increase in demand by emerging economies , this will inevitably lead to a more competitive price of nuclear power .
Indeed , there are many concerns from the public regarding the safety of nuclear power plants , the disposal of radioactive waste and the cost of electricity consumers will have to pay .
However , with the designing of generation IV reactors such as VHTR , the problems of radioactive waste disposal and the high cost of electricity generated by nuclear power plant will be solved .
Moreover , there are many safety measures implemented to minimize potential dangers of operating VHTR .
The prospect of nuclear power will remain optimistic and in the future more countries may consider substituting gas and coal power plants for nuclear power plants to generate electricity .
With the increase in global population , the demand for energy is increasing .
According to the International Energy Agency (January 2009) , worldwide energy consumption on average will increase 2% per annum and will double by the next 35 years .
With the fuel prices soaring up , fossil fuel reserves dwindling and increased pressure to tackle climate change and global warming , nuclear energy is back in the agenda of many countries .
In 2001 , amidst increasing debates about nuclear energy , the ten founding nations of Generation IV International Forum also known as GIF decided to work together , collaborating on research activities in the field of nuclear energy (Butler D , 2004) .
These collaborative efforts resulted in building up six possible nuclear reactor concepts known as the generation IV reactors .
However these concepts at that time were still untested and would require years of further extensive research before they could be used in the industry .
Although six possible concepts were developed I personally believe that the molten salt fast reactor concept is the best solution amongst the six .
Nuclear energy is produced by splitting the nuclei of uranium atoms which in turn produce a large amount of energy that is used to drive turbines which produce electricity .
This procedure is extremely efficient so much so that one pound of uranium produces 20 ,000 times more energy compared to  one pound coal .
However , according the World Energy Council there are only 442 nuclear reactors to date and currently they provide only 11% to 18% (March , 2008) of the world electricity requirements .
This is mainly due to the fear and anticipation of possible accidents in nuclear power plants .
After the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and Three Miles accident in 1979 (Think quest , May 2007) many people fear the word "nuclear energy" , but if we consider the number of accidents since the commencement of operations of the world's first nuclear power plant in the year 1954 (Think quest , May 2007) , it is only a handful .
Also , the technology used in the production of nuclear energy has significantly improved in the past few decades and safety factors are analyzed thoroughly when a nuclear plant is designed following the Three Miles Island and Chernobyl accidents .
We should also not forget that accidents do happen in other energy related industries .
For example , statistics show that there is one accident taking place in a coal mine somewhere around the world every week (Mining Industry Today , August 2008) .
In contrast to other  accidents ,   nuclear accidents are given more media coverage sparking public disapproval .
The primary cause of many nuclear accidents is  overheating of water which is used as the coolant in nuclear fission reactions .
As a result of such overheating under high pressure an immense amount of steam is produced if uncontrolled .
This causes the system to explode .
However , in molten salt reactors also known as MSRs fluoride salts are used instead of water as the coolant .
Fluoride salts has boiling temperatures over 1300o Celsius which is about 13 times higher than the boiling temperature of water and they are not flammable (Forsberg CW , 2007) .
Furthermore , most of the current reactors and generation IV concepts require high pressure and high temperature to optimize the energy output .
This further increases the probability of possible accidents .
However , MSRs operate at much lower pressure levels and with Min a relatively low temperature range of 750 o C to 800 o C .(World nuclear Association , August 2009) .
Thus these enhanced features of MSRs further reduce any possibility of any nuclear reactor-based accidents .
However , scientists argue that the current reprocessing method can be altered such that Plutonium produced cannot be used for manufacturing of nuclear weapons .
One such example is the mixed oxide fuel process (commonly known as MOX) used in France where Plutonium is converted to a form stored under very high temperature so that it cannot be used to produce nuclear weaponry .
Moreover , more than 90% of the energy in spent fuel can be reprocessed and reused leaving only about 3 to 4 percent as net waste (Ling K , The New York Times , May 2009) .
Furthermore , MSRs being closed fuel cycle nuclear reactors (World nuclear Association , August 2009) reprocessing takes place minimizing nuclear waste .
In addition nuclear waste produced by MSRs is not soluble in water thus reducing chances of possible contamination .
Thus , through advanced research the cost of nuclear waste management can be reduced and the MSR technology can be enhanced to further minimize the harmful effects and to avoid nuclear waste proliferation .
Another challenge faced by the nuclear energy industry against other alternatives of energy is that building of nuclear power plants is very costly and time consuming .
Most nuclear reactors involve the use of the fast breeder technique but the MSRs use a technology known as slow breeder or thorium fuel cycle breeder which has been proven to be less expensive (Forsberg CW , 2007) .
Besides , the operation costs involved in maintaining high temperature and pressure within nuclear reactors during nuclear fission is notably low in MSRs since they operate at a much lower temperature and pressure .
Also the concepts behind the MSRs are not completely New .
Several have been already constructed with simple validated designs , thus this will reduce the time required in designing larger nuclear reactors (Forsberg CW , 2007) .
Another important advantage of MSRs is that they can be built in a small scale first and can then be expanded gradually , so the plants could be easily built with several small reactors and from the income they can carry out expansions (Forsberg CW , 2007) .
This further reduces cost and additional financial burden arising from interest expenses .
Therefore , MSRs are highly cost effective and efficient .
Uranium prices are currently much more stable than fuel prices and of all the uranium available less than 1% is used up to date .
Compared to hydro or solar power , nuclear energy .
does not change the ecology of a certain environment .
Unlike wind turbines , nuclear energy does not require specific environmental conditions and compared to fossil fuels , they do not produce green house gases , However , the future of nuclear energy depends on further research where these generation IV reactors have to be tested , constructed and operated in such a way that they can provide competitive prices while maximizing the usage of natural resources and enhancing nuclear safety .
They also need to address the fears of the public so that people are more aware of the advantages of nuclear energy
In conclusion , all earlier mentioned objectives cannot be achieved without necessary funding .
In an era where global warming is a burning issue , when the effects of extreme climate change are already evident , nuclear energy may be the ultimate solution to greener energy alternative , thus it is indeed time for us to move forward by challenging our fears and supporting funding for research based on nuclear reactors .
Nuclear power -- an evolutionary discovery that is capable of replacing conventional thermal power stations for decades or even centuries .
Nuclear power makes use of a common element on Earth , which is uranium .
Uranium has an extremely long half-life of 4 .5 billion years .
The atoms of uranium are shot against each other ,  processing an incredible amount of gamma radiation and heat .
This is extremely efficient as compared to the conventional thermal power station methods .
Nuclear power plants have been around for decades and according to Brain and Lamb (2007) , 430 operating nuclear plants have been providing power to the world as of July 2008 .
Nuclear plants have come a long way since the early days and the world has witnessed two major accidents , the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island Incident .
According to Butler (2004) , Generation IV nuclear reactors comprise of six different types of reactors , Gas-cooled fast reactors , Lead-cooled fast reactors , Sodium-cool fast reactors , Supercritical-water-cooled reactors , Very-high-temperature reactors and lastly Molten salt reactors which will be discussed in this article .
Generation IV nuclear reactors including the Molten salt reactors is designed to be safer and preven similar incidents such as the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island from happening again .
Molten-Salt-Reactor technology as one of the six Generation IV nuclear reactors are designed with these factors in mind -- safe , environmentally friendly and cheap in their use of electricity .
However , with all the different concerns involved , this might not be the case .
Firstly , Molten-Salt-Reactors (MSRs) are used to produce electricity .
In addition , MSRs use liquid fuel as compared to the other reactors that use solid fuel .
MSRs are high temperature reactors , depending on the choice of salt; it could range from 320 to 500 degrees Celsius .
As the temperature rises , the heat transfer properties of the reactor rapidly improve .
In addition , the close helium or nitrogen Brayton power cycles are adopted thus allowing the high temperature generated by the MSRs to be efficiently used .
As a result , there is an improvement of 15 percent in electrical power output without increasing the temperature of the fuel salt .
Secondly , with nuclear power being a dangerous source when explosions happen , safety has always been a concern throughout the world .
MSRs handle the situation by having excellent safety measures to handle emergencies .
When the situation calls for it , there is a drainage system to cool the critical safe dump tanks using the liquid fuel .
On top of that , the system can be initiated upon overheating of the coolant with the use of freeze valves and other techniques .
Workers are protected as well , thanks to the intelligent fuel system .
The refueling can be done online , therefore minimizing the danger of the workers .
However , if nuclear plants are to replace conventional thermal stations and be the world's source of power , there are much more to be taken into consideration .
Firstly , despite the safety of  MSRs , one can never forget the devastating Chernobyl incident in April 1986 .
According to World-Nuclear (2009) , the explosion happened during a test on how long the turbines would spin and supply power with the main power supply cut off .
Approximately 200 ,000 people were involved in the clean up from the accident and these people were exposed to  high radiation .
More people were then evacuated from their homes as the radiation spread widely and rapidly .
The effects of a nuclear plant accident are devastating .
Currently there are people around the world who are still suffering from the after effects of such an accident , living in pain where some develop cancer from the exposure to radiation .
Even with the new safety precautions which promise excellent safety measures and technology , no one can guarantee that such accidents would not cause more people to suffer .
For example , the Titanic ,  the largest ship built then , and was equipped with the most advanced technology and safety measures at the time .
A collision with an iceberg during her maiden voyage still sent the enormous ship deep down onto the sea bed .
Secondly , nuclear plants are said to be environmentally friendly due to the fact that they do not produce Carbon Dioxide .
As a result , it helps reduce the greenhouse effect .
On the other hand , the wastes produced by  nuclear plants are highly radioactive and cannot be easily disposed .
These wastes have to be transported to a storage pond filled with boric acid to absorb the radiation , or to a disposal site , for example the Yucca Mountains , where the wastes are buried underground .
During transportation , there might be leakage from  containers , and the effects of burying the waste underground are yet to be confirmed till years to come .
In addition , these waste disposal process might become an open target to terrorists who are constantly keen on destruction .
Lastly , nuclear power might be more cost effective as compared to the conventional thermal power stations .
However the cost of constructing the plant is significantly higher , as well as the operational and waste disposal costs .
The construction cost involves  research on the material so as to contain  radiation in the event of a nuclear meltdown .
Operational and maintenance costs are made up of labor and overheads , for example , pension benefits and medical .
Labor costs include  labor from various departments in the nuclear plant .
These include maintenance , health , engineering and headquarters .
Firstly , maintenance consists of mechanics , instrument personnel , electricians and control personnel .
Secondly , health consists of doctors , nurses and physicians .
Thirdly , engineering consists of electrical , chemical , computer , radiological , nuclear and mechanical aspects .
Lastly , headquarters consist of mainly administrative personnel .
In addition , there are expendable license charges , emergency planning fees as well as other expendable costs .
The waste disposal cost of a nuclear power plant is higher than a conventional thermal station .
The cost involves transportation of the waste to  various storage ponds and dumping grounds , and the running costs of these sites .
This cost increases over the years , as more nuclear wastes are produced .
In conclusion , Generation IV MSR does provide  energy hungry cities with the amount of electricity needed and it reduces greenhouse effect due to the zero carbon dioxide emission , and lastly it is much safer than the previous Generation plants with  enhanced meltdown technology .
On the other hand , the danger of nuclear radiation , fear of terrorism and the high initial and running cost of a Generation IV nuclear plant , make us consider if there are any other alternatives .
has goneforThe serious global warming and the gy demand give nuclear power a chance back to the stage .
The new generation reactors , namely generation IV reactors , have tremendous innovations in improving reactors' efficiency and safety .
Among different kinds of new designs of generation IV reactors , the Very-High-Temperature Reactors(VHTR) are the moweaponsmising ones .
Although VHTR withill has a few technical problems to be solved , its inspiring advantages have indicated the revtheval of the nuclear power .
The design of VHTR has an abundance of advantages .
First of all , VHTR is designed to operate at 1000 which results in the more efficient conversion of heat to electricity .
From thepotentialt of uranium fuels , VHTR can squeeze 50% more electricity than conventional plants .
The same reason of high operating temperature gives birth to  (VHTR) second advantage which is the produce of hydrogen .
At temperatures of about 700-900 , hydrogen can be split from water thermochemically(Nature , 2004) .
This by-product of nuclear power is also a kind of clean energy in place of oil the third advantage VHTR has is the practical experience .
A similar test reactor of VHTR has already been operated in Japan and proven to be a success since it reached its operating goal of 950 .
Last but not least , VHTR does not have the problem of reprocessing of plutonium waste .
Many politicians are afraid that the reprocessing of plutonium waste , which is used in other generation IV reactors , may cause plutonium wars since plutonium is a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons .
VHTR will not cause such concern .
In spite of so many advantages VHTR has got , it still faces some technical challenges .
One of most essential ones is the high cost of a reactor , which will deeply affect the development of the whole nuclear industry .
Based on a report from U .S . Department of Energy , even a prototype , which is just a sample run of the practical reactor , will require $1 .25 billion to build(Korman , 2008) .
Meanwhile , the price of uranium is fast increasing , a 30% increase in a thermochemically (Nature ,$50 per pound to 2008's $65 per pound(DOE , 2009) .
These two factoenergy;ult in a high cost of nuclear-generated electriciwhich disables nuclear power from competing with other clean energy technologies like solar energy and wind energy .
A second major challenge is to find suitable building materials .
Since VHTR is operated at a very high temperature and pressure condition , the materials must be able to resist continued high temperature , pressure , corrosive reagents and intense bombardment by neutrons .
Scientists still cannot give a proper solution to this problem .
The last challenge is what the public concerns most-the safety issues .
The high temperature and pressure , which gives birth to the advantage of producing hydrogen , on the other hand , means a high risk of accident .
Also VHTR has no waste recycling systems so that radioactive waste goes nowhere but directly to repository .
This potential danger of waste leak will affect generations .
Nevertheless , in spite challenges are just challenges , not impossibilities .
With the efforts of countless scthe mostists and engineers , these challenges are expected to be solved in a few years .
In terms of high cost of a reactor , significant cost deduction the U .S be achieved by design improvement , standardisation , better construction methods , reduced construction time and improving probuild (Kormanent in building a reactor(OECD , 2005) .
Meanwhile the high efficiency of fuel utilization in VHTR makes reactors use less fuels which in turn lower the cost of fuels(OECD , 2005) .
For finding suitable materials , although the perfect solution has not been found yet , engineers do have some suggested materials that have promising potential to develop , such as silicon carbide , specific grades of graphite and high chromium steels(Murty & Charit , 2008) .
Lastly , the design of VHTR enhances safety features and excludes sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators so as to minimise the human intervention .
In addition , VHTR's ability of burning up 65% of uranium fuel will vastly reduce the amount of nuclear waste to a tolerable level(USDOE , 2005) .
level (USDOEsteels (Murtyfuels (OECD)To sum up , VHTR has many advantages that other generation IV reactors do not have .
It can do very well in converting nuclear power to electricity efficiently .
And it is relatively easier to build and it will not cause political concern on reprocessing of plutonium waste .
Also it produces useful hydrogen as a by-product .
After solving challenges in reactor cost , building materials and safety issues , VHr (OECD)l become a best choice for cheaper , cleaner and safer energy .
This promising design reveals the revival of nuclear power .
The rising sea level , the increase in natural disasters , the proliferation of pandemics , which are the by-products of industrial development , along with the depletion of fossil fuel , demand a new source of energy .
In the endeavor to meet this demand , the GIF (Generation IV International Forum) introduced new types of nuclear reactor in 2002 .
However , nuclear power always conjures up images of catastrophes , tremendous capital investment and wars .
To me , these thoughts on safety - daily danger , accidents and waste , cost and security , can be completely expunged from our minds with the new reactor technology , specifically the lead-cooled fast reactor .
First , there are myriad benefits of nuclear power that the critics often overlook .
In terms of environment , nuclear plant operation by no means entails greenhouse gas emission .
Economically , the price of electricity generated from radioactive fuel would be much lower than that generated from fossil fuel due to the enormous energy churned out from fission reaction .
In addition , as the new nuclear reactor works at high temperature , scientists can utilize it to produce hydrogen from thermochemical reaction of water , which is  material for other industries .
About the negative effects , the first argument  concerns the impact of radiation on humans due to the routine operation of a nuclear plant .
However , according to the Journal of the American Medical Association published by the National Cancer Institute , a major survey showed that there was no rise in cancer rates in 107 US counties near 62 nuclear plants .
In fact , the amount of radiation that people living in the neighborhood of a nuclear plant are exposed to is really miniscule in comparison with that from natural sources .
Furthermore , burning coal in industries also emits radioactive elements .
According to the Atomic Energy Commission ,  power plants using coal produce ash that contains 5 .2 tons of uranium and 12 .8 tons of thorium per year .
Regarding  nuclear accidents , it is the modern reactor generation that is invulnerable to the meltdown incident .
Granted , we cannot deny their impact  , such as the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents , but the new technology can eliminate the possibility of these accidents .
In Three Mile Island , indeed , there were still two defense lines along with the thick steel vessel containing radioactive fuel .
These safety criteria are improving in the lead-cooled fast reactor .
It has double-walled container and a lot of core-cooling emergency systems .
Moreover , since  accidents are mainly brought about by the leaking of the cooling tube , lead is chosen to reduce this possibility .
Lead vapor has low pressure .
Lead is a good heat conductor .
Lead is an inert substance preventing  corrosion .
What is more , lead has high shielding capability for gamma ray (the most damaging radiation) .
Besides , the effects of accidents in coal and oil industries are noticeable , such as oil spills , mining accidents , let alone the environmental effects of the toxic fumes they produce .
As far as  radioactive waste is concerned , a lead-cooled fast reactor is designed best to cut back on the amount of high level waste .
It has a closed cycle and high operating temperature in order to increase the efficiency and lower the radioactive waste .
Furthermore , the high level waste is turned into a rock-like form before it is embedded into a deep rock layer whose lifetime is about one billion years .
On the other hand , the emissions of coal and oil industries are still lingering in our atmosphere , which impact on the number of respiratory disease .
Therefore , in terms of safety , the new lead-cooled fast reactor can really outweigh  coal and oil plants .
Another rationale behind  protests against nuclear plants is that it takes a huge capital investment to build up a nuclear plant (from $3 to $5 billion dollars) (Nuclear Energy Information Service , 2004) , to research the new reactors (approximate 1 billion US dollars for each prototype of generation IV reactors) (Nature publishing group , 2004) .
From the viewpoint of those against , to gain such a sum , the government has to cut off its expenditure on  on education , health  , etc , and raise taxes .
In my opinion , it is essential to invest in a new nuclear power plant .
First , if the government fosters  research and development in the nuclear industry , the cost for building and maintaining the new nuclear power plant will be  affordable  .
Second , the expenditure can be compensated for by  profit since a nuclear plant is competitive in comparison with coal and oil industries in terms of productivity and environment .
Third ,  fossil resources are shrinking rapidly , so the cost for coal and oil would increase sharply in the future .
Last , if the country continues producing energy without reducing the burning of oil and coal ,  health and social service expenses will rise  .
At any rate , the government has to increase its expenditure .
For the lead-cooled fast reactor , it has new features to increase the longevity of core life , and  scientists have come up with the idea of creating a medium size reactor to reduce the cost .
Last but not least , the skeptics are worried about security .
They believe that the development of nuclear states might create opportunities to produce nuclear weapons from  plutonium reprocessing and uranium enriching .
Terrorists may also have the chance to magnify the destruction by attacking  nuclear plants and  freighters that carry radioactive substances .
However , the new lead-cooled fast reactor , as I have mentioned , has many emergency systems that make the reactor "meltdown proof" even in cases of human interference .
The closed cycle will reduce the waste as well as the necessity of plutonium reprocessing .
The efficiency of the nuclear reactor also means the reduction of refueling , so it minimizes the frequency of radioactive substance transfer .
In addition , the development of nuclear power also improves the energy security of a country .
In other words , it reduces the amount of foreign energy import , so it can help solve disputes over energy , especially oil .
In conclusion , the new generation IV nuclear reactor , in particular the lead-cooled fast reactor , is an optimal choice for future energy in three fronts -  safety , cost and security - though there are still many challenges  ahead .
Thus , the government should invest more in  nuclear power development to make construction of these reactors a feasible feat .
For the past few decades ,  engineering field has developed drastically to a new  level .
At the same time , the peril and hazard of the engineering installations and systems rise in response to complexity .
However , these designs seem to be too complex and complicated for engineers to work with .
The result was a series of engineering accidents: Three Mile Island , Chernobyl , the Challenger  and more .
Interestingly , the analysis reports of these accidents invariably described human factors as the major cause of the accidents .
Thus , people start to argue the importance of psychology in engineering design process .
Supporters claim that psychology can help to reduce the probability of accidents and  emphasize  the value of human lives .
Opponents , mainly composed of engineers and operators , consider costs more and somehow ignore  safety measure as it is reasonable for suppliers to produce at a minimum cost .
Although engineers and operators tend to oppose the use of psychology in engineering design process , research results have shown the importance of psychology in preventing accidents by using their professional knowledge .
One of the most famous accidents -- the Chernobyl accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 in the Soviet Ukraine -- is a typical type of engineering accident .
Frot's (2000) studies gave two main causes of the explosion of the Chernobyl reactors: design errors and faults of management and errors committed by the operating staff .
While psychology is described as a necessity in improving the safety measures during a design process , opponents are still sceptical about the validity and reliability in psychology research .
Karanian (1988)  showed how  engineers think: "The content is considered repetitive and filled with slanted views and reflective of self-interest and personal bias" .
They claim that psychology tends to talk a lot but there are too few really good theories .
However , their disbelief is mainly due to their lack of knowledge about  studies of psychology .
According to the International Ergonomics Association (2000) , engineering psychology is defined as "the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system , and the profession that applies theory , principles , data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance" .
It does not only reflect on how human thinking solve human errors but it also uses sophisticated theory and principles  .
For example , one famous psychology law -- Hick's Law -- describes the amount of time that a person takes to make a decision , given several possible choices he or she has .
It can be seen that psychology is a professional field that has been accepted by  society and the theories and principles are useful in analysing  latent designing errors .
Still , opponents argue that accidents are unpredictable as there are too many possible causes .
However , research has shown that causes are basically formed by human errors .
In the Chernobyl accident , six human errors were identified (Frot , 2000) .
The reactors were not well-designed and operators were not sufficiently trained .
Wickens , Gordon and Liu (1997) defined human errors as "mistakes made by human operating a system , humans who designed the equipment , who supervise the worker , and who trained or advised the worker" and those human errors can be categorized as psychological factors .
Psychology which deals with human behaviours is therefore the best preventive way to avoid engineering accidents .
During a design process , designers do not focus on human response to the design and there is frequent mismatch between  operators and  designed machines (Wilpert , 2007) .
However , psychology takes human behaviours into consideration while using the machines and they look into questions like "Are the machines too complex for the operators to deal with ?
Or will the operators feel fatigued easily while using the machines ?"
Accidents are hard to predict , but psychology will definitely help to reduce the probability of occurrence of accidents .
A single error will usually not produce an accident but it arises from a number of failures (Noyes , 1997) .
Those latent errors mostly arise during the design process .
For the Chernobyl accident , there were five major design errors (Frot , 2000) .
These five design errors then led to the start of the accident .
Eventually , latent and active failures had come together to create this tragedy .
Why are there so many errors ?
Actually human errors are inevitable but can only be minimized to a tolerable extent (Noyes , 1997) .
Psychology is useful in foreseeing latent errors and thus it is easier to come out with a solution that will reduce the probability of an accident .
It can be done by designing a less complex device , giving more useful information and practice for operators in charge , designing better backup systems and so on .
With the aid of psychology which focuses on safety measures , accidents are more likely to be avoided .
In brief , while engineering has become a much sophisticated field , safety measures have become more and more important at the same time .
People have incurred much loss in terms of money and lives in various engineering accidents and they will not want to experience any disaster anymore .
While research has shown that most of the causes are due to human error , people are able to solve this problem by using psychology .
Human errors are unavoidable , but psychology is meant to reduce the effect caused by these errors  .
Although some engineers and operators still oppose the use of psychology , for human safety , it is worthwhile to include psychology in an engineering design process .
In the current world , nuclear technology has evolved significantly and researchers have come out with many prototypes and systems which can benefit the world .
The latest systems are the Generation IV nuclear systems which were introduced in 2002 .
Now , the 6 nuclear energy systems are technologies which include advantages like reduced capital cost , enhanced nuclear safety , minimal generation of nuclear waste , and further reduction of the risk of weapon material proliferation .
Gen IV systems are designed to be highly sustainable because the energy they produce meets the desire for clean air and in the long term , benefits the environment(Bouchard ,J) . , Each system has its own advantages in terms of performance , cost and security (Generation IV International Forum GIF and U .S . Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee NERAC)
The Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) system is a system which uses lead as the coolant and the radioactive fuel used is the uranium .
It operates at 400~500 during its operation .
We measure performance by  the output of the system  and the amount of power it can generate .
Since the lead-cooled fast reactor is not a large scale reactor , its output is not as much if we compare it to reactors like Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) .
The VHTR is a helium-cooled , graphite-moderated , thermal neutron spectrum reactor with a coolant outlet temperature of 1000  C or above .
VHTR outperformse other reactors because of its potential to produce hydrogen .
It is possible to produce over 2 million cubic meters of hydrogen per day and this is the energy which is equal to over 16 ,000 gallons of gasoline per day (Chapin et al ,2004) .
From this , we can see that VHTR greatly outperfomsm LFR .
Safety is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to nuclear powered reactors , because the result is grievous and devastating if a nuclear reactor accident were to happen .
On 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine , there was a nuclear reactor accident which resulted in the deaths of many due to radiation poisoning .
To prevent such accidents from happening again , much emphasis has been put into the safety aspect of nuclear reactors  being designed .
The graphitic core structure , helium coolant , and coated fuel particles allow the VHTR to withstand accident temperatures without structural damage or fission product release .
The publication by MPR further added that these features of VHTR replace the current safety systems in current reactors .
This feature is the enhanced version of the safety system .
Because of the very high temperature used in the reactions , hotspots are prevented from forming within the core because the graphite core of VHTRs has very high thermal conductivity .
Another promising safety feature of VHTRs is the helium coolant .
Helium is chemically inert , which means it is not very reactive .
This removes any possible corrosion or irradiation which could occur with the component materials .
In addition , helium does not go through any phase change at or over reactor operating temperature; this will improve  safety because the design and operation are being simplified .
VHTRs are also designed to be proliferation resistant .
Due to the extremely hard reprocessing of its fuel , it deters any means to misuse them  since the process is very complicated .
Although this feature does not really decrease the chance of reprocessing to zero , it does complicate the means to try to reprocess them (Chapin et al ,2004) .
On the other hand , lead-cooled fast reactors (LFRs) have various safety issues which are of concern when it comes to building a safe reactor .
There are chances of corrosion of lead with its reactors' component materials when temperature is increased .
(Generation IV International Forum GIF and U .S . Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee NERAC) .
This will pose as a threat for  workers at the reactors due to the corrosion of the materials .
Because the Gen IV's VHTR systems are built on the older generation of high temperature reactors , therefore many of the safety systems which already existed in the old reactors are further being enhanced .
In this way , the safety systems in VHTR do exceed the ones in LFRs .
For the generation IV nuclear reactor systems , the cost of the individual reactors varies and some are far more costly than others .
The estimated cost of building a 100MWE prototype of lead-cooled fast reactor in the U .S . is between $400-$700 million (Brown ,N .W .) .
Compared with this , the cost of building a VHTR reactor is much higher; it has an estimated cost of about $1 .1 billion (Butler , D .2004 , May 20) .
This is partially due to the reason that VHTR's coolant , helium gas ,  is much more costly than LFRs' coolant , and because of the strong structure that VHTR consists , it costs more to build .
However , most importantly , the extra cost of the system must be valid and used in an effective way .
In the case of VHTR , though more costly than LFRs , its performance and safety systems exceed those of LFRs , which justifies the extra cost incurred in building VHTRs .
In conclusion , both Very high temperature and lead-cooled fast reactors have good performance and excellent safety systems , but VHTRs are on a higher end as compared to LFRs due to the greater system performance and system safety it provides .
Hence , VHTRs are , to some extent , better than LFRs .
However , there is no doubt that the energy demand will continue increasing , since human beings cannot slow down the pace of technology development .
In this case , we have to consider more about energy-producingrecent research and development of generation IV nuclear reactor makes the large scaled use of nuclear energy more reliable and feasible , because of its sustainability , reliability , economics and proliferation resistance .
Some may say that nuclear plant is dangerous , after seeing those nuclear accidents in the last few decades .
However , the generation IV reactors are quite different from the previous ones .
Here , we are going to discuss two of the generation IV reactors , Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) , which features a fast-neutron-spectrum , helium-cooled reactor and closed fuel cycle , and Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor (SWCR) , which is a high-temperature , high-pressure water-cooled reactor that operates above the thermodynamic critical point of water .
I think that GFR does a better job than SWCR , respectively in the aspect of efficiency , cost and security .
When talking about an energy generating method , efficiency will to increasegnored .
Some people hold the view that SWCR has a higher efficiency .
Yes , they are right , but they are just compaSWCR with the generation III reactors , not GFR reactor .
According to the statistics data given by IdahoNational Laboratory , the thermal efficiency of SWR is 43 .8% , which is lower than that of GFR , 48% .
You may think that the difference is not that much , ba nuclearhown in a report by Kevan Dexperiencinge Hussein S . Khalil , a typical GFR plant has a power ll of 600 MWth .
In this case , after doing a simple calculation , we will find that the difference is quite considerable .
What is more , GFR also get Hydrogen production .
The only production of combusting hydrogen is water and burning same amount of hydrogen or other fueWater-cooleduch more energy from hydrogen .
Due to all the reasons mentioned above , I think that GFR has a higher efficiency than SWCR .
tswhich hardlythe safetynsan accidentIn a conclusion , Gas-coled Fast Reactor is better than Supefearical Water Cooled Reactor , respectively in the field of efficiency , expend and security .
I believe that GFR is one of the most promising generation IV nuclear reactorare concernedits large scaled application is justaround the corner .
Chernobyl , Ukraine is the location of the most fatal nuclear accident that happened on April 26 , 1986 .
The accident caused many deaths and resulted in severe health impacts due to  the population's exposure to radiation (Cleveland , 2009) .
There is a debate on whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the Chernobyl tragedy .
The critics argue that the calamity took place due to human factors which were beyond the control of the engineers .
The use of psychology would be irrelevant .
On the other hand , the supporters claim that through the use of psychology , the engineers might have has anticipated different scenarios that could happen and designed a safer and more stable plant .
In other words , the Chernobyl accident could have been prevented and if better safety measures were in place , the effects of the accident would have been minimized .
According to Wilpert (2007) , human actions usually play a significant role in provoking accidents .
In the Chernobyl accident , the operators lacked the expertise of operating the nuclear power plant and were inadequately trained .
They also violated several operating and safety regulations (Serrill , 1986) .
These led to the explosion of the power plant .
The engineers did not factor in the possibility of the operators switching off the security systems as its probability was close to zero (Gorbachev , n .d .) .
The use of psychology would be ineffective as the carelessness of the operators was beyond the control of the engineers .
However , psychology has a vital role in all human ventures (Wilpert , 2007) .
The problem of psychopathology of design refers to a mismatch of the engineers' and the operators' theoretical models which happened in this case .
The use of  occupational psychology could have aided the engineers in understanding that the operators might not have been equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to operate the plant .
They could  have exercised precaution such that unauthorized personnel could not shut down the emergency safety systems (World Nuclear Association , 2007) .
Therefore , there is a possibility that the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
At the very least , it would have had weakened the severity of the consequences .
Human actions alone could not trigger the explosion .
The Chernobyl reactor was unstable due to the positive void coefficient which made  power exacerbation uncontrollable .
It did not have a containment structure to reduce the amount of the radioactivity released (World Nuclear Association , 2007) .
The poorly designed reactor contributed to the Chernobyl accident as well .
It may seem that the use of psychology would be irrelevant as the flawed reactor design was a technological fault .
However , this instead posed a challenge to psychology to help modify the plant design through the method of feed-forward safety controls which could be applied in the  (Wilpert , 2007) .
The engineers should be aware of the limitations of the reactor and the use of psychology could have led them to use a better reactor or install other measures to counter the weaknesses of the reactor . 
In addition to the operators' actions and the flawed reactor design , there are external factors that made the explosion possible .
The operators were working under pressure overnight (Stang , 1996) .
A study shows that irregular hours of work can decrease work performance and may result in errors or accidents (Costa , 1999) .
Furthermore , when some reactor components fail to work correctly , the operators face more stress (Stang , 1996) .
They might not be able to think properly and make the right decisions .
Such external conditions are not part of  design process and hence the use of psychology would not be helpful .
However , occupational threats and individual workplace misfortunes are the focus of psychology as they are influenced by the individual's motivation , attitude and decision-making (Wilpert , 2007) .
The use of work and organisational psychology might aid the engineers in understanding how the environment could affect the operators' performance .
The engineers might have implemented more safety measures to counter the failure of each component or the effects of the blunders made by the operators .
Therefore , there is a possibility that the use of psychology would have prevented the accident . 
In conclusion , the main factors that resulted in the Chernobyl disaster are the negligence of the operators , the flawed reactor designed and other external factors such as the pressure faced by the operators .
On the surface , psychology appears to be irrelevant during the design process of the nuclear plant .
On the contrary , psychology could have helped the engineers foresee possible problems during the operation and more safety precaution could have been incorporated .
The use of psychology might have prevented the Chernobyl accident and the effects of the accident would have been minimized .
based onOn performance , proponents of the SWCR claim that the thermal efficiency of this reactor is 44% , compare to the SFR's 42% CITATION Gen08 \l 2052 (Generation IV Nuclear Reactor Comparisons  , 2008) .
However , the difference is not very much and they fail to consider that the SWCR is working in the environment of very high pressure , while SFR is working in lowallyressure .
With higher pressure , the nuclear reaction will be more thorough and efficiency will increase .
However , with higher pressure , the possiis also greater since a larger force is exerted on the wall of the reactor .
On the other hand , the SFR is mnuclear accidentawase of its closed fuel cycle and excellent potential of aiedinide management .
It can recycle 99% of the fuel , thus reducing nuclear waste .
Compare this to the SWCR , in a word , sodium-cooled fast reactors do well in performance .
In terms of cost , proponents of SWCR claim that SWCR has longer history of development while SFR is a nedwer concept that int years .
The research and development of SFR is very expensive .
People who are against nuclear reactors even claim that the sting method of generate electricity is good enough and new method is not necessary .
However , these shortsighted people fail to realize that shortage of resource is already very serious among global .
Moreover , the thermal efficiency of thermal power generation is just about 30% .
Hence , the invention of generation IV reactors can both generate electity in a more efficient way and more fuel saving way .
For SFR , it saves costs in two main methods: the ractor vessel and fuel . .) .
It usage of advanced materials , the loop type cooling system and innovative dgn op;ions are all adopted to save the plant capital costs .
Secondly , it recovers and recycles 99 .9% of the actinides , which can both save the fuel and decrease the money spent on dealing with nuclear waste .
For SWCR , it does not recycle the waste; the nuclear wastes management is also one concern of SWCR in terms of both cost and safety .
The third point to emphasis is that SFR has the earliest delivery year , 10 years earlier than SWCR .
This means the time and money required to do the research for SFR is much less than that of SWCR .
We can conclude that SFR is also cost saving .
cost-effectivearethat thewhich is 10 yearstimeewithTaking safety into account , opponents of nuclear reactorsa longer the past year accident to prove it is not safe .
For this has just been SFR pay spein recentttention to the safety issue .
Its operating temperature is as low as the SWCR's .
Besides this , as mentioned in the previous paragraph , the operating ingressure is almost the atmospherea newessure which is very safe .
SFR also recycle the radioactive materials thus decreasglobal shortagesk of leakaese of such dangerous materoes not recycle the waste which is not that safe .
Moreover , to protect the workers in the nuclear power station , only low occupational radioactivity dose to workers and with minimal risk and hfuel-savingts from severe accidents CITATthroughN Mik05 \l 2052 (Corradini , 2005) .
Last but not least , for SFR , "about a 2/3 reduction in flow can be tolerated passively and that the tims , available to take controction is ample when larger flow reductions occur (Stacey , etal , 2007 , p .
48) ."
Hence , SFR is very safe .

Generation four nuclear reactor plants went into development with the hope of creating a new nuclear reactor plant that can replace the current old generation three reactor plants .
The new nuclear reactor may be high in cost for research but it has better performance , safety and security measures than the old generator plants .
In this new development , experts have looked into 6 new nuclear reactor plant concepts like molten salt reactor (MSR) and Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) .
MSR researchers did intensify research to ensure that it has superior safety standards and fuel cycle qualities than VHTR .
Therefore ,  research in MSR costs about $1000 million as compared to VHTR's research which  costs about $670 million as quoted from the report on "a technology roadmap for generation IV Nuclear Energy system" .
The latter costs only 20% less than the former and the difference in money spent is used to build  generation 4 reactor's standards .
From the report , researchers for MSR distributed a lot of funds in areas like safety , reactor system and fuel cycle as compared to fund distribution in these areas of research in VHTR .
The areas of safety and reactor systems will be covered later in this essay .
Fuel cycle in MSR needs to have more attention as compared to VHTR  because there is a need to ensure that molten salt which is mixed with  nuclear material will still be functional after many rounds of usage in the system .
The idea of MSR is that it will produce less waste and be able to recycle it .
Therefore , the effort put into this area of research is to make MSR a cleaner nuclear reactor plant that  reduces , reuses and recycles its waste .
MSR works better than VHTR in various ways .
It has a 24/7 circulating molten salt fuel mixture in the whole system to generate energy for the masses .
The molten fluoride salt used in the system helps to lower  vapor pressure , thus , reduces stresses on vessel and piping .
As compared to VHTR , it uses helium cooling to transfer heat to electric energy .
This system generates high temperature of up to 1000 degree Celsius .
Therefore , when there is high temperature the pressure in the system will also increase .
A highly pressurized system is dangerous and needs to be consistently monitored to ensure a safe operation as stresses acting on the pipes and vessel can cause the system to explode .
When MSR is operating at high temperature of  eight hundred degrees and above , it can produce another good energy source .
This energy source is hydrogen .
Hydrogen can be used to generate power for machines like hydrogen-powered cars which are clean for the environment .
In VHTR , in order to produce hydrogen for similar usage , it requires another indirect cycle that consists of a heat exchanger .
This will further complicate the VHTR system and additional cost is incurred .
The fuel used in MSR can be recycled as mentioned earlier .
However , in the case of VHTR , the fuel used is  one through fuel cycle and therefore , it requires proper disposal .
Researchers have been looking into this area , to recycle VHTR fuel waste , so that it will be a clean nuclear reactor plant .
The Molten  Salt reactor  is a lot safer in performance and operation than the Very High Temperature Reactor MSR works based on 3 independent sub stations and is a closed loop that interlink with each other to transfer heat energy to electric energy by turning on the turbine generator .
In  case of an industrial accident in one of the systems , operators can easily isolate that particular system and rectify the problem as quickly as possible without worrying that the problem might spread to  parts of the other two systems .
MSR's design works on fail-safe drainage , passive cooling , and low inventory of volatile fission products in fuel .
As for VHTR , it has only one open loop system to produce  electricity from heat .
Overall , MSR also operates at lower pressure than VHTR as low temperature results in lower pressure .
One of the reasons for development in Generation 4 nuclear reactor plants is  security reason .
The waste products produced by the current old nuclear plants cannot be recycled and need to be disposed at wasteland .
These wastes are highly radioactive and suitable for making weapons of mass destruction .
If these wastes landed on the wrong hands like terrorists , the world would be in chaos as we live in fear of nuclear attacks by unknown enemies .
Wastes generated by these nuclear plants also bring problems to  future generations .
As these wastes take very long to degrade , the land that holds them will become a wasteland which is not suitable for agricultural , residential and commercial usages .
Therefore ,  Generation 4 nuclear reactor plants like MSR recycle their waste products and do not need to dispose them .
However , in VHTR , as mentioned earlier , it produces wastes and researchers are trying to find solutions to it .
In conclusion , even though MSR costs more due to research than VHTR , its benefits outshine VHTR .
Its performance in low pressure quality can help to reduce stresses on equipment and less chances of industrial accidents than a high pressure system which induces high stress to the equipment .
It is safer than VHTR as it has better safety standards .
Lastly , in the area of security , MSR will not create chances of producing waste that will land on the wrong hands like the terrorists as compared to VHTR which has to deal with secured and proper waste disposal .
In recent years , we have seen that nuclear power is one of the main sources for generating electrical energy .
As of September 2009 , there have been 436 nuclear reactors worldwide and another 53 nuclear reactors under construction .
An undeniable fact is that a total of 14 percent of the world's energy was produced by nuclear reactors in 2008 (Nuclear Energy Institute , 2009) .
Another shocking fact is that 76 .2 percent of electrical energy is generated by nuclear reactors in France (Nuclear Energy Institute , 2009) .
There are always concerns about the safe operations of nuclear reactors  , opponents of the supporters of nuclear reactors note that the public's irrational fears towards radiation .
I have chosen the Supercritical water-cooled reactor to support the argument for further research and development funding for  generation IV reactors .
One of the most important factors to support further research development funding is security .
The public often have doubts when it comes to security and safety issues concerning nuclear reactors .
However , the Supercritical water-cooled reactor is one of the safest reactors compared to current generation II and III reactors .
The SCWR has safety measures such as physical resistance against terrorist attacks .
For example , possibilities of an air attack by terrorist do occur .
However , the penetration of the containment for nuclear elements is not possible .
events that lead to the occurrence of such possibilities would probably not reach the nuclear vessel (Carl & Mark , 2005) .
Ever since the Three Miles Island incident , many new safety regulations have been implemented ; also in SCWR , emergency plans have been set up to prevent such things from happening again .
For instance , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has set up a 10-mile Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) to maintain warning zones and also set up sirens and conducted emergency evacuation exercises (Carl & Mark , 2005) .
Such plans are to assist in protecting people within the 10-mile radius .
In addition , cost is a major factor for all sectors including the private sector , the government and the community .
The economics for overall nuclear reactors are hard to estimate .
Normally , the economics of nuclear reactors are basic construction costs , operating costs , the life-time of the plant and the rate of return on capital (Solar Energy Systems) .
Critics often said that the overall cost for using nuclear energy has increased over the years and was relatively high (Jack & Nicolas , 2008) .
In contrast , with the new SCWR , it is possible to decrease its cost since it is cheaper to build than existing nuclear reactors in the United States which consist of the Pressurized Water Reactors and Boiled Water Reactors .
For example , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded that the operating costs are lower for Light Water Reactors (LWR) compared to coal-fired operating plants and also considerably below the operating costs for gas-fired plants (Solar Energy Systems) .
Thirdly , the performance of the nuclear reactors also contributes to further support and development funding of nuclear reactors .
Performance is measured through the efficient production of electricity , the production and recycle of waste disposal , and the method and characteristics of the nuclear reactor .
Critics often said that nuclear reactors are unsafe , impractical and low in performance .
However , this argument is not true .
The Generation-IV International Forum (GIF) has been formed in order to improve the current generation reactors , thus also improving the performance of the Generation IV reactors .
Since SCWR is under the category of Generation IV reactors , it is also true that in terms of performance , it would be better than current Generation III reactors .
As for the characteristics of the SCWR , it operates above the thermodynamic critical point of water with high temperature and high pressure .
Statistics showed that the thermal efficiency has been increased by 45 percent compared to previous generation reactors (Solar Energy Systems) .
It should be evident that the arguments against supporting further research and development funding for Generation IV reactors are not valid .
On the contrary , recent research also found that 74 percent of the U .S population favors nuclear energy (Ann , 2009) .
Safety measures such as physical resistance and emergency plans have been implemented to improve the security of the SCWR .
Furthermore , the cost of the SCWR which is lower compared to existing LWR reactors also plays an important role in further research on Generation IV reactors .
Nonetheless , the formation of the GIF and the increase in performance  SCWR are also another reason for further research and development of the nuclear reactor .
Therefore , the development of the Generation IV reactors will surely benefit mankind and help  with energy demands of the future .
In today's operating theatre , it is not an uncommon sight to find 3 or more surgeons and nurses needed for a simple operation .
Most surgeries will require even more .
The need for surgical robots will eventually eliminate the number of surgeons and nurses in one operation theatre .
Surgical robots are machines performing operations by having surgeons control them using a computer .
Research shows that patients who undergo robotic surgeries will recover in a shorter time .
According to statistics from Morristown Memorial Hospital (2009) , prostate cancer patients can be discharged from the hospital after one day and return to their normal activities after one week .
Comparing this with  open human surgeries , patients can only return to their daily activities after 4 to 6 weeks .
Surgical robots definitely play an important role in operation theatres in terms of their advantages .
However , as surgical robots are still not widely used , there are some constraints  which patients are concerned about  .
These constraints include the patients' safety in using the system , benefits of the system , as well as the cost of the surgery and the system .
When it comes to  patients' safety , some questions such as the reliability of surgical robots are raised by the public .
Patients feel uneasy having robots operating on them without the presence of humans .
They feel that robots are not able to feel their 'pain' and thus unable to detect any error during the operation .
According to New York Health Times (2009) , surgical robots have successfully helped a patient with a kidney transplant .
This is one of the many successful operations using surgical robots that are happening around the world .
A patient's safety is the responsibility of a surgeon .
The surgeon will ensure that the robots are in good working conditions before having them in operation theatres .
Besides having the robot in the operating room , there will be at least one surgeon in the room to control the robot remotely .
Every movement of the robot's arms is controlled by the surgeon (Morristown Memorial Hospital , 2009) .
There are official training centres available to train surgeons such as the H pitaux Universitaires de Gen ve .
One issue often raised by the public is the need for surgical robots when compared to  traditional method .
The procedures for both robots and traditional surgeries are the same with the only difference of having robots doing the job and surgeons controlling them .
According to University of Geneva (N .D .) , patients who undergo robotic surgeries suffer significantly less pain and less scarring and have a shorter hospital stay .
Some patients chose robotic surgery  solely because of the shorter recovery time (U .S . news , 2009) .
A research  carried out by Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital (2003) states that 100 patients who undergo robotic surgery lost less blood than 100 who had traditional open surgery .
Robotic surgery is useful in some ways such as microscopic precision; it saves manpower and ergonomics .
The surgical robot has keyhole techniques to reach previously untouchable tissues during surgery as unlike in  traditional open surgery (Bonsor , 2008) .
This precise cut will enable less blood loss and therefore , less scarring .
There will be a camera attached to each robot to provide three dimensional images and visual magnification (Morristown Memorial Hospital , 2009) .
This provides safe operation for the surgeons and better control of the system .
Traditional surgeons used to spend long hours operating without changing their hand postures .
With the robot , surgeons can now sit comfortably controlling the robots , hands positioned in a natural forward position , relieving stress as compared to the traditional open surgery (Morristown Memorial Hospital , 2009) .
The final issue is the cost of the surgery and system .
According to an article (The Journal of Urology , 2004) , the cost of each surgery ranges from a few hundreds to a few thousands depending on what surgery is performed .
The cost of the system is estimated at $120 000 with a yearly maintenance of $100 000 (The Journal of Urology , 2004) .
Although the cost is high , it is definitely worth the money given the quality that the system can provide .
The extra cost from the elimination of surgeons can also be used for the maintenance fee of the robots .
The government will also subsidize for the cost of the system and also for people who are in need of financial help .
In conclusion , surgical robots play a very important role in hospitals .
The number of surgeons in each operating theatre is reduced .
Actual precision such as keyhole techniques  produces less scarring and less blood loss .
Robots can also help to reduce hand stress of the surgeons from long hours of surgery .
Surgeons are well-trained before they can operate the robots .
This will enhance safety of patients .
Although the cost of the surgery is high , given the high quality provided from the robots such as shorter hospital stays , faster recovery and safe operation , surgical robots should therefore be encouraged worldwide .
Firstly , people may doubt the safety of SFR with respect to its coolant and waste , as VHTR almost des not have any f , aste , and id Sodium , which can react with air , water and many other things .
However , according to the design , SFR is an entirely closed system containing nuclear fuel and Sodium that can only touch with the inner surface of it helps ease global warmingysNevertheless ,  as a Passive safety confirmatioaboutin case of emergency .
If a sodium-water reaction happens , this securing system willplants" , especially its a buffer befor radioactiveadioactive sodium and the steam or water" to prevent the release of tsecitative sodium their Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nucleathe usuallyy Systems , 2002) .
In addition , although the reacttson involved in SFR is not complete and wastes like plutonium and actinide will occur consequently , the effective recovery and recyc -- safetye cwastes" pre designed in context of these problems .
According to the data given by Generation IV International Forum (2002) , the effectiveness of recovery and recycle of actinides can be as high as 99 .9% .
In contrassystems -- SodiumTR produces minimal wastes , it Very-Highves one-circle reaction , whibased on stes cannot be recperformance considerationslearillustrate thatew Dawn" , 2004) .
Therefore , safety is not a problem for SFR and it is safer than VHTR in some degree .
Another issue is about the performance , or economic evaluation of these two reactors .
Exactly , because of the temperature factor , the power supplier SFR cannot be as efficient as VHTR , which can achieve efficiency higher than 50% ("A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems" , 2002) .
Yet , SFR is still quite efficient and economic-friendly in terms of its recycle of nuclreachund flexibility in the plant structuMoreoverith its effective recovery and recycle of actinides , SFR can achieve converting 99% of natural uranium energy into electricity .
Besides , in the six protocols , SFR is one of the only two systems that have flexible options of building different sizes of power plant .
More specifically , its power supply can range from a few hundred MW(e) for Mid-Size plant to 1500- 1700 MW(e) for Large Monolithic plant ("A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems" , 2002) .
However , VHTR only can be built as Large Monolithic plant .
That means SFR is able to meet requirement of economic factors in different situations better than other reactors .
Hence , the SFR still can meet the performance and economist requirement in the future .
tsicofeconomic requirementsmeet theas afor afor aThirdly , about cost , it is quite clear that SFR is among thosn , low-cost Generation IV Because no matter from Research and Development or from plant aspect .
Especially , with only 610M$ , the cost of Research and Development of SFR is exactly the lowest one comparing to the other five protocols ("A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV NucleaalSystems" , 2002) .
In addition , the effectiveness of its utilization of nuclear fuel also ciedntributes to its low cost if it is launched into production .
Therefore , SFR benefits more with its lower cost than VHTR .
In conclusion , Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor has a more consummate security system than Very-High-Temperat , whether based ono insure its safety .
And , the erence featuresn the perforance of SFR and VHTR is minimized .
In addition , the low cost of SFR exactly benefits a lot foreds economic requirement and fetches up the difference of its performance .
Considering above aspects , SFR can meet the future requirement better .
Nuclear energy is a new kind of energy generated from nuclear power plants .
A hugeuge amount of nuclear energy will come out during atomic reactions .
Because of its high efficiency and enormous quantity , nuclear power energy has developed rapidly in recent years .
However , many negative aspects of nuclear energy , such as radiation pollution , waste heat , greenhouse gas emission etc , also cause people to question its reliability .
Nowadays people argue about the safety  and economic cost of nuclear power generation and they doubt  its ability to help ease climate change as well asserted specifically by some scientists .
According to  scientific observations of nuclear power generation and the positive effect of nuclear energy , there is no doubt that nuclear power is one of the best ways for energy generation , although there are some negative influences .
One of the most controversial issues is the safety  of nuclear power plants .
Everyone knows that nuclear reaction produces a lot of radiation waste which will harm human health .
In the past years , accidents did  happen .
One catastrophic example was the Chernobyl accident  in 1986 in Russia which caused 28 deaths within 4 months and up to 56 fatalities by 2004 just because of  steam explosion and a slight waste release of the radiation of the reactor's core (Chernobyl Accident , April 2009) .
Nevertheless , scientists found that nuclear power risks are actually tiny and they can also be further reduced through using the updated technological reactors .
Facts also indicated that the record of the operational safety of nuclear plants is much better than any other types of power plants (debate on nuclear power , n .d) .
Hence , compared with other energy , nuclear energy actually is much safer !
The second controversial topic about nuclear power is its high cost .
Millions and billions of dollars will have to be spent to build a nuclear power plant .
For example , in May 2008 the congressional budget office reported that the actual cost for the construction of 75 nuclear power plants in the USA is 45 .2 billion dollars; furthermore , they eventually cost  144 .6 billion dollars after taking the facilities into account ({ Benjamin K . S .}[HYPERLINK: http://scitizen .com/screens/usersPage/userSummary/sw_userDisplay .php ?idUserDisplayed=899&sign=08b456d033fcee27acbc8caf208135e8] Nov 2008) .
The astronomical cost is the reason why many people are against nuclear energy development .
But the  argument only considersshort-term effects while it does not pay attention to  long-term impact .
In fact , compared to other forms of electricity generation , nuclear power is ascendant with lower cost .
The MIT has published a 2-year study on the prospects of nuclear energy in USA .
The results showed that the generation cost is 4 .2 c/kWh , which is just the same as coal , eliminating all carbon cost .
An industry study for European electricity has made a comparison of the electricity costs among gas , coal and nuclear in 2005 .
The final data suggested that with its 5% discount rate , nuclear is much cheaper than all the others  (The Economics of Nuclear Power , July 2009) .
In the long run , the cost of nuclear power is much lower than others .
Another reason why people argue against nuclear power is that people doubt  its ability to help ease climate change .
People argue that nuclear is not emission-free at all .
They argue that if we take into account emission in relation to plant construction , uranium mining , transportation radiation and the contamination storage  , in the UK for example , its 23 nuclear reactors can only cut less than 8% emissions .
However , the European Union stated that more achievement with 20% reduction can be reached at zero net costs by 2020 (Velloor R , 2009) .
But the truth is nuclear power can do more than what has been mentioned .
Take France as example .
Its emission of nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide has been reduced by 70% over 20 years .
In India , the government also stated that it will sharply reduce  global warming gas to combat climate change (Velloor R , 2009) .
There is no doubt that nuclear power can efficiently help ease climate change with low cost .
Generally speaking , nuclear power is becoming more and more acceptable .
Some countries which did not support nuclear power before , like Australia , have started developing their nuclear power generation .
In an earlier survey , more than half of the Australians support nuclear power now; even 92% of them think it is quite an important approach help ease climate change (Australian attitudes to uranium , 2007) .
Although some technological problems still exist , nuclear power energy , as one of the energies of the future , will surely become more and more popular . 
The notion of addressing the world's power needs has never been more pressing as developing countries become more developed , population increases tremendously and demands for power supply escalate exponentially .
It is in time like this that mankind is driven to innovate and churn out alternate solutions , hoping that coupled with existing ones , he can solve or at the very least tackle the problem effectively; and in this case , an experimented , practical solution would be the further development of nuclear energy .
Due to the numerous advantages that nuclear energy brings about , it is very likely to be one of the most feasible solutions to the world's energy crisis .
While there are public concerns about  cost , security and safety issues involved , the new generation IV reactors are proposed to address these areas of concern .
One particularly advanced concept is the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , which makes use of helium coolant , which is inert and not reactive , and produces electricity and hydrogen , which is in turn used for the formation of hydrogen cell (GEN IV International Forum , 2003) .
These advantages , along with other safety precaution in place , will definitely serve to tackle the energy problem of the world .
Nuclear energy has never been a foreign subject to energy scientists .
A vastast amount of resources , manpower and time has been invested in research involving it .
Nuclear energy is most commonly produced by the fission of uranium , which produces 10 million times the energy produced by the combustion of an atom of carbon from coal (McCarthy , 2008) .
In light of this , nuclear scientists all over the world are hoping to harness this rich pool of energy .
With the exponential increase in energy consumption , nuclear energy will prove to be a good alternative , or even a primary source of energy .
Detractors argue that it is not cost effective to carry out such research .
The critique is that such costs may not even bear fruit .
However , this is a rather myopic view , as research generally entails foreseeable results in the long run .
The amount of money required for research is initially estimated at 6 billion over the next 15 years for the 6 Generation IV reactors , but one must realize that subsequently the cost of maintaining the nuclear plant as well as the raw materials are far cheaper than coal (World Nuclear Association , 2008) .
The inexpensive fuel cost and the sheer volume of energy produced by a nuclear reactor far outweighs the cost of research and development .
The next key agenda on the minds of the public is nonetheless the safety considerations and implications that these nuclear reactors can have .
While we can gladly say that nuclear leakages are not rampant over the past few years , we can never forget the reactor meltdown back in 1979 at Three Mile Island , where lives were taken away (Butler D , 2004) .
This not only serves as a reminder for generations but also for scientists to reflect upon and further enhance their research .
In fact , it is because of these very reasons that the Generation IV reactors were proposed --  to further improve on the safety aspect of existing reactors .
Most thoughts were put into the proposal to ensure the  level of safety and security in producing such a powerful reactor .
We have realized how much a nuclear power plant is capable of , and a reactor of such magnitude should it land in the hands of the undesired will have grave consequences .
Security issues tied with nuclear power plants have been a very sensitive topic as political leaders have to account for the internal and international security of their country .
However , the concept of a VHTR , one of the safest reactors proposed , encompassed this consideration and will prove hard to be a security breach due to the high temperature in which the nuclear byproducts are embedded in (EU and Energy research , 2007) .
Indeed , nuclear power development carries with them a social stigma; being dangerous and harmful to the society even in the modern world as mankind is skeptical about its use and benefits , and instead are more wary of the few incidents whereby lives were lost .
However , this societal stigma can be eradicated with the help of time , together with education on nuclear energy .
Nuclear energy does not produce greenhouse gases or acid rain , and thus governments abiding by the Kyoto Protocol will definitely be looking at this to cut down on  greenhouse emission .
I definitely believe that it is too early to simply brush aside the whole concept of nuclear energy and classify it as being unsafe .
While we might have our reservations , given the test of time , nuclear energy will be able to prove its worth in our society .
The devastating damage and long-term , "chronic" consequences of the two nuclear disasters at Hiroshima and Nagasaki  still remind us about how dangerous this type of weapons is .
Greenpeace and a lot of volunteer groups and organizations around the world are trying their best to ensure that those calamities will never occur again .
Nevertheless , the scenario of no fuel resources left and increasing extreme weather caused by global warming nowadays have pushed us to reconsider nuclear power .
Governments and scientists support the wide use and development of nuclear power .
Obviously , to lessen the world's thirst for energy in the long term , and to reduce the growing number of disasters , I am in favor of using nuclear power as a main resource of energy in the future .
First of all , we have to ease  public worry .
Consequences of nuclear disasters are still among the most fearful images of the human race .
With approval to widely use nuclear power , authorities have to be responsible for the safety of the entire process .
Mistakes are impermissible because they would kill several people and totally destroy a huge area .
There are also a lot of nerve-wracking problems , particularly chronic diseases many years after a disaster .
Security is the second issue when operating nuclear power plants .
Discrimination is widespread around the world due to terrorism , racism and religion .
Some nations even publicize their support for these idealisms .
Because of this , any source of  .
Otherwise , the degree of destruction would be more fatal than those mistakes in operating nuclear power plants .
However , the shift from fossil fuels to nuclear power is inevitable .
Global warming and worldwide shortage of energy are main problems .
Typhoon Ketsana , Hurricane Katrina , and tsunamis striking the South- and South-East Asia are some apparent consequences of global warming .
In addition , more difficult problems soon arise if we keep using fossil fuels .
Acidification , famine , and disappearance of permafrost , coastal areas and agricultural lands will threaten our future  .
The reserves for fossil fuels are running out .
Thus , nuclear energy is a prominent alternative .
Further research brought us the promising generation IV concept , the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) .
It not only generates 50% more electricity  than conventional plants from the same amount of fuel , but can also split hydrogen from water , which is another fuel for the future .
Then , we can use energy that is safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and yet proliferation resistant (Butler , 2004) .
First of all , it is possible to generate a large amount of electricity with just a plant .
The VHTR has the highest potential among the six generation IV reactor designs .
Many plants operating at the same time will give us more than enough electricity for industrial and city needs .
It is a remarkable benefit of nuclear energy compared to other developing kinds of energy like solar energy and wind power .
Those types just meet the requirements of residential , office and house needs .
Using nuclear power is a long-term solution to human need for energy .
That is why nuclear energy is said to be abundant .
Secondly , this technology has had a long process of development while solar energy and wind power have just been developed recently .
Humans do not need to invest too much on it compared to other kinds of energy .
Thus , a large amount of money can be saved .
Thirdly , nuclear energy frees us from fossil fuel dependence .
That means no monopoly of some oil-rich nations like in the present .
It will prevent some countries from abusing fuel as a way of achieving political and economic power to form a new world order .
In contrast with fossil fuel , uranium is evenly deposited around the world .
Thus , there will be enough fuel for all nationsand regions .
With this fuel , nuclear power plants are no longer vulnerable to some unexpected scenarios , such as wars , natural disasters or economic disorders .
This is the reliability of nuclear energy .
Lastly , more procedures will help decrease the potential danger of nuclear energy .
Nuclear waste can also be recycled and reprocessed .
Thanks to the rapid pace of technology development nowadays , new materials for reactor construction , ways of observing and controlling process , we can be assured that past accidents like Chernobyl will never happen again .
Without nuclear disasters , no people die due to working inside nuclear power plants .
However , each year , many people all over the world die from respiratory diseases because of the burning of coal , gas , oil , etc .
In conclusion , the advantages of nuclear energy outweigh the disadvantages .
Regulatory systems will create more strict safety measures .
As global energy demands are predicted to soar  relentlessly , nuclear energy is a prominent resource .
It will not only mitigate the consequences of global warming , but also help lessen the world's thirst for fuel for a long period .
We , human beings , have to adapt to a new age of nuclear powerand  fully exploit it rather than be uneasy and doubtful about this controversial type of energy .
With increasing concerns over the impact of global warming and oil prices , fossil fuels alone will not be able to meet the world's increasing energy demand in the future  .
While oil will remain indispensible for transport for a long time , nuclear energy , with its large and cheap output of energy , has the potential to play a big role in supplying the rest of the world's energy demands .
Nuclear energy is currently supplying 17% of the world's energy demand ;  however this number is projected to drop as old plants close more frequently than new ones open .
Unless a new source of sustainable energy is discovered , continuous research and development of nuclear energy should be conducted in order to sustain the economies of the world .
The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of the nuclear generation IV reactor concepts that should be given priority in  research and development .
It uses helium , an unreactive gas , as a coolant and operates at high temperature to achieve high efficiency .
It has  one of the earliest delivery dates among the other generation IV reactors .
Many projects incurred high costs due to extended periods of research and development , thus it is economically more sensible to give priority to a project that has an earlier delivery date .
Moreover , the VHTR does not require the reprocessing of nuclear waste , thus avoiding the separation of plutonium , a key ingredient in making advanced nuclear weapons .
The difference between the cost of nuclear and conventional power plants is perhaps the most important factor in the research and development of the former .
The costs mainly comprise of two components: the investment and generation cost .
Typically , the investment cost of a nuclear power plant is much higher due to its design .
However , based on generation cost , nuclear power plants have a significant economic advantage over conventional power plants .
The high investment cost is offset by the generation cost , making nuclear energy a much cheaper form of energy .
According to Jones and Woite (1990) , in countries where raw materials for generation of energy is not readily available , nuclear electricity is significantly cheaper .
On the other hand , for example in the coal-rich regions of China , coal-based electricity is much cheaper .
Many countries depend on the import of oil , gases and coal for generation of electricity , which means that cheaper electricity is only limited to countries with control over fossil fuel .
Since 1990 , oil prices have risen steadily as sources of fossil fuel decrease and demands for fossil fuel increase .
It is apparent that eventually nuclear energy will be significantly cheaper even in regions that are rich in fossil fuel .
The main reason for public opposition to nuclear energy could be the lack of confidence in the safe operation of nuclear power plants  .
The Chernobyl (1986) and Three Mile Island (1979) accidents are frightening examples of how devastating a nuclear accident can be .
Even until today , people are  dying from the effects of radiation caused by the accidents .
During World War II , the world also witnessed the large scale effects of radiation on both environment and humans when an atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The nuclear power industry is still a relatively new one and  confidence in the safe running of  nuclear reactors comes only with experience over time .
Despite this , the nuclear industry has already an established safety system and stringent checks , and over time , the industry would be able to prove its safety records .
There has been a concern over how the growth of nuclear power will contribute to nuclear proliferation .
The world now already has enough nuclear weapons to blow up the whole planet .
In addition , majority of the nations with nuclear plants own nuclear weapons as well and the nations with the most number of nuclear plants own most of the nuclear weapons worldwide .
Nuclear was first developed under a project codenamed "The Manhattan Project" and it was fueled by  competition with the Nazis to develop the world's first atomic bomb during  War World II .
The technology was later used to generate energy , thus it is inevitable that most countries own both nuclear weapons and plants .
With the introduction of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) , majority of the nations have adhered to it and has since concluded that it is also in their security interest to remain without nuclear weapons .
In summary , nuclear energy will continue to play an important role in meeting the world's energy demands .
However , with increasing public opposition to nuclear technology due to the harmful effects of the radiation produced , in recent years more plants have shut down than new ones opening .
The cause is due to concerns over the cost of nuclear plants and most importantly , the safe operation of nuclear plants and the issue of nuclear proliferation .
The concerns are uncalled for as continuous research and development will bring about cheaper and safer operation of nuclear plants .
Measures are also in place to keep nuclear proliferation in check .
As new reactor concepts develop  , it is no surprise that nuclear energy is the "next big thing" .

s salts with radioactive fission substances in water is zero .
The salts are also not easy to become radioactive products under neutron bombardment .
The other reason is that low-pressure molten salts cannot cause a steam explosion in the core absolutely .
(Charles W . F . , 2004) In addition , almost no excess reactivity of the fuel goes on in the reactor , since the fuel is added in as needed and the radioactive substances are removed on-line from the nuclear plant .
Moreover , Molten salt reactor costs less than other reactors under development which is indicathe othern the table .
Why fluorides are favored to be used as coolant is because fluorine does not need expensive isotope separation as chlorine does (Per F . P . & HaiHua Z . , 2004) .
What is more , in the core of reactor , the pressure is relatively low .
Thus there is no need for the quite expensive high-pressure steam vessel .
Instead , the low prssure pipes built of thin sheets of metal are used .
Since the metal pipes are thick , it costs less to construct and weld .
In addition , the efficiency is raised effectively due to the high temperature , which accordingly reduces the use of fueost of complementary ) .quipment by 50% or more .
{(GIF , 2007)}[HYPERLINK: http://www .gen-4 .org/Technology/systems/msr .htm] These properties imply that MSRs can work in small sizes , which reduces the cost of land and construction .
reducingFurthermora M , some experts do not support MSRs for two constraints .
One is that the alloy Hastelloy-N cannot matcFlouridesmperature of the reaction .
The otheis the decay heat produced by noble metals which can damage the heat exchanger .
(Paul P . , 2002) Nevertheless , these two limitations can bethe rsolved by carbon-carbon heat exchangers .
A Thus ,eries of experiments show that graphite-based materials can well match the tempture of molten salts which is as high as 700 to 800 Celsius .
Actually , the carbon-carbon heattheyxchaners are compatible with molten salts even 1000 Celsius .
For the second constraint , phite is not easy to be wetted by fluoride salts .
Therefore , the amount of plated out noble metals is significantly reduced and it is easy for trapping systems to remove those noble metal from the system .
(Per F . P . & HaiHua Z . , 2004)
) .In conclusion , it is worthwhile to further develop thereasonst reactor in order to fulfill the booming energy demands .
First is because MSRs are relatively safe among the other reactors under development .
Besides , MSRs provide the counties a much more) .economic way to develop nuclear plant .
Last but not least , the two main challenges of MSRs are solved by the new technology called carbon-carbon heat exchanger .
Thus , under current circumstance , the new dawn of Molten salt reactor will come soon .
Many major engineering accidents have occurred around the world such as the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents .
Some feel that  incorporating psychology into the design process can help to avoid such accidents from happening .
This could be one of the reasons why Psychology is now being taught in the design graduate programs of many institutes , such as Chicago's Institute of Design ; it is also used in some design firms (Psychology by design , n .d) .
Psychology is , in short , the scientific study of human mind and its functions , especially those affecting behaviour .
By understanding psychology one would be able to enhance his or her thinking style and creativity , therefore would be able to come up with  better solutions during the design process .
Therefore , the use of psychology in the design process would help to prevent major engineering accidents from happening again .
As stated by Wilpert(2007) , the train accident in Eschede (Germany) , in the year 1998 , was one of the major engineering accidents that had occurred .
It has been documented that the crack in the wheel of the train caused it to derail  (Eschede train disaster , n .d) .
As every design process involves more than one engineer , some people might argue that this accident occurred due to poor team work and effort .
They suggest that if there had been a better team of engineers involved in the design process , they would have worked in an effective and productive manner and would have been able to come up with a better piece of design for the wheel  , thus preventing the accident .
However , these people are not aware that the use of psychology helps one to understand the people around him as well as know their strengths and weaknesses .
This way , during the design process they would have been able to split themselves up into smaller groups and work on the part of the design process they are strong at .
This would help them to specialize in the area they are strong at and hence the entire process would be conducted more effectively , resulting in a better solution or design for the wheel .
Therefore , if psychology had been used in the design process , the accident would not have happened .
Opponents of the use of psychology would argue that if a prototype of the wheel had been built and tested at a high speed it would have prevented the accident .
Khandani (2004)) also states  that building of a prototype , which is the last step , is very important as it helps us to know if the design is reliable to  use .
However , it was noted that Germany did not have sufficient facilities to facilitate the prototype then (German ICE Accident , n .d) .
Therefore , even if a prototype had been built it would not have been possible to test it out with  real conditions .
The use of psychology , on the other hand , would have helped to prevent the accident .
The design process places a very high demand on the creativity of  engineers involved , which is closely related to  thinking ability .
Therefore , the use of cognitive psychology would have helped to prevent the accident .
According to Wanger (n .d .) ,  cognitive psychology focuses on the essence of human thinking .
The use of cognitive psychology would enhance  style of thinking and creativity in the design process , encouraging the engineers to come up with an effective and safe design .
There are a group of people who might strongly feel that if proper research has been done , the engineers at Eschede would have come up with a better design such that any fault in the wheels would have been detected and hence prevented the train from moving .
High technology research on this aspect of design would have been possible and hence would have prevented the accident .
However , the study of psychology focusing on  Human Computer Interaction (HCI) helps one to use the rapidly advancing telecommunication and research facilities to their advantage .
As mentioned , "modern information and communication technologies drastically change the nature of the design process" (Wilpert , 2007 p .297) .
Therefore , the study of HCI would better enable the engineers to analyse  information they gather and would hence  to be able to come up with innovative designs which look into the safety of the design .
Therefore , the use of  psychology would have helped  prevent the accident .
In conclusion , incorporating psychology into the design process would help to enhance the creativity and style of thinking of the engineers and it would also help the engineers to better interact with  advanced technologies and modern information .
Psychology also helps teamwork to be effective  .
Therefore , the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
s'moreGiven the memories of previous nuclear reactor accidents , the public concerns a lot about the safety of nuclear  to ensure safety is the primary goal of MSR , it has good safety factors .
Molten salt reactor systems use liquid saltuel together .
It has an integrated fuel cycle , taking advantage of the great heat transport propert of molten salt CITATION Mal09 \l 1033 (Malten Salt Reactords  .The reaction processworks towardslow chemical reactivity  .Ted operators CITATION Nuc04 \l 1033 (Nuclear Power's New Dawn , 2004) .
This can prevent any deliberate accident and minand waste damage of accidents .
Consequently , we should further develop these techniques , conduct more tests in different situations and do enough precaution measures .
Then safety can be ensureis most advancedn though accident happens , the loss can be eliminated .
d ,narycarry outFurthermore , another main concern from the public is the performance is concernedation during reaction process .
But the fact is that the MSR will be advanced enough to solve these problems .
The MSR systemeasuress an integrated fuel cycle .
This implies that to build a MSR coud be smaller than other reactor concepts and that the efficiency of thermal power output would be higher CITATION Cha04 4) .
At the same time ) .
can split hydrogen from water , which ca and be alternativreactivity .
Thesport to deal with oil shortage CITATION Nuc04 \l 1033 (Nuclear Power's New Dawn , 2004) .
So its performance is quite advwhen and among the six coallows for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity and shorter-lived radioactivity , the radiation can be minimycled and now new technology is planned to isolate waste from the biosphere .
CITATION Lui09 \l 1caused by3 (Echavarri , 2009)As the result , radiation and waste will not be a significant problem anymore .
Besides , opponents argue that the use of nuclear planwould be too expensive to cduring the with other resource such as coal and gas .
But we should realize that even though currently coal and gas are widely used because they are cheaper , they will be used up one anay .
Then how will our children and grand children live on ?
So now we should not only consider the economic profit velopment of the human society .
The , MSR use thorium as fuel .
Thorium is more abundant than uranium and its price is quite cheap .
It is well e . Therefore compared with the other reactors , MSR has Economical and social advantages .
MSR can convert heat to electricity with high efficiency .
The 4th generations are enhanced to longer lifetimes .
All these increase its economic competitiveness .
Moreover , as the development of this new technology , costs can be cut down g it can compete f) .
Asrably with other energy source .
estechnology developsee ,a wellrelativelyesOpponentsl challenges are using green resources and energy to get a radical reduction of CO2 emissiesns to deal with climate change and to pursue sustainable development .
The MSR can produce nuclear energy with high safety and efficiency .
Even though lots of problems still need to be solved , the benefits are far greater than disadvantages .
So furr research on the MSRould be supported .
In recent years , oil has become very important to many people by providing fuel for cars and most importantly , generating electricity .
We are using more tools that require electricity with technological advancement .
This means that we need more oil to meet our rising energy demands , causing the oil price to increase due to depleting oil reserves .
At the same time , burning oil to generate electricity also releases a large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
This has caused many environmental problems like global warming .
Thus , there is a need for us to find other ways of generating electricity .
One alternative we have is nuclear power .
However , there are many who oppose  this idea because they feel that this choice is expensive , unsafe and cannot perform as well as others like renewable energy .
Thus , scientists have come out with the idea of Generation IV Reactors , which will be safer , cheaper and better in terms of performance .
The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of these reactors .
Since  the Generation IV Reactor that is expected to have one of the earliest deliveries with the highest power output (Butler , 2004) ,  research on it should be supported and continued .
Firstly , many people oppose the use of nuclear power as a form of energy because it is expensive to research and build  .
However , they do not realise that nuclear power is expensive only at the early stage .
In the long run , nuclear power is still a cheaper alternative fuel as VHTR can generate fifty percent more electricity from the same amount of fuel in the current coal-powered power plants (Butler , 2004) .
Besides this , the rising price of oil will eventually become much more expensive than the radioactive materials used .
In the long run , the cost of setting up the plant and researching can be offset .
Thus , nuclear power is not expensive compared to other sources .
Secondly , people may argue that nuclear power is not safe  because of the radiation that radioactive materials give out .
The Three Mile Island accident and Chernobyl accident are evidence of their claims .
In the Chernobyl accident alone , there were fifty-six deaths (World Nuclear Association , 2004) .
Hence , they feel that nuclear power is dangerous .
Yet , according to the World Nuclear Association (2008) , the most serious case of nuclear reactor accident was the Chernobyl accident with fifty-six deaths while a recent coal mine methane explosion in China has caused seventy-eight deaths .
Thus , nuclear power is not as dangerous as we thought .
Furthermore , in the new concept of VHTR , it will be "meltdown proof" so it will  still be safe if accidents happen (Butler , 2004) .
Thus , nuclear power is not as dangerous compared to other sources of energy and  VHTR can be made safer with modern technology .
Lastly , people claimed that it cannot perform as well as other sources of energy since it is not sustainable (Langwith , 2009) .
The radioactive materials will run out one day like oil and coal , giving us the problems that coal and oil are giving us today .
Thus , they feel that we should use renewable resources like solar and wind for power .
However , nuclear power is actually a better choice over other sources of energy because it has the best output for its cost and land area occupied .
Many renewable resources like solar and wind require a lot more land mass to generate sufficient energy (Mckenna , 2007) .
Thus , the amount of electricity generated per land area is not as much as nuclear power .
So , if we use renewable resources , we will have to clear more land , which is harmful to the environment .
Furthermore , nuclear power is one of the cheapest powers to generate now (The Royal Academy of Engineering , 2004) .
Thus , even though nuclear power cannot perform for a long time like other renewable powers ,  it is the best performing power that we can rely on now for its efficiency per land area and cost .
In conclusion , coal and oil are no longer sources of energy that we should rely on because of their rising costs and environmental impact .
Thus , there is a need for other sources of power .
Currently , generating power using the nuclear reactor , VHTR , will be our best choice since it has zero emission , cheap , safe and efficient .
Thus ,  research on VHTR should be continued and funded to get ourselves ready before the demand for energy increases much more in 2050 as predicted (Butler , 2004) .
As noted in "Nuclear power's new dawn" , Butler said that the public is concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Public opposition was one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries .
However , nuclear energy is more efficient and gives a new future for  energy consumption , especially after the use of generation  IV nuclear reactors (Hill , 2008) .
In my perspective , it is a good choice to support and fund the development of generation  IV nuclear reactors for future energy consumption .
The first reason  why it is good to fund and support the development of Nuclear energy for future energy consumption is  the limitation of energy resources .
The main energy resources human beings consume today are coal , oil , natural gas and some other non-renewable resources .
People may argue that we still have enough resources in the following centuries; however , according to a survey done by  world geographers ,  oil will be used up 40 years later if human beings continue using it like they do now .
Natural gas will last 60 years and  coal can last a little longer time , 160 years .
nuclear energy now is hot and it will show its great use in the next few centuries (Gerstner , 2009) .
Scientists in Taiwan plan to build a nuclear reactor and here are some data they made public .
If they build a power plant that can produce 17 .8 billion kilowatt-hour of electricity , they need 81 ton uranium , or 4 .34 million ton oil , or 6 .51 million ton coal  From this it can be seen that the uranium can produce more energy per kilogram and it can partly solve the issue concerning limitation of energy resources .
In this case it will be a good decision to fund the development of nuclear energy , especially the generation  IV nuclear reactors .
Besides the advantages mentioned earlier ,  nuclear energy also does not produce any greenhouse gases , like carbon dioxide .
Many people think green house gases have nothing to do with nuclear energy .
Nevertheless , from a news report in 2008 , "Nuclear power gets green light from UK government" , the UK government decided to use nuclear energy to reduce the production of carbon dioxide .
The generation  IV reactors can really reduce the production of green house gases (Butler , 2004) .
People may argue that  many accidents have happened related to nuclear reactors .
We cannot deny it ; for example , on 26th of April , 1986 , the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl , Ukraine leaked and exploded  .
Although the possibility of accidents exists , under strict management and better technology , the number of accidents will be reduced and nuclear energy will be a kind of energy that is environmental friendly  .
The public should fund its development .
A country can also benefit a lot from nuclear energynot because it is a kind of future energy but also because it can enhance the speed of economic development (Hill , 2008) .
People always say that economic development will depend on  comprehensive national strength or  national power , not  nuclear energy .
However , they may not see the importance of nuclear energy in improving  .
According to a report made by OPEC , in 2009 , China consumed 8 .27 million barrels of oil a day , which is 0 .29 million barrels more per day than 2008 .
And China will rely almost 50% of its whole energy consumption on oil .
The money for oil import is a huge number and that money can do many other infrastructure constructions .
As mentioned before , the material for nuclear energy can produce much more energy per kilogram .
Hence , China will reduce a lot of its oil import if nuclear energy is widely used and accepted by the public .
The generation  IV reactors will perform very well in this aspect .
If we can support and fund the nuclear energy for future development , it will enhance the speed of economic development .
In conclusion , it will be a good decision to fund the development of generation  IV nuclear reactors for future energy consumption .
Nuclear energy has three main advantages --  its high rate of energy production , its being environmental friendly , and its ability to  enhance a country's economic development . 
As we advance into the age of technology , we witness many breakthroughs .
It is significant that nuclear power has marked a new era of science and technology .
However , some people have lost their confidence in nuclear power development after the occurrence of nuclear disasters in Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
But the generation IV reactors that are currently under research and development have been greatly improved and hence they are much safer than conventional plants .
Of the six generation IV reactors ,  the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) has the most potential to be selected for further R&D funding .
Specifically , compared with the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) , the VHTR is saferand incurs low operation and maintenance costs and modular construction costs .
The MSR operates at the temperature of 700-800  C and low pressurs .
On the other hand , the VHTR requires a very high pressure since inert helium is used to keep the reactor cool .
Thus , the VHTR would incura higherr cost of installing since it needs thicker pipes to sustain the high pressure .
However , the VHTR which operates at a higher temperature is highly efficientin then conversion of heat to electricity compared to the MSR .
For instance , the VHTR could squeeze 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared to conventional plants (Butler , 2004) .
Therefore , with economy of scale , the cost of installing and maintaining the VHTR increaese less than proportionately with the plants' generating capacity due to its high efficiency .
Moreover , additionalR & D technologiesD for the VHTR includings high temperature alloy , fiber reinforced ceramics and composite materials can further improve the efficiency and cut down the costs (U .S . Department of Energy Nuclear , 2002) .
For instance , an optimized approachtor dealing with graphite is currently under research .
Thus , the VHTR is much cheaper than the MSR in overallcosts .
Some people might have a wrong assumption that the MSR has higher performance than the VHTR since it is a fast reactor that relies on fast neutrons while the latter is a thermal reactor that relies on moderators to slow neutrons first .
However , this is not true because the reactors' performances  also depend on  temperature and pressure .
In fact , the overall plant efficiency of the VHTR is more than 50%  compared to MSR's  44-50% .
This is because the VHTR is operating at a higher temperature , thus its thermal power output is up to 600 MW .
In addition , the VHTR is operating in a midsized plant as compared to the MSR which is  large in size .
Thus , it is true that the VHTR has higher performance .
Research shows that the MSR is safe to operate and maintain as the molten fluoride salts used are mechanically and chemically stable at sea-level pressures (DestinationScience .com) .
However , the MSR is operating with closed fuel cycle while the VHTR is operating with an open fuel cycle system .
Thus , the VHTR is neutral in sustainability which means that VHTR spent fuel that could be disposed of in a geological repository or conditioned for optimum waste disposal .
Therefore , the VHTR is definitely safe to be used because the encapsulation for the spent fuel fission products has been further improved so it is extremely resistant to leaching in a final repository (U .S . Department of Energy Nuclear , 2002) .
Furthermore , the MSR discards a larger amount of waste compared to the VHTR .
Even though  waste from the MSR undergoes recycling ,  this process is unsecure as this bypasses the stage where plutonium , an active ingredient for nuclear weapons , is produced .
Hence ,  plants might become  targets of terrorist .
In addition , the cost of recycling is very expensive and a lot of fuel still ends up as waste .
On the other hand , the VHTR enhances minimization through fuel recycling .
From the analysis , the VHTR will spend fuel in a symbiotic fuel cycle that can achieve significant reductions in waste quantity and radio toxicity because of its ability to accommodate a wide variety of mixtures of fissile and fertile materials without significantly modifying the core design (U .S . Department of Energy Nuclear , 2002) .
Thus , in terms of safety and security , the VHTR is actually much safer than the MSR .
In conclusion , the VHTR provides an economically competitive nuclear heat source and hydrogen production capability (Idaho National Laboratory Idaho Falls , 2006) .
Therefore , unremitting efforts and funding should be put into its research and development so that it would give a fresh impetus to enhance the development of nuclear power .
Should funding be given to  Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor over the other Generation IV reactors ?
There has been much debate on whether to develop Generation IV reactors , or to continue using Generation III reactors , which are much safer (Butler , 2004) .
However , with the rising need for energy , going ahead to develop the Generation IV concepts is a logical choice .
Among the six chosen concepts for Generation IV reactors , the Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor (SCWR) is one of the more popular choices (Butler , 2004) .
The SCWR has a much simpler design compared to the other chosen reactors , and would be cheaper to build and operate (Cogeneration Technologies , 2002) .
This will fulfill the nuclear reactors' main purpose of generating affordable and reliable electricity (Buongiorno , 2003) .
In addition , the SCWR is developed from existing technologies that work , which will result in a reduction in the cost of building it and also an increase in its reliability (Buongiorno , 2002) .
Therefore , the SCWR is the most feasible choice among all the other generation IV reactors .
The main reason for choosing the SCWR over the other reactors is the low cost of development (Buongiorno , 2003) .
The SCWR requires the least to develop , compared with the other reactors .
This is due to the SCWR being developed from existing technologies , and some of its core components can be recycled .
In addition , the coolant , water , used by the SCWR is the cheapest among the chosen Generation IV reactors .
The SCWR also creates hydrogen , which can be sold to the hydrogen economy , resulting in the reduction of operating costs (Buongiorno , 2003) .
Opponents of the SCWR would argue that water is a precious resource , and the amount of clean water available is decreasing .
This problem can be solved by using other methods to generate the water needed for the coolant .
One of the methods available to date is the distillation of sea water .
As the Earth is mostly made up of  water , there will be enough water to be used for the coolant of the SCWR .
Therefore , with the low cost needed to develop and run the SCWR , it will be an apt choice for more funding and development .
The rapid decrease in the amount of fossil fuels is leading to development of alternative energy sources .
Nuclear power is one of the frontier alternative power technologies that people have huge interest in .
However , converting nuclear power into usable energy is not a simple process .
Unfortunately , the development is not aided by nuclear disasters , such as the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and  the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979 , which are two of the most serious accidents which happened in nuclear power plants .
The current nuclear power plants use generation II reactors , for example , Pressurized Water Reactors and boiling water reactors .
However , the efficiency , security , economics and sustainability of generation II nuclear reactors are not up to the mark .
New nuclear technology is definitely needed to be developed to achieve a broader application in the power industry .
As a result , generation IV international forum (GIF) , initiated in 2000 , is currently developing six new nuclear technologies for deployment between 2020 and 2030 .
We will discuss two out of the six new nuclear technologies---Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) .
Then we will decide which one will better meet the energy deman of the future .
VHPR is a good reactor for utilization in the future .
It offers the potential for the cogeneration of electricity and hydrogen , alongside process heat .
Moreover , VHPR is expected to achieve an even higher efficiency than SFR due to its higher operating temperature .
However , after considering sustainability and practicality factors , SFR is better .
It is proven scientifically that hydrogen could be generated in the VHPR system .
However , it is not important , as no research has proven that the method of generating hydrogen can achieve a higher efficiency compared with generating electricity .
Besides , from a practical point of view , electricity is more widely used than hydrogen .
Most of the devices and appliances we are using today use electricity as a source of energy .
There is a rather mature and secure electricity transit and selling system in the world , while hydrogen transit is still a problem waiting to be solved .
It is not wrong to assume that under a higher temperature VHPR can achieve a higher efficiency than SFR .
However , VHTR's aim of operating above 1000 C presents significant challenges in terms of current scientific technology .
There is still a lot of research to be done before putting VHPR into service , which may bring many uncertainties in development and unpredictable cost .
In contrast , SFR has already benefited from considerable technological advancement .
As a result , it is easier for SFR to achieve its intended goal of providing energy to the world .
Similarly ,ditm has the potential too achieeg a higher efficiency rate .
According to an article in Nature Magazine , the earliest delivery of VHTR is estimated to be in 2020 , while SFR can be delivered by 2015 , five years earlier (Nuclear Power's New Down .
Nature  .
20 May 2004) .
Additionally , "SFR offers the potential to operate with a high conversion fast spectrum core , with the resulting benefit of increasing the utilization of fuel resources" .
("The Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR)" .
Generation iv technology forum .)
Lastly , SFR has an obvious advantage over VHTR .
SFR is supposed to be safer and more environmentally friendly than VHTR .
"SFR have the capability to efficiently and nearly completely consume trans-uranium as fuel , which would reduce the actinide loadings in the high-level radioactive waste it produces .
Such reductions would bring benefits in the radioactive waste disposal requirements associated with the system and enhance its non-proliferation attributes " ("The Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR)" .
Generation iv technology forum .)
Such feature increases sustainability of SFR and makes it easier to ease public anxiety over the security of new nuclear power technology .
Thus , it will be much easier to put nuclear power plants to work .
Nuclear power is a good substitution for fossil fuel .
The utilization of nuclear power is going to change the world and people's way of living  in the future .
At present , it is necessary for people to decide which one of the six new nuclear technologies is most valuable to our power needs .
It is reasonable to choose Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor instead of Very High Temperature Reactor since SFR has a narrower technology gap , safer and more environmentally friendly , can achieve a high efficiency rate and has the potential to be developed to reach a higher efficiency level beyond the hypothesis .
The first nuclear reactor was invented by Dr Fermi in 1934  .It produced plutonium for the world's first atomic bomb ("World first nuclear reactor , " 2008) .
The bomb , dropped in Japan during the World War II , killed more than 200 ,000 people .
In 1986 , the worst nuclear accident in history broke out in Chernobyl .
The meltdown of the nuclear plant caused 30 immediate deaths along with 100 ,000 cases of fatal cancers in the years that followed (Greenpeace UK , 2006) .
Seventy years into the nuclear age , we are being constantly reminded of its power and danger .
However , the world today has come to a crossroad where we might have to reconsider the role of nuclear power .
In many instances , nuclear power could be a solution to problems we are facing now .
For example , fossil fuel combustion which emits greenhouse gases can be substituted with nuclear power to produce electricity .
Nevertheless , with the high cost and the inadequately safe nuclear technology that we have now , convincing people to embrace nuclear power will not be possible without safer and cheaper technology .
Out of the various fourth generation nuclear reactors currently being researched , the Very High Temperature Reactor , also known as the VHTR , is one of the most promising ones .
Conventional nuclear reactors utilize heat produced from nuclear fission to boil water .
This water becomes steam and drives a turbine which produces electricity .
The VHTR , on the other hand , utilizes the heat to boil helium , an inert gas , which drives the turbine directly .
This brings up the efficiency of the reactor by as much as 50 percent (Hecht , 2008) .
Besides efficiency , VHTR also shows its potential in two other aspects .
The first aspect is in its inherent safety design .
In conventional nuclear reactors , the radioactive fission products remain in the reactor's core .
In the event of an explosion , these products will dissipate into the surrounding .
The VHTR , however , is designed such that the fission products are trapped inside the fuel particles .
These fuel particles , coated with layers of uranium oxycarbide , have the ability to absorb the radioactivity and withstand a temperature of 2000c , way above the working temperature of 1600c (Hecht , 2008) .
People may be concerned that the high temperature of VHTR can trigger an explosion .
However , the worry is unnecessary because the VHTR is able to shut down itself in a situation of abnormal high temperature .
When above normal working temperature is reached , the VHTR reactor is able to catch the highly accelerated neutrons and stop the chain fission reactions completely , thereby shutting down the whole system .
This is evidenced by the test carried out on one of the VHTR prototypes , HTR-10 in 2004 .
The helium coolant was cut off from the system and the reactor was able to shut down automatically without leakage of any radioactive particles (Hecht , 2008) .
The second aspect lies in its economics .
Most people are aware that building a nuclear plant is expensive .
According to a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2009) on the cost of nuclear power , the overnight cost (cost without interest incurred) of building a nuclear plant is US$4000 / kwh (kilowatt hour of electricity produced) .
A coal-fuelled plant of the same scale only cost US$1300/ kwh .
While its initial cost is high , VHTR makes up for its efficiency and versatility .
Besides electricity , VHTR also produces heat and hydrogen which can be harnessed for other industrial applications .
For example , heat can be used for petrochemical reprocessing while hydrogen can be used as fuel in fuel cell plants to produce even more electricity .
Hence , VHTR is actually more profitable to operate as electricity , heat and hydrogen can be obtained altogether .
Besides , non-monetary economics should be considered at the same time .
Traditional coal-fuelled power plants produce 20% of the world's emissions of greenhouse gases ("Coal and climate change fact" , n .d .) while VHTR does not produce any of such gases .
The environmental damage done , though not measurable in dollars and cents , should also be taken into account as  cost .
In this context , VHTR is much cheaper than coal-fuelled plants .
Nobody expected it .
In less than a minute , a six-storey building was reduced to a pile of rubble .
This was one of the deadliest civil accidents in Singapore , known as the Hotel New World collapse which happened on 15 March 1986  .
According to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (2009) , this misfortune took away 33 lives .
In an article on the collapse , Tan (1999) claimed that investigations showed the collapse was due to under design made by the engineers , shoddy workmanship and cost cutting made by the contractors (Tan , 1999) .
In this example of Hotel New World collapse , National Geographic (n .d .) also showed that warning signs of structure integrity failure surfaced 16 hours well before the collapse (National Geographic , n .d .) .
There are some special scenarios where no amount of logical preventive measures could prevent accidents from happening , but as far as this study is concerned , the devastating loss of human life and the collapse of Hotel New World could have all been avoided with the use of psychology during the design process , eliminating the errors committed by humans in the design and maintenance phase .
All modern buildings are designed to support what the experts call the dead load and the life load .
The dead load is the weight of the building itself and the life load consists of people and objects like furniture which the building has to support .
Calculations made by the draughtsman of Hotel New World in the designing phase was so badly wrong that he only considered  the life load and had forgotten about the dead load .
It was destined to collapse from the moment they designed the drawings .
Separating the submission of dead and life load calculations could ensure that both loading types were being considered in the designing phase .
To take an even further precautionary measure , safety factors could have been introduced to the design calculations to make way for any unprecedented human calculation errors .
In summary , this accident could have been prevented right from the beginning , taking human errors into consideration in the design phase .
No doubt engineers and contractors had to play a role in erecting the building and also ensuring the safe operation of the civil structure .
More importantly , the users or patrons must not assume ignorance .
Upon completing the construction of the building , the building went into the maintenance phase , making the building operational .
The building showed signs of failure in the structural integrity 16 hours well before the collapse , yet people who witnessed the failure did not react appropriately .
Staff of the building were alerted but did not know what to expect , whereas the management overlooked and had repair workers to fix the cracks in concrete by bracing it with timber .
This event would have turned out differently if the management teams of the building were psychologically prepared .
In other words , educated or briefed on such issues , the building would have been evacuated almost immediately , even having a buffer time of 16 hours on hand to do it , saving the lives of 33  .
In short , this accident could have been prevented with the aid of psychology during the design process in the maintenance phase .
As an additional pointer , the maintenance phase could act as a second safety net to catch  any remaining human errors left unsolved in the previous designing phase .
Risks are an integral part of our life .
Every day we are making risky decisions unknowingly .
It is just a matter of  degree in the risk taken: walking on the open street itself would also mean being exposed to  aircrafts crashing down on you . 
Freak accidents referr to unanticipated natural disasters , such as unforeseen or illogical scenarios like the tsunami that swept across Sri Lanka in year 2004 .
No amount of logical preventive measures taken could hav prevented the disaster from happening .
There are no absolute measures to an accident-free world .
What can be done is to minimize the risk as much as possible , preventing the occurrence of accidents close to nil  , learning from past mistakes and improving if an accident has occurred .
In an article on Keeping Building Engineers Well Grounded , Lee (2008) claimed that Hotel New World is iconic of the construction challenges in the 1970s (Lee , 2008) .
To conclude , it is evident that the arguments involving psychology during the design process in the design and maintenance phase would have prevented the accident in this particular study .
The author of Hotel New World Collapse , Hon (1987) , concluded that the design was bad , the construction was bad and the maintenance was bad .
Human errors  caused the failure of Hotel New World .
Nuclear reactors produce harmful or even deadly radiation while radioactive nuclear wastes are extremely difficult to handle and may even explode with no warning .
Nuclear reactors also produce plutonium as a by-product which can be used in the nuThe Clear weapons .
It raises a global concern that terrorists or aggressive countrnuclear have easier access to the nuclear weapons and may threaten the world peace .
Also , nuclear hseactors are opthe rrational only for around fifty years , requiria mg regular costly replacements
s .However , with increasing demands for energy due to industrialization and the rising price of oil and fossil fuels , nuclear energy remains as an important source of energy despite all the controversies .
Currently , there are mainly six differ types of reactors .
Among them , very-high- temperature reactor (VHTR) and sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) are sidered the two most advanced and iable systems .
The VHTR has an open fuel cycle and can supply electricity , hydrogen and heat at a highly efficient level .
Tfuelre reactor is connected to an intermediate heat exchanger to process heat and is able to output the temperature up to 1000 degree Celsius with more than 50% efficiency ("Very- High-Temperature Reactor" , 2003) .
On the other hand , the SFR has a closed loop fuel cycle and is designed to reduce wastes .
It demands less space of repositories as it recovers and recycles 99 .9% of the actinides and has the thermal efficiency of about 40% ("GEN-4: Technology: Systems") .
With regards to safety , the VHTR has certain desirable safety measures under both normal and extreme conditions .
However , the need to operate the VHTR above 1000 degree Celsius puts the limitations on the effectiveness of the safety measurement .
For the SFR system , safety measures consist of a long thermal response time , a huge margin to coolant boiling and a main mechanism that works near atmospheric pressre .
However , sodium reacts chemically with air or water and is a major safety drawback .
Nevertheless , with some innovations , a buffer can be introduced to prevent water vapor from reaching the radioactive sodium in the primary system .
Also , the SFR offers other safety measures such as automatic shutdown function and cooling function in case of accidents ("Jordi , Todd , Lineberry" , 2002) .
The cost ofa reactor varies with various factors .
For the VHTR , the cost is mainly associated with the heat exchanger size and the installation expenses which usually total to about US$781 .5 millions .
For the SFR , the cost can be reduced considerably by using some innovative methods to make a modular design or to remove a primary loop or to integrate the pump and the heat exchanger .
Although the cost of building a nuclear reactor is great and there are concerns about safety , there are several advantages of using nuclear energy as an energy source .
The small size of the nuclear pwer plants allows them to be integrated in the already developed regions and makes the long- distance power transfer unnecessary .
Also , the nuclear energy does not produce pollution directly into the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases .
Moreover , a large amount of energy can be produced in the nuclear power plants within a relatively short period of time .
The use of nuclear energy is also advantageous in a sense that it will never run out while oils reserves and fossil fuels are likely to be used up at some time .
With more research and investments in the nuclear technology , the SFR can become a viable energy source in the future .
The infety measures can be improved and the hazardous by-products can be reduced with the advancement of technology .
With the rising demand for energy and the increasinlong-distancermful effects of the use of oil andssil fuels to the environment , the nuclear energy offers an alternative and is regaining some of its popularity and early successes of 1970s .
in theBibliography
On 20 April 2004 ,  contractors and workers were having their usual tea break when they heard a loud thud from the structure that they were working on for the past few months .
The retaining wall of the tunnel for the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Circle Line at Nicoll Highway had collapsed (MOM , 2005) .
Four men were immediately killed (MOM , 2005) .The Nicoll Highway that links Kallang to the Central Business District had collapsed .(Ahmad ,A . ,2004) .
Now , it was damaged as a result of the collapse of the tunnel construction for the circle line .
The collapse of  Nicoll Highway was a controversial issue where everyone had his or her own views .
Could the use of psychology have prevented the accident ?
There were views from engineers as well as the parties involved , saying that the collapse was not due to a mistake in design as they followed the code of practice in their design and the safest bottom-up construction method was used .
There were no occupational hazards influenced by the decisiveness and attitude of the project managers .
The parties involved took pride in their work .
In my opinion , I felt that the collapse was due to a mistake in the design , the lack of integrity as portrayed by the parties involved and the management team's indecisiveness about the situation .
Indecisiveness and negligence of the management team , design mistake and lack of integrity are three factors of psychology which I felt were lacking in the design process which had resulted in the engineering accident .
The reason for the collapse of Nicoll Highway was not solely due to a mistake in the design .
Safety factors were taken into consideration in the design of the loads according to the Code of Practice (LTA , Sep1 , 2004) .
Furthermore , the common and safest bottom-up method was used , said a civil engineer working in LTA .
It was definitely a mistake in design as the investigation revealed that there was an error in the design of the strut support system and that it was under-designed(MOM , 2009) .
Also , it was under-designed by a safety factor of 2 (SCOSS , SC/06/102) .
There were omission and misintepretation of the code of practice (SCOSS , SC/06/102) .Therefore , the use of phsychology could have prevented the accident if the parties involved had not made any errors in the design .
The Land Transport Authority was decisive throughout the whole project as it shored up the surrounding ground to prevent further collapse of the repair work .
If they were indecisive , they would not have been able to decide what  steps to be taken to prevent further collapse .
However , there was evidence showing that the management teams had neglected their roles .
The management teams failed to provide adequate instrumentation and monitoring works , lacked  competent personnel to carry out specified works , and failed to identify adverse trends and implement corrective work (Ministry of Manpower , 2005) .
The management team did not make the right decision about the situation .
There were signs of structure failing but they were ignored (17 May 2005 , Ministry of National Development) .
The above evidence showed that there were human errors such as the negligence of the management team which had resulted in the collapse  .
The parties involved in the construction of  Nicoll Highway were carefully selected and one of them was the Land Transport Authority (LTA) .
Since it is under severe guidance by the government , there should have been  no problems with integrity or dishonesty .
However , there was evidence showing that there was dishonesty and lack of integrity among the parties involved .
From the book on Nicoll Highway Collapse , extracted from New Civil Engineer (2005) , Nishimatsu-Lum Chang (NLC) , being a party involved in the project , was negligent , reckless and dishonest during the design and construction of the retaining wall .
He cut costs by using scrap material as a replacement of stiffener plates as stated by Shanmugan (New Civil Engineer , 2005) .
If the parties involved had integrity and knew that  cutting costs would result in many casualties , the engineering accident would have been prevented .
It was due to the parties' lack of integrity , which was one of the psychological factors that they failed to demonstrate , that resulted in the collapse .
In conclusion , the use of psychology could have prevented the accident if the parties involved were careful about the design and made sure that it was not under-designed as in the case of  Nicoll Highway .
The carelessness and negligence of the management team  caused the accident .
If there were no cutting of costs in this case , the structure wouldn't have collapsed .
In many cases , structures failed due to the dishonesty of the parties involved in the construction process , not just Nicoll Highway but also the collapse of the Hotel New World .
Therefore , I felt that the use of psychology could have prevented the accident .
Nuclear energy generally refers to electrical power from controlled nuclear reactions .
Some people think nuclear energy is good but there are still people whothink we should not develop nuclear energy .
Two sides support their  views on pro and cons to nuclear energy .
In my opinion , we should further develop nuclear energy .
In Butler's (2004) article , there are 6 types of generation IV reactor .
If we look at Supercritical-water-cooled reactors , it is cheap and requires low temperature to generate electricity .
This means it is safer to use this kind of reactor .
This reactor can generate a large amount of energy and can undergo waste recycling .
We can see that the future reactor is much cheaper , safer and more environmental-friendly .
We should further develop nuclear power energy since the cons of nuclear energy can be minimized by developing it .
Some people feel that radioactive waste is the main problem of nuclear energy source because it causes cancer .
Although radioactive waste lasts for a few thousand  years  , fossil fuel will cause more serious damage to the earth because of emission of natural gas that leads to global warming .
Global warming affects the whole world but nuclear waste only affects a certain area .
If we maximize the effect of global warming , all  life forms on earth will become extinct eventually .
will finally disappear after a long period .
(Kowner and Rotem , 2002) .
From the example of Hiroshima , we can see how fast a city is able to rebuild itself after a nuclear warfare .
In addition , the probabilities of it happening again can be further reduced if we put more effort in research and develop the technology of nuclear energy .
Furthermore , nuclear waste is not a problem for future generation IV reactors like the Supercritical-water-cooled reactor because it recycles waste .
Many people think that we should not waste money on nuclear energy because the cost of handling or building a nuclear power plant is very high; we can use the money to contribute to research on finding alternative energy or  the development of alternative energy sources like solar and wind energy .
Energy demand each year is rapidly increasing  so I do not think alternative energy sources like solar and wind energy can meet that need .
Nuclear energy contributes to almost 15% of the world's electricity (Leipoldt , E , 2006) .
If we don't use nuclear energy , what are we going to use to replace  15% of the world's electricity ?
Since there is already a solution to meet the energy demands of  the future , why don't we just use it ?
In addition ,  future generation IV reactors like the Supercritical-water-cooled reactor can produce much more electrical energy than older generation reactors , so we should develop it .
Helium-3 produces much less waste and has a half-life that is 12 years only .
If we use helium-3 we don't really need to spend a lot of money in handling nuclear energy waste .
A lot of countries are racing to go to the Moon for helium-3 that is why they keep improving their space technology .
Lasker (2006) states that NASA is planning to go and harvest it in 2024  so they are developing high technology to achieve it .
We should improve our nuclear technology first while waiting for  nuclear sources from the moon .
Using nuclear energy can decrease the emission of natural gas , generate a large amount of energy to meet future needs  .
The disadvantages of nuclear power energy can be further reduced by research and development in nuclear technology .
In addition , we should prepare for helium-3 isotopes by developing better nuclear technology .
Since developing higher technology can reduce its disadvantages and increase its benefit , we should develop nuclear energy; hence we should support further research and development in nuclear energy .
The Britain's Road to 2010 strategy states that nuclear power , which generates low carbon electricity , is affordable , dependable and safe (Nuclear Power In The United Kingdom , 2009) .
Like Britain , many countries have considered nuclear power to be the best solution to foster electricity as well as the energy industry .
However , after two significant accidents , Three Mile Island and Chernobyl , most people are worried about the safety factor of nuclear reactor plans .
Therefore , Generation IV reactors are researched based on technological goals , especially nuclear safety .
Among these reactor designs , Supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR) is the most suitable concept for funding and development due to its usage of advanced material , safety and economical design and high security .
People who oppose nuclear power plants think that SCWR is not safe enough because it has potentially hazardous requirements .
The SCWR operates at high temperature (510-550 Celsius degree) and very high pressure .
As a result , it needs technological characteristics to prevent physical phenomena such as corrosion and stress (Butler , 2004 , p . 239) .
However , recent studies about materials show a lot of success in finding out a lot of materials that satisfy these requirements .
For example , INCOLOY alloy MA956 that "combines excellent strength fabric ability with outstanding resistance to prolonged exposure up to 1300 Celsius degree" (INCOLOY alloy MA956 , 2004 , para .
1) is one of the candidate materials .
Other promising material , 9Cr-1Mo-1V , can be used under corresponding maximum service temperature at 650 Celsius degree and has several characteristics for resistance to radiation .
Since the materials are subjected to rigorous safety standards , SCWR should be supported further through research and development funding .
One point in favour of SCWR is that scientists plan to manufacture it with simple and economical design .
Some people still doubt the safety of SCWR's design; in their opinion , a simple design may lack specifications that cause unexpected accidents .
On the contrary , the balance of SCWR plant design utilizes a relatively simple direct cycle power conversion system , which also allows for the incorporation of passive safety features .
Moreover , compared to the Light-water reactor (LWRs) , it provides a simplified , reduced volume system with higher thermal efficiency .
SCWR's efficiency is  about 45% while this one in advanced LWRs is 33% (Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) , 2007) .
Another advantage of SCWR that it is very cost-effective because it involves only one cycle .
In addition , because of similarities in primary system design between the SCWR and LWRs , it is expected that some of the current LWRs technology will be applied in this area .
So the overall simple design of the SCWR will also cut down  construction cost .
Finally , while it's true to say that reprocessing nuclear waste is still controversial , the general characteristics of the SCWR make it an attractive candidate for addressing Generation IV safety goals against terrorism .
The attack on September 11 in 2001 has provided a wake-up call to the threat of nuclear terrorism .
Freely circulating plutonium in the global market is really a huge threat to countries around the world , especially the US .
According to Li (2008) , the Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator in Cabot House , the United States Congress has decided to use 555 billion USD in the formation of an "international fuel nuclear bank" (p . 54) to prepare for  safe reprocessing .
Furthermore , improved technology used in the SCWR "allows plant operators to shut down the reaction completely at the slightest sign of trouble" (pp .
53-54) , said Li .
That means human intervention will be reduced to the minimum to prevent potential terrorist attacks on nuclear reactors .
On the other hand , in his research , Butler (2004) also reported that scientists of the SCWR would add more steps to lengthen the stored time of long-lived waste , especially plutonium , the "key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons" (p . 240) .
Taking everything into account , because of its achievement in research in advanced materials , effective design and security , the SCWR should be so highly appreciated to pursue the GEN-IV through continuous development and funding .
Jacopo (2002) argues that electricity generated by SCWR may cost 2 .9 cents per Kilowatt hour , much lower than the recent electricity rate .
So if successfully improved and deployed , the SCWR reactor would effectively generate low-cost electricity .
Our natural resources are rapidly consumed to supply energy for  society .
This exploitation of natural resources will result in a shortage of energy in the next few decades .
Therefore , the search for a quick and powerful new source of energy is urgent and vital .
One of the most promising technologies available today is nuclear energy .
Although the construction of new nuclear power plants is strictly restricted , a new concept for the next generation of nuclear power plants has been announced .
This concept , known as Very-High-Temperature-Reactor (VHTR) , is capable of improving our energy supply , clearing all doubts about the efficiency and safety of nuclear power .
Firstly , although the efficiency of nuclear power has been proven by older models , the new VHTR promises an even more effective production .
Despite criticism about its safety , over the past decades , while still undergoing many restrictions , a small number of nuclear plants alone located in North America and Europe has been providing 15% of global total power .
Some countries such as France rely solely on nuclear power for 80% of its nation's energy supply (Gerstner , 2009) .
This shows how powerful nuclear energy was in the past .
Today , with the upcoming VHTR technology , the amount of electricity produced will be increased by 50% (Butler , 2004) .
With the predicted US shortage of fuel by 2025 and VHTR's expected delivery by 2020 (Butler , 2004) , and if this new generation of reactors receives enough funding , it would be available at the right time to ease the lack-of-fuel crisis .
The second advantage of VHTR is that it does not only produce electricity but at the same time create hydrogen fuel as well (Butler , 2004) .
The concept of hydrogen fuel is not new and its efficiency is of course nothing to be doubted .
Being the lightest element of all , Hydrogen is capable of producing the highest ratio of energy-to-mass ratio (Schlapbach , 2009) .
The public may argue that the conversion from petroleum-fuelled to hydrogen-fuelled would be very complicated and costly .
However , the investment in hydrogen fuel will bring us more pros than cons .
The design for hydrogen vehicles is not similar to that of petroleum vehicles .
A car which runs on hydrogen does not need heavy materials and much space for its fuel tank .
Therefore , it would be much more lightweight than a petroleum car .
This allows a higher safety level for drivers and lower production cost (Schlapbach , 2009) .
Although the mass conversion to full hydrogen-fuelled vehicles might be costly , it will bring more advantages as a long-term strategy .
Finally , other than nuclear , there is still one source of energy that is believed to bring us an abundant amount of energy -- solar power .
Evironmentalists argue that solar power is not just unlimited but also safer .
However , our solar power technology is not that advanced yet .
No one can understand the current situation of global power supply better than oil-supplying countries themselves , and these global oil providers are  in the Gulf (Brumfiel , 2008) .
These oil-rich nations include Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates (UAE) , and Bahrain .
With a pessimistic view about the current global oil supply , these countries hope to quadruple their energy supply using nuclear plants .
Moreover , they are willing to pay up to $7 billion for each plant .
We can see how urgent these equatorial nations need nuclear power and not solar energy .
A vast area of solar panel can only provide energy for 6000 houses (Shukman , 2007) .
With a VHTR constructed on the same amount of area , the  amount of energy far outweighs that created by solar energy .
On the whole , the concept of VHTR can clearly benefit the society much more than any other sources of power .
The development of VHTR ensures us a safe and abundant source of energy for the next centuries , before solar power technology is becomes advanced to meet our energy demands .
Generation IV (Gen IV) reactors are theoretically nuclear reactor designs that are undergoing research and are to be completed in 2030 .
They are projects initiated by Generation IV International Forum (GIF) which aims to come up with nuclear reactors that are more desirable for human use .
However , government policies to promote nuclear energy are still met with resistance from the public .
This can be attributed to the fact that the public are not well informed about nuclear energy .
Many of them still see nuclear energy as it was decades ago , when it was expensive , low performing and deemed to lead to nuclear arms proliferation .
As such , we must find a reactor design that eliminates all these concerns of the public .
Out of all gen IV reactors , only the supercritical water cooled reactor (SWCR) can fulfill these requirements , thus it should receive funding for research .
One of public's concerns is the proliferation of nuclear arms .
A nuclear powered nation can also be a nuclear armed nation .
If nuclear arms fall into the hands of rouge states , regional security will be jeopardised .
An example will be North Korea , which threatens East Asia's stability .
Thus , opponents argue that we should stop investing in nuclear energy for security reasons .
However , they fail to realise that nuclear arms can be produced only with recycled nuclear wasted .
If the nuclear reactor runs on an open loop fuel system , nuclear waste will not be recycled .
The SWCR is able to operate on an open looped fuel system which does not recycle nuclear waste (Butler , 2004) .
If nuclear waste is managed well ,  waste from SWCR cannot be used for nuclear arms .
Thus , funding for SWCR should be increase .
Another drawback of nuclear energy is the cost factor .
The public perceive that nuclear energy is more expensive than conventional energy sources (Hughes , 1999) and thus oppose the use of nuclear power .
However , they do not consider the fact that fossil fuel is depleting quickly (How much Fossil fuel are left ?
When will fossil fuels run out ?
n .d ) .
Moreover , the cost of nuclear energy can be made lower through research and adopting nuclear energy in a large scale .
Although nuclear energy is expensive now , we should be far-sighted and consider the potential of nuclear energy becoming an affordable energy source in the future .
With high thermal efficiency , SWCR is able to produce electricity at a price comparable to fossil fuel reactors (Butler , 2004) .
Thus , by investing in SWCR , we are paying to secure an affordable energy source in the future .
For the sustainability of our modern lifestyle , funding for research on SWCR should increase .
Many people oppose developing nuclear energy because of the large amount of money required for its infrastructure (Wald , 2008) .
They argue that by allocating majority of available fund for nuclear power's development , funding for other potential energy sources like solar power is reduced .
Opponents of nuclear energy propose that we should look at energy sources that are cheap to start up instead of expending our available fund for nuclear energy .
Although their concerns about the diversion of funding are valid , they fail to realise that nuclear power has the greatest potential to meet our demands .
Unlike  green energy , which is unstable and cannot be produced on demand (Wald , 2008) , nuclear power is dependable at all time .
In addition , nuclear power is cheaper than alternative energy (Wald , 2008) .
Thus , it is logical that nuclear power receives the lion's share of funding as it is our best option .
An example will be SWCR that is efficient and cheap to run (Butler , 2004) , making it worthwhile to fund its research .
In conclusion , funding for SWCR's research should be increased as it is the best investment for energy .
In conclusion , the public reject nuclear energy for fear of nuclear arms proliferation , the perception that nuclear energy is expensive and the thinking that a nuclear reactor is costly to build .
However , the use of an open loop fuel system in SWCR can prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms .
With technological advancement , SWCR can reduce the cost of nuclear energy .
Moreover , nuclear energy has the greatest potential for fulfilling our demands .
As such , it is logical that we support  research on SWCR .
Some people may not agree , because they believe that some design problems of the nuclear planexplosioncould not be properly solved at the condition of technology at that time .
Besides , no matter how advanced and well-designed of the control system was , the machine was processed by man and it could never predict the human errors , which occurred by chace and were dependent on people's emotions at particular time .
First of allh the core of the reactor vertically instead of horizontally .
So the top have beenst position of thwithcore was not properly cooled in the process of nuclear reaction .
It was overheat of the reactn core that made the plant explode .
By iteration of analysis and systematic feedbacks the machine ,the mistake could have been detected early even before the machineore , the tragedy could not have happened .
Even with technology at that time , this simple mistake could definitely have been corrected , if the psychology of evaluation was applied in the design engineering stage .
Secondly , the control rods of the reaction section were not properly built .
Only the tips of the rods were covered with the regulated material .
On the contrast of slowing down the rate of the reaction , it sped up the separation of atoms , which caused such a serious explosion .
The psychology behind this is that he workers who built the rods had no idea of consequences of the grossly built rods .
However , if psychology was applied , there would have been better understanding between workers and the design engineers .
The workers , who were in charge of the building of engineering segments , would be aware of the uses of their product and more careful when making important parts of machines .
Then , the accident could have been avoided .
The information of designing and processing would be better channeled and translated to all the people related , if they input psychology into the process engineering stage .
Moreover , the main nuclear reactor in the plant had been constructed without any secure containment , which led to radial active containment freeIt005 report by the Chernobyl Forueight U .N . organizations , the nuclear plant was designed by Soviet experienced engineers (West , 2005) .
These engineers were very aware of the damaging results of the containment without secure protection .
Most of them had participated in the design of first generation nuclear reactor .
The Chernobyl was the second generation , but it merely had nothing diwould have beenfrom the first generation .
The psychology of the engineers was that they were not willing to accept the design flaws of the first generation , which was their several years' work .
They had have been motivation to correct their mistakes .
The bias bliconcernedeir eyes .
Iincorporatedis case , if a psychologist was employed , he would have seen the engineers' dilemma and used psychological approach to help them overcome their bias .
used arsIn addition , although human errors were also accounted for the nuclear explosion , they were not totally unpreventable .
Behind every mistake , there is a ingychology leading to the mistakeanother psychology which could have been used to correct it .
To sum up , if psychology was applied in the design engineerin the stage , feedback loops would function to minimize human errors in the process .
Psychology can reduce misunderstanding between designers and processors , helping information better channeled and decreasing the probability of misunderstanding problems .
Psychologists can see through the problems in a different aspect and contribute to the solution by an integrated approach (Wilpert , 2007 , P300) .
In conclusion , psychology approach could prevent engineering accident , regardless of different possible mistakes which may occur in the process .
People still worry about the radioactivit reactor sends out and they think the sodium cooled reactor is safer .
I agree with this idea that the safety issue should always be first concerned .
Sodium is very chemically active and it can react with the  (re material anAssociation , 2001) .
Thef the reactor will be less .
Moreover , the sodiwill get radioactive and wennot imagindesign the it will be when the coolant is exposed to the outside .
The VHTR hasgreat advantages of concerning the issue thatrity over other reactors like the sodium cooled fast reactor .
First of all , it uses helium as coolant .
Helium is an inert gas , it will not chemically react with any other materials .
Meanwhile , helium is radioactive when it is radiated , d .nThee other coolants .
Ev why based l helium comes out of the reactor , it still causes little effects on the environment .
We control the speed of the atoms to slow down the speed of the reaction .
If the system loses control , its core temperature will rise and finally it melts .
The possibility of a sodium cooled reactor to melt is about per reactor per year .
The one of a VHTR is aboutper reactor per year .
(Baidu ,2007) When the system finds something wrong , it will automatically stop working and cool down the temperature to a safe level .
) .about oneAoneSome people think the cost of the sodium cooled reactor is muchsoeaper .
Apparently , the cost of VHTR is really high .
But the ecoemic rent ofe reactos not only depend a concernbuild the plant , but also depends on the efficiency of the reactorests as it r , so we l bnefit .
The VHTR has an average heat efficiency obe like40% , and the one designed by ESKOM company in South Africa even has efficieiny of 47% .
(Baidu Baike ,2007) The heat efficiency of sodium cooled reactor is only 20% .
For example , one spends 1 billion dollargas; build a 200MW VHTR and one builds a 100MW sodium onethat costs 0 .5billion dollars .
The price of 1kw .h electricity i cents .
Then a 200MW VHTR will have an advantage of 1 billion dollars after 20 years run ovr the sodium cooled reactor .
Then , the overall benefit of the sodium reactor is too little compared to the Very High Temperature Reactor .
usAnother group of people think the sodium cooled reactor will cause lessandthe materials than the VHTRwhile It may be true that many materials cannot endure such high temperature .
However , the sodium cooled reactor needs high quality materials to prevent the corrosion of sodium , which is even harder .
Then they still need good materials to prohibit the radioactivity of the sodium when it flows out to heat the water .
Experts use graphite and pottery material to make the mai structure for VHT) . .
Both materials can stand more than 1000 degrees and have stable properties .
So the high temperature will not be a problem .
To sum up , comparing the Verks High Temperature Reactor with the Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor , the VHTR really does better in security and long-term performance .
Some technology problems proposed by the opposing views can be soon solved as the science develops very fast .
The Very High Temperature Reactor will definitely have a bright future and everyone can benefit from it .
The ability to experience something that we cannot naturally experience is indeed a blessed feeling .
With the advancement in technology , humans can now experience the joy of swimming long hours inside deep waters or even step on the far away moon .
Well , to have the opportunity for those is great; but unlike many of us with flawless senses , for those with impairments in senses , a blessed feeling would be to see a flower , smell its fragrance , hear a bird or sing along to a song .
Fortunately , those with the talent and education required to invent such things are using existing technologies and extending them to suit human purposes .
One such innovation is the Haptic chair .
The chair is named using the word "Haptic" which is a derivative of a Greek word to mean "touch" .
The haptic chair depends on tactile senses to deliver the musical experience to the receiver .
The basic idea is to allow the receiver to feel the musical beat , tone and volume as vibrations of different strengths and frequencies .
For  complete understanding of the invention , it is important that we learn its exact built  .
The haptic chair is a cushioned wooden chair with five contact speakers attached at the back of the chair .
The speakers are connected to a single music source which carries the music from the source to the receiver .
To make the experience livelier , the chair is accessorised with a screen which displays visuals that correspond to the music depending on the characteristics of the music .
The screen displays are of two types: one with a visual of an individual enjoying the music corresponding to the beat or a mosaic of lines and circles triggered by the music .
Speaking of the technology behind this innovation , it is one simple rule that applies .
It is the fact that sound travels through matter as vibration .
The hearing impaired cannot detect sound that travels through air but their skin , bone and muscle can detect sound vibrations that travel through solid matter such as wood and cotton .
Studies conducted to test the effectiveness of the chair show that the chair indeed has great potential .
The tests have been done on forty three participants including those who are fully deaf , partially deaf and those who lost their hearing later in their life .
Comparisons of results obtained from all different groups allow measuring the accuracy of the tests as well .
The developers of this chair have previously been involved in the study of "echolocation" of dolphinswhere dolphins locate themselves in sea and travels .
Even though a direct correlation is unseen here , it is the study of sound that inspired the thesis of this design .
With the promising results the studies have shown , it is safe to deduce that in the future we shall see a row of haptic chairs for the hearing impaired in concert halls .
This will provide them the opportunity to live a more normal life and enjoy the joys of life as any other citizen .
Still there are stepbacks in the technology .
Speaking in plain terms would be to admit that their music experience is not fully compatible with that of one with normal hearing where they hear the lyrics , etc .
Musical understanding would be limited to beat , tone and volume alone .
Since it is a new technology ,  many refinements  could still be made .
The chair could be upgraded from time to time , involving technicians from other disciplines and not just engineers .
Currently the chair is not in mass production .
This means the chair would come with a heavy price tag .
Given that it is also equipped with many speakers , heavy cushion  , and accessories , the chair uses much space and has quite limited mobility .
This makes the usage very inconvenient and could discourage the use .
This indirectly could lead to the suspension of the development and upgrading of the technology which finally could terminate its usage .
Since there are foundations for the benefit of the hearing impaired , one step that could be taken is to unite these institutes and the developers of this technology together to  ensure that research continues .
This innovation is for the better living of the hearing impaired and with the help of those currently involved , the developers could create an advanced version in the near future .
Innovations are for the betterment of the living conditions of humans , especially and convenience in their life .
This technology can be extended to animals such as dolphins which are facing threats of extinction .
becausebeing ps ,As far as I am concerned , it is not the truth .
Here we just use the supercritical-water-cooled reactoIto illustrate for the reason that in all the generation IV reactors it a ls the only one which tednly use water as its coolant anjust recentlytionally recyclable .
Besides , it do not need very high temperature and  produce lare amount of electricity , the only obvious weak point may be the high psure neefuelIt seems to betsthe best one in the six reactors in my mind .
People are firstly concerned about the safe operation owillclear reactors .
They think it is very possible to have somethe nuamongear plants .
Even a quite small mistake may lead to a great disaseser to the people around .
For example , one of the reactors in Chemobyl plant ,doeskrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , once explodea largeat was worse , further  .
Thesions and the resulting fire sent a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the aamongere and cover an extensive geographical area which in fact became a nightmare for the local people .
This of course makes people scared .
However , the truth is that in more than 12700 cumulative reactor-years of commercial operation in 32 countries , there are only two major accidents happened including the one we have mentioned above .
There is actually no need to be that worried .
To achieve nuclear safety furthermore , we also need to develop high-quality design& construction and invent equipment to prevent operational disturbances developing into problems .
Redundant and diverse systems are also needed to detect problems , control damage to the fuel and prevent significant radioactive releases .
Provisions are needed to confine the effects of severe fuel damage to the plant itself .
design &veryOf course , some people may say that high risk of nuclear reactors may make them becomethatraccidents are possible coonated suicide attacks happening on September 11 , 2001 .
It is such a disaster that leads to over 6000 deaths even though it has nothingrnto do with nuclear .
Imagine if the attack happened in a nuclear plant , what will the consequence be ?
In fact , we do not need to be that scared because of this point .
Tests have shown concrete sredructures used in reactor domes can withstand battering .
Besides , governments have emphasized the importance of hardening nuclear power reactor .
Most countries have cooperation in defence against nuclear terrorism .
Therefore , it is not that ehave been for the terrorists to attnuclear reactors .
veryWhen it comes to the cost , manythat theple may think building the nuclear reactors is quite an expensive process .
However , the conclusion is exactly reversed .
Nuclear power is quite an economical cwasice for countries with ldted natural resources .
For example , nedrly 80 percent of the enerr powery used in France is generated from nuclear plants .
Althougwould have beene building cost m be high , the whole cost also inveryes waste disposal cost and decommissioning cosn that .
While in fact , a successfully operated nuclear plant is much more environmentally friendly than coal or gas power stations , which means a relatively lorser waste disposal cost .
MoreoverJust as what I have mentioned above , nuclear reactors haves own advantages on both cost and performance .
Also , what people worry about , like security , is actually not that bad .
Therefore , further research and development funding for nuclear reactors is necessary for our society since it is a good way to solve the energy offering problem .
As the world's energy demand is on the rise , the world has to look into alternatives to solve this issue .
At the same time , the alternatives have to be cleaner so that the current global warming situation will not be aggravated (Butler , 2004) .
They also have to be cheap and safe , which is beneficial for the users (Buongiorno , 2002) .
To address this situation , a variety of Generation IV nuclear reactors is developed .
One of the nuclear reactors , the Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor (SCWR) , has been proven to be one of the excellent methods to generate cheap and safe power for consumption .
Although there are criticisms cited about its flaws , it is still a reactor which is worth to be developed (Idaho National Library , 2009) .
Firstly , the SCWR design concept is one that requires lower cost for development .
Among the Generation IV nuclear reactors , the SCWR has the lowest development cost which is based on  economic , safety and sustainability factors (Cogeneration Technologies , 2003) .
Comparing with other forms of Generation IV reactors , the SCWR does not require high development cost as it uses existing technologies such as Light Water Reactors (LWRs) and supercritical fossil-fired boilers .
The coolant used , which is water , is considered the cheapest source of coolant in comparison with others used in the Generation IV reactors .
Although  critics highlighted that further research and development is required for  systems components (such as vessel and pressure tubes) , which in turn demands  more funds , on the contrary , this could support SCWR systems in yielding better efficiency (Buongiorno , 2002) .
Secondly , the SCWR systems are able to produce great performance with its unique characteristics .
It is able to produce high thermal efficiency of about 45% versus about 33% efficiency for current LWRs , which translates to greater energy output (Danielyan , 2003) .
This is due to its ability to operate at higher pressure and temperature (at 550 degree Celsius) in a single phase operation , unlike the current LWRs that need recirculation of heat and components like jet pumps and steam generators .
Critics of SCWR think otherwise .
The other Generation IV reactors , such as Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) ,  also produce high thermal efficiency at about 50% and at a high temperature of 1000 degree Celsius (Butler , 2009) .
With such performance , the VHTR can also have high energy output when compared with SCWR .
However , the high temperature produced may cause a reactor meltdown (Butler , 2004) .
Hence ,  SCWR should be used instead of other Generation IV reactors .
Lastly , research and development (R&D) is crucially needed as this is the most important aspect needed as part of the implementation of any Generation IV reactor (Butler 2004) .
For example , VHTR requires research to be done on the reactors (specifically pebble bed type core and prismatic block core) , power conversion unit , and its production of hydrogen (supply for future energy source) .
These are very complex research undertakings could take a long period of time and requires collaboration with partners across the world (Carre , 2006) .
In contrast , the SCWRs require the least amount of R&D for its implementation .
The area of research is on the materials that could withstand high temperature , stress corrosion cracking , radiation and creep resistance .
Although Dr Buongiorno highlighted that this "was not easy" to be done , he and his research team collaborated with researchers from University of Michigan , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Westinghouse to do  research by testing new materials under the supercritical condition (Buongiorno , 2003) .
In conclusion , there should be funding allocated for the Research and Development of SCWR .
This is a much promising system  for its potential for low development cost , better performance and least research and development processes .
Although there are odds in proving the system's efficiency , it is  a great investment for a better future (Idaho National Library , 2009) .
Assessing Gas-cooled Fast Reactors for Generation IV Services To meet the energy demands of the 21st century , a new generation of nuclear reactors termed as Generation IV , is being developed .
One of the most popular concepts of the Generation IV is gas-cooled fast reactors (GFR) , which use a direct-cycle helium turbine for electricity generation or hydrogen production with a high efficiency  (Hejzar , Pope , Williams , & Driscoll , 2005) .
However , there are concerns about the impact of its radioactive waste on the environment and its safety in operation  (Butler , 2004) .
Although GFR has certain deficiencies at this stage , further R&D funding should be supported because it has three main advantages in terms of sustainability , safety and industrial applications .
Opponents of GFR point out that it is inevitable for nuclear reactors to produce radioactive waste which has destructive effects , and due to the high cost of pollutant management , it seems impossible to install nuclear reactors without any radioactive emissions .
However , a research conducted by the MIT GFR development team  (Hejzar , Pope , Williams , & Driscoll , 2005) , shows that it is possible to develop a closed fuel cycle with full transuranics (TRU) recycling so that all TRUs will be recycled with losses of 0 .1% or less .
The long-term waste will be substantially reduced in the core with a conversion ratio to be close to 1 .0  (Girardin , et al . , 2008) .
Consequently , GFR has a significant improvement on radioactive waste minimization over the previous generations .
Hence , the GFR system is highly-ranked in sustainability among all the nuclear reactors and this makes it a favorable energy supply in the future .
There are also worries about the accidents caused during processes of coolant depressurization and decay heat removal because GFR has to be operated in an environment of both high pressure and temperature .
Fortunately , under Generation IV International Forum , a number of research deals  with this safety problem using "passive decay heat removal options"  (Girardin , et al . , 2008) .
In the design of the GFR system , combined systems of both active cooling and passive cooling are applied: active systems are used to remove the decays of heat at high power level , then passive systems will take over after 24 hours when decay heat is reduced to 0 .5% .The active part defends the system in the first place and the passive part only  with the pressure achieved after depressurization .
In this way , less human labor is involved in the operation of GFR and thus accident risks are minimized .
Some also claim that GFR can hardly change the energy supply scenario in the globe because  nuclear energy today is mainly utilized to generate electricity , which only accounts for 16% of the total energy consumption  (Herranz , Linares , & Moratilla , 2009) .
However , except for electricity generation , the future GFR is predicted to achieve an excellent thermal performance based on a direct Brayton cycle configuration .
Herranz , Linares , & Moratilla (2009) predict that GFR can use a few hundred MWs to produce heat at a very high temperature .This will satisfy most heat applications of industrial processes .
Besides , some scientists suggest that the thermal efficiency of GFR can probably be increased from the present level 30% to higher than 50% with no additional economic penalty  (Herranz , Linares , & Moratilla , 2009) .
Hence , this will reinforce the competitiveness of GFR in the energy market of most industries .
To summarize , GRF can be a favorable energy supply because it can achieve a wider range of industry applications with minimized radioactive waste .
Moreover , it better ensures  safety during operation so that accident risk is lowered .
Hence , to make such energy supply possible in the future , the development of the GFR system should be funded .
Nuclear power is widely used around the world today .
There are more than 400 nuclear power plants operating in 30 countries , which supply almost 17 percent of the world's electricity .
Scientists debate whether using a large amount of nuclear power as an energy resource might bring human benefits .
Although some scientists argue that nuclear power has negative effects on the the environment (it is not safe or secure) , there is evidence which shows nuclear power yields great benefits such as protecting environmentand is safer than using traditional power .
In addition , the appearance of nuclear weapons cannot be avoided when nuclear power is developed .
Opponents of the use of nuclear power claim that it has negative impact on the environment because of some accidents which had happened before .
However , it is inconclusive .
Despite the fact that  nuclear power plant accidents really result in environmental contamination , it is still relatively not very bad contrasted  with the pollution  produced by traditional power generation .
Nuclear power plants produce electricity by using Uranium , but not burning of fuel .
As a result , no air pollutants are released such as nitrogen oxides , sulfur oxides , dust or greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide .
A research report from University of Michigan (Ilan Lipper&Jon Stone , 2009) shows that USA's nuclear power plants reduce electric generating emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percent , or 128 trillion tons per year .
Without nuclear power plants , electric generating emissions of NOX would be 2 million tons per year higher and sulfur dioxide would be 5 million tons per year higher .
Also in France , SO2 and NOX emissions produced in the electric generating were reduced by 71% and 60% respectively .
In addition , nuclear power alleviates  global carbon dioxide production which is one of the major contributors to  global warming .
If 16 percent of the world's electricity generated by nuclear power plants is replaced by generating using coal , 1 ,600 million tons of CO2 will be annually produced .
Using nuclear power to generate electricity really helps to protect environment .
Opponents also maintain that nuclear power is not safe .
They say that the accidents caused by nuclear power plants caused huge harm to humans .
However , such an argument completely ignores the fact that only two accidents happened in the half century of the nuclear age and only a small number of people died due to the accidents .
At Three Mile Island (World Nuclear Association , 2009) , no people died and no one was injured .
At Chernobyl (World Nuclear Association , 2009) , about 50 people died , and 1 ,500 people suffered from diseases due to radioactive emission .
However , diseases could be treated successfully so less than ten people died .
Compared with people who died in coal mining disasters , this number is very small .
According to the State Work Safe Supervision Administration (2009) , 4 ,749 Chinese coal miners were killed in 2006 .
The total number of people who died during the coal mining accidents is obviously far more than this number .
The final argument advanced by opponents of the use of nuclear power is that nuclear power can be used to create mass destruction nuclear weapons .
However , it is true that whenever a new technology is developed , it is always used for war .
For example , powder was created in the 9th century .
At the beginning , it was only applied in acrobatics and later it was used as the energy source for shooting weapons .
In addition , in the project Apollo 13 , a huge number of new technologies is developed and applied to  spacecraft .
Later Americans used these new technologies to create new powerful missiles .
Hence , the appearance of nuclear weapons cannot be avoided when nuclear power was developed .
In conclusion , it should be evident that the arguments against using nuclear power are not valid .
In contrast , nuclear power can replace traditional energy resources very well .
Moreover , it can help to protect the environment and is much safer than using traditional energy resources .
Hence , in my opinion , using a large amount of nuclear power as an energy resource can bring about human benefits .
rsHowever , the opponents suggest that recycling nucleathe need foraste is not an effective method .
"Fuel recycling may look exciting on paper; in practice , it is partof the problem , not the solutreactors (sixrgues .
Reprocessing the nuclear waste endures great economic and political cost .
First of all , the recovered plutonium and uranium are too active and unstable to be stored safely , and this storage costs a lot .
The Energy Department of US recently released an industry estimate that a reprocessing plant with an annual capacity of 2 ,000 metric tons of spent fuel would ost up to $20 billion to build while the cost premium for reprocessing spent an extra $3 to $4 .5 billion per year .
Secondly , the action endangers global security , which includes deterring terrorism and nuclear weapon proliferation .

T" , safe targueironment , we need nuclear energy requiresy , excludes nuclear reprocessing .
Therefore , among six of the new concepts , only VHTR and SCWR fit the condition .
The main difference between VHTR and SCWR is that the former generates hydrogen as a by-product .
Hydrogen is a carbon-f" , says non-toxic fuel that could probably replace oil , especially for tvensport applications .
However , the advanced generatiexcluding nuclearon of hygrogen have not yet been the sixeloped .
Due to current technology , hydrogen produced by nuclear reactors is not enough to completely replace gasoline for transport demands , the opponents argues .
They also raise concerns about the corresponding infrastructure such as "hydrogen-fuelled cars" and "hydrogen-stations" which have not yet been widely implemented .
"To complete a worldwide , fundamental energy overhaul , we need to exploit the vast , unfulfilled opportunities for fuel efficiency in electric motors , light bulbs , appliances and home heating and cooling .
"words from Jeffery .D .Sachs , director of the Earh Institute at Columbia Universtiy , implies that gasoline is replaced not only by hydrogen , but also electricity , biofuels , solar energy .
The more hydrogen put into use , the better the situation could be .
Bargue , the hydrogen technology is deveing rapidly .
"Hydrogen-poweresd buses in Germany and Japan have already been successful , and about 50 prototype cars both thermal-combustion and fuel-cell types have so far been tested , with good results .
"says Louis Schlapbach , a scientist from the National Institute for Materials Science of Japan .
Hence , the generation of hydrogen is an advantage of VHTR .
" , saysis putand solar .
This implies" , argueIn conclusion , the Very-high-temperature reactors is the most practical and efficient one among the six concepts .
Because it does not include waste recycling and produces both electricity and hydrogen .
becauseREFERENCE LIST:
Opponents hold another opposite ideas that building VTHR is not safe .
They set the Chernotsyl nuclear accident as an example show how darevenuesis to build such plants .
But I think by now theyworth itp being concerned .
First , VHTR use helium as coolantthink it ism is an inert gas , sm it does not chemically react with other materials .
Additionally , in "Thermal Performance and Flow Insto "Aities"(n .d .)Roadmap" (2002) ,t exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioac (ive , unlike most oC)her possile coolants .
Second , there are also some new safety designs to secure the plants .
For instance , Reactor and gas turbine system is separated from hydrogen production plant in order to isolate the hydrogen plant from reactor system during the abnormal events of hydrogen production plant .
Furthermore , also from" A Technology Roadmap "(2002) , the ongoing 30-MWth HTTR project in Japan is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of reaching outlet temperatures up to 950 C coupled to a heat utilization process .
Plenty of safety designs are put into practice to secure the plants .
So there is no need to be concerned about the safety of VHTR .
from "ASome peoplalso arguevironmental at aiendly .
They consider thgiveplants can pollute the environment and waste cannot be dealt with well .
However , they do not realize building VTHR is mainly for solving environmental problem .
esf we utilize traditional resource , such as coal , gas and petrol , there will be much more emission of carbon dioxide .
The problem of global warming will be mor" (n .erious .
On the other hand , VHTR discharge no carbon dioxide and its product of hydrogen is the cleanest fuel ever found .
Also , Shropshire and Herring(2004) said that the waste of VHTR will be reprocessthe rd according to the form and will meet the acceptthe hydrogenteria of the repos is muchre environmental friendly .
Dealing with the current increasing demand for energy and the threat of global warming  , the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) came up with six generation IV nuclear reactors which are believed to be able to help address the problems by 2025 (Butler , 2004) .
Based on studies (Elder & Allen , 2009) , these nuclear reactors are capable of replacing gasoline with hydrogen in the long run with its enhanced efficiencies .
However , the public professes strong opposition against the building of nuclear reactors .
Nevertheless , there is strong evidence that the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) , one of the six generation IV nuclear reactors , could bring positive results through funding further its research and development .
According to Butler (2004) , further funding for  the research and development of VHTR would mean that there will be increasing demand to build a lot more nuclear power plants with the hope of replacing  gasoline with hydrogen .
This would result in an especially high cost for the government to bear .
Yet , the opposing argument ignores the fact that building more nuclear power plants will need time and good management to achieve full results in the long run (Greenwald , 1991) .
Supporters argue that with  nuclear power plants being built , it will contribute to countries by the use of hydrogen being produced for other important uss such as  direct fuel or as feedstock (Farbman & Brecher , 1975) .
In addition ,  nuclear power plants offer life-cycle cost advantage over other energy resources (Perera , 2004) .
It is believed that countries will profit with the effort and large investments being made to build the  plants .
Next , Butler (2004) states that incidents such as the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island which  occurred years ago , highly traumatized the public , thus casting doubts on the performance of the new generation IV nuclear reactors being proposed by the GIF .
According to Butler (2004) , it has been found  that VHTR has the abilities to convert  heat and generate 1 .5 times of  electricity compared to   generation nuclear power plants being used currently . 
Then , another opposing argument being raised states that building  nuclear power plants will make countries more vulnerable to terrorist attacks as plutonium is a key ingredient to nuclear weapons (Butler , 2004) .
Also , destruction of nuclear plant will emit radioactive substances which will be detrimental to the whole world (Elder & Allen , 2009) .
However , research studies (Butler , 2004) show that VHTR does not undergo waste recycling ; the waste being produced will go directly to a repository leading to less possibility of obtaining  plutonium ingredients to make nuclear weapons  , thus , increased the security of countries .
The new generation nuclear reactors prove to be more effective in terms of cost , performance and  security .
Supporters and experts believe that  nuclear hydrogen production by VHTR has the potential to meet the nuclear energy needs of the future .
Hence ,  VHTR , one of the generation IV reactor concepts , should be supported for further research and development funding .
Nuclear-related issues have always been one of the most important issues  .
The word "nuclear" has always confused the minds of people for years .
As early as after World War II  ended , 
According to a report "World population may reach 9 .2 billion by 2050" from the Associated Press , the world's population is expected to expand from 6 .2 billion to 9 .2 million  by the end of 2050 which will lead to an increase in the demand for energy .
But the current nuclear industry can only maintain its current position of generating 17% of the world's electricity .
Therefore , groups of international experts were organized to take up research  to develop  new conceptsfor nuclear reactors .
Thus , by comparing the Generation IV reactor concept with the previous generations , we can discover significant advantages .
They are manageable nuclear waste , better safety performance and secure nuclear energy .
Among the concepts , the most beneficial reactor seems to be the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) compared to the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and other 4 .
According to the Roadmap for Generation IV from an e-book , VHTR is equipped with a Back-Up emergency core cooling system .
MSR , on the other hand , is proved to be much safer compared to VHTR .
In the process of reacting , no high pressure steam is required within the core which means that there will not  .
In addition , MSR uses the Passive emergency core cooling systems .
In the event of overheating , instead of using additional coolant ,  fuel salt will be forced to overflow and the overflow will be safely stored in a tank with the cooling system .
Because VHTR operates at a very high temperature which is near  1000oC , it is proven to have the ability to convert the heat energy to electricity efficiently .
In addition  , it is able to produce hydrogen gas which is useful because of hydrogen's role in emission-free hydrogen fuel cells that can be used in transportation .
But because of the high operating temperature , it means that the materials being used must have the ability to withstand extremely high temperature in order to sustain the process and therefore additional cost is needed to research and purchase these materials .
MSR uses a multi-reheat helium Brayton cycle which is a simplified balance of plants with lower cost and improved efficiency .
Because of the low cost ,  The improved efficiency is able to reduce fuel waste and emission thus reducing the cost by 50% .
Studies have shown that the VHTR is able to produce up to 600MWt which is about 27 times larger compared to MSR with 22MWt .
The overall plant efficiency of the VHTR is also greater than that of an MSR .
The attractive feature of this MSR fuel cycle is that the fission products have shorter-lived radioactivity .
Generally , modern small reactors for power generation are expected to have greater simplicity of design , economy of mass production , and reduced sitting costs .
These requirements greatly fit the bill for the MSR .
Therefore , I conclude that MSR has a better chance over the other reactors .
The consumption of electricity in the world is increasing continually .
In the long run , there will be a shortage of non-renewable sources of energy  .
This raises a need to apply new technology to create power , and building new nuclear reactors such as the very-high-temperature reactors would be a choice to consider .
However , the safety and the efficiency of the new generation power plants raise many opposing public concerns .
Should countries , especially developing ones , sacrifice the funding that would possibly solve poverty and unemployment in order to build new nuclear reactors ?
The answer , to me , is no .
Supporters of  new nuclear power plants claim that building new plants will provide unemployed people with job opportunities , both in the construction phase and operation phase .
According to DePillis (2009) , constructing a power plant would require 2 ,000 people while operating it would involve approximately 500 technicians , reactor operators , engineers , security guards , and administrators .
However , building new power plants only provides workers with temporary work .
Moreover , the new generation reactors require skilled engineers to operate .
For instance , the unemployment rate of China in 2009 is 4% , which is equal to more than 52 million people (Central Intelligence Agency , 2009) .
Substantiably , new power plants cannot thoroughly solve unemployment .
If  governments spend the funds on building nuclear power reactors , which , according to The U .S . Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy (2009) , is approximately US$70 .0 million in Fiscal Year 2009 , to do research on agriculture or some other necessary matters , they could help decreasing famine and poverty and provide work for millions of people .
Another claim of the supporters is that the new generation would reduce the green house effect , which is worsened by the smoke of the traditional coal-fired power plants .
Although it has been substantiated that smoke released from burning coal is the largest contributor to  human-made increase of CO2 in the air , there are still several unpolluted and renewable replacements such as solar , wind , and tidal energy .
They are free and environmental-friendly sources of energy that we can use in the future .
In addition , new nuclear power plants still threaten possible leakage of hazardous waste , which could result in a catastrophic accident whose effect could last for decades .
One typical example is the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine in 1986 , which resulted from a flawed reactor design .
Within 4 months , 28 people died from radiation or thermal burns; another 19 had subsequently died , and there had been around 9 deaths from thyroid cancer apparently due to the accident .
As of 2004 , a total of 56 fatalities had been recorded (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
In a journal in 2004 , Butler showed that the radioactive waste of  very-high-temperature reactors is not recycled; instead , it goes directly to the repository .
This raises  awareness of the possibility that  waste may be leaked either inadvertently or purposefully and may cause another disastrous catastrophe .
Nuclear energy is a promising source of energy that can replace the traditional power that we use nowadays .
However , it is still in the researching process , which means that many other problems concerning health matters and the efficiency of the concept could arise before it can reach the final stage .
Hence , developing countries should first focus on dealing with poverty and unemployment before they can use funds to build new nuclear reactors .
Only when the issue is solved and the process of researching  generation IV reactors reaches a stable state should these countries channel  funding into developing  generation IV reactors .
Engineering psychology is defined as the analysis of how man behaves in the designing or constructing of equipment or man-made environments for better usage  .
On March 27 , 1977 , at the Los Rodeos airport , a massive shockwave shook the control towers as the airport witnessed the collision of 2 Boeing 747s , PA1736 and KLM4805 , taking the lives of 522 people .
Some argue that the cause of this accident was mainly the result of human errors , thus it would be inevitable even with the best procedures and equipment in place .
However , in my opinion , the implementation of psychology could have helped to anticipate some events that led to the accident , therefore allowing designers to prepare for such emergencies .
This might have changed the course of action of the pilots and thereby preventing the accident .
Two major areas that psychology could have helped include the design of the airport and the communication equipment and procedures .
Skeptics claim that the region usually sees few people and thus there is no need for a larger airport that can accommodate larger planes to be built .
On the contrary , the construction of the Tenerife south airport in 1978 suggests that more people , rather than less , were visiting the region .
Still , designers failed to improve the airport to accommodate larger planes such as the Boeing 747 , even when it was widely used at that point in time .
The use of psychology in this case could have helped designers to anticipate that the airport would eventually see a Boeing 747 and thus make the necessary preparations .
One step that could have been taken would be to remove sharp 148-degree turns that the PA1736 , a 747 , would not be able to take .
This might have allowed the PA1736 to make an earlier exit rather than stay on the runway and hence prevent the accident from ever occurring .
Skeptics also suggest that one main cause of the accident was the Air Traffic Controller's (ATC) choice to use non-standard words in communicating with the pilots despite the fact that radio conventions were already in place at that time .
It is undeniably true that although psychology can help to produce the best procedures , the accident would have still happened if the ATC chose not to abide by it .
However , the convention that was used at that time could have been improved to avoid confusion amongst the pilots .
One way to do so would have been by the implementation of psychology in the compilation of  radio convention .
During the accident , the words 'take off' resulted in a serious misunderstanding between the pilot and the co-pilot of the KLM4805 .
The pilot mistook the phrase 'take off' as a clearance rather than a request between the co-pilot and the ATC .
Moreover , aviation governing bodies such as the International Civil Aviations Organization [ICAO] were quick to revise their phrasing convention , replacing all traces of 'take off' before the actual take off itself to 'departure' .
Should proper psychology have been used in the development of the phrasing convention initially , the pilot would not have executed take off before the clearance was given and hence preventing the accident .
will produceonAfter the Three Mile Island Explosion people had a bad impact in producthe fusionf nuclear energy since they have been suffered from the accident .
However in recent century according to the survey done by Nuclear Energy Institute on September 29 , 2008 it showformsrcent of American is suthe extremelyor nuclear energy while 24 percent opposed .
thisothe atomicuclear energy has been the second largest source of electricity in America's after coal .
In addition it did not produce carbon dioxide which can lead to global warming .
Then there are still technical problem in inventing the next generation of reactor .

had more holistically been consideredOne of the most heated objections is that the cause of error actually lies in the technical malfunctioning of the relief valve , not out of the lack of safety considerations (U .S .NRC) .
The valve was designed to close automatically , but remained open for various reasons which we still do not know .
Proponents of the man-machine view believe that it was ultimately a freak error , and not a psychological error , that resulted in the inability to close the valve a ,d prevent overheating .
However , such claims tend to be speculative and over focused .
Yes , it's true that initially it was due to the malfunction of the instrument , but it had been asserted that even so , the accident could still be prevented at that point in time .
Rather , "It was the subsequent series of baffling and contradictory informati ,n that made plant operators shut off the emergence water system that would have cooled the core (Chana Gazit 1999) , turning the problem into a mishap .
The meltdown was not caused by a single event , but rather by a series of wrong decisions and actions .
Should the operators have a better schema on emergency response , or if the information output by the reactor was designed to be more conclusive , then such confusion would not arise , and the meltdown would have been prevented .
Opponents may also maintain that the reason why the use of psychology could not have changed the situation is because of its subjective and inconclusive nature .
They assert that the use of psychology is no more than a whimsical 'what if' speculation after witnessing a real-life situation goes wrong .
Indeed , there is always room for criticism of 'why didn't you think of a better mousetrap' after a particular design failure .
Similarly , we could retrospect the accident at TMI to see that there is always room for improvement , and then conveniently tag one of Bernhard's safety design process to claim that the meltdown could have been prevented with a little extra attention in psychology during the design process .
However , due overwhelming possibilities for error , such introspection for potential sources of error is almost practically impossible during the design process .
This premise lecore"to their conclusion that nothing could have been done , on the part of psychology , to change the situation should things went wrong .
To this , we must look at the nature of psychology .
Indeed , psychology has its roots from speculations , primarily owing to its roots in the philosophy of mind .
Structuralism , the first movement of psychology , banks its primary research tool on introspection , literally 'looking within' (Kosslyn/ Rosenberg 2006) .
However it has since evolved as an empirical science to include realistic models and hypotheses .
Such models were set to ensure that there is no chance for an accident to occur , and if it did , be quickly resolved before it becomes a catastrophe .
Psychologist James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model was adopted by the US department of defense to conclusively pin-point the four possible stages of error during the designidue to planning and execution phases (Department of Defence 2005 , qtd by Illinois 2008) .
Many multinational corporations have also employed psychologists to scientifically monitor the psychological states of their employees .
For a fact that such models were not considered during the design progo at TMI , instead shows the lack of preparatory work from commitment (Bernhard 2007) , one of Bernhard's major areas of psychological consideration .
Now , one of the ways the use of psychology could have possibly prevented the accident at TMI would be if it had identified safer options during the design process (Bernhard 2007) .
This included the consistent functional review of instruments and constant search question identifications (Bernhard 2007) .
Indeed , we have to admit that there were existing safety considerations in place , since there were instruments to allareeedback of reactor status to the operators .
But we can claim that such psycdoesogical considerations for occupational safety were not holistic enough- since there was evidently nothing to indicate the valve's actual position .
Such a fact can be succinctly summarized as a failure in consideration of identifying safer options during design .
Should greater consideration be place on the designing of the valve to ensure accurate feedback (and potential safety) when the reactor core is not functioning as per normal , it can beThe factat the problem would have been identified by then , and a meltdown wTMIe occurred then .
Moreover , it was evident that there was inadequate monitoring and evaluating of Implementations at TMIl failure to identify the status of the valve , subsequent reactions by the operators were what one could be described as 'firefighting' .
According to the account provided by the World Nuclear association , the operators reduced the flow of replacement water because their training told them that the water level as the only indication of the amount of cooling water in the reactor .
Then , when the pressure kept increasing , their training made them assume that the reactor was too full of water , instead of the actual truth that it was lacking in water (World Nuclear Association , 2001) .
This leads rise to the psychological concept of Schemas or a human's collecplacedof information and practiced evocation of knowledge , behavior or required action . . . (Illinois 2008) .
In this case , the designed Schema that compliments the design of the reactor itself , imparted by the designers (engineers) to the operators , was insufficient and not properly planned for mishap .
Failure in safety design is not restricted only in terms of instruments , but also in the design of accompanying operating instructions .
Such monitoring and evaluation of implementations were fundamentally lacking .
Implementations in this context , would be the contingency plan should the reactor go awry .
giveswasFrom the above arguments , we can see that the considerations of psychology are mimplementations convenient 'tag-along' during both the design and execution process .
In summary , it was the failure to identify safer options during the design process , to monitor and evaluate these implementations , and the lack of preparatory work from commitment , as seen from the failure to consider safety models , that had brought about the accident at TMI .
Systems are designed by humans , and for humans .
Hence , design considerations have to be constantly tied into the man-machine interface to ensure tthe executionman and machine are at ease during operation and contingent when problems arise .
Such a list is not exhaustive , and much more detailed considerations could be introduced .
But in the meantime , we have definitely proven that the use of psychology is mandatory , and could definitely have prevented the TMI accident , had relevant safety considerations be made during its design process .
The most obvious controversy over the Supercritical-Wa-cooled Reactor is about the materials .
Opponents claim that the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is supposed to operate at superior thermodynamic condition , which refers to the operating pressure as high as 25MPa and the maximum temperature of more than 500  C . Compared with current Light-Water-cooled Reactors , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor raises the operating temperature in outlet coolant from 300  C to 500  C . Furthermore , the supercritical water environment may also cause some compatibility issues in practice .
The materials used in this reactor must be capable to withstand various supercritical water conditions that range from the low temperature inlet at 280  C to the outlet at above 500  C , and from a compressed liquid to a fluid nearly an order of magnitude less dense than ordinary water as the supercritical water traverses the core from bottom to top .
Besides theconceptnge , in extreme conditions , the operating temperature can reach 840  C (Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) .
Opponents of the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor claim that the existing materials are not qualified for the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor and the advanced materials under current research are not economic enough .
According to Alain Bugat , who heads France's Atomic Energy Commission , there is a considerable gap in the fundamental research .
"This is a long-term research; if we have a working demo of some of the designs by 2030 we will be doing well ."
said Alain Bugat (Butler , 2004) .
However , the research on advanced materials is promising .
Japan's Atomic Energy Research Institute based in Kashiwa already managed to operate a similar high-temperature engineering test reactor at Oarai .
The reactor is reported to have reached the maximum operating temperature of 950 C for the first time in research (Butler , 2004) .
On the hand , the cost-effectiveness is inconclusive .
Climate 2030: A National Blueprint for a Clean Energy Economy , the recent UCS report has pointed out that nuclear plants are not the most economical approach to realize our ambitious targets for cutting global warming emission through 2030 ("Nuclear Power: a"  , n .d .) .
Nevertheless , it also shows that it remains difficult to predict the cost-effectiveness of using nuclear power as electricity supply to homes and businesses after 2030 when no projections are made on technology advances past that point .
Therefore , we can still expect the cost to fall during further research and development in finding the material qualified for the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor .
HoweverOpponents also maintain that building nuclear plants is likely to induce cost overruns .
They say that there are several records of cost overruns of building nuclear plants and the high construction costs have been and will continue to be the "economic Achilles' heel of the nuclear plants" .
For instance , in the article Nuclear Power: a Resurgence We can't Afford (2009) , the scientists from the Union of Concerned Scientists stated that utilities' cost overruns of building nuclear power plants during the 1970s and 1980s averaged more than 200 percent .
In October 2008 , the cost of building one nuclear plant is estimated to be roughly S$ 9 billion .
In 2009 , the cost overruns of Olkiluoto plant in Finland have reportedly topped 50 percent (Kanter 2009) .
However , opponents of the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor have neglected the fact that this new nuclear plant is not completely the same as any nuclear plants that have ever been constructed .
According the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Ten-year Program Plan prepared by the Idaho National Laboratory (2007) , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is designed upon two proven technologies .
One is the Light-Water-cooled Reactors , which are the most widely deployed nuclear reactors generating power in the world; the other is supercritical fossil-fired boilers , many of which are applied in industry throughout the world .
Additionally , since the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor uses supercritical water as coolant , its design features considerable simwell ,"ation by reducing the containment volume and eliminating the need for recirculation and jet pumps , pressurizer , steam generators , steam separators and dryers (Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) .
In conclusion , because of the above simple design features and proven technology basis , it is possible to run the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor at relatively low cost .
pressurizersThe final argument held by opponents of the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is that the nuclear power plants provide access to materials that can be used to make nuclear weapons and the potential massive radioactive releases are threat to human safety and security .
Despite the public's growing concerns over nuclear safety , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor can clear people's doubt due to its safety features .
According to the roadmap of the Generation IV Reactors , to which the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor belongs , the new nuclear reactors , unlike any of the current Generation III Reactors , awas the representatives of advancement in sustainability , safety , and reliability .
They are resistant to diversion of materials for proliferation and secure from terrorist attacks , too .
Moreover , the simplified safety features of the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor are independent of all the sophisticated backup system or experienced operators .
In fact , these features are all "meltdown proof" due to the reactors' basic principles .
According to Butler , D (2004) , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor can cool down all by itself when it encounters an accident without any technical support from experienced operators .
Thus , terrorist attacks to the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor may be the last concern for the public and nuclear weapon proliferation may be effectively controlled due to the new reactors' safety features coupled with enhanced strategies to manage the nuclear fuels and materials in the international markets .
systemsTo sum up , I firmly reckon that the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is the most suitable nuclear reactor concept for further research and development , despite the issues of high requirement of materials , the potential cost overruns , and the threat of nuclear safety and nuclear proliferation , because the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor's advantages of promising research on advanced materials , simplified designed factors , safety design features and resistance to nuclear proliferation overweigh the problems it faces today .
Nuclear energy is a source of energy which originates from the splitting of uranium atoms in a process called fission .
At the power plant , the fission process is used to generate heat for producing steam , which is used by a turbine to generate electricity .
(Westinghouse Electric Company LLC , 2009) Nuclear energy started in 1942 .
Till date , there are 436 active nuclear power plants and they generate more than 370 ,221 Megawatts of electricity which constitute  16% of the world's total energy consumption .
Nuclear energy is used because it does not produce carbon dioxide which causes greenhouse effect .
Also , nuclear energy does not rely on oil and coal which are limited resources and its energy generation is the most concentrated compared to other sources of energy .
Despite the benefits of nuclear energy , few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries due to public opposition .
Nuclear leak is the fear that most people have after the Bhopal incident which occurred in 1984 .
It continues to evoke strong emotions even after 25 years later .
(Union Carbide Corporation , 2001) However , as time goes by , new reactor concepts have been developed and the aspects of safety and performance have been improved .
Therefore , I feel that we should allow further research and development funding for nuclear energy so that it can be our future source of energy .
There are 6 new generation IV reactor concepts which have been developed: gas-cooled reactor , lead-cooled reactor , molten salt reactor , sodium-cooled fast reactor and very-high-temperature reactor .
In this essay , I will be using the "very-high- temperature reactor" (VHTR) due to several deciding factors .
Firstly , the concept of VHTR is the most practical among the 6 reactor concepts .
A concept similar to that of VHTR has been tested out in Oarai , Japan and the test run was successful as it reached its operating goal of 950 Degree Celsius .
As the reactor operates at such a high temperature , it can be used to split hydrogen from water thermochemically .
Hydrogen can be used as fuel cells to convert the gas into electricity for cars and homes .
VHTR can also operate without having to depend on the controversial reprocessing of plutonium waste which will deter terrorism and prevent nuclear weapon proliferation .
(Nature , 2004)
Terrorism has became the world's concern after the "911" incident which happened in New York City , USA .
As nuclear weapon can be very destructive and deadly , people are afraid that nuclear power plants will be a potential target for terrorists .
Therefore , security at the nuclear plants must be able to counter nuclear weapon proliferation as well as terrorist attacks .
VHTR concept has handled the issue on security .
As the waste recycling is not needed in the operational process , plutonium , which is a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapon , will not be easily obtained from reprocessing waste , thus countering nuclear weapon proliferation .
Furthermore , terrorist attacks on nuclear plants will not be of great destruction as compared to the 911 incident .
The percentage of destruction on a nuclear plant by a large aircraft being used to attack a nuclear facility with the purpose of releasing radioactive materials is close to zero .
The US department of energy concluded that reactor structures are robust and would protect the fuel from impacts of large commercial aircraft .
(Hardy & Haven , 1999) .
Critics may argue that there is no foolproof plan to deter terrorism .
Despite the lesson learnt after the 911 incident , several terrorist attacks were still conducted such as the Bali and London bombings .
However , news of nuclear terrorism is very rare as compared to other acts of terrorism .
Nuclear plants have counter terrorism structures and systems to prevent terrorist attacks .
As terrorist attacks are becoming more sophisticated and deadly , we will need the help of research and development to come out with new systems and structures to counter terrorism .
Operational safety is a prime concern for people working in nuclear plants .
Workers working in a nuclear plant are prone to radiation doses .
However , workers need not worry about them as radiation doses are controlled by the use of remote handling equipment , physical shielding and limiting the time workers spend in the nuclear plant .
(Levenson , M . & Rahn , F . 1981) Others may argue that accidents are inevitable .
However , based on statistics , the number of fatalities in nuclear plants caused by operational accident is the lowest compared to other energy plants .
(Ball , Roberts & Simpson , 1994) Therefore , we can say that nuclear plants are the safest to work in compared to other energy generation plants .
New equipments that will protect workers from radiation doses can be obtained through research and development .
The Bhopal nuclear incident which was due to worker's carelessness still induces fear among people .
The educational and experience level of the workers working in nuclear plants need to be of certain standard .
As nuclear accidents can be devastating such as the Chernobyl incident , we need to carefully select people to work in nuclear plants .
However , critics may argue that human error cannot be avoided if humans are involved in the process .
Then , to minimize human error , one way is to minimize manual labor and computerize the whole operating process .
Therefore , we need research and development to explore the possibility of computerizing the operating process .
Cost and performance of nuclear plants are two of the main factors that people will look into before deciding whether to invest in them .
Cost will include the operating and maintenance cost and performance is determined by the amount of output energy a nuclear plant can achieve .
Based on an article published by U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee and the Generation IV International Forum in December 2002 , the estimated cost of building and maintaining a VHTR nuclear plant is one of the lowest compared to the other generation IV reactor concepts .
The article also stated that the efficiency of VHTR exceeds fifty percent , which is the highest among the six reactors .
We cannot deny that the advantages of having VHTR are gained through years of research and development .
Therefore , we cannot stop the research and development process if we want to continue to have a better energy source .
In conclusion , I support further research and development funding for nuclear power as a source of energy for the future .
Research and development is an important process that will bring up the standard of human life .
As we trace the history of nuclear power since 1942 till today , we can see that there is a vast improvement in the field of nuclear energy in terms of global security , operational safety , automation of the process , cost and performance .
We cannot be contended with the results that we currently have .
Research and development needs to be done consistently so that we can better improve the concept of nuclear reactor in the future .
However , opponents might argue that resources could be diverted to research more into renewable resources .
Howevisearch had been done and there was no potential into further improving the process of tapping renewable energy but there is potential in nuclear power and hence the funding is required to carry on .
Furthermore , the world today require more energy and the energy demand is not met with the existing renewable resources as they have their own limitations .
For , example , wind energy cannot be tapped on non-windy days and solar energy cannot be tapped at night .
This causes a country to lose out its profits as the production in industries could not be carried out if there is not enough energy supply .
Hence , due to our growing energy needs we need to concentrate on the generation IV Reactors .
Italy they areally constructed 4 nuclear reactors but shut all of them down after the Chernobyl accident .
However the Prime Minister of Italy , Berlusconi , and the President of France , Nicolas Sarkozy , signed an agreement which states havet that the both countries would work together to bring back nuclear power in Italy .
Initially , Italy had no back up energy source on its own and need to depend on other countries .
CITATION Ita09 \l 1033 (Italy , 2009) In fact , Italy had more than 80% of its energy supplied by other countries CITATION nuc08 \l 1033 (Italy n .  , 2008) .
Italy now plans to build nuclear reactors as it does not want to depend heavily on other countries for energy .
If the country supplying power to Italy decides to stop importing power to it , Italy's economy would come to a halt .
Furthermore , it would destabilize the society and would potentially cause political instability as people would be unhappy with no electricity in the country .
For example , citizens living in the village Banthara did not participate in the elections in India as they were upset over having little access to electricity CITATION Kam09 \l 1033 (Hajela , 2009) .
Hence , nuclear power is required for social peace and to meet the increasing energy demand .
Therefore , research and funding would be necessary for generation IV reactors .
exportingcountries .neededtwoOpponents might also argue that nuclear reactors are expensive to cmore researchever , the claim is not true .
Nuclear supplierhaseported that thno potential has been reportedfory require 10 to 40% of the price needed to build theenergy .
Butnt .
Also , the generation IV reactors are researched as a consortium .
Hence , the countries can benefit from EconomrequiresScale and create Monopoly .
This would cause profit for the reactors .
Also , if nuclear power is not used , then the world's economy could not progress as the energy input is not met .
Hence , there would be more loss to the world if production stops .
Therefore , research and funding for Generation IV reactors is necessary .
CITATION joh06 \l 1033 (madslein , 2006) .
Funding for generation IV nuclear reactors would be useful as they help reduce greenhouse gases .
The Massachusetts institute of technology reported that more than 40 percent of the greenhouse gases produced would be attributed to the burning of fossil fuels by 2020 CITATION Lau08 \l 1033 (Sullivan , 2008) .
However , using the generation IV nuclear reactors would reduce the emission of greebringe gases as a method known as nuclear fission is applied to tap energy .
The energy after the uranium is burnt in the fission process is used to vaporize water to produce steam which is then used to turn turbine to produce electricity CITATION Gab07 \l 1033 (Gache , 2007) .
Morenuclear reactors is used in Australia instead of fossil fuels , the greenhouse emission in Australia alone would reduce by 4% .
Hence , further research and funding is necessary for generation IV concepts as they help reduce the effect of global warming .
However , opponents backtrack to the accidents on Chernobyl and the three-mile island and argue that funding should not be given for generation IV reactors .
However , the accidents happened in the past .
Furthermore , the new generation IV reactors are more safe and also help combat future climate changes .
The generation IV reactors are not only safe to operate as they are machine operated , but also reduce greenhouse gases that the current energy sources produce .
they alsoarebe reducedTo sum it all , funding for the generation IV concepts is necessary as there is an increasing energy demand today .
AInstitute of Technologyepend solely on other countries for its energy as it would cause socio-economic problems .
Furthermore , nuclear power helps reduc help combat climate change .
Also , the plant is not very expensive to construct as the opponents claim .
Hence , the funding for the Generation IV nuclear reactors is a useful one .
People usually have the misconception of nuclear power .
Whenever people hear of the word "nuclear" , they usually associate this word with nuclear warfare , radiation emitted by nuclear and all the possible detrimental impacts that nuclear power can cause (Donald , 2004) .
People have this misconception because they think that nuclear power is actually a very lethal "weapon" .
However , the public usually forgets the fact that nuclear power can actually be a rich source of energy and is able to have a substantial effect on the reduction of cost and environmental pollution .
Moreover , with the advancement of technology , nuclear fission and waste disposal of nuclear energy can be assured of safety (Partha , n .d) .
Indeed , nuclear energy should be funded for further research and development .
With the numerous benefits of nuclear energy , there is no doubt that nuclear energy should be used .
Researchers are currently researching and finding ways to further reduce the cost and enhance the safety of generation IV reactor concepts .
One of the most advanced concepts is the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) which incorporates maximum safety features and produces more energy than expected (Burtler , 2004) .
More research should be done on the VHTR reactor because currently , the expected cost of operating this VHTR reactor is still relatively high .
However , the cost is still cheaper in contrast to using fossil fuels to generate energy .
For example , the cost of nuclear energy per kilo watt hour (KWh) is just 1 .68 cents only .
This is much cheaper compared to using oil which costs 18 cents per KWh or using coal which costs about 4 cents per KWh (Economics of Nuclear Power , 2009) .
The low cost of nuclear energy is mainly due to the abundance of uranium which can be mined at a low cost and just a tiny amount of uranium can provide a huge amount of nuclear energy for usage .
However , for fossil fuels , the most optimistic estimate on their remaining years  is about two hundred years (Enzler , 1998) .
Cost is definitely an issue for people .
With low cost of electricity , people will enjoy the benefits .
In addition , if further research is done on VHTR reactor , the cost of using nuclear energy may even be lower .
As for the environmental factor with regards to using nuclear energy , opponents of nuclear energy may argue that nuclear power plant produces waste that is not environmental friendly .
It is a fact that nuclear power plant does produce waste known as spent fuel .
This spent fuel has different radiation level and requires special handling .
However , the US Department of Energy , just like France , has vowed to ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste by transmuting problem components of nuclear fuel into less harmful components and burying  them deep into the ground (Nuclear Power and the Environment , n .d) .
The strict regulation of nuclear reactors by the government and together with the current technology is enough to ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste .
Furthermore , in the aspect of zero pollution by nuclear energy , opponents of nuclear energy will have no choice but to agree with this fact .
If we were to compare the amount of greenhouse gases and poisonous gases emitted by fossil fuels in contrast to that by nuclear energy when operating the reactors , there is an astonishing statistics showing the huge amount of harmful gases emitted by fossil fuel .
2249 pounds of carbon dioxide and thirteen pounds of sulphur dioxide are being produced in the production of 1MWh of electricity (Nuclear Power and the Environment , n .d) .
This amount of carbon dioxide definitely expedites the process of global warming .
When the amount of gases produced by fossil fuels is compared with that by nuclear power plants , the latter will definitely be the wise choice for energy purpose because it produces zero carbon dioxide and zero poisonous gas .
Only with the usage of nuclear reactor are we then able to claim the title of being environmental friendly .
Opposition of nuclear energy may also claim that nuclear reactors pose a security threat because terrorists may target nuclear reactors , hence causing mass destruction to the country and its citizens .
The fear of using nuclear reactors as a cover up for making nuclear bombs is even more prominent .
However , with the generation IV reactors coming up , especially the VHTR , maximum security is assured .
VHTR is designed in such a way that in the event of an accident occurring , there will be a temperature control sensor to switch off the nuclear reactor automatically .
(Very High Temperature Reactor , n .d) Though people may still be worried that the temperature control sensor may fail , all these safety features can be enhanced by having a back up sensor in the event of breakdown .
Security guards and cameras can also be used to monitor the safety operation of a nuclear power plant and ensure that the power plant is free from terrorists .
All the research and funding for the VHTR are definitely worth the money and effort with regards to the security issue of nuclear power plants (Nuclear Energy Information Centre , 2006) .
There is definitely no question that producing an increasing share of electric power using nuclear fuel in lieu of fossil fuels will reduce greenhouse gases emissions .
Substantial replacement of fossil fuels would result in substantial decline in global warming and greenhouses gases .
Furthermore , the cost of operating nuclear reactors is low in comparison to operating fossil fuel power plants .
Cost will definitely be an issue for the people when using electricity .
There is no doubt that more research and funding should be allocated to generation IV reactors , especially VHTR , which opens a new arena for nuclear energy as VHTR incorporates the safety of nuclear reactors and also provides low cost of nuclear energy for users .
Nuclear energy is definitely the one and the best choice of energy .
Firstly , for security reasons , opponents of the new reactors insist that terrorists could easily make nuclear reactors one of their targets .
Shelly (25 March 2002) reminded us that the terrorists who attacked the world trade centre could have easily attacked the Indian Point's twin reactors and the United States would agree with Shelly that they were somehow fortunate .
However , one could question why the terrorists did  not fly the plane into the twin reactors .
Could it be that the twin reactors were more difficult to hit or the terrorists knew that the twin reactors were well protected or prepared to handle terrorists attacks ?
In fact , the core of the present nuclear plants is already well protected by strong materials and there is a safety plan (Goldstein , 23 September 2009) .
Since researchers would also be finding suitable high heat-resistant materials for the VHTRs to prevent the plant from melting down , the extra protection would make the future plants almost impossible to penetrate in the future .
Lastly , disputers argue that nuclear waste storage is a problem as nuclear waste remains reactive even after a long time .
This causes citizens to oppose strongly against the nuclear waste being stored near them .
In the U .S . , Mr Obama also questioned whether nuclear waste could be stored in a safe place (Steve , 10 November 2008) as the search for a suitable place to store nuclear waste in the U .S . continues .
However , he explained that the U .S . could store the waste near the reactors .
Naturally , that is possible as the waste is about 33 tonnes per year (Wald , August 2009) and this relatively small amount of waste should find the space at those nuclear sites .
Moreover the impact of global warming is growing and is of immediate concern to the world and nuclear power helps solve the problem by reducing the emission of carbon dioxide by a total of 31 ,243 MtC in 2050 in France and Canada alone .
(Cochran , 23 April 2008) .
It is without doubt that the world needs to solve global warming or else the Earth might perish first .
In conclusion , the Earth's temperature is increasing rapidly towards a level that causes widespread heatstroke .
If the world does not cooperate to support VHTR or nuclear power , it is difficult to find an alternative that could produce energy that is clean and affordable in the long run .
As a result , the world might see an increasing number of casualties due to global warming .
In  recent years , oil prices have been soaring to new heights and this reflects the high energy demands all over the world and the limited supply of fossil fuels .
This sounds the siren for us to find an effective source of alternative energy before the fossil fuels that we depend so much on run out .
Today we have candidates such as the solar energy , wind energy and the nuclear energy .
Since energy harvested from nuclear reactors is highly efficient and has low material cost , it is seen as a good source of alternative energy .
A nuclear reactor is very similar to a typical coal burning power plant where water is heated into pressurized steam which drives the turbine generator .
The only difference is the type of fuel used to heat up the water .
Nuclear reactors use energy generated from nuclear fission which has a very high output to material used ratio .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) was initiated in 2000 and formally chartered in mid 2001 to come up with more advanced nuclear reactors called the Generation IV reactors .
(Gen IV Reactors ,2009) By far , six designs of generation IV nuclear reactors have been finalized which the GIF believed to represent the shape of future nuclear energy .
(Butler , 2004) But public opposition due to several factors such as terrorism , safety , renewability and environmental issues has caused few reactors to be built over the past decade .
Although nuclear energy should not be seen as the only solution to depleting fossil fuels , due to its ability to generate a huge amount of energy using a small amount of resources , its development should be encouraged .
Further research and development and funding for generation IV reactors such as the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) have benefits outweighing the disadvantages  with respect to security , cost and environmental concerns .
Oppositions have very good reasons to go against nuclear reactor development especially after the 911 incident and the Chernobyl disaster .
After the 911 incident , Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) enforced strict rules and regulations on the nuclear power plants .
(Order Code RS21131 , 2005) These include having all nuclear plants licensed by NRC to be protected by layers of physical barriers and a highly trained security force .
Another benefit that comes with this heightened security is the generation of more jobs helping to ease unemployment rate .
NRC also requires the power plants to conduct regular security and evacuation exercises which will be closely monitored by NRC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) .
(Order Code RS21131 , 2005) Furthermore , a decades-long test and analysis portrayed that actual radioactivity escaping from molten fuel is less than initial assumption as the nuclear activity slows down a lot when it is not in the internal structure of the reactor .
Also the containment structures of modern reactors are designed to effectively prevent the escape of radioactivity even if it sustains severe damages .
(Safety , 2008) These factors would certainly ease the minds of people worrying about the security and safety issues of nuclear reactors .
In contrast to the two other alternative sources of energy , the cost of building a nuclear reactor is higher than a wind turbine or solar panel .
Also since a wind turbine or solar panel is more unlikely to be in a terrorist's hit list than a nuclear plant , cost of maintaining security of them are relative less .
But in contrast to what many people would think , even a generation III reactor used today has structures that can sustain a plane crashing into it .
In addition , a MSR uses an integrated fuel cycle system where molten salts are used as its fuel as well as its coolant .
(GIF , 2007) MSR has lower fissile inventories and no need to spend on ways to handle solid fuels .
(Gen IV reactors , 2009) Moreover , newer advanced reactors have simpler designs which further reduce capital cost and they are more fuel efficient and safer .
(Advanced Reactors , 2009) The construction of wind turbines and solar panels is very space consuming because of their low energy efficiency and they are unreliable as they are weather dependent .
(Gibson , 2007) Although nuclear reactors too need large area of land space , the great energy output it has compensates  for its use of space .
All the alternative energy sources mentioned are green compared to the burning of fossil fuels in terms of emission to the environment .
But some still feel that wind and solar energy are greener than nuclear energy due to the nuclear waste .
Since the first generation of nuclear reactors , advancement in technology has greatly increased the fuel efficiency , thus cutting down  the waste .
(Gen IV Reactors , 2009) Furthermore , MSR's fuel doubling up as its coolant due to the good heat transportation properties of molten salts further reduces on the waste produced .
Due to the nature of MSR , its waste has a lower amount of radioactivity , is safer due to passive cooling up to any size and has very low fuel usage .
The French self-breeding variant claims 50kg of thorium and 50kg U-238 per billion kWh .
(Gen IV Reactors , 2009)
There is certainly a need to find a replacement for the depleting fossil fuels and any feasible energy source could be a potential candidate .
All the possible candidates should not be conveniently ignored .
Thus nuclear energy alike should not be dismissed .
Considering that the benefits nuclear energy brings outweigh the disadvantages , further research and development and funding should be provided for more advanced reactors that are safer , more powerful and less costly .
countriessurprisingRegardless of the technical difficulties , the main reason is obvious , that is the consideration of safety .
The nuclear power reactor is a high hazh reliability and safcoal , are limited because of limited sourcesf itsuch a situationtrol , a nuclear explosion is very likely to happen and the leakage of radiation will make horrible harm tmany environment or people around .
This kind of greathe samesasters did happen in the history(Three Mile Island and Chernobyl) , and resulted in many people's losing confidence on the nuclearmorergy .
Since 1986 when the Chernobyl accident happened , the America even hasn't set up any new nuclear power plants .
In order to make full use of the advantages of nuclear energy , the primary task for the engineers is to improve the safety .
Every time befhighly hazardousto improve , we should first find out what has gone wrong and where is the disfigurement .
So let us take Chernobyl as an example , and have an insight of this nuclear industrial accident .
About that disaster , some later investigations showed the design of the nuclear reactor existed defects and someone insisted that the causes werepeopleut technical problein .wever , it is proved to be one-sided now .
Actually if there was onlhe design defects , the final explosion was completely avoidable .
Most the investigators have come to a consensus that the primary cause for the Chernobyl is the failure of human management .
Because of the staff's breach of duty , the operators detected the reactors' problem very late and even took erroneous actions .
What's worse , the makeup of the working team was not adequate , for they didn't have timely backup system .
As a consequence , the emergency shut-down mechanism totally failed .
All these small human errors came together and finally led the Chernobyl explosion happen .
For the sake of avoiding the failure of human factors , some engineers and sociologists bring up the idea of applying psychological methods to engineering design process , which is really necessary and effective in my opinion .
However , some engineers hold the opinion that embed social psychology into the Engining processes seems crazyitsd funny .
It is usually known that human factors mean the characteristic at the efficient anace .
In their conservative view , they always care more about the how productive and reliable of the machines are and neglect to focus on the role of humans in safeguarding .
But from the phad analysis of the Chernobyl nuclear accidents , we can see that correct human actions are indispensable in preventing the disaster .
Indeed , the wererall system's reliability and safety in a nuclear power plant is more ofMost of thendent on humans instead of the machines Why is that ?
Once the equipments be put into use , the maximum reliability are already fixed .
Afterwards , we need well-trained and experienced operators to maintain the performance of the machines and always keep track of the status of the equipments .
In addition , in a hazard industrial pa timelywell-organized working team is also very necessary , which has orderly shifts system , immediate backup , and so on .
Without any of the above led to the Chernobyl explosionent , the reliability of the whole system will not be easy to be ensured .
it will not be easy to ensure the reliability of the whole systemSome conservatism may still oppose that " you incorporatingt human management is importengineeringcan hire good managers to improve the effectiveness of human actions , sti management in the engineering processes is already a way applying social psychology .
B it's not enough .
In trefuse hazard industry like nuclear powersafeguarding securityyone should be responsible and devotional instead of automaccidentworking under the management of the manager or chief engineer .
Applying psychology in engineering design processes is to let everyone work efficiently , such as set-up couches for psychotherapeutic sessions fohon machines .ors and staff , can reduce the strehave been of the workers who work for long time iser high pressure and help them relax .
All in all , human errors are avoidable , and psychology in engineering is meant to reduce the risk of occurrence of nuclear industry failure caused by huan industrial plant with potential hazards
hoursarranging forAnywaconservativesfforts done by theoppose to the use of psycholoy in engineering processes as they think that hiring good managers should suffice .gy provide us a new option to improvingvely improve nucleandustry's safety and reliability .
Maybe some engineers still oppose the use of psychology , it is wohighly hazardous include psychology in an engplantsing design process .
I'm confidence thdevotede
As the worlds' population grows ever larger , the worlds' energy consumption also increases; hence a sustainable energy source needs to be found to supply developing countries and others with enough energy .
The world's natural resources are depleting and a clean and renewable energy source is required .
16% of the world's electricity is supplied by nuclear power plants , and 30% of the world's fossil fuels are used to produce electricity .
A clean energy source like nuclear power seems to be the ideal solution for the energy crisis .
The generation 4 nuclear reactors are much safer , more efficient and more secure .
However the scars left from the Chernobyl disaster and the Three Mile Island catastrophe has changed the public opinion on nuclear reactors for the worse .
(US DOE Nuclear Energy research advisory committee and the generation IV international forum)
On April 26th 1986 , the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded .
The whole town was evacuated and almost all of them never returned .
Around 30 people died and  several thousands were exposed to radiation .
The radiation spread , contaminating tens of thousands of square miles in northern Ukraine , southern Belarus , and Russia's Bryansk region .
Today the area is still abandoned and highly radioactive .
This coupled with the Three Mile Island accident has left the public to view the nuclear reactors as highly dangerous .
However the Generation 4 reactors tackle these problems with various methods .
Two of the popular Generation 4 reactors , the Very High Temperature reactor (VHTR) and Sodium Fast cooled reactor (SFR) , are reviewed below .
(Stone ,R)
Safety is a major point , and it is important for the Generation 4 reactors to prove its safety .
The SFR has a passive cooling system; this is because the thermal difference between the coolant boiling temperature and the operational temperature is quite large .
Hence in case of a meltdown or any terrorist activities the system can avoid a meltdown without any human interaction .
On the other hand the VHTR has an active cooling system , which means a human interaction is required in case of an emergency .
This works in  favor of the VHTR , a scenario where a fast response is needed , as the VHTR would be suitable and safer .
The SFR boasts a recycling system where 99 .9% of the actinides are recycled back  as fuels , such as plutonium and since the SFR is a closed fuel system , fuel can be used again in the system .
Unlike the SFR , the VHTR has no waste recycling system and hence It goes directly into the repository where the nuclear waste has a half life of about a few centuries only (research is currently going on to reduce the half life) .
In addition  , in the SFR the recycled plutonium could be a security threat .
This could be a serious security flaw; in case the plutonium is stolen it could be used to fuel nuclear weapons .
In the case of the VHTR this major security flaw is completely eliminated .
(Roglans , J . , Allen , T . and Lineberry ,M .)
Finally , the SFR operates under relatively low temperatures and hence Sodium is chosen as its coolant .
This coolant is highly reactive unlike the inert Helium used in a VHTR .
This  coolant makes the VHTR significantly much safer since it makes its core highly stable and unreactive .
(Southworth  ,F) In order to provide electricity to the masses at an affordable rate , performance of the nuclear reactor is very important .
Notably , the SFR operates on a closed fuel system where 99 .9% of the actinides are recycled; this significantly reduces the wastage and also enhances its performance .
Even though the SFR has the above mentioned features , it only has a thermal efficiency of less the 40% whilst the VHTR has an efficiency of above 50% .
Furthermore , unlike SFR , the VHTR produces Hydrogen gas in addition to electricity .
Hydrogen is also a clean fuel as it does not emit green house gasses when it is burned .
It is also an alternate fuel which could be used to power vehicles in the future .
(Southworth  ,F)
The cost is a major is issue in constructing a nuclear power planet .
The SFR , due to its relatively low operating temperature and pressure , is much cheaper when it comes to material cost and building; hence , it has a lower capital cost .
On the other hand the VHTR is more expensive to build; its materials have to withstand high temperatures as well as high pressures .
Though the capital cost of the VHTR is high the operational cost is comparatively less since the VHTR is highly efficient at higher temperatures and hence is a good solution to get cheaper electricity .
Some may argue that the VHTR has too high a capital cost , as a prototype would cost 1Billion US dollars .
But many countries have shown great interests in the development of the VHTR , and the cost of Research and Development , therefore , will be split amongst several countries .
(Butler , D)
In the society nowadays , people have high expectations in the development of new technologies .
Due to the speed of advancement of technology , people have taken it for granted and are expecting more for less .
This is evident when we look at the issue regarding new nuclear power plants to be built .
People are very performance oriented and yet safety and cost conscious .
Thus it is a common dilemma faced by most engineers nowadays .
People expect the new and upcoming Generation IV nuclear power plants to be efficient and at the same time expecting engineers and researchers to make them safer and cheaper .
Thus with this in mind , I would strongly advocate further research and development on the Very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) as they suit the "requirements" of the public the most .
I feel that if ample time is spent in researching this model of nuclear reactor , it will yield the best return and result and it will also address public concerns .
Firstly , the VHRT had an earlier  delivery date than most other designs and that was the reason  why I supported it .
According to a table published in an article (NATURE , 2004 , Vol 429 , p . 239) , it showed that the VHTR could be delivered in 2020 while many other designs could only manage 2025 .
This is because the basic technology envisioned in the VHTR is already in use by several current high temperature gas reactor plants based in countries like Japan , China and the USA (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee and the Generation IV international Forum , 2002 , p . 49) .
This means that the technology is already quite well established and thus less time is needed to research on the basic technology that will be used in VHTR as compared to the other power plants that may involve the use of totally new technologies .
In times like this when the price of fossil fuels  is sky rocketing , an earlier delivery date of 5 years for an efficient energy alternative is very crucial .
If the VHTR can be realized as soon as possible , public concerns about the hefty pricing on carbon tax and fossil fuels can then be addressed earlier .
Secondly , the high temperature generated by the VHTR is advantageous in many different ways .
It allows for high-thermodynamic efficiency of up to 48% currently (AREVA , 2009) and it is one of the most efficient designs among others .
Thus it translates to higher electrical production efficiency , meaning that it can produce more electrical energy .
The huge amount of heat produced from the nuclear cores can also be used in refineries , for petro chemistry , metallurgy and hydrogen production (U .S . DOE NERAC & GIF , 2002 , p . 48) .
With hydrogen generation made possible , the VHTR can replace future coal fueled hydrogen production plants , taking over the role of supplying energy for other hydrogen intensive industries and may also be able to generate hydrogen as a source of fuel .
Therefore the implementation of the VHTR can offer a wide range of solutions to the fuel crisis that is currently troubling the public .
However , there are also constraints and problems to be solved before the VHTR can be commercially implemented .
This includes extensive research on materials that can withstand high temperature and that are stronger and corrosion resistant .
Materials such as alloys , composite , fuel coating and ceramic based materials (Fraser , 2006) need to be improved on in order to make the power plant safer .
Mechanisms and processes to cool the cores down in the event of an accident have to be reinvented or improved on as well .
In all , I feel that VHRT would be the best bet as a clean , safe and cheaper alternative in the long run .
It is because it can co-generate hydrogen and electricity with superior efficiency , tackling the fuel crisis issue head on .
It is also relatively safer than the rest of the Gen IV nuclear power plants as it uses an inert gas , helium , as the coolant .
Finally , the cost should not be an issue because it has been reported that the pricing of nuclear energy is comparable or if not lower than those generated by coal and oil fired plants (Nuclear Energy Institute , 2001) .
Nowadays , people are arguing about the research and development for  generation IV reactors to the current energy crisis .
Many people support further research and development for generation IV reactors while others do not .
The most heated argument is  how to ensure the safety of the operation of  nuclear reactors .
From my point of view , I agree with the continuous research and development on the Very-High-Temperature-Reactor (VHTR) , which is one of the generation IV concepts , because it is the technology that brings us solutions .
Opponents of developing nuclear reactors claim that we should not put so much money and effort on such a dangerous plant .
Safety is the factor that  most people worry about .
There have been two nuclear power plant accidents in  history .
The Chernobyl accident caused a huge number of deaths and radiation-related injuries .
In fact , the accident occurred because the nuclear power plant was inappropriately operated and the reactor was not placed in the well-protected area  .
The Three Mile Island accident was due to a meltdown of partial core in unit 2 .
As it is well controlled ,  no deaths were caused .
Nowadays , when building a nuclear plant , the safety issue needs to be considered .
The nuclear plants are always built far from the public community .
If an accident occurs , the public will be prevented from the impact of the accident .
Besides safety , the cost , performance and environmental issues are also popular in today's arguments .
It is true that to develop and build a nuclear plant will cost a lot of money , but the cost is reasonable .
Nuclear power technology is much more well-rounded and practical technology when compared to solar power or bio-power technology .
A lot of money is also spent on developing these technologies which are still in the experimental stage .
According to a recent report of nuclear plants (European Nuclear Society , 2009) , until 24 September 2009 ,  436 nuclear power plant units in 31 countries are in operation and 53 plants in 15 countries are under construction .
About 17% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear plants .
It is obvious that spending more money on the development of nuclear power is quite reasonable .
Moreover , the performance of a nuclear plant is very significant compared to conventional thermal power stations .
They both used the same principle to generate electricity .
Finally , under normal operation , nuclear power plants are environmentally-friendly .
It does not emit any carbon dioxide gases or other pollutions .
The only thing to care about is the radiation .
The plant can ensure there will be no radiation emitted out of the reactor under normal operation .
The generation IV reactor concepts bring a brighter future to the nuclear reactors .
One of them is the VHTR concept .
It has many advantages compared to the existing technology .
With this technology , the efficiency of the system can be brought to a new level .
It is able to produce an output temperature of up to 1000oC unlike the existing reactors which can only produce a temperature of about 300oC (Butler , 2004) .
VHTR is more than three times more powerful than the existing reactors .
That means it will generate much more power during the same period of time .
Besides , the VHTR can produce not only heat but also hydrogen productions .
This is a valuable process because hydrogen-production can be further processed to other types of fuel which is suitable for use in vehicles .
If VHTR is widely used , the amount of hydrogen-production could be enough to become a major fuel that can be another solution to the vehicle power system .
Moreover , VHTR is the lowest risk technology .
The safety characteristics of a helium-cooled , graphite-moderated core are employed by VHTR .
VHTR benefits from the high heat capacity and structural stability of the graphite together with the single phase and inert material of the Helium coolant .
The fuel allows high burn-up and  because of the characteristics of the cooled uranium-oxycarbide .
The high operating temperature of the core in the VHTR allows emissions-free process .
Furthermore , this technology also provides an enhanced waste minimization .
We have strong evidence to show that with the improvement of technology , the concerns about the operation of nuclear plants will fade away .
In comparison with the current technologies , nuclear power has its advantages .
It is clean and highly efficient .
With the appearance of the generation IV reactors , it will become more and more clean , efficient and safe .
The most important thing is to ensure the safety of the nuclear power plant to prevent it from the attack of terrorism .
In conclusion , the generation IV reactor concept opens a new chapter in the development of nuclear power .
VHTR is one of them .
It provides high-efficiency operation , produces not only heat but also hydrogen productions , has lower risk , and offers enhanced waste minimization .
With all these advantages , the generation IV reactors will be one of the best solutions to the world's energy shortage problem .
First of all , most people are questioning about the safety when talking about robotic surgery .
As robotic surgery is a new medical technology , most patients may not be familiar with it .
Thus they have  doubt on the robots and feel uneasy during the surgery with no humans present .
In case of emergency , it will be even harder for the surgeon , who controls the robot , to know the feeling of the patient and handle the situation .
Thus , some people prefer surgery done by a human surgeon as they believe such surgery will have lower risk level .
However , this is not true and in fact , robotic surgery has a relatively lower risk level than conventional surgery .
As mentioned before , robotic surgery is more precise and causes smaller incision .
For example , according to Livingston (New York Health News , 2009) , the all-robotic kidney transplant surgery is easier and less painful with its tiny robot incision and the patient is able to be back to normal activities within few weeks .
Furthermore , to avoid the risk , the professional engineers are required to check and maintain the system before and after every surgery to ensure the functionality of robot .
Surgeons are also well trained before they actually use the robot in performing the surgery .
The robot is designed in the way that in case of emergency , it will stop operating immediately and the surgeon will take over the surgery himself .
In this way , the safety of the patients is no longer an issue .
Although it is true that the cost of the robotic surgery system is high , we have several solutions to solve this problem .
The most important part is government subsidy .
The robotic surgery is expensive because the robot is costly .
Hence , if the government could subsidize the hospital in purchasing the system , the cost of robotic surgery will dramatically drop to an affordable price to the general public .
Also , according to an article (Bonsor and Strickland , 2009) , the number of surgeons and nurses required for robotic surgery will be much less than conventional surgery and the hospital stays are generally shorter due to quicker healing time .
These will also cut the cost of robotic surgery .
In addition , more and more patients prefer robotic surgery as they agree that robots will perform more accurate surgeries with shorter healing time .
Thus , even if the cost of robotic surgery is relatively higher than conventional surgery , most people believe that the money is worthy spent .
Last but not least , people may be concerned about the efficiency of robotic surgery .
There are doubts as to whether the surgeons will be able to perform robotic surgeries effectively .
Recently , there was one case that one patient died from complications during the robotic surgery because the surgeon was not familiar with the system and could not perform effectively (Science News , 2006) .
This concern is reasonable because if the surgeon is not familiar with the system , he may take longer time for the surgery , thus creating a risk .
To avoid this kind of risk happening in Singapore , a training center should be set up in each hospital .
Professional engineers and foreign experts are invited to train the local surgeons with certain hours of practicing to ensure the surgeons are fully familiar with the system and will be able to perform in real situations .
Now , if the surgeons are well trained , the robot will eventually increase the efficiency of the surgeons .
According to Wiley (ScienceDaily , 2009) , if the surgeon is well trained , using robots could help him perform many surgical tasks without other human assistants .
This is beneficial especially in the case of Singapore as there are limited skilled assistants available in hospital .
Also , with the help of robots , the fatigue of the surgeon will be reduced as most work is done by robots and time taken for each surgery is generally shortened .
All these will increase the efficiency of robotic surgery .
Security is one of the primary factors that need to be addressed when monetary support is involved in the advancement of nuclear plants .
Unlike the rest of generation IV reactor concepts , SCWR is capable of running the operation without relying on the process of reusing plutonium waste .
(Butler , 2004) This could reduce the misuse of nuclear waste which can threaten the world peace as seen in the case of rbe caused North Korea nuclear saga .
Under the concept of SCWR , Butler (2004) also states that SCWR have simple safety features that do not depend on well-trained operators and complex backup systems .
Furthermore , they are able to solve the heat emission by cooling themselves down if accidents do happen .
Opponents of nuclear energy might argue that the radioactive waste which will be produced by the nuclear reactors is susceptible to accidents due to human intervention .
However , researchers could only suggest better solutions for the nuclear plants to produce less radioactive waste but not to the extent of eliminating radioactive waste till today .
In addition , engineers and researchers are not the only ones who are responsible for the security of the nuclear reactors .
Military protection in nuclear plants is another factor that should be considered in the security of the nuclear plants .
With strong ground and air defence within the nuclear reactors , the plants would be well-protected and could deter any forms of terrorist threats .
It has been popularly argued that the the performance of SWCR could play a major factor in the financial contribution for the development of SWCR .
According to Butler (2004) , if the concept of SCWR is successful , it could compete with other elements such as coals and gases in terms of the prices in producing electricity .
With this statement , proponents of nuclear power would highlight the economical benefit in generating electricity using nuclear power .
Since SCWR and other Generation IV desigSCWRs haveactors which can produce electricity as well as high temperature , they can also provide process heat for industrial purposes .
In addition , Bouchard (2008) mentions the uses of process heat for various types of industries such as chemical plants , petroleum refineries and hydrogen production .
Of rse , some might be doubtful over the advantages gained through the performances of SWCR in the upcoming decades due to the slow develont process .
However , Heber (2008) has explained that fact of the slow process in the new designs of SWCR is due to the great emphasize over the overall safety performances of the nuclear plants .
the Chernobyl accidentfrombecomefuelsIt is evident that the funding in the area of research and the environmentalf SWCR will provide benefits in the aspects of security , performance and environment .
With strong performance in the SCWR concept , mankind would experience better protection with the construction of new nuclear plants .
In the long run , the development of SWCR could also provide solutions to the environmental issues Ultimately , mankind need to accept new technology confidently and ethnically that might bring about unexpected improvements to the world .
One of the world's most devastating gas leak accidents occurred on December 3 , 1984 , in Bhopal , India .
The accident caused thousands of death and many are still suffering from its aftermath effect .
Methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas escaped from a pesticide producing plant owned by the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) and intoxicated the people in Bhopal .
After investigation , it was found that someone deliberately added water into the storage tank of the highly reactive MIC , causing a runaway reaction , pressure built up , which then caused a large volume of toxic gas to escape and intoxicate the area .
Safety systems such as the alarm system , a refrigeration unit (for cooling down the storage tank) , a caustic soda scrubber (to neutralized the toxic gases) , and the flare system (to incinerate excess gases or toxic gases) were all not in operation at that time .
According to Psychology and design processes (Bernhard .W .
2007) , the article defines design as a strategy allowing the final product to meet the user requirements in many different areas and accidents usually occur when there are miscommunications , inadequate organization or errors contributed by individuals .
Summing up , accidents occur when the outcome is not within the expectation of the designers .
Bernhard suggests the idea of adopting psychology during the design phase of a project , because engineers are humans and humans are prone to mistakes .
Implementing psychology in the design does have advantages .
It can be used as a reminder to engineers if there are any areas neglected during the process , allowing better communication to take place within the team and reducing the possibility of problems arising from miscommunication or individual actions .
Also , instead of having the traditional feedback controls of safety , the use of psychology predicts the consequences of having mistakes in design and take corrective actions immediately , thus greatly reducing the probability of accidents occurring due to design errors .
Adopting psychology in the initial or design phase of the project seems to benefit in the short term; however , it may not be beneficial in the long term .
This is because most of the designs change over time due to expansion , maintenance and more .
In most cases , the root cause of accidents is due to human errors .
For example , operational errors (BI-ME , 2009)  usually arise during operation instead of the designing phase .
For example , the Bhopal incident occurred due to lack of maintenance work for the plant and the workers neglected the importance of the safety in plant operations .
The main cause of the accident is due to a worker's mistake of adding water to MIC causing a runaway reaction .
Thus , implementing psychology in the design does not help , regardless of how well the plant is constructed or how many safety devices have been installed .
As long as the operators neglect the importance of working safely , the occurrence of accidents is definite .
Psychology can be used in areas to promote safety within workers or reinforce the importance of it .
Another factor that often leads to accidents is the approach the company or supervisors take on .
In the case of the Bhopal incident , the plant manger should have immediately rectified the problem like  safety device systems .
It was later discovered that the storage tank alarm system had not been working for four years and the flare system had been down for five months (E .Ingrid , 2004) Therefore , if a superintendent of a company shows no concern about safety , it is very likely that workers will take a similar attitude in the long run .
In spite of having a detailed and careful design , if the company decides to cut edges especially in safety , it is very likely that accidents can still occur .
In current engineering practices , a method has already been used to update and reinforce safety , known as Hazard and Operability studies or HAZOP .
HAZOP is conducted every 3 years (but it varies with different companies) and it is used to update the design of the plant or equipment in case of any changes .
It allows the representatives from different departments to collaborate and discuss the best possible solution to enhance safety in the plant .
Hence , psychology in the design phase may be unnecessary and replaced by a set of regulations enforced by the company .
In conclusion , adopting psychology does have benefits in the initial phase , as it reduces accidents due to design errors .
However , the usage may be limited to the design phase , as root causes like operation errors , human behavior and company's stand are common causes for accidents .
Thus , psychology may be used in areas like promoting safety issues among the workers , reducing the behavior of bad practices in a workplace and enhancing the communication between  different departments .
Unfortunately , solar cars are not too safe compared to conventional cars .
The first fatal accident of a soemissionsoccurred on August 12 , 2004 due to a head-on collision with a Chrysler minivan .
The driver of the solar car died instantly while the minivan's driver was unhurt[4] .
There are numerous reasons why the solar car is unsafe .
The best solar panel in the market today is less than 30% efficient at converting solar energy to usable electrical power .
Hence , solar cars must be made of very light materials .
Unfortunately , in any collision , a lighter car would suffer greater damages than a heavier car .
beltsreason why airbagsLast but not least , I believe that an addition of a few airbags would not vary the cost of the solar car too much .
Just like in conventional cars , the addition of airbags only cost an increase by two to five hundred dollars at the most .
Of course , this also h to depend on branding and quality of the car and the airbag .
Also , tthe speed of the airbag inflationne kilogram[12] and hence should not affect the performance of the solar car significantly .
Thus , I stand strong on my point of view that solar cars should be improved and designed with airbags to enhance safety .
From the mechanical pointwhich happened , the direct cause for the explosion was "the right solid rocket booster aft joint sealing , most likeltraumaof the extremely cold temperature in the mornin86) Data and reviews also showed that there were actually esit was the first time flaws of the Cteachernger , especially lying in the fact that the O-rings in the SRB could not seal thethe flight when it was very cold .
As a consequence , the hot exdied leaked through the joint and burned everything up .
Hence , it seemed that the technological deficiency was essentially the cause of the accident , as argued by Robert E . (1997) .
Despite the technological deficiency doomed that the challenger was not safe to launch , psychology could be implemented to stop the disaster from happening .
Before the launch of the challenger , what concerned the chief managersexpertswere the preceding 24 successful space shuttle launch .
There was probably too much pressure from the public .
If the managers handled the pressure well , rechuman factorscarefully and dcause not to launch thewould have been preventedeverthe decision makershad acteds eliminated; theagers , the challenger would never have been launched .
,launchesIn adaion , reviews of the accident reported , "before the launch , the low temperature had prompted concern form engineers at Morton Thiokol ."
(Dick , 1986) Thiokol engineers found that the temperature was colder than 53 F (12 C) and they did not have enough data and experience to determine if the O-rings Challenger .
In particular , the O-rings in the SRB could not seal the joint when it was very coldn Thiokol this potential failure , their concern did not draw the full attention of the supervisors .
If the supervisors of the company were more alert and far-sighted , they would have reported this concern and stoppedAlthough technological deficiency was behind the failure of the Challengerr , the happening of the accident was just a matter of time .
However , what they would get was precious time , and they would detect the problem and cancel the launch instead of just delaying it .
cancelledhave detectedand with more timeMeanwhile , some engineers at Rockwell International also noticed that a significant amount of ice built up on the fixed service structure that stood beside the shuttle .
These engineers feared that during launch , ice might be shaken loose and harm the challenger's thermal protection tiles .
Likewise , the engineers warned their mangers about this concern , and once again it was neglected .
If still this concern had drawn close attenabout this of the decpitfallakers , the accident would have been prevented .
Some people may argue that the ice beside the shuttle was actually not the cause of the problem , so it would not make a difference even if the launch was delayed and the ice was removed .
Again , this claim was invalid , because more inspections would be conducted and the real problem would be found out with enough care .
To sum up , even though the Challenger was designed with some serious flaw and destined to fail in had builta cold environment , appropriate psychology could still be implemented to prevent the accident from happening , as long as decision of the launch was made with surety and the potential dangers found by the engineers were cleared up .
In the case of the Challenger accident , lack of psychology education was indeed the main cause .
And not just in that case , the use of psychology should always be marked as a necessity in future engineering designs to enhance safety .
The Chernobyl accident in 1986 and Three Mile Island in 1979 have led to serious concerns about the safety of nuclear power plants .
For instance , Sweden is moving out of the nuclear power industry within the next 10 years .
Sweden is even committed by law to phase out its existing nuclear power plants (Fred Guterl , 2002) .
This indicates that the public support has declined in  recent years .
One of the main reasons for the decline is  that the nuclear power plant might cause dangerous consequences when it malfunctions , due to its unstable nature .
Secondly , the amount of radioactive waste emitted by the nuclear power plant is also harmful to the earth , and yet , these nuclear plants release large amounts of highly radioactive compound .
Thirdly , the challenge faced by the countries to isolate the leftover , highly radioactive material discharged by the nuclear power plant is also a main reason why it is in decline .
The wastes produced are required to be isolated from humans and the environment for about 100 ,000 years before it is deemed safe and harmless to humans .
Although nuclear power plant has its disadvantages , it also has its advantages too .
The warming of the Earth is partly due to the emission of carbon dioxide gas from power plants that burn coal , oil or natural gas .
The September 11 attack has also provided valid political reasons for cutting down on the reliance on fossil fuels .
Actually , nuclear power plants emit one hundredth times less greenhouse gases as compared to coal or gas power plants .
The cost of Uranium Ore is a very small portion of the operating cost of a nuclear power plant .
Fourth Generation Nuclear plants can fully utilize all the energy in natural uranium .
The amount of uranium accessible on Earth is able to support fourth generation nuclear power plants for hundreds of centuries .
In short , nuclear power plants are more environmental friendly than coal power plants .
Secondly , coal which is believed to be responsible for more quotidian problems such as acid rain and greenhouse gases emission .
However , wastes emitted by coal powered plants are essentially more radioactive than wastes produced by nuclear power plants (Mara Hvistendahl , 2007) .
In fact , the wastes produced by coal powered plants are 100 times more radioactive than those produced by a nuclear power plant generating similar amounts of energy .
Current Generation III reactors are only able to produce 5% of useful energy in uranium where there are plenty of radioactive leftovers .
The introduction of fourth generation nuclear power plants allows a new way of disposal of nuclear waste .
VHTR not only solves the nuclear waste problem , but its current wastes are a very valuable source of energy to power VHTR as they can burn plutonium , neptunium and other materials that Generation II and III reactors leave behind (Smith , 2009) .
In summary , VHTR will solve the nuclear waste problems if it is implemented as a Generation IV reactor .
"A common theme of future reactors is to make them simpler so there are fewer systems to monitor and fewer systems that could fail ," says Revis James , director of the Energy Technology Assessment Center at the Electric Power Research Institute , an independent power-industry research organization .
Another safety concern is how effectively a nuclear power plant can deal with a terrorist attack .
Generation III reactors are built within a double concealment which will protect the reactor even when the outer layer is penetrated .
Furthermore Generation IV reactors use different fuels and coolants than previous generators .
The new reactors are built to be more efficient in absorbing heat through using better coolants , with improved circulation and larger containment structures .
Lastly , the cost of building nuclear power plants has greatly been reduced over the years .
Current reactors will still be usable for a long time; thus , the construction cost will be spread over the years .
New plants are easier to build and maintain , thus reducing construction cost .
Current Generation III reactors are around $2000 per KW which is lower than $2300 per KW for a coal power plant .
To reiterate , it is not true that nuclear power plants are much more costly than coal power plants .
The opponents thought that it was not worthy to generate electricity by nuclear ethegy because the cost of building nuclearthat of heat enginess will be an astronomical figure .
Although the costbuilding a nuclear power plant is much higher than that of a traditional power plant , some evidence shows that it's possible to reduce the price difference .
First , scientists have been studying how to recycle used nuclear fuel to recover its energy content .
VHTP will use this kind of fuel , thusamount ofing the cost .
Second , research has been done to extend the tenure of use ofis that the reactors can be usedties .
The nuclear facilities of VHTP will be used for about 50 years (the generation 4 international forum , 2002) .
The long life span of equipment helps save cost .
Third , the traditional energy like coal and petroleum are getting moramongpensive because they are non-renewable-resources and will be exhausted one day .
In the contrast with the development of the nuclear technology and application of nuclear energy on a large scale , the efficiency of nuclear reactors will be improved gradually and the price of nuclear energy will decrease .
The above three points prove that it is worth to build VHTRs because it will pay back in the long run .
theythe applicationcontrast ,energy sourcesThrough taking a look at the current energy situation and analyzing the special advantages of VHTR , the Generation 4 nuclear reactor , it wouldld be evident that VHTR concept is advanced and VHTR will gear to actual circumstances .
The three outstanding characters of VHTR are passive safety , high efficiency and having byproduct hydrogen .
These distinctive features are significant in the nuclear industry because they can avoid miserable nuclear accidents , raise the efficiency of nuclear reactor to a new peak and decrease the cost of nuclear industry .
Therefothe use further research and development funding are essential for the VHTR concept .
"Nuclear energy would be dominant source of energy by now if it hadn't been Chernobyl and Three Miles island ."
(Our Energy , 2007) Without the public fear and reluctance to accept nuclear power , the world may now be enjoying  abundant electricity and accelerating economic growth , especially in some developing countries like India and China .
Now , human beings are facing a series of harsh realities: greenhouse emission , depletion of non-renewable resources , increasing thirst for energy .
As expected , every possible ways of generating energy are under research .
However , only nuclear reactors can generate electricity at high efficiency and are viable for a long period of time .
Therefore , it is obvious that nuclear power will be undergoing immense research and development .
Amongst the six most probable concepts at the present stage , the Super-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) is  the most suitable and worth extensive research , after after its properties are compared with those of the other five .
The first issue  is the performance of reactors .
Opponents of SCWR point out that its thermal efficiency is not the highest among the 6 concepts .
To maximize the level of energy output , it seems that the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , which could achieve 50% efficiency level when deployed , is a better choice .
However , it operates under super high temperature of 1000 .
This results in the increase in temperatures of the whole system and the whole area .
Energy is needed to run the cooling machine to maintain the temperature at the safe level .
Furthermore , the disparity between the two reactors (VHTR and SCWR)in terms of efficiency is not huge .
This is attributed to the existing light water reactor technology on the basis of which SCWR is developed .
With modifications , the efficiency can be increased by one third , reaching a high value of at least 44 %( A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy System , 2002 , p . 6) .
On the other hand , the electric efficiency of a conventional thermal power station , considered as saleable energy , is typically 33% to 48%  .
Therefore , SCWR is able to provide a consistently high level of energy output .
In addition , the system does not require steam-water separation , which reduces the flow path of the coolant , water , and subsequently minimizes the heat loss to surroundings .
Hence , it is reasonable to further develop the SCWR system , since its overall performance excels .
Opponents also claim that constructing nuclear power reactors is a huge capital-intensive project , which requires intensive investment of money and research .
After the deployment of a nuclear plant , more funds are needed for insurance coverage , maintenance and labor .
Hence , nuclear energy may not be worth it .
In the case of SCWR , due to the presence of high pressure and possible corrosion , the expenditure on research and maintenance will be high .
However , the other reactors also face challenges that require substantial technological and financial supports .
If the ratio of energy output and all inputs is considered , the rate of return of SCWR is faster than that of the others , not mentioning the low price of the electricity when the design is successful .
Then the traditional oil or coal generators will be disadvantaged because of the rarity of these non-renewable resources .
Moreover , comparing with the other five concepts which use inert gas , liquid compound or metal as coolants , water is much easily accessed and present in relative abundance .
Thus , the manufacturing process of coolant is simpler for SCWR , and thus it is also cheaper .
Also , due to the presence of light water reactors , there is already extensive worldwide experience in constructing and operating this sort of reactor .
This saves a lot of experiments  for scientists .
The experience minimizes the chances of any experimental failure and in turn saves the research funds .
The final design proposes a reduction in the size of the reactor coolant pumps , piping , and associated equipment .
So SCWR is economically favorable .
As mentioned at the beginning of the essay , safety is always the most essential concern in the whole designing process .
Opponents' views are that the very high pressure SCWR requires may pose risks , which is indeed a realistic concern .
However , this potential peril can be avoided by testing and choosing suitable materials which can withstand huge pressure and corrosion .
Consequently , they help prevent formation of cracks or explosion .
Furthermore , the proposed design of SCWR is much less sophisticated than the present reactors .
It is greatly simplified after discarding  the step of steam-water conversion .
It reduces the probability of making mistakes and the level of seriousness of accidents .
In fact , the safety measures are executed to the maximum for every design .
It is hardly possible , as what many nuclear research associations have asserted , to have a second Chernobyl incident .
Another advantage of SCWR is that waste generation is optional .
This feature limited the extent of its nuclear pollution which leads to health problems like birth defects .
Hence , although there are inevitable risks that we have to bear for every type of design , we can still choose appropriately the one that can minimize those risks .
In conclusion , SCWR reactor excels in  performance , cost and safety .
Its advantages make it the suitable one to help the world transit into a new era of energy .
As nuclear energy is taking over the world , the development on SCWR will be the stepping stone and will lead us to a "new dawn" .
Nuclear reactor produces a large amount of energy relative to the average fossil fuel combustion .
The amount of nuclear energy given off is huge in a typical nuclear reaction , amounting to an average of 3 .4 thousand billion joules per kilogram of fuel , which is about one hundred thousand texpressing much energy as the combustion of fuel (Gene Smith , 1999) .
With human population risihaveat an exponential rate , peaking at an estimaared 9 .1 billion in 2050 , energy consumption is too expected to rise proportionally .
Nuclear is definitely a viable option that can meet this demand .
Nuclear energy can be utilized to relieve the world's demand for depleting fossil fuel .
Fossil fuel is the main source of energy worldwide , contributing up to 95 percent of world's energy demands (David Johnston , 2008) .
As this natural resource is being used up at an approximated rate of 6 .2 billion tons annually , it is calculated to last for a maximum of four more decades (Bob Williamson , 2009) .
In addition , burning of these fuels emits harmful greenhouse gases such ais , too ,on dioxide and nitrogen dioxide , wNuclear energythe nuclear technology is clean and green .
It is clear that nuclear technology is the best alternative to the current fossil consumption as it produces a relative larger amountmanyenergy .
It is also able to meet the increasing demand for energy consumption , without the expense of the environmhave .
In a long run , nuclear techaregy is definitely going to be more efficient and beneficial to the society .
Even though it may be costly as extensive research has to be carried out and expensive construction is required , the benefits and advantages will definitely outweigh this hefty price .
Importantly , global issues such as greenhouse effect and deplekeep non-renewable resources are being addressed and can be solved .
Although nuclear technology has a few disadvantages , many changes had been proposed to minimize them .
As we know that we have a technology gap between now and the proposed Generation IV reactors , it is important that research commences as soon as possible so that implementation of nuclear technology will not be distant .

With the global growth in population and economy , energies needed for either manufacturing industries or home appliances are increasing; hence , developing nuclear power becomes an important issue .
Nuclear power is a power obtained from controlled nuclear reactions in a nuclear reactor; generally electricity can be produced after the reaction as the output power .
Among the six generation IV reactors , compared to other similar reactors which are able to generate both electricity and hydrogen power , the Lead-cooled fast reactor requires relatively lower temperature and lower pressure with the support of recycling of the waste .
Although a large scale of energy can be obtained by generating nuclear power , there are critical voices over the use of it in terms of safety concerns and environmental pollutions .
However , there are solutions provided to avoid nuclear accidents and in fact nuclear energy does not contribute any pollution .
Hence , nuclear energy is definitely a safe and reasonable approach to solve the problem of producing enough energy for both the present and the future needs .
Firstly , the critics claim that the operation of nuclear plant is dangerous because of the only one accident which happened in Chernobyl in history .
The radioactivity escaped from one overheated core into the atmosphere , and caused 28 people to die , 134 people to fall sick and about 70 cases of thyroid cancer in children .
However , such an accident will not happen again .
That is because nowadays all nuclear reactors that are currently in operation worldwide are placed inside a containment building .
Unfortunately , the reactor in Chernobyl was not in such an infrastructure .
The containment building helps to keep the radiation inside in the case of a faulty operation of the reactor .
Its ability to prevent the leak of radiation was proved in 1979 , during the reactor core meltdown at the Three Mile Island .
It should have caused major impact to people living there , but in fact , no injuries or deaths occurred because of the presence of the containment building .
( Donald W . Miller ,2004) .
As far as accidents are concerned , coal mining is more dangerous , as 100 miners die in mining per year in the U .S and another 100 die in transporting  .
Secondly , from an environmental standpoint , the opposing views think that the life-cycle emissions of the nuclear energy are  great pollutants .
However , several analyses have shown that the life-cycle emissions are far less than those of coal or natural gas-fired power plants (Nuclear Energy: A key tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions , n . d) .
Furthermore , in fact 15% electricity which is generated by nuclear power globally greatly reduces the amounts of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere every year by 2 .1 billion tonnes (Position Paper , n .d) .
And the nuclear plants emit hardly any key agents for acid rain and photochemical air pollution , the sulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxides .
About 4 .8 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 2 .6 million tonnes of nitrogen oxides are avoided each year in European countries (Position Paper , n .d) .
Thirdly , people oppose the development of nuclear power due to the problem of long term radiation influence caused by nuclear wastes .
However , it is not an issue that could not be solved .
Several physicists in Germany claim to have found out a way to speed up the decay process of radioactive waste on timescales of a few tens of years and make it harmless .
The technique could avoid burying the waste in deep repositories , which may cost a lot for the government .
(Physics World , July 31 2006) .
The same goes for the discovery of Nuclear Solution Inc . Its president and CEO Dr . Paul M . Brown claims that they have a technology to make the nuclear waste a safe energy by burning it .
(Spirit of Ma'at Online Magazine Feb 2002) .The six generation lead-cool fast reactor also provides a function of waste recycling to handle the waste; this will again ease the work of disposing the waste (Butler .
D ,2004) .
To sum up , nuclear energy is safe to develop and use with the continuing evolution of  nuclear plants and reactors , and it is also an emission- free energy source which can significantly reduce carbon dioxide gas and acid rains .
The waste produced by it can be recycled and reused to reduce the radiation influence to the environment and our society; as a result , cost will be also reduced on the whole .
In conclusion , in my opinion nuclear energy can be used to solve the problem of increasing energy demand in various industries , because it is safe to both human beings and the environment , and it is capable to provide relatively larger amounts of energy than other sources .
Design , as Wilpert (2007) defines , is a human activity that produces something in the future which does not currently exist .
The most fundamental pursuit of any design is the guarantee of the product to be usable , functional , safe and competent .
For many cases , safety is the most important aspect of a product , since it may be connected with countless lives .
On the morning of June 3 , 1998 , a tragic train accident happened in a small town in Germany .
The passengers on the fast travelling Inter City Express were comfortably enjoying the journey when they felt an unusual shaking sensation .
After a while , the whole train was pulled away from the railway and the bridge , bringing the road down onto itself .
(Eschede , n .d .) The tragedy happened just like that .
When people try to analyze the causes of the train accident , many believed that the use of psychology during the process of design could have prevented it .
(Wilpert , 2007) They claim that human actions , which are tightly related to psychology , play a major role in the process of design .
However , some people oppose this argument .
In their point of view , psychology is not the deciding factor in the design process , and it is certainly not only the design process that contributes to the accident .
As far as I am concerned , the use of psychology may help prevent the tragedy , but it's far from enough .
Rather , developing high technology and taking proper safety precaution when an accident happens are more important .
Design engineers can make mistakes .
Their design errors eventually would result in the malfunction of the products , thus causing accidents .
Some people accuse that the design engineers of ICE didn't handle the safety design of the train in a careful way .
They claim that the engineers were being unprofessional (Eschede , n .d .) , because the engineers were concerned more about the interior facilities of the train .
According to them , the facilities of ICE trains are second to none .
Passengers could enjoy the radio , the newspaper as well as refreshment , including wonderful meals provided from the luxurious dining car .
The design engineers were said to put so much effort into these trivial factors rather than safety issues .
On the other hand , some people defend the engineers .
They believe that the engineers should not take the responsibilities and be blamed for the accident .
Germany adopted high speed trains and made some changes to them .
Soon , ICE were travelling across the whole Germany and were favored by passengers .
It is not wrong if the engineers decided to make the train more comfortable and attractive .
In fact , over the years ICE expanded throughout Germany , and the safety record was perfect .
(NASA , 2007) What went wrong when the train accident happened would rather be the construction and the maintenance of the track and the bridge .
The maintenance of the track was poorly done , as well as the maintenance of the bridge .
They were unprotected by any form of crash barrier .
(Eschede , n .d .) If only the work had been done well , countless lives would have been saved .
Some people always claim that engineers tend to focus on component failures , but they lack the understanding of the breakdown of the whole system .
Moreover , they blame the design engineers for not coming up with the plans against system breakdown .
In other words , they did not take the safety issues into account when they were designing the train .
(Wilpert , 2007) However , some people argue , it is not fair to the engineers .
The train , ICE , did have an adequate protection system as well as a warning system .
Actually , the tragedy can be attributed to the flawed emergency operation procedures instead .
(NASA , 2007) Passengers would have pulled the emergency break to stop the train as soon as they witnessed the wheel failure .
This is the key reason why the accident was so serious .
In fact , one passenger sensed something was wrong , and tried to remind the driver of the hazard .
The driver , nevertheless , chose to ignore the report until it was too late .
(NASA , 2007) One way and the best way to prevent the accident may be taking the appropriate safety precaution and applying correct methods to deal with the accident .
Many people believe that the use of heritage also contributed to the accident .
(NASA , 2007) The ICE engineers just followed whatever had already been designed , neglecting the current situation .
In addition , ICE was insufficiently tested before it was put into use .
However , it was not the case at all , according to others .
Technology at that time limited the designing of ICE , thus causing the design failure .
If high technology had been used , and sufficient testing was performed , the accident would have been avoided .
(Eschede , n .d .)
fuelpart of the expensescompensate forWith the demand for energy increasing , it is urgent to find an economy and efficient energy source .
Nuclear power is inevitably becoming one of the most important supplies .
As a generation IV reactor , the molten salt reactor has outstanding safety advanteconomicalboth reactor and reprocessing , and it is profitable in a long run .
Hence , it will be reasonable and wise to support the research .
As the developing countries are building more factories and cities throughout the years , the global energy consumption is rapidly increasing over the years .
This is a concern as at the rate countries are consuming energy it is a matter of time before the earth runs out of natural resources .
The alternative way to generate electricity is the use of nuclear technology according to Butler ,D .
Countries are spending a large amount of money to develop the Generation IV reactors to meet the demand of energy consumption .
There is a need for this development as currently nuclear reactors are not that safe and efficient .
The objectives of Generation IV reactors are to improve safety features , minimise waste output and  decrease the construction and operating cost of nuclear reactors .
The VHTR (Very High Temperature Reactor) and (MSR) Molten Salt reactor are Generation IV reactors currently under development .
Although there are many risk hazards involving the VHTR , it is still one of the most promising models , and many countries are keen on adopting this model as the future reactor .
(Ogawa ,M .
and Lensa , W .V .)
One of the most practical issues of concern is the cost .
All countries want to build reactors that are cheap in cost and that are efficient in producing electricity and hydrogen gases .
For the VHTR Model when compared to the MSR , the construction of the plant is costly and takes up a relatively large space .
The construction of the plant is costly as it requires materials that can withstand the extreme heat and corrosive operating condition of the reactor .
The molten salt is preferred as its operation system is less complicated which means that it is cheaper to construct and it does not need to run on very high temperature or pressure .
However , in terms of the overall development cost , the Very High temperature reactor is still much cheaper than the Molten Salt reactor .
The cost is 679 million dollars compared to the 1000 million required by the MSR (NERAC) .
This is so as the VHTR is simply the upgrading of existing high temperature reactors while the MSR is a relatively new technology .
Hence VHTR needs less testing and less time to develop whereas extensive testing is required for the MSR .
In terms of efficiency , there is criticism regarding its high fuel burn up and the need to periodically change the graphite core .
The initial design of the VHTR also does not allow the system to produce electricity directly as modifications are required to be made to the plant to achieve generation of electricity .
In comparison , the MSR is considered a better choice as it is safer to operate at lower pressures and temperatures .
The efficiency of the MSR will improve in the near future as scientists are working to increase the output of hydrogen and electricity (NERAC) .
Despite the negative points of the VHTR , it is still way ahead of the MSR and all other generation IV models , as only VHR has an efficiency of more than fifty percent .
Not only does it produce more electricity , but the high temperature generated is actually not useless .
The extreme heat produced can be used for heat application process such as the petrochemical industries (Billot ,P .
and Barbier , D) .
The final issue brought up by people opposing the usage of VHTR is related to the safety aspect of the system .
This is due to the fact that the VHTR runs on very high temperatures and it will have a higher chance of failure  .
The isolation of the reactor when failure occurs is another issue being widely debated .
For VHTR  safety  is maintained manually by safety officers and it is not  reliable as humans will make mistakes .
Then for  MSR about 200 million dollars have been spent on safety testing .
Since the safety of the system is tested intensively , it is unforgivable if failure occurs .
Although the safety aspect is being widely debated , the safety feature of VHTR is improving with time (INL) .
In conclusion ,  VHTR is still one of the better choices when compared to  MSR .
This is so as it will be ready by the year 2025 , five years earlier than  MSR .
With the operation of  VHTR five years ahead , the revenue generated by  VHR will provide more funds for further research and improvement .
Then in term of efficiency it is ahead of  MSR and there is no guarantee that after intensive research the efficiency will improve .
Hence VHTR has the potential to be the main provider of electricity in the future .
With the fast development of high-technology , more energy is needed both for industrial use and for home use .
Nuclear energy as a more efficient method to produce electricity attracts many scientists' attention .
In 2000 , The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) , an international cooperative project representing governments of 13 countries , was initiated .
Scientists from these countries cooperate to develop the next generation of nuclear technology , the Generation IV Nuclear Reactor (World Nuclear Association , 2008) .
Six concepts are put forward .
William Magwood (2004) , chairman of GIF's board , predicts that no more than three of these six concepts will become research prototypes and be put into practice .
In my point of view , among all the six reactors , the Sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) is the one that should be chosen as one of the prototypes .
The generation IV SFR is a new concept which is safe not only when it operates during electric production , but also when it meets the problem of nuclear weapons and the terrorism attack .
Moreover , by now the research on reducing the cost of this reactor has received significant achievement and the research is still undergoing .
Scientists are still looking forward to more research findings in the coming years .
Many people think that compared with traditional ways of producing electricity , using nuclear reactors is not safe .
In fact ,  SFR is a very safe nuclear reactor operating under low pressures and low temperatures .
The operating temperatures of  SFR range from 500 to 550 , one of the two reactors with the lowest temperatures among all the six together  .
Moreover the sodium-cooled technique has been in use since  1951 .
"It builds on more than 300 reactor-years experienced with sodium-cooled fast neutron reactors over five decades and in eight countries (World nuclear association , 2008)" .
Scientists from Japan have also been concerned about the chemical reaction between sodium and water .
They add double-wall piping to their Japanese sodium-cooled fast reactor (JSFR) to improve the security of the reactor .
Nuclear weapon and terrorism are always sensitive topics to both governments and ordinary people .
Because the waste of the nuclear reactor can be used by terrorists to produce nuclear weapons , many people doubt whether it can provide true safety if scientists can only promise that the reactor is safe during the operation .
However , this is not a problem for SRF .
The new design for SRF is likely to have all the neutron action in the core .
That is to say "the new processing technologies will enable the fuel to be recycled without separating the plutonium (World Nuclear Association , 2008)" .
In this case , the waste will all be recycled in the reactor and terrorists will not get a chance to reach the nuclear raw materials .
Closing the nuclear fuel cycle through the use of advanced reprocessing and fast reactor technologies is a good way to improve the security of the reactor and avoid duplication of effort at the same time .
Opponents say that comparing with the other five generation IV reactors , the cost of the SFR is relatively high .
Yes , this is a drawback of the SFR; however , scientists are working hard on it to find out the way to reduce the capital cost of the SFR and they have already made some achievements .
On November 27-28 , 2006 , Mr . Kazuo Mukai , from the Advanced Nuclear System Research and Development Directorate Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) , had an international seminar on "Coolants and Innovative Reactor Technologies" in Cadarache , which is a research center for nuclear energy in France .
In this seminar he talked about the JSFR and the achievements Japanese scientists had made to reduce the cost of the SFR .
Kazuo (2006) said that by adopting high chromium steel with higher strength and lower thermal expansion , the capacity of the heat exchangers  and the flow rate in the pipe got enlarged , so that the piping could be shortened and the loop number also got reduced .
In this way , the capital cost of the SFR was reduced .
This is just an example of the  achievements .
The research is still ongoing and scientists have confidence that they will have more findings in the future .
According to The U .S . Department of Energy (DOE) , the sodium-cooled fast reactor technology is one of the most advanced nuclear technologies being researched to date and could potentially be used as an advanced recycling reactor ("U .S . , France" , 2008) .
With the participation of the experts from 13 countries , more achievements will be received during the next decade .
The advanced technology of the SFR will benefit people all around the world in the not too distant future .
Opponents claim that asishuman being , we make mistakes and it canthat has ever happenedd .
I agree to the point that human can make mistakes .
However , it does not mean that mistakes cannot be avoided .
This includes the mistakes made by the Chernobyl nuclear plant operators .
They did not request to maintain the power which caused it to run down rapidly until it was below the permitted safety level (Onisawa and Nishnuclear power1988) .
This mistake was actually unnecessary since this was not their first time doing the safety test .
The problem lies on the behavior of the plant operators .
They took light of their task since for them this was jufety test .
They did not have any sense of responsibility and were not aware of the consequences if anything went wrong .
Therefore , during the design process , these plant operators are supposed to be 'designed' as well .
They should be given the required knowledge and should also be warned about the worst thing that may happen if they make even a simple mistake .
In this way , they will be more careful in doing their task and as a result able to avoid making mistakes .
Opponents also state that nuclear power is indeed dangerous for that reason , it is impossible not to have achumanst while working with it .
Accident is a situation when there is a failure in the interaction between man and machine (Stoop , 1995) .
Therefore , even though nuclear power is certainly dangerous , it can still be safe to work with as long as the interaction between man and machine is designed carefully so that it will not fail .
Again , this shows the importance of considering psychological factors in design process .
Most of tin times , while designing a system , engineers are likely to overestimate the ability of the user (Wilpert , 2007) .
As a result , most users are not able to properly use the equipments .
In the case of Chernobyl , the plant operators failed to make the right decision which then caused the reactor to explode .
Instead of following the safety procedure , the plant operators even blocked the reactor's protection system (making it impossible for automatic shut down) in order to keep the test running (Onisawa and Nishiwaki , 1988) .
If the plawill as a result be ablee familiar with the system and the procedure , they would have known which one was more important and would definitely have prioritized safety rather than keeping the test running .
Thus , in designing a system engineers alone are not enough .
making automatic shut down impossibleThe final argument proposewhile nuclear power is indeed dangerous for that reason ,humans who can make mistakes jaccidents engineers .
Hence , even An accidentir help mistakes are still inevitable .
The point of involving psychologists in the design process is not because they are better than engineers .
It is rather to balance the engineers' point of view which is usually machine-centered .
Since man and machines are equally important to achieve safety in design , psychologists' role is to concern about the human resources which are usually neglectetimeengineers .
If both machines and man are well designed , safety will definitely improve and the possibility of accidents will be reduced .
menbe concernedIn conclusion , carefully designing a system's safety is useless unless psychological factors are also considered .
Without considering psychological factors , there is a big possibility that there will be a bad interaction between man and machine which will then results in an accident such as Chernobyl's .
Therefore , psychological factors play an important role in reducing the possibilmen of accident as well as improving the system's safety .
The world has been searching for different sources of energy to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels .
In some countries , they have turned to nuclear power .
Despite producing less carbon footprints , nuclear power is a relatively dangerous source of energy .
One unmistakable example is the 1986 Chernobyl disaster .
Some psychologists have wondered whether the the use of psychology in the design process would have prevented the accident .
While opponents reasoned that there is no distinctive link between psychology and engineering design process , the use of psychology could theoretically have prevented the accident through its intervention in the controls and the safety mechanisms design .
Also , use of psychology could counter the underestimation of the number of errors that will form inevitably .
Opponents argue that  psychology would not be useful as the chief cause for the accident is the lack of knowledge of the operators .
According to Rich(1986) , the accident was the fault of not complying with strict operating regulations governed by the reactor designers .
However , one way of how psychology could have averted the accident is that the designers could have anticipated that the operators might not understand the physics behind the reactor .
They might have been trained to operate even though they do not understand the principles behind it .
The design could have incorporated automated controls to reduce the number of errors that could be made .
Leptak(2009) suggests that to maintain a safe operation , there should be fewer autonomous control and more 'redundant automated safety interlocks' .
This is to prohibit safety controls from being bypassed .
This could prove to be an essential part of the design as Stellman(1998) provides evidence that the chief engineer involved actually approved the shutting down of the Emergency Cooling System .
This move compromised the safety of the plant .
Thus , psychology could have indeed changed the reactor plant to a vastly safer environment .
On the other hand , other opponents blame the heavy politico-military factors attached to the Chernobyl reactors .
In Chernobyl(2006) , the writer points out that the reactors were designed and adapted for the production of plutonium for military businesses .
This dual function could have compromised safety of the reactor .
Psychology or the employment of psychologists to assist in the design process would thus be futile .
However , this may not be the case .
Psychology understands that almost every action has a causal history which leads up to the root of the problem .
This concept is evident when accounts of the accident revealed that the operator indifferently disregarded safety protocols .
In fact , Stang(1996) notes that running the reactors at low operating standards was commonplace .
Hence , designers  could have brought in psychologists to evaluate the design to inhibit such unauthorized practices and to ensure the safety standards are kept high .
In short , the use of psychology could have been used to uphold the safety of the reactors and hence might have prevented the accident .
In contrast , other opponents may argue that the design process is beyond the domain of psychologists .
Instead , only the designer and the engineers have the expertise to partake in the design process .
However , this perception could be wrong as designers make human errors .
Psychology could be used to minimize these errors .
According to Wilpert(2007) , the design process encompasses both social science and  engineering .
In Reason(2000)'s article , he notices a distinctive element that separates high reliability organizations from others .
This element is the consensual agreement that errors can occur anywhere and every stage  should be treated meticulously .
Stang and Liptak have deduced that the designers involved in the Chernobyl reactor did not understand certain aspects of the reactor .
This implies that the design was not given scrupulous care .
Therefore , psychology could be used in the design process and could perhaps have minimized the possibilities of accidents .
To sum up , the use of psychology could have been used in some phases of the design process .
Psychology could have helped in automating several safety controls , improving safety and enhancing the reliability of the reactor design .
Though the use of psychology could have aided the design process in these three areas , whether the use of psychology would have prevented the accident is really hard to say .
Many factors contribute to the accident .
However , current reactor designers should take the Chernobyl accident as a valuable lesson and do their utmost efforts to prevent such painful and costly incidents from happening again .
Since the introduction of nuclear-powered generators , public opposition is one of the reasons why only limited nuclear reactors have been built in the past .
The public is against the idea of constructing nuclear reactors because they are concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Their concern arises because of a few incidents that have happened in the past which includes a partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and also the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , where the reactor core exploded and caused the death of 31 people and spewed radioactive debris across Europe (Butler , 2004) .
However , I believe that previews of the nuclear reactors should not influence the decision to fund the research and development of the generation IV reactors as people will be more careful not to let the same incidents happen again with the advancement in technology .
Therefore , I feel that generation IV reactors such as the Supercritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) should be funded for their research and development .
Nevertheless , the first reason that the public is concerned over the funding of generation IV nuclear reactors is that the nuclear reactors will not reduce  greenhouse-gas emissions as compared to natural gas and oil use (Nature , 2008) .
However , this is not the case as there are countries constructing nuclear reactors because they can indeed improve the environment .
For example , reducing greenhouse-gas emissions is the main reason for the endorsement of the construction of nuclear reactors by the UK government (Nature , 2008) .
Furthermore , according to Butler (2004) , the SCWR does not emit carbon dioxide , which is a greenhouse-gas that is soaring because of natural gas and oil generated power plants .
Therefore , such generation IV reactors will certainly improve the environment and should be funded for their research and development .
Another concern from the public opposition is that nuclear reactors should not be used in medical research because they pose a danger to the people using nuclear power for their medical researches .
According to Ruth (2009) , medical isotopes used in  cancer research can be supplied using accelerators instead of nuclear reactors as using accelerators is a safer and cheaper method .
However , nuclear reactors should continue to be used to supply  medical isotopes as they can produce  isotopes much faster than  accelerators .
Furthermore , the idea of accelerators to supply  medical isotopes has still not been put to practical use as they still require further research and development unlike  nuclear reactors , which have already been vastly used in medical researches .
This can be shown as many researchers were lamenting on the shutdown of the nuclear reactor located in chalk river , Ontario , and their medical research had to be put to a halt (Nature , 2008) .
Therefore , generation IV reactors will be more stable to maintain the medical research process and should be funded for their research and development .
The last concern from the public opposition is that nuclear reactors are not safe enough to be built as they are under-designed for earthquakes as the earthquake in Japan killed at least 9 , injured 1000 , caused the evacuation of further 10 ,000 people , sparked a fire and caused radiation- contaminated water from the nuclear reactor to spill into the sea (Nature , 2007) .
However , damages done from an earthquake on a nuclear reactor is inevitable no matter how well a building is designed and such damages done are already considered very minimal even though the nuclear reactor in Japan was under-designed to deal with an earthquake of magnitude 6 .8 .
Furthermore , due to technology advancement , the new generation IV reactors are designed to deal with an earthquake of magnitude 8 .0 (Nature , 2007) .
Therefore , the concern of the public opposition over nuclear reactors which are under-designed for earthquakes is unnecessary because the generation IV reactors are strong enough to handle tough conditions already .
To wrap up , I believe that the new generation IV reactors such as SCWR are nothing like their previous generation of nuclear reactors because technology is constantly improving each day to make the nuclear reactors safer to be built .
Thus , the public opposition should look at the new generation IV reactors in a different light and not just be based on some of the incidents that  happened in the past .
There is no denying that nuclear energy is a dangerous source of energy and an example is the Chernobyl accident in 1986 .
It was caused by an error during a safety test and resulted in over 4 ,000 deaths and many more may die due to the radiation from the accident (Nature 2006) .
In recent years , there are also fears that nuclear reactors may be the targets of terrorist attacks .
As a result , the public has been reluctant about the use of nuclear power as a source of energy .
Nonetheless , there are still over 400 nuclear reactors around the world which make up for 17% of the world's electrical consummation (Butler , 2004) .
All of these reactors have improved safety precautions and higher security levels to ensure the safety of the public .
In addition , the new SFR will be equipped with a better coolant system to prevent a reactor meltdown and stronger containment structures to guard against terrorist attacks (Smith , 2009) .
Out of the six generation IV reactors , SFR is expected to be the first reactor to be developed .
Therefore , we can tap on the use of safer nuclear energy earlier .
This is mainly thanks to the fact that sodium-cooled reactors are already in operation in Japan and Russia (US DOE NERAC/GIF 2002) .
Thus , less research will be required for  SFR , which also means that the research cost will be reduced .
Furthermore , by choosing the SFR's proven method of cooling the nuclear core , it removes the uncertainties of using new and untested technologies which are present in the other reactors .
SFR is also chosen by the United States as their front runner for generation IV fast reactors due to its strong technology basis (US DOE/NE 2006) .
On top of its technological readiness ,  SFR is designed for high efficiency as well .
It recycles nuclear fuel through a process whereby a group of chemical elements called actinides are produced .
Plutonium is also included in this group and it can be used for the production of nuclear weapons .
Therefore , to ensure the nuclear non-proliferation ,  SFR is designed such that  plutonium cannot be extracted from the nuclear core .
Furthermore , 99 .9% of the actinides will be recycled again .
SFR will also be using spent thermal reactor fuel from other older nuclear reactors as its initial fuel (US DOE NERAC/GIF 2002) .
All these designs will lead to a more efficient usage of the nuclear fuel and  also help solve the current problem of the disposal of nuclear wastes .
The truth is , we will one day run out of fossil fuels; hence , we must plan ahead and look for other sources of energy .
And despite its risks , nuclear energy has its significant benefits as well .
Nuclear power plants may be hazardous , but the new SFR boosts many new safeguards .
It also allows us to utilize more capable generation IV reactors sooner and helps reduce the amount of nuclear wastes .
Therefore , governments should continue to fund these nuclear research projects so as to ensure that we can continue with our way of life even after our fossil fuels run out .
nuclear power has been a controversial issue ever since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II .
Over the years , Nuclear power has evolved with the help of technological advancement .
Today , scientists have gone step further in developing what we know as the Fourth Generation Reactors .
Out of the six new reactors , Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is the most favorable .
It is known for being more environmental friendly and less hazardous .
Nuclear power is encompassed by four main factors .
These factors are economic benefits , security , safety and effects on the environment .
Firstly , the cost of operating  a VHTR is truly subjective .
Some may feel that the costs are too high .
According to a survey done by researchers from the Keystone Center , the cost of building a new reactor varied from $3600 to $4600 per installed kW and the operating cost would be about 30 cents per kWh (Benjamin , 2008) .
Naturally , The public would have an impression that VHTR would be much more expensive , compared to renewable energy such as solar and wind .
However , this is not the case .
VHTR will be cheaper as cost incurred on transportation of nuclear waste is redundant .
This is because the nuclear waste goes directly to a respiratory which is located within the nuclear plant (Clayton 2009) .
Furthermore , VHTR produces cheaper energy compared to solar and wind energy .
Barry (2009) cites that the capital cost of building a solar plant is 25 times more than that of building a plant and the land area a solar plant occupies is 400 times more than that of a nuclear plant .
With cheaper energy , more people are able to afford electricity .
Countries going through industrialization will also benefit from the cheap energy .
In addition , building  VHTR will boost the economy as it creates job opportunities in the areas surrounding the power plant .
Secondly , ever since the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 , the world has heightened global security against terrorism .
Nuclear plants have become prime targets of terrorists .
This is because the plutonium waste that the nuclear reactor produces are ingredients for making nuclear weapons .
Hence , security of nuclear plants is strengthened as well to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons .
If nuclear weapons were to fall in the hands of terrorists , it would pose a great threat to the safety of the public .
However in VHTR , plutonium is spiked with heat producing and radioactive elements (Butler , 2004) .
These elements cause the plutonium waste to increase in temperature such that it is too hot to handle and therefore prevent anyone from stealing it .
Hence , the public does not need to worry about nuclear waste falling in the hands of the terrorists .
Thirdly , safety of the employees working at the nuclear plant and the residents near the plant has to be taken into consideration .
The VHTR is actually an evolution from the present High Temperature-grouped reactor (HTGR) .
In  VHTR , heat resistant materials are used to build the nuclear reactor so that the heat is carefully contained .
Moreover , the heat produced during the processing of uranium is used for hydrogen production and desalinization (Very High Temperature Reactor , n .d .) .
Also radioactive leakage is prevented with the use of corrosion resistant materials .
For example , helium is used as a cooling agent in VHTR as helium is an inert gas and does not provide any hazardous effect .
Finally , as global warming becomes more perilous , governments and several communities are placing greater emphasis on being environmental friendly .
The main environmental concern is the disposal of radioactive wastes .
It is known that these radioactive wastes have very long shelf life and will not decay until a few hundred years later .
Most importantly , the radioactive emission is harmful to human body .
However , in VHTR , an additional processing step is taken to shorten the life span of the wastes and these wastes are carefully contained .
In addition , VHTR produces less nuclear wastes .
This means that there will be minimal chance of weapon proliferation and reduced pollution to the environment .
Compared to  solar plants , nuclear plants actually produce less carbon dioxide .
Barry (2009) writes that solar plants produce 25 times more carbon dioxide than nuclear plants .
In conclusion , VHTR is much safer , more environmental friendly , more efficient and  much cheaper .
Hence , we should abandon those pessimistic views on nuclear power and embrace this new source of energy .
With memories of the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Tagoe Mile Iclean , Pennsylvania ,According to Butler (2004) ,nobyl in Ukraine , during which the reactordioxide .
Withilling some 31 peo immediately gases spewing radioactive debris across Europe , the public consider nuclear reactors as someting extremely dangerous and imperils their lives .
However , sodiuproduce aooled feactors are rather safe because they can reactthe use of nuclear energy is not without opposing voicesof 550 degrees in contrast with the above 700 degrees of other reactors; it also reacts under low pressure .
The low temperature and pressure lower the demands of the equipment and the conditions of the reaction; as a result , the reactor becomes safer .
Besides , in order to mahigheaction safer , in Jfunding for its further research and development .o prevent the chemical reactions of sodium itself and the leak of sodium by using double-wall piping method , high reliable equipment with double-wall tube and sensitive leak detector .
Thereby , sodium-cooled fast reactors are very safe and also safer than the other reactors in the fourth generation .
Some pacifists are sceptical about the safety of nuclear energy also because that reprocessing nuclear waste is controversial as it separates out plutonium , a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons .
Besides , they are worried about that nuclear reactors would become a terrorist target because of the radioactive waste .
Neverthengs won't happen in sodium-cooled fast reactors , because the reaction is within the core and the recycling is closed which means the recycling is not separated out .
for a result , the percentage of plutonium in the waste is reduced effectively .
pressure requirements the reprocessing can cut the final amount of waste proforced .
Moreover , the systems based on mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel are primarily under developmenthe engineers in Japanreferred recycle option is an advanced aqueous process; and metal-fuel cycle systems are under development in the United States which use highlyroprocessing recycle as the preferred fuel cycle option .
As a consequenThereforeple do not need to worry about the radioactive waste during the producing .
Except the problem of the safety , the second one is the cost .
Thst of nuc reactors which consists of the construction cost , operating cost and decommissioning cost are very high .
It is the fact that several billion dollarneeded to get a nuclear reactor going and tclosed ,ium-cooled fast reactors are even more expensive than other ones .
However , in order to make the nuclear energy more powerful and safer , the money spent is worthy .
Seen the value of the sodium-cooled fast reactors , many countries are investing in the sodium-cooled fast reactors .
Meanwhile , many engineers are looking for the methods to cut the cost of nuclear reactors .
New plants are designed to be much simpler and quicker to build , reducing financing costs by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars .
In details , the cost can be reduced by reducing the refuelling outages' number , compacting the reactor vessel , sampling the vessel internals , reducing the loop number , shortening the pipes , integrating the primary components and so on .
Thus , we should believe in the bright futureproductioneducing of the sodium-cooled fast reactors' cost .
the cost-effective sodium-cooled fast reactorsthe number of refuelling outagesSpecificallyBesidesr energy , the mopowerful another problemworld , will attraccostsre and more research and develop further and further .
As one of the fourth generation of nuclear reactors , sodium-cooSeveraln advantages .
It has more factors of safety and it is now under further improvement in many developed countries .
Briefly , sthe other-cooled fast reactors are with brilliant prospects and the public do not need to be much concerned aboutHaving seen safety .
Nuclear power plants across the globe are producing about 16 percent of the world's electricity .
However , no nuclear reactors have been built for the past 30 years .
This was partly due to the 1979 incident at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania where a partial reactor meltdown occurred , and the 1986 incident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , where the reactor core exploded , which resulted in casualties and spewing harmful debris across Europe (Butler , 2004) .
This was the result of inadequately trained personnel operating a flawed reactor design without proper regard for safety .
However , the fourth generation nuclear reactors can broaden the opportunities of nuclear energy for use .
Also , the new reactors are designed with the following objectives in mind: economic competitiveness , enhanced safety , minimal radioactive waste generation and proliferation resistance .
In particular , the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) are outstanding in safety , cost and performance; but the SFR has more benefits than the VHTR .
SFR uses liquid sodium as coolant to lower coolant volume fractionre outlet temperature to approximately 600 C (Roglans , et al 2002) .
As for VHTR , it produces both electricity and hydrogen from only heat and water by applying the steam reformer technology .
This way ,the temperaturee at the core outlets can reach more than 1000 C (Corwin , 2003) .
So , this design is significantly more thermally efficient as its reactor core is able to withstand higher temperature (VHTR's 1000 C to SFR's 600 C) .
It n be therefore be used as a significant source of electrical power and hydrogen generation or as a heat source .
Furthermore , helium is used as the coolant in the VHTR system .
Not only is it advantageous to sodium because it can be subjected to high temperature , it is also efficient in the transfer of thermal energy .
Helium will not become radioactive and will not react with other materials .
Therefore in my opinion , VHTR is rated better  in terms of physical protection and performance as compared to SFR .
Safety is another major concern about nuclear power .
The main safety concern has always been the possibility of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material , leading to contamination and consequent radiation exposure off-site (Lacy , 2009) .
Active and passive safeguard features against accidents are to be carefully considered .
To reduce the probability of radioactive elements leaking to the atmosphere  , there must be an emphasis on the human factors pertaining to plant operations .
VHTR employs the method of burying waste into the floor bed of deep oceans in the middle of inactive oceanic tectonic plates .
However , geologists and biologists have expressed concern .
They do not believe this idea of seabed disposal will work .
Even with deep trenches used , it is possible that life forms living in them would bring back the still harmful nuclear waste back into contact with other life forms .
Also , it might be very difficult to safely recover the waste once it has been placed in the seabed .
As this is not the case for SFR , it is rated higher in terms of waste disposal .
SFR is designed for management of high-level wastes .
The systems increase performance requirements by employing a fully closed fuel cycle to reduce repository space (Lineberry , et al) .
This is considered a very effective actinide management strategy .
Next , the cost of new reactors must be competitive in a changing market place of energy demand .
Nuclear energy has to be economically comparable to other energy sources in order for it to be a competitive energy source .
Nuclear energy plants need to be modular or with standardized technical specifications so that plant parts can be duplicated and replaced .
This would be more economical than if each plant is uniquely designed .
As is the case for both the reactor and the fuel cycle , technology development to achieve cost competitiveness is necessary .
A key issue on the SFR system is the reduction of cost to competitive levels .
None of the SFRs constructed to date have been economical to build or operate (Lineberry , et al) .
With innovations to reduce capital cost , it can be extended to electricity production , given the proven capability of sodium reactors to utilize almost all of the energy in the natural uranium .
In this way , SFR can competitively serve markets for electricity .
In conclusion , plant design should be streamlined for technically sound , robust , passively safe , and low-cost production .
Despite challenges within steps of the nuclear fuel cycle  , they can be solved with improvements in technology and with global cooperation .
Although VHTR has the advantage of   high fuel burn up , SFR performs better in areas such as having low maintenance and operating cost , passive safety and potential modular construction .
VHTR must overcome these challenges , particularly in reactor safety and costs in order to be comparable with the SFR system .
In 1986 , the world's worst nuclear accident Chernobyl took place in Ukraine .
The explosion of the Unit 4 reactor core had spread radioactivity across many areas , claiming lives of some 50 emergency workers and leaving health problems , such as thyroid cancer , and psychological trauma on over 5 million people .
(ElBaradei , 2005) Critics have found out that mechanical errors such as the building of Unit 4 was not up to its highest standards and that some of its safety devices were faulty , while the human management of the whole plant was questionable .
(North , 2006) This , therefore , boils down to the question as to whether the use of psychology , both in technical and human terms , during the design process of the reactor would have prevented this accident .
Introducing psychology in the design process can foresee the possible human errors , such as the operators' incompetent mental state of mind during the operation of the plant .
Safety measures , for example installing auto power shut-off for the reactors in the event of an accident or oversight , would have been taken to assist the operators should any human error occurred .
Having said that , the use of psychology during the process is done on the basis of an ideal situation , where the human labour is of the highly skilled and with high capabilities .
However , psychology during the design process fails to consider the lack of appropriate skills and training of the labour employed during the time of operation .
For the case of Chernobyl , the designers admitted that they had not taken into account the possible user-machine interactions , thus leaving this area undetermined .
(Munipov , ND)
Critics have brought out the point that the explosion of Unit 4 was due to the poor management of the whole plant , from the failure to follow certain safety standards , to the design flaws of the reactor and structure , and to the incompetency of the labour .
(BBCNews .com , 2000) Even if psychology were to be used in the design process of the Chernobyl plant , it would still have overlooked the national culture and working style then .
In the old Soviet Union , the people were taught to be obedient and politically correct .
There were hardly rebuttals from the lower ranks to the senior management even if the former had found anything amiss with the machines or operating procedures .
(North , 2006) Furthermore , the state was practicing the policy of secrecy for 35 years , such that only certain information on safety standards was made known and approved , while the design flaws were always hidden from the light .
(Munipov , ND) Psychology is the study of the mind and if it is included in the design process , the design would be seen from the user's perspective and thus the end product would have an effective design .
The use of psychology during the design process would have minimized the effects of the accident , but would not have prevented it from happening because the accident happened due to the combination of errors on multiple levels , such as the context of time and national culture .
The Chernobyl accident was inevitable due to the various faults made in the different levels of the management of the plant and political factors , and this accident did provide an important lesson for both the human engineering and nuclear power world .
On the 20 April 2004 at about 3 .30pm in the afternoon , a major construction incident occurred in Singapore , the collapse of Nicoll Highway .
This caused soil subsidence of the immediate surrounding area which resulted in substantial damages on the Nicoll Highway carriageway .
This incident has also resulted in 4 fatalities and 3 casualties .
The incident is mainly due to the collapse of a deep excavation work alongside Nicoll Highway .
The main contractor for these works is Nishimatsu-Lum Chang Joint Venture and the client for this Circle Line project is the Land Transport Authority of Singapore (LTA) .
What could have caused this incident ?
And who should be responsible for it ?
According to the committee of inquiry (Press Release 2005 , Ministry of Manpower) , it was concluded that the incident was due to inadequate temporary works and design construction errors .
Very often , such mistakes are always linked to the negligence and carelessness of humans .
Psychological factors play an important role in the root of this incident .
It was reported (New Civil Engineer May 2005) that the main contractor , Nishimatsu-Lum Chang used an inappropriate soil analysis model in the early stages of the temporary work design on the highly plastic marine clays area .
The use of such model then led to serious false predictions of forces  which resulted in the fatal catastrophe .
The incident was due to the carelessness of the engineers then .
According to Land Transport Authority's counsel K- Shanmugam (2005) ,  Nishimatsu-Lum Chang maintained that designs were satisfactory even after the discovery of minor designs faults and pressured LTA to allow them to continue their excavation activities .
It was observed that the main contractors wanted to avoid troubles and further expenses for rectifications of minor faults , hence resulting in the negligence .
The committee inquiry (press Release 2005 , Ministry of Manpower) stated that Nicoll Highway collapse was initiated by the failure of the strut- waler support system for the excavation .
However , the committee also highlighted that there were deficiencies in the project management that perpetuated and aggravated the design errors .
Psychological factors in the design processes such as negligence , impatience and carelessness led to inadequate instrumentation and monitoring works , improper handling of the instrumentation data .
From the analysis of major accidents , we learnt that human actions always play a major role in triggering accidents as well as mitigating their consequences .
B . Wilpert (Psychology and Design Processes) .
According to the Committee , it was also discovered that there was a lack of competency of persons carrying out specialized work which resulted in the incapacity of the project management team and supervisory personnel to identify adverse trends in the construction process and implement corrective measures .
The committee of inquiry for the incidence  also pointed out that the temporary works pertaining to deep excavation were not regulated to the same degree as the permanent works .
Many of the considerations in the aspect of safety were more leniently treated as compared to those required for permanent works .
As such , the designs of diaphragm walls were not strong enough to support the deep excavation and hence failures occurred .
The lower standards often lead designers to underestimate in their design .
They tend to have a psychological effect of letting down their guards in the designs where the standards are not as strict , often leading to carelessness , negligence and eventually accidents .
Many of the workplace incidents such as the collapse of Nicoll Highway have been traditionally categorized as a single component failure Design error .
However , these are often the results of human errors .
Occupational hazards and individual workplace accidents are very often influenced by individual constructs like motivation , perception , attitude and decision- making (Fahlbruch and Wilpert , 1999) .
The problem is not simply due to design faults , as the root of these design faults is usually psychological factors such as carelessness , lousy moods ,  fatigue and inability to stay focused .
Psychological factors such as accountability , responsibility and professionalism play an important role in every design process .
Potential in major accidents can in fact be recognized through the use of hazard identification and risk analysis , which allows the designs to be robust , independently checked and regularly reviewed .
When there is a strong safety psychological awareness culture , accidents could be prevented !
The Nicoll Highway collapse was caused by the failure of the overloaded temporary structure connection on the level 9 strut-waler .
This resulted in the death of 4 workers .
There are three main reasons for this incident: cost cutting on the temporary structure , the lack of concentration at work and negligence in checking the design of the structure due to its temporary identity .
Catastrophic incidents always take a series of mistakes to happen where human errors usually play a main part (B .Wilpert , 2007) .
Thus , the problem lies in whether psychology is important to fuse into the design process .
One of the major reasons for the temporary structure to collapse is the use of a cheaper material which made the structure unable to withstand the capacity to cater for the loads .
Erroneous individual action is a crucial link in this chain .
In order to avoid the delay penalty of S$25M , Nishimatsu-Lum Chang(NLC) , the contractor company for constructing Mass Rapid Transport under Nicoll Highway , did not seek their client Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s  approval on the replacement of material .
With the intention to complete the project on time , NLC replaced lower- priced material to build the remaining temporary structure when the original raw material had depleted .
Dysfunctional relations with the other organizational party created this problem .
If both NLC and LTA could communicate and negotiate efficiently on the extension of the deadline , NLC might not have resorted to risk compromising safety for fines .
In this case , this incident might not have happened .
Workers are required  work overtime to ensure timely completion of the project .
Although the standard legal law set by the Employment Act states that each employee can only work 44 hours per week (Foreign , 2003) , NLC did not obey the law .
Therefore , it is necessary to forbid the company from making the workers to work overtime .
Excessive overtime causes them to lose concentration and eventually wear out .
As a result , workers tend to pay less attention to the details and surroundings and are more inclined to erroneous action which , in this case , posed great dangers .
If anyone was alert , there would have had enough time to evacuate everybody from the site before it actually collapsed since it took 1 hour for the first failure of the connection to the total collapse of the excavation (Design , 2005) , and the incident might not have happened .
There was no law stating safety rules for temporary structures in 2004; thus , it was not compulsory to make the temporary structure a very well-built one .
Problems arise where individual  perspectives come to play a part .
Assumption has always been made when some people are doing the 'assuring' job .
In addition to make the design process worse .
First , the LTA personnel thought that the contractors would do a good job on designing the structure and do the calculations to ensure it is acceptable and assumed that the contractors already did the proper checking for the design .
Assumptions are made in between both parties .
As a result , they missed out 2 mistakes that could be easily spotted .
The first mistake is that the contractors used the wrong soil analysis at the early stages of the design process .
The second mistake is that  the contractors miscalculated the capacity of the loads for the temporary structure .
Moreover , when NLC's engineers brought out an alternative analysis models , LTA's engineers rejected them because the latter thought that it was overcautious .
Second , the LTA's personnel , due to slothfulness , did not do their job on ensuring the safety of building works by performing checks on the construction work .
Currently , there already is a set of Safety Control Process (Seetoh Hon Hoy , 2005) for temporary structure to prevent this from happening again .
Even though this incident looks like a system or technical problem , it all boils down to human faults .
Humans are responsible for designing the system , creating and enforcing laws , rules and regulations and regrettably , making mistakes during work .
By having certain degree of psychology knowledge , we are able to understand human weaknesses so that design processes can incorporate  psychological knowledge to improve the system .
This can greatly reduce human errors made during work which may able to reduce accidents from happening .
"Times are exciting for nuclear ," says Ronaldo Szilard , director of nuclear science and engineering at the Idaho National Lab , a part of the U .S . Energy Department (Smith , 2009) .
Nuclear power , a breakthrough discovery that was celebrated at the end of nineteenth century , is ironically feared as a tool of destruction today .
Acting like a double edged sword , it is hailed as the wonder that can solve current energy crisis while critics believe incidents such as 1986 Chernobyl accidents in Ukraine and 1976 Three Mile Islands reactors meltdown may occur again .
However , due to worldwide soaring increase in carbon emission , a series of new generation IV nuclear generators concepts have been proposed .
Lead cooled fast reactor (LFR) is one of them .
Among the six proposed generation IV reactors , three of them belong to fast reactors .
So what are fast reactors ?
Fast reactors utilize neutrons of much higher energy to cause fission , which differs from present types of reactors that slow down neutrons using moderators such as water .
LFR is a type of fast reactors that rely on lead as coolant in the reactor .
Its ability to provide reliable safety , efficient waste management and effective cost minimization enables itself to have a competitive edge over other energy sources .
Skeptics believe that if nuclear energy replaces oil to further increase its current 21percent contribution of electricity in the United States , the nuclear reactors may become potential targets for terrorist groups .
In addition , there is still no safe guarantee that these new LFRsoperate without any malfunction as they have not been presented to the National Regulatory Council for review .
Despite all these factors , general public may not be aware of the refined safety measures that these new reactors possess .
First of all , all generation IV nuclear reactors include passive design that relies on law of nature , which simplifies the current nuclear generator design that has redundant valves and control system .
Therefore , during any emergency process , the required human intervention is minimized .
Moreover , LFR has a  safety advantage compared to the other nuclear reactors designs .
Calculation has been done to show that LFR has a better safety design mainly because lead serves as a better coolant that does not react as readily as  sodium and air .
(Kamil Tuek , 2006) In fact , the number of incidents that may lead to severe accidents has been declining in recent years .
(U . S . NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION , 1998)Thus , with these years of experience in improving the safety aspects of nuclear energy , the new design is deemed to be safe to provide service to mankind .
The waste management is another problematic issue in the current generation III nuclear reactors .
An ordinary thermal nuclear reactor is only to extract approximately only 5 percent energy contained in uranium .
(Smith , 2009)That shows the other 95 percent of the energy would end up as waste and need to be stored in safety for thousands of years .
Millions of  tons of radioactive materials are currently sitting somewhere in this world .
Instead of waiting for them to lose their radioactivity , a fast reactor is able to utilize most energy from the remaining 95 percent energy .
With current nuclear energy wastes sitting in the storage sites , GE Hitachi Company believes the power extracted would be able to meet 70 years of energy demands in USA .
(GE Reports , 2009)By supporting the research on LFR , not only would it provide tremendous energy power to the world , but it would also solve the headache waste issue that every OECD nation is facing .
Feasibility also needs to be analyzed in our discussion .
One  current LFR research , SSTAR (Small , Sealed , Transportable , Autonomous Reactor) offers a good solution in minimizing the capital cost of building a nuclear reactor .
Its main concept is to develop portable nuclear reactors that are able to provide their services in developing countries .
(Rennie , 2004) "With SSTAR , countries won't need a large nuclear reactor industry to benefit from nuclear energy ," says Craig Smith , a nuclear engineer in Livermore's Energy and Environment Directorate .
Manufacturing costs including materials , expertise requirement and manpower have effectively been lessened with this concept .
The future is unknown .
We do not know which research may ripen before the others .
Any research may come to a dead end due to strained resources .
LFR , a highly feasible solution for the earth's energy crisis , has a clear direction and promising future .
It deserves more human and financial resources in order for it to reach the maturity stage .
Safe , less waste and more affordable , these are the characteristics of our future energy .
Therefore , we should give our fullest support , as this technology may turn out to be essential for our future generation .
Opponents argue that the Vthe fourwould have a great explosion potential since the VHTR operates in an extremely high temperature of more than 1000  C . However , there is subtle safety design in the VHTR to reduce the potential of explosion .
One good designhas raisede utilization of helium as the coolant .
Helium is aninert gas .
It will not chemically react with other materials (International Atomic Energy Agency , 1996) .
Unlike water and most other coolants , helium can maintain its non-radioactive property even when it exposes (Institute for Scientific and Technical Information , 2000) .
Another safety design is the temperature-resistant material .
Some promising materials like zirconium carbide can allow the plants perform at the temperature up to 1800 C (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2002) .According to Butler (2004) , a similar high-temperature engineering test reactor in Oarai , Japan , has already successfully operated at the temperature of 950 C . The success of this reactor suggests that more advanced temperature-resistant material can be developed in the near future .
Besides these , other safety designs like the passive heat removal system can also enhance the safety factor of the VHTR .
It can not only cool the nuclear plants fast , but also protect plants from seismic and other external events (Eul , 2006) .
materialsBesides the concern about safety design , sceptics also doubt the environmental impacts of the VHTR .
They say that the non-recyclable radioactive waste in the VHTR reactor can harm the environment and people's health .
Although the waste of nuclear reactors is indeed radioactive , the VHTR reactor design miniman inerte possibility for radioactive elements to harm the environment .
According to research , the radioactivity for VHTR waste is relatively small compared with other reactors .
The VHTR produces "less heavy metal radioactive waste" and "less plutonium per unit of energy produced" because of the VHTR's high thermal efficiency (Shropshire and Herring , 2004) .It has a high thermal efficiency of over 50% , wto performher reactors only have a thermal efficiency of 33%-50% (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2009) .Thus , the VHTR is less harmful to the environment .
Some opponents may think that the VHTR would be very costly .
However , recent research supports exactly the opposite conclusion .
The cost for VHTR including fuels and materials , reactor systems , balance of plant , safety , design & evaluation and fuel cycle is relatively low .
The total cost would be around 610 million US dollars , which is the second cheapest among the six Generation IV reactors .
Furthermore , hydrogen producthe VHTRn VHTR can be commercialised as clean fuethe other transportan to make profits (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2009) .
In conclusion , the arguments anst VHTR reactor cannot be valid .
As Mr . Butler (2004) said , "Global warming and rising energy needs are rehabilitating the concept of nuclear power .
But if it is the figure in the energy equation , it will need to be cheaper , cleaner and safer" (p .238) .
The VHTR has the advantage of meticulous safety designs , small environmental impact and relatively low cost .
Therefore , the VHTR could be a promising nuclear reactor for the "Nuclear power's new dawn" .
Reference
Safety features are one of the main considerations when designing a nuclear reactor .
Proponents of VHTR claim that it has an inherent passive safety features for both the fuel and the reactor (Goethem 2008) .
For example , the core of the reactor will be able to withstand temperatures way above the normal operating temperatures .
In the event of an accident , the probability of a meltdown occurring is minimized .
However , passive safety features are present in the MSR too .
Unlike the VHTR which produces high pressure steam at the core , MSR produces low pressure .
This is due to the nature of molten fluoride salts , which is used as coolant and is mechanically and chemically stable at sea-level pressures (Forsberg 2004) .
In other words the MSR's core cannot have a steam explosion , thus it eliminates the need for additional advance technology to control the high pressure .
Due to VHTR's high temperature and corrosive operating conditions , the materials used must have high dimensional stability and be able to withstand high pressure .
New ultra hard materials that can resist continued highshowsratures and intense bombardment by neutrons have to be developed (Butler) .
Practical advantages of MSR's high temperature low pressure cooling result in higher efficiency in removing heat from the core (Fosberg 2004) .
This also implies that MSR does not need to spend additional money developing new materials to withstand the high pressure .
Uranium is the main source of fuel for the VHTR's main system of operation .
A once-through uranium fuel cycle allows the reactor to produce high tempfeatureat the outlet core .
But unlike the VHTR , the MSR uses another kind of fuel cycle called thorium , which is much more abundant in nature than uranium (David .S 2007)The first advantages of using a thorium fuel cycle are the ability to burn up most of the actinides which produces radioactivity .
Radioactivity is unwanted as it can remain active for hundreds of years if it is not properly contained .
(David .s 2007) The second advantage is an enhanced nuclear weapons pareliferation resistanceareDue to the nature of a thorium based fuel cycle , essential elements for nuclear weapons like enriched uranium cannot be chemicexplosion; thus ,from thorium .
Unlike thorium , enriched advanced used in the VHTR and it can potentially produce a bomb .
Moreover uranium is limited in supply and not as abundant as Thorium .
The need for expensive fuel-enrichment facilities is unnecessary when Thorium is being used as the main fuel cycle too .
Both MSR and VHTR are state-of-the-art nuclear reactors .
Automation throughout the reactors and passive safety features are just some of the technology implemented to make the Generation IV reactors safer .
MSR's high temperature , low pressure cooling technologies will ensure a safe operation .
With the combination of Thorium being used as the main fuel cycle , MSR is a safe reactor with an abundant source of fuel .
In terms of safety and fuel technologies used , the MSR stands in a better position than the VHTR .

The main misconception about nuclear energy is its possibility to explode once it is under attack and its radiation .
In fact , the nuclear reactor doesn't produce the weapon grade reaction .
Hence , it won't explode even when it is under attack .
Moreover , the structure of the nuclear reactor is output and ato be able to sustain high collision and prevent raare still concernede , even it is under attack , the radiation will not leak .
In the history , there were only two accidents occurred , the Three Mile Island and Chenobyl incident .
The former did not cause anythe nucleare and was well under control .
The latter caused explosion sources , hence developingill affecting people until now .
However , we need to know that the latter incident happened at the generation I nuclear reactor , and it didn't follow the safety regulation then , hence caused the accident .
Since then , the WNA has imposed strict regulations and most of the reactors in operation now are generation II and III reactors which are safer and more efficient .
It is highly notable that since Chenobyl incident there is no more any accident .
This shows that the nuclear reactors now are reliable .
According to WNA , the current safety standard for nuclear reactor is 1 in 10000 core damage , which means that the core will possibly damage once in 10000 operation years .
The United States reactors now have the safety standard of 1 in 100000 , much better than requirement .
In fact , in comparison with other energy sources , the nuclear energy has the lowest fatality , as shown on the figure below: Source: Applied Energy 75 (2003) 7986
requiredreactorshas beenthen , hence causingIt is shown that the fatality of Nuclear Power its radiation and its possibility to explode once it is under attackn the other conventional energy sources .
Finally , given that people are worried about the nuclear power , it is much needed that we should research on it so that it will be safer and more efficient for us .
It is a fact that there are thousands of nuclear reactors in operation in the world now .
Hence , we should researmillions ofw generation of reactor even more to replace the old ones .
In can excellent , the nuclear power is the sodecaying the current energy crisis .
By researching the newhich can be usedion of nuclear reactor , we can enjoy more efficient and safer energy aroufriendly and at
Further research and development funding for Generation IV nuclear reactors , particularly the Very- High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , should be supported .
Ever since Mankind has started using fossil fuels for energy , 400 billion tonnes of carbon has been released and eventually would raise world temperatures by 13 degrees Celsius (Zoe ,n .d .) .
Global warming has become an inevitable issue .
Mankind's hunger for energy is ever increasing , and experts agree that fossil fuels might deplete within the next 50 years (John ,2006) .
Nuclear energy has been proposed to be the solution to this critical issue .
There are , however , concerns about nuclear power with respect to its safety , economic viability and waste disposal .
Nonetheless , the advantages Generation IV nuclear power , specifically the Very-High- Temperature reactor(VHTR) , could provide can offset its high start up cost and overcome its disadvantages .
Thus , further research and development funding for VHTR should be supported .
There was a partial meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island and there was also an accident in at Chernobyl , causing casualties and spewing radioactive waste across Europe .
Such accidents dealt a great blow in the public's confidence in generating nuclear power (Butler ,D .
, 2004) .
It will take a lot of convincing for the public to accept nuclear power as a safe source of energy .
However , such incidents are anomalous .
Furthermore , for the case of Chernobyl , the cause of the incident was due to human negligence and not the inadequacy of the technology itself .
The technology has since improved and many new safety and monitoring features have been included .
Even though there have been several instances of leaks and other safety incidents , there have been no major accidents  and no known deaths have been resulted (The Economist , 2009) .
In addition , the coolant used in VHTR is helium .
Helium is a noble gas and will not react with other materials even at high temperature , which makes the model safer (Butler ,D .
, 2004) .
The start up cost of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
Many might argue that it is more economically viable to continue using fossil fuels for energy .
However , continual burning of fossil fuels increases the emission of greenhouse gases .
This will not improve the current situation as greenhouse gases are the main culprit of global warming .
Since global warming is a pressing issue now and even more so in the future , heavy carbon taxes should be preempted .
The "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , a United Nations-appointed group of scientific experts , reckons that fossil fuels should carry a tax of $20-50 for every tonne of carbon dioxide they generate"(The Economist ,2008) .
Furthermore , fossil fuels are a rapidly decreasing limited resource .
The price of fossil fuels will increase exponentially in the near future due to increasing demand and fast decreasing supply .
This would make VHTR model the more viable choice for energy since its high efficiency and stability would offset the high start up cost .
Some would say nuclear power plants are a source of nuclear weapons and might become potential terrorist targets .
Some other concepts for the reactor might involve waste reprocessing and recycling which separates out plutonium , a main ingredient of advanced nuclear weapon (Butler ,D .
2004) .
This might be true to some Generation IV reactor concepts , but not so for VHTR as VHTR model does not involve the waste recycling process .
VHTR will have many safety features included to make it terrorist proof as well .
Therefore ,  VHTR is a safe model and would eliminate any  such concerns .
In conclusion , the increasing demand of energy would mean that fossil fuels would deplete in the near future .
In addition , continual usage of fossil fuels would increase the emission of greenhouse gases which causes global warming .
VHTR would be an ideal model to supply nuclear energy to resolve the problems .
There are concerns about producing nuclear energy with regards to its cost , security and performance .
However ,  VHTR includes features and benefits that would offset its disadvantages .
Therefore , the VHTR model should be given more funding for further research and development .
Whenever nuclear power is concerned , accident is always the first thing that comes into the picture .
However , people seldom think about how nuclear energy will benefit the world by providing a solution to global warming .
Increasing energy needs and global warming are restoring the idea of nuclear power .
According to Butler (2004) by 2050 the carbon dioxide level in the air is expected to double , causing severe global warming .
Therefore , new sources of green energy are needed to prevent this from happening .
There are many different green energy sources such as solar energy , turbine generated energy from wave and wind , but nuclear energy , especially the Very High Temperature Reactor , can be the most reliable source of energy in the future when security , safety and cost of nuclear power could be resolved .
Security issue against terrorist attacks and the use of the energy for nuclear weapons is a major concern when we think about nuclear power .
The destructive power of nuclear bombs can be seen in the history of World War 2 , when two atomic bombs were used on Japan , killing 220000 people .
As technology becomes more advanced , hydrogen bombs which are deadlier are now available and the world would be in trouble if these bombs are in the wrong hands as incidents worse than September 11 may happen .
However this is only possible when we try to integrate the process of recycling nuclear waste , which is not available for Very High Temperature Reactor .
During the process of recycling , plutonium , a key ingredient for advance nuclear weapon , is produced .
Most countries including The United States has refrained from reprocessing nuclear waste and has discouraged other from doing so too .
Since the very high temperature of VHTR does not allow the waste to be recycled , the problem that people may misuse the technology will be resolved .
Even if there is recycling of waste , convectional reprocessing does not generate weapon grade plutonium and chemicals could be used to spike the plutonium to make it too hot to steal or transport .
Safety issue is definitely a concern as the history of the Three Mile Island in 1979 and the Chernobyl incident in 1986 has left a long lasting bad impression of nuclear plants .
During the Chernobyl incident the plant was blown apart in a very short time and 31 deaths were caused immediately .
The worst thing  was not the immediate death but the exposure of humans to radiation .
After the explosion the land was to be vacated and would no longer be usable and the number of cancer cases is believed to have increased in Europe .
However  the number of deaths is much smaller for nuclear accidents than that for coal mining ones as cave-in usually results in hundreds and thousands of death .
One of the reasons for the Chernobyl accident was  the staff inexperience , but for the newer plant there will be more advanced safety enhancement and inbuilt automatic safety features that will cool themselves in times of emergency .
Although the cost of building a nuclear plant is very high and the price of the energy generated is higher than that we have in the market , development on nuclear plants is still a necessity .
In the long run the price of the energy generated by coal and oil would skyrocket as the tax for carbon emissions will increase exponentially .
The development of nuclear plants would prevent this especially the Very High Temperature Reactor , would prevent this .
The very high temperature reactor can generate both electricity and hydrogen and it is 50% more effective than the conventional reactor and it allows countries to be self sufficient in terms of energy .
In conclusion , nuclear power is definitely one of the better choices when we are looking for a green source of energy .
Nuclear power is one technology that must be increasingly promoted and relied upon if the world is to stabilize carbon emissions at an acceptable level .
Nuclear power plants are not nuclear bombs waiting to go off .
thinkFirst , for the sodium-cooled fast reactor , itused .top-ranked in sustainability because of its closed fuel cycle and excellent potential for actinipercentement .
Actually , it can make the use of 99% of fuel .
The outlet temperatures in the range of 510-650 makes the resulting thermal efficiencies range from 39% to 47% .
The performance of sodium-cooled fast reactor seems so perfect , however , compared with the Gas-cooled fast reactor , these data is not perfect anymore .
For gas-cooled fast reactor , it also a closed fuel cycle and the use of fuel can reach 99% as well .
The outlet temperatures in the range of the gas-cooled fast reactor is around 850 , so it makes the theoretical value of its thermal efficiency is 50% .
This limit of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is just 47% .
Second , safety is another important factor .
For the sodperfect; however ,ecompared with the performance of the gas-cooled fast reactor , that of sodium-cooled fast reactor spheric pressure and impoThe gaseatures of threactorclude a long thermal response time which is a large margin to cool the boiling .
It also offers a high level of safety reliability .
This factares based on activitsntermeasures for self-trolled shutdown function anThat function .
However , dynamic simulations indicate that an accidental reduction of flow up to 2-3 can be tolerated (with no control action) without sodium boiling or fuel melting .
From it we can find the most significant part for safety features of sodium- cooled fast reactor is the control action .
Thus , no matter which kind of generation IV reactor , if its system has control action , it is also relatively safety .
Furthermore , the gas-cooled fast reactor also has its own control action of the system .
This control makes the gas-cooled fast reactor can be as safe as the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
Third , the cost of the fast reactor is also significant .
Some evident shows the sodium-cooled fast reactor can reduce the cost of the raw material by changing it .
However , as the sodium-cooled fast reactor was developed later than the other kinds of factors , especially later than the gas-cooled fast reactor , the cost of research and investigation of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is so huge .
Just because of it , many developed countries do not have enough money to afford this expense .
Therefore , it obstructs the application of the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
Compared with sodium-cooled fast reactor , the gas-cooled fast factor is an old one which has been developed and widely used since 1979 .
Its cost of development is far less than the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
It does not need to be changed or improved so much .
The main cost of it is just the annual depreciation which is far less than the development cost of the sodium- cooled reactor .
In addition , we should consider the cost of time of the reactors .
The gas-cooled fast reactor can be used directly at once .
However , the sodium-cooled fast reactor should be checked for several years by the fact .
Therefore , the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor by cost .
in terms ofbefore it could be usedIts main costthat of thethe sodiumreactor is hinderedto build a sodium-cooled fast reactorthisBecausereactorsthe materials usedevidenceinsafereactor is usedIn conclusion , even though the sodium-cooled fast reactor is a good type of generation IV reactor , thethe sodiumooled fast reactor is a much better one .
Compared with the sodium-cooled fast reactor , the gas-cooled reactor has its obvious advantages of performance and cost .
It has the larger thermal efficiency and less cost of expense and time .
Even though the safety of sodium-cooled fast reactor may be better than the gas-cooled fast reactor , it cannot change the fact that the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor in contemporary time , because there is stillObviously , nuclear power totally safeof the now .
Therefore , the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
resolvedconceptssaid ,improperTo begin with , some of opponents will argue that the cost of building a nuclear reactor is too high and the cost mentioned above generally cogas , which constituted ises of research , develoof the total energy consumption respectivelyation , construction contributato the nuclear waste fund .
Frankwithin no more than 50 years ,t problem does really existbe usedut wwhereasan view it from another perspective , which means compariWhen we are faceds cost with other kind of power plant under all the same factors .
Firstly , the cost of constructing a nuclear reactor is at most 2 to 3 times than the cost of building a heat-ean increasinglyr with the sametput .
But the raw material like uranium enrichment used for nuclear reactor is much cheaper both in transporconcerned aboute under the same amount of energy out .
In addition , unlike the heenergy reactor , the gas emittedTheirring the opeunderstandablelittle influence on the environmwhich happenedglobal warming .
Lastly , the achievement obtained from the research can also be applied intresultedr fielhumans'
Secondly , numerous public are holding the view that the nuclear reactor is still existing huge potential safety risk .
Reviewing the history , the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island catastrophe indeed witnessed the enormous harm the nuclear reactor could cause .
While the invest report showed thatirect cause was a series of wrong operations , the result actually didn't have much relatithat of othertkindse nuclear plantsor itself .
Currentlyconditionsaterials applied in VHTR are more advanced and steady compared to the past .
For example , the Carbon-Fibre reinforced Carbon can bear the highest temperature which the VHTR could generate .
In addition , due to threactorstructure-isotropiwwithwill become difficult to crack and release harmful radiation and fission products .
Thereemitted by the nuclear reactorhe wastes become concentraed and then easily to deal with .
the burning of fossil fuelsgasesleadbelieved that the production of nuclear energy willscientists and economistsdone2400 tons ofkilogram ofIn conclmany opponentsbelievedoubtthe huge potential benefits reactorslear reactor creates will no doubt attract more support not only from the government but also public and once the VHTR construction completed , I think the dawn of nuclear energy haso al .
Global warming has been the main concern of the governments around the world for the past decade .
High carbon dioxide emission has been one of the main culprits for global warming .
Thus there is a need to find alternatives to produce energy instead of relying on the conventional ones .
Although it is not commonly seen , some countries are already using nuclear reactors to produce energy .
These nuclear reactors , unlike the conventional power plants ,  do not produce greenhouse gases (Gerstner , 2009) .
However , these nuclear reactors also have their own disadvantages such as producing radioactive wastes , high cost and safety issues .
Research has shown that it is possible to have a nuclear reactor that is cleaner , safer and cheaper (Butler , 2004) .
Thus , there should be funding for research and development for Generation IV nuclear reactors .
Some people think that the radioactive wastes produced by  nuclear reactors .
are more dangerous than the greenhouse gases .
The radioactive waste could be used as an ingredient for nuclear weapons (Butler , 2004) .
Furthermore , the nuclear plant produces a large amount of waste (12 ,000 tonnes); thus , disposal becomes an issue (Gerstner , 2009) .
However , these problems could be solved by the new Generation IV reactors .
Currently , most of the nuclear reactors use nuclear fission to produce energy and a large volume of radioactive wastes is produced .
It was found that through thermonuclear fusion , it could reduce the radioactivity and the volume of wastes produced by nuclear fission (Gerstner , 2009) .
Thus by combining the nuclear fission and fusion , the waste produced will be less and less radioactive .
With less amount of wastes produced , it would mean that less plutonium is produced .
In this way it reduces the threat that the wastes would be used for developing nuclear weapons .
It also solves the problem of disposal .
Hence there should be funding to research  and develop the hybrid concept in the Generation IV reactors
Some people think that it is too costly to set up and maintain the nuclear reactor .
This would not have happened if there have been funding for research and development to produce a cheaper reactor .
The new reactor would be able to produce 50% more energy with the same amount of fuel (Butler , 2004) .
According to studies , the nuclear reactors .
now produce electricity at 6 .7cents per kWh after considering the set up cost , cost of fuel , operating cost and cost of disposal .
This is comparable as gas and coal plants produce electricity at 3 .8 to 5 .6 cents per kWh (Giles , 2006) .
After a 50% more energy is reduced  the nuclear reactor would be cheaper  power plants using coal and gas .
This shows that the new reactor will be able to produce cheaper energy .
Hence there should be funding for R&D for the Generation IV reactors
Some people have the impression from the two major incidents which happened in Chernobyl , Ukraine and the Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania that nuclear reactors are dangerous and so are against the idea of having nuclear reactors .
The two incidents happened due to high temperature , which leads to the partial meltdown .
This would not happen in the new reactors as they have better cooling systems that will allow the plants to cool down faster when they reach too high a temperature (Butler , 2004) .
In conclusion , there should be funding for research and development for Generation IV reactors .
Nuclear energyhelps in coping with global warming by not producing greenhouses gases unlike  conventional energy sources .
Although it produces a large amount of radioactive wastes , if the hybrid reactor could be produced , the wastes would not be a problem .
Furthermore Generation IV reactors are able to produce more energy; thus , the cost of the energy would be cheaper .
Lastly it has better systems which would prevent similar incidents as the meltdown of the nuclear power reactor  .
Thus there should be funding to develop Generation IV reactors .
The verynents argue mostly about the huge destructiveness in an accident and the hidden raareoactive pollution .
Some accidents of nuclear power plants , such as the Chernobyl disaster occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant , caused huge panic about the new clear powhaveplant .
Howthe Unitedduring that time the nuclear reactothe veryere not well developed .
Researches done by the experts in United State showunder developmentecurity of the very high temperature would be improved quite a lot .
First , since the core is composed of helium , whose coolant is dingle phase , and graphite whose thermal inertia iEven whenry large , the core becomes very steady and safe .
In addition , fuel of the very high temperature reactor is designed to cycle from ore extraction of final waste disposal and radioactive wastes will be sent to repositories for final geologic disposal which will reduce both the lifetime and toxicity of the radioactive waste .
Therefore , the safety of the very high temperature reactor is improved a lot .
Another reason for opposition is the high cost of the very high temperature reactor .
Given that the cost of the nuclear power plant including very high temperature reactor is verwhich occurrednd it will take several decades to recover from the cost , the opponents think it is nuclearnable to use very high temperature reactor .
However , according to the research done by the experts , the very high temperthe Unitedreactor will be designed in condition that the generation cost will be competitive when compared with other energy sources and the capital investment cost enough for a large number of countries .
Hence , the very high temperature will provide competitive econothe fuel .
theIn conclusion , the reasons against the development of the very high temperature are debatable .
The safety and cost of the high temperature reactor should not be used to limit the development of the very high temperature reactor , on the contrary ,provideould be considered as challenges to be overcome .
Anyway , the research about the very high temperature reactor shows that the very high temperature is beneficial to the society .
Therefore , the very high temperature should be developed .
In the twenty-first century , the world is developing in such a rapid pace that has never occurred in the past .
Countries like China and India enjoy an up to 8% increase of their GDP almost every year .
Besides the increase of GDP , carbon dioxide emission is also reaching the highest level compared to the past .
Obvious climate changes experienced in many countries and regions remind us that the green house effect is really dangerous to the earth .
We should stop destroying our earth by continuing mining and generating electricity through  coal plants .
Nuclear power seems to be a suitable solution .
However ,  opponents feel that nuclear power is not acceptable mainly due to safety , cost and pollution .
In fact , by using Generation Four nuclear power plant in the coming future , these problems can be solved definitely .
And among all types of the Generation IV nuclear power technology , the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) would be the best choice due to its safety , efficiency and environment friendliness .
Firstly , opponents of using nuclear power plants argue that nuclear power is not a safe technology .
The reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania seems to show that nuclear power technology is extremely dangerous to use .
I do admit that some of the public have lost their confidence and trust after this accident happened .
However , we should understand that the TML used pressurized water reactor which is Generation Two model and that it is less safe than VHTR which is a Generation Four model .
VHTR makes use of helium , an inert gas , as coolant .
It will not react with the VHTR materials nor become radioactive itself .
Hence , it is very safe to use .
Secondly , supporters of traditional power plants argue that the cost of building nuclear plants is much higher than that of building  coal plants .
Actually , the construction cost of nuclear power plants keeps on decreasing in the past few years .
For example , the construction cost for the first third generation reactor , ABWR , built in Japan was 2000 per KW , while the Chinese Nuclear Power Industry has built new plants of their own design at capital costs reported to be$1500 per KW and $1300 per KW at sites in South-East and North-East China recently .
In fact , the VHTR could even produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with other nuclear plants .
In addition , the maintenance and labor cost of VHTR is much less than that of that of the coal plants .
With the low maintenance fees , low labor cost and the high output of electricity , the total cost of the VHTR is actually less than the coal plants after a few years of operation .
Thirdly ,  opponents of nuclear power plants worry that the disposal of radioactive waste from the plants will cause serious illness or even death to people who live or work near the place .
However ,  VHTR has a reactor core made of graphite , which possesses high stability even in high temperatures .
And by using uranium dioxide fuel particles coated with graphite , the reactors will not release radioactive substances even in extreme high temperatures .
It has zero waste .
In addition , VHTR is capable of producing hydrogen gas by breaking the molecular bond of H2O .
As hydrogen gas has zero carbon dioxide emission , it has a potential to replace petroleum as a clean fuel for transportation .
So VHTR is environment friendly and the most optimized solution towards green house effect .
In conclusion , it should be evident that the arguments against nuclear power plants are not valid .
Among the generation IV reactors , the very-high-temperature reactor is most likely to be the best choice due to its safety , efficiency and environment friendliness .
As a good solution towards green house effect , we expect to see a bright future of nuclear power technology and it will be adopted in more countries in next few decades .
The Tenerife runway accident involved the collision of two airplanes , the Pan American (Pan Am) Boeing 747 and the Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KLM) aircraft .
The accident was caused by the lack of the use of psychology during the design process , and could have been prevented , had more psychological considerations been taken into the aircraft designs .
However , some people say that the accident was caused due to human errors .
Upon realising that there was a crisis , the aircraft crew of each vessel responded without much consideration as to what their actions might lead to .
People then blamed the cause of the accident on the aircraft crew of both sides for badly managing the situation .
Still , the reason behind the cause of the accident cannot be blamed on the aircraft crew .
The aircraft crew reacted the way they reacted because the plane was not built with all the necessary functions for them to react in an unexpected situation .
For example , under low-visibility conditions , there was no way the Pam Am officer could differentiate between a stationary and a vibrating aircraft nearby .
Had strong light-emitting devices been installed on the KLM aircraft , an unambiguous signal would have been sent , leaving the Pan Am officer with a clear signal .
In this situation people cannot say that the Pan Am officer did not do his job because he  kept lookout on the surroundings , but in the midst of the fog , the presence of the KLM aircraft signaled an ambiguous message .
Also , had proximity sensors been installed within the Pan Am aircraft , the whole accident could have been prevented .
The Pan Am officer saw the KLM through the fog and noticed its apparent static state when it was in fact still moving .
If an alarm was sounded  when safety distance between the Pan Am and KLM aircraft was breached , the Pan Am crew would have steered their aircraft away from hazard .
The undetected KLM aircraft collided with the Pan Am aircraft because by the time the Pan Am officer realised that the KLM was nearing their aircraft , it was too late .
Had he been warned by the ringing alarm of a proximity sensor , he would have gotten enough time to respond and not to panic when the impending collision was apparent .
For these reasons , we conclude that the accident in the Tenerife runway could have been avoided , had the use of psychology been applied in the designing process .
If designers still persist that psychological considerations are of hardly any importance , then the users of their products may well be put in situations where accidents are bound to occur .
We have achieved so much .
However , nuclear power plants sometimes could cause disasters .
Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylfor oneia; Chernobyl accident happened in Ukraine .
We bear while using nuclear power .
As a result , a new generation of nuclear power- The six generation IV reactors concepts were raised to solve this problem .
Among all these six generation IV nuclear reactor plants , I think Very-high-temperature reactor is the most promising one .
We can use this kind of reactors to solve our energy problems .
Security has always been the most concerned problem which is also biggest trouble in using nuclear power .
For the last few years , very few new nuclear power plants were built .
We are not only concerning the shortage of technology but also considering the danger of terrorists .
Nuclear power could be easily used as weapon because we do not need to consider controlling the bomb , but if we use nuclear power as energy , then we should make it safe for us to operate it .
The big danger hidden in nuclear power plant also makes it as a target for those who want to destroy .
From "Baidu" dictionary , we know that the power released in Chernobyl Accident was about 400 times as big as the atom bomb which US threw in Hiroshima .
We must make sure that there is not a little danger in our building and using nuclear power .
Our new technology used in VHTR nuclear power plant includes simplified safety features that do not rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators .
"Meltdown proof" and can cool themselves down even if anyone shuts off the coolant or power supply .
(Nuclear power's new dawn) Different form the caution we must take in using traditional nuclear power plants , now we can make the most of nuclear power .
Instead of taking great caution VHTR is 'meltdown proof"plantswhenthe USthe Chernobyldestroy itNuclear waste is full of radiation which can easily destroy our body .
The half-life of thThe Threeadio elements lasts fooccurredthousands of yeThe Chernobylen longer .
They become potential sy hazard .
Therefore , the second advantage which stands out the VHTR is becauthethat VHTR doesn't produce any nuclear waste .
VHTR could even generate hydrogen at the same time under its high temperature .
We may cut thethe veryt spending using in nuclear waste when we use VHTR .
Hydrogen generated values because of its high thermal value and can also be used without any pollution .
VHTR uses Helium as its coolant instead today's water-cooled reactor and transfers energy into hydrogen surely save the sourhave beenIn summary ,are worried about not onlying nuclear power which surely will bew energy stream .
Just like Abraham said , "we will have energy tha weaponsafe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant ."
In the society today ,there are many ideas or concepts that are currently in the stages of research and development .
Some of the ideas and new creations which fall into this category are robotics and hybrid cars .
There are many reasons amounting to the factors which result in the delaying of mass production in the market .
These include lack of technology as well as funding from the appropriate ministries or bodies .
With regard to hybrid cars , prior to the mass production and usage of it , there are some factors with respect to the construction of the vehicle that we have to factor in in order to increase the safety aspects of usage .
Some of the vito factors leading to increased safety levels require the addition of new features into the vehicle as well as modifications  made to current existing design .
In conclusion , there are pros and cons regarding the improvements to hybrid cars in order to increase its level of safety .
However , we must recognize that our safety is of utmost importance and take precedence above anything else .
I hope that in the near future , we are able to do our part for our mother Earth by driving such hybrid cars as it reduces greenhouse gases since it is not driven by petrol or diesel , but at the same time not compromise our personal safety .
Nowadays , people are living longer than in the past and the growth of the world's population is increasing expectedly to around 10 billion by the year 2050 .
Therefore , there is an increasing demand for energy usage throughout the world .
According to the article of Nuclear Power/Nuclear Dawn (The Economist , 2007) , the global electricity consumption is expected to double in the next few decades [1] .
Furthermore , due to the depletion of unrenewable energy such as coal and fossil fuel ,  , scientists scientists in many countries have started  to seek  a new source of energy , which is nuclear energy .
Although the potential for the uses of nuclear power energy is great , there are a number of opponents with anti-nuclear sentiments preventing the construction of nuclear plants in the past few decades in many countries .
Such issues include the safe operations of nuclear reaction As a result , the generation IV nuclear energy system was introduced , which was an improved design from their predecessors , Generation IV reactors are offering significant advances such as clean , safe and cost effective .
Therefore , the very-high temperature reactor (VHTR) was introduced to meet global energy demands .
After the catastrophe that happened at Chernobyl , Russia 1986 , the World start to be concerned more carefully about the safety and security of nuclear power reactors .
A majority of the public have been opposing the development of nuclear plants around their living areas .
As a result , nuclear industry has stepped into the degradation , causing the world's energy crisis .
However , nowadays  scientists have proved that with measured caution , nuclear power could be used to supply alternated energy to the world as the fossil fuels would come to an end soon .
At the same time there is a lot of evidences show that nuclear power could be considered as the best suggestion to mitigate global warming .
This era is 'Nuclear Renaissance' , and the reasons for the renaissance of nuclear are due to the advanced technology and innovation of human to make nuclear power safer , cleaner with better cost effectiveness .
Hence , with the security systems , modern technology and intelligence of the manpower , I strongly believe that building of nuclear power plant should not be stopped .
First of all , the public is against the proposal of building nuclear power plant to supply electrical energy as they are very concerned with safety of the plant .
Questions that come to their mind will be .
"What is going to happen to us if the nuclear plant exploded ?
" , "Do they contain the deadly radioactive particles ?" .
The Chernobyl disaster is one of the nuclear power plant accidents that remind people about how dangerous nuclear reaction can be .
But we have to look at other things like passenger aircrafts .
Accidents happened every now and then , and through these accidents , people learnt and things were improved to prevent the same accidents from happening once again .
For example , the windows of the planes used to have square shape in the past but engineer have changed all of them to round shape to improve the safety of airplanes .
Because of accidents and people found out the solutions to improve safety .
Similarly , new designs nuclear power reactors are there to reduce off-site radioactivity to the minimum if there is accident .
The latest nuclear power plant accidents happened in 1999 , which is more than 10 years ago .
In 10 years , technology is advancing rapidly .
Therefore , I believe that nuclear power plant is very much safer than it was in the past .
The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 in Ukraine was not the only major accident that gave devastating impact to Russia .
In September 2009 , another accident gave Russia a huge hit .
Russia's biggest hydroelectric power plant in Sayano-Shushenskaya had a big explosion accident .
75 workers were killed and one person was reported missing in the accident .
The top industrial safety official in Russia stated that human's negligence was the major factor in the devastation of the accident .
One part of an overstrained turbine unit which weighed 1 ,500 tons snapped off from its restraining bolts and flowed 14 meters into the air , causing floods .
Due to flooding in the plant , short circuits crippled the plant and exploded .
It is said that the cost of repairing the damage would be over $1 .2 billion and the duration to recover the damage would take two years .
Accidents are events that involve unintended harms .
Could this hydroelectric power plant accident be prevented if the design of the plant was given more thought about safety ?
Many engineers and experts are debating whether psychology in design processes could prevent accidents from occurring .
Although some contend psychology used in designing can prevent accidents , there are some reasons and evidence  to oppose the theory of psychology in design processes can prevent accidents .
Proponents of psychology in design processes claims that psychological thinking is very important in the design processes .
They stated that when engineers or designers design with human psychology in through , they could produce a design that can prevent accidents from taking place .
As Bernhard Wilpert pointed in his article on psychology and design processes (2007) , "a crucial problem of design is to match the designer's mental modal of the object or system to be designed with the mental model of the future user requirements" .
For example , in the case of the hydroelectric power plant accident , humans negligent the warning of the system .
If the system was designed in a way that it automatically shuts down when there was a default in the system , the plant's operation would have been stopped and the accident would not have occurred .
Many studies from different accidents such as nuclear and chemical industry showed that between 20% and 50% of accidents are caused by design errors (B . Wilert , 2007) .
Therefore , the proponents think that psychology in design processes could be a solution for accident prevention .
But contenders pointed that accidents are unaccepted event that happens .
So , they are mainly due to human 'errors' .
If engineers can predict human's behavior , they will be able to design according to human's nature .
The Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (PHERP) is a technique used for works of Human Reliability Assessment (System Reliability Center , n .d) .
The purpose of THERP is to evaluate the probability of a human 'error' taking place throughout the completion of a job .
Predicting human actions during thee operation of object or system , designers and engineers can design corresponding to human actions .
For example , when a worker accidentally places his or her hand into a cutter , the worker will get hurt .
If the engineers and designers can predict that humans can be careless at work sometimes , they will design a cutter that can detect human's hand when placed inside and stop the operation immediately .
Hence engineers can produce better design with more safety if they predict human's behaviors .
Even though predicting human 'error' can help in design processes , but that cannot prevent accidents .
Engineers and designers cannot predict behavior s of every human .
During the prediction , engineers may predict human actions wrongly .
80% and more accidents are caused by human 'error' rather than fully machines or systems .
In the Sayano-Shushenskaya's hydroelectric power plant accident , the main factor that leads to the accident was human 'error' .
The system showed many warning signs about the failure in it .
The bolts that hold the turbines were 90% teared out .
Since the bolts were fatigued , the system was producing noise .
Although the system showed signs of damage , humans were negligent about the damage .
There had been three other major accidents excluding this accident since the construction of the plant .
The previous accidents in 1979 , 1985 and 1988 were caused by spring floods that overwhelmed the dam's capacity .
This shows that the design of the power plant was not stable for generating energy .
Therefore , during the psychological process of thinking , mistakes can occur which result in poor design and lead to accidents .
To close  the arguments , accidents are mistakes with bad consequences .
The Sayano-Shushenskaya's hydroelectric power plant accident would be avoided if the humans had not negligent the warning given by the system .
But psychology can only play a part in design processes to create a better design but not prevent accidents from occurring .
Humans can never work without making error .
With psychology , engineers and designers can design only to reduce human 'error' but cannot prevent human 'error' .
Therefore , accidents cannot be prevented but can be reduced by psychology in the design processes .
Apart from the engineering errors , psychology should also be taken into account with respect to safety issue .
The management committee of the Challenger space shuttle actually got a warning report about the high risk before the launch .
They were informed that the O-ring might fail to seal the fuel tank due to the low temperature .
However , in response to such a crucial warning report , they put it aside and left it to chance (The Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster , 2009) .
It was a totally irresponsible action .
Conceding that officials in NASA may have been used to high risk operation and there are certain times when the system needs to operate at high risk (Feynman , Richard Phillips ,1992) , the managers cannot straightaway ignore the problem just because the chance for the accident to take place is slim .
Their underestimation of the danger resulted in the Challenger accident directly .
If psychology could been used in their decision , if they could have thought more about their work which related to the safety of other people and the outcome of the entire program , if they really have had the sense of responsibility which results from the essence of their job , they would not rush their work and make irresponsible decision .
Thus psychology helps to evaluate the danger of the event correctthe O-ring avoid the accident to occur .
a certainReferences:
Owing to the public's concerns about the safe operation nuclear power , research and development , funding for nuclear power has been  rather minimal .
More recently , environmental concerns and rising energy demands are putting nuclear power back into the energy equation .
However , if nuclear power is to win the approval of the previously disapproving public , it will have to be more cost-effective , environmentally-friendly and almost void of security concerns .
Keeping this in mind the pioneer nations of nuclear power have come up with a few generation-IV reactor concepts (Butler , 2004) .
The earliest concept that is going to be introduced is the Sodium- Cooled fast reactor concept , which requires relatively new low pressure and temperature to operate and recycles its nuclear waste .
Examining the public's concerns with respect to the Sodium-Cooled fast reactor will give us a useful insight on the potential of nuclear power .
However , nuclear power would never be a major source of energy simply because its drawbacks far outweigh its advantages .
The final factor that we are considering is the safety of the public .
Firstly , it is almost impossible to build something that is perfectly safe .
The chance of a failure , although minute , is still present .
The consequences of any accident are vast .
If there is a leak , these radioactive substances can kill at high doses and cause cancer and birth defects at low doses .
Sodium-Cooled reactors recycle the nuclear waste so it is highly improbable that nuclear waste will end up in the wrong hands .
However , one can never be too sure .
The information on creating "dirty nuclear bombs" is readily available in the Internet and in several books too .
So there could be mass destruction if terrorists somehow get hold of uranium and decide to make nuclear bombs .
Finally , nuclear power might give rise to strained relations between nations .
For instance , if a country is utilizing nuclear power , neighbouring countries might view that country as a military threat .
Therefore , nuclear power , although very environmentally- friendly , invokes many security concerns amongst the public .
Another concern about nuclear power is that the radioactive waste is very hard to be dealt with .
The waste needs to be carefully kept away from people for several thousand years .
In addition , nuclear waste may become tools for terrorists , which is very dangerous .
However , one of the concepts of the Gen = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors , very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , can solve this problem .
In the design of VHTR system , the radioactive uranium and plutonium will run automatically into the recycle so that it can offer an enhanced waste minimization6 .
Therefore , there l be no need to worry about the nuclear waste reprocessing .
Furthermore , it is much easier for us to develop nuclear technology than explore other new energy resources .
People have already had a relatively mature technology on nuclear power .
We have known the theory and been aware of the process .
What should we do is to develop the technology other than spend much more time and money exploring a totally new field .
This turns out to be the truth .
Within a few years , people have come up with the concepts of the Gen = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors .
These concepts overcome many difficulties and make a lotypoents which can make nuclear power "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation-resistant"5 .
There have been  many engineering accidents  in the past and now they are still not avoided .
Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion is one of the incidents occurred on 26 April 1986 .
This accident killed 30 people and the radioactive effect has caused 56 fatalities till the year of 2004 (WNA , 2009) .
The main cause of  most accidents is  the  error .
It can be due to knowledge of operators , inadequate training of operators , poor design and poor communication among team members .
However , further investigations have shown that these could be prevented at the initial stage which was at the design stage .
In the journal written by Wilpert (2007) , the use of psychology in the design process could help to prevent accidents from happening or at least minimize the damage from the accidents .
It is currently encouraged to all design process especially in engineering design to have psychology knowledge involved .
Wilpert (2007) also mentioned that the most common problem encountered in everyday design product including engineering product is the different perspective between designer and user .
The designer usually thinks that the user may know how to use the product by reading through the manual provided .
This is also experienced by design engineers .
They make assumption that operators would know how to handle the equipments when the process is offset , thus a potential safety features are not necessary .
On the other hand , operators assume that designers have set all the equipment in such a way that is easy and safe for operation .
In worse condition , alarms would be triggered and equipments would be shut down .
As a result , in most accidents , operators would be pointed as the main cause of the accident .
Insufficient knowledge and training of operators result in panic under offset condition and also violating the normal procedures .
It occurred in Chernobyl disaster where the operators shut down the cooling system and removed control rods in order to maintain the power level for carrying out the test .
When there was a surge of power , they tried to put back control rods , hoping that the power  level could be lowered .
In fact , it did not happen as expected; the power increased dramatically and an explosion occurred .
When psychology is incorporated in design engineer's thoughts , this accident could be prevented .
Psychology could lead the design engineer to be aware of others either in physical or mental behaviour (Wagner , n .d .) .
Design engineer would try to see the situation from the perspective of operators .
As a result , easily-understood-understood manuals will be provided , more accurate safety systems would be installed and sufficient training and sharing session between design engineers and operators would be conducted to have common opinions instead of assumptions .
In fact , psychology had been used in the past for improving human behaviours by selecting , training and motivating the operators in industries .
However , this might have been avoided due to time constraints and financial limit which result in insufficient time for design engineers to analyse the design and looking for other cheaper materials for substitution .
As a result , one small mistake of a worker could lead to a huge damage to the plant and also to the surrounding environment especially for nuclear plant .
Therefore , nowadays there is  encouragement to have human scientists (psychologists) in the design team (Wilpert , 2007) .
Psychologist is not only a scientist seeking knowledge for others to use , but also a technologist who is actively involving in the planning and design man-operated system (Taylor , 1957) .
In other words , system design is an applied psychology because of its human reference; by converting design engineers to psychologists or at least having psychology knowledge may help in design process as they would take into account of human behavior .
A correct design at the beginning stage is very important to prevent accidents .
Most of the accidents occurred because of human errors either done by operators or even designer at the design stage .
As design engineers and operators are human beings , psychology could have been integrated in the design process to analyse possible errors from the design and human behaviours .
Moreover , with psychology knowledge , a design engineer would be capable of predicting the situation under worse condition .
Hence , system would be incorporated with proper safety features to prevent accident .
With the introduction of the Generation IV reactors in 2001 , a fresh wave of debate on Nuclear Power was brought up .
The common topics like safety , security and cost and performance are once again discussed .
The goals of Generation IV reactors are set towards sustainability , economical viability , safety and reliability , resistance to proliferation risks and protection from external attacks (Cogeneration Technologies , 2002) .
With these goals , six new models are introduced (see Table 1) , of which Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) should be further developed comparative to the other .
The reasons are  that VHTR addresses the worries of public against nuclear power , such as safety , pollution and cost and performance issues .
There is a need for our world to move towards nuclear energy due to three reasons .
Firstly , the tremendous increase in consumption of energy due to the growing population and development of nations .
Secondly , the depletion of natural resources is at a much faster rate due fore mentioned reason .
Lastly , the increased concern for global warming in recent years .
With these three reasons , it is thus wise for us to move towards relying on nuclear power for energy and support it , especially with advance technology where Generation IV reactors are so well developed as shown below .
Currently there are only about 400 nuclear plants worldwide and one of the most important concerns that hinder the development of nuclear power is its safety problem .
A nuclear  plant operates at extremely high temperatures and it relies heavily on coolants to reduce temperature .
Any malfunctioning of the cooling agent will have devastating consequences when the nuclear plant melts .
However , VHTR addresses this problem by using helium as its coolant , which can reach extremely low temperatures (Butler , 2004) .
As such , the temperature of the core is maintained at a low temperature to deter melting .
In addition , Helium itself is an inert gas , which will not react with the radioactive waste or substances in reactor .
This is much safer compared to Sodium-Cooled reactor , since Sodium is explosive in contact with air or water .
Therefore , VHTR is operating safer compared to other reactors .
testing backThis has set The first opposing factor is that , there have been accidents in many technologies that man has developed through time .
The Chernobyl and Three Mile Island incidents are no different from a normal technical error .
These errors are prone to happen in any technology with the level of complication as the nuclear technology .
But , it is to be noted that these errors are fatal and long lasting .
This has been taken into consideration always by scientists , but mistakes happen .
But in the Generation IV reactors safety is as important an issue as implementation of new technologies .
The VHTR , being "passively safe" (Hansen , 2008) , is self sustained in case of emergency by shutting itself down safely .
The present scientific advancements and engineering precision ensure the above mentioned safety feature of the VHTR .
There will be no more of nuclear spill , loss of human lives or even an injury for workers within the nuclear plant in case of in-plant emergency .
spillsThe second opposing factor is the problems that are anticipated if high grade plutonium is being produced .
In the conventional reprocessing method , uranium and plutonium are separated effectively .
This is costly and also gives manageable weapons grade plutonium as an outcome , which is not desired .
The new form of reprocessing adds more steps to the earlier process; "converting long-lived wastes to elements with shorter half-life periods" (Butler , 2004) .
This reduces storage time .
Along with the above , it also promises to "create plutonium spiked with heat-producing radioactive elements to make it too hot to handle" (Hansen , 2008) .

Two years ago on 1st August , 2007 , an accident that shocked the world happened .
The I-35W Mississippi River Bridge in the US state of Minnesota collapsed suddenly , "killing at least 7 people" .
There were at least 60 casualties and 50 vehicles thrown into the water .
(BBC News , 2007) .
The bridge was built in 1964 and officially opened to traffic in 1967 .
It consists of 8 lanes moving in two directions and is used by 140 ,000 cars a day (Minnesota Department of Transportation , 2007) .
The bridge "had been inspected annually since 1993" and "the last fracture critical inspection was in 2006" (Minnesota Department of Transportation , 2007) .
With with regard to this incident , many might argue that the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
Psychology is defined as "the science of mind and behavior" (Psychology , n .d) .
Hence , supporters to the use of psychology might argue that the use of psychology during the design process means to improve the thought process and reinforce engineering ethics .
This might have reduced the chance of the accident happening .
However , to say that it would have prevented the whole accident , I would see it as too extreme .
Secondly , supporters to use of psychology may argue that the use of psychology in the design process will improve the thought process of an engineer , thus improving the design and safety of the product which could prevent accidents from happening .
However , I would like to make use of an analogy .
To say that the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident would be as good as saying that if you studied hard and memorised everything , you would be able to prevent mistakes during the exam .
However , we all know that this cannot be true .
By studying more , it only reduces the chance of making mistakes during exam but definitely not prevent it .
Similarly , the use of psychology might reduce the chance of engineers making mistakes in their design .
However , it does not mean that they will not make mistakes as they are still factors like human error which cannot be eliminated through the use of psychology .
In the article Psychology and design processes , the author mentioned that all human beings make mistakes , including engineers .
"Design engineers may make mistakes , too , namely in their designs" (Wilpert , 2007) .
Therefore , whether or not there is the use of psychology during the design process , it is inevitable that engineers make mistakes .
Hence , it is impossible to prevent accidents from happening .
Another concern about the safety issue is very common .
The supercritical water reactor is working at much higher temperature(500 C) and pressure than the generation III reactor(Butler , 2004) .
It is a dangerous operating temperature in the concept of today .
In fact , due to the higher temperature and pressure , the reactor can , however , be safer .
At first , the whole concept of the supercritical water reactor is based on the light water reactor which has already used for years .
The technique is already mature .
The supercritical water is also used in different areas for a long time , so that the supercritical water reactor can be a practical innovation and it is very safe .
Secondly , as I mentioned above , the steam has the same density and can be mixed with the liquid , so that the whole moderator have the nearly same density everywhere .
It will be much easier to control equipmentiquid compared to the liquid mixed with the bubbles .
Actually , these voids in the liquid are chaotic and can be very dangerous because that the liquid and the steam have totally different properties .
Lastly , the special supercritical water property also makes other procedures can be easily controlled such as cooling part (Magnus , 2006) .
The supercritical water reactor can be safer compared to the light water reactor .
There are still a lot of people worrying about the nuclear waste of the supercritical water reactor (U .S . Envioromental Protection Angency , 2004) .
Some of the reactors need to depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste which will separate the plutonium which can be used to make nuclear weapons .
Nevertheless , the supercritical water reactor will not depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste , thus it will not separate the plutonium (Butler , 2004) .
Besides , the supercritical water reactor is can also be developed with a fast neutron spectrum due to the neutron will be only partly moderated in the supercritical water .
Being a fast neutron reactor will split the long lived actinides , destroying the most long lived nuclear waste through nuclear transmutation , which will greatly reduce the nuclear waste it produces and increase the efficiency of the reactor (GIF , 2007) .
From these two points , we can see that the supercritical water reactor does well in dealing with the nuclear waste .
environmentalAlthough the supercritical water reactor is still under the research , it has already shown a lot of advantages .
It successfully resolves the public doubts about the safety , configuration and the waste production and gives us a bright and promising future of the nuclear power .
I believe that the generation IV reactor will break the energy source composition and bring us to a new age of nuclear power .

We are on the brink of time whereby  global warming will affect the earth severely if we don't act appropriately .
The world population is 6 .8 billion to the current date and is increasing rapidly (US Census Bureau , 2009) .
In order to provide electricity to the increasing population , governments around the world have to build more power plants to maintain undisrupted power supply to the cities .
U .S . EIA , Energy Information Administration , estimated that up to 65% of energy sources for the power generators come from oil and coal (Hong , 1994) .
These conventional power generators contribute to the increasing trend of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere , important factor for global warming .
In order to stoop global warming , we must reduce carbon dioxide production .
One alternative way will be the Nuclear power .
Nuclear energy is produced from the fission of uranium elements in the nuclear reactors which produce massive heat .
This intense heat can be converted into energy source and distributed as electricity .
There are some public concerns regarding the safety and security of nuclear plants .
But accidents that occured in the past were mainly because of lack of skilled workers and security (Major , 2008) .
In the new Generation IV reactors , the possibilities of accidents will be minimized by allowing the reactors to run at high temperatures up to 1000 degree Celsius (Butler , 2004) .
Among the six technologies mentioned , very high-temperature reactors concept has most potential to be a breakthrough in nuclear technology and therefore its research should be further supported and funded .
By 2030 , the world demand for energy is predicted to rise by about 50 percent and by 2050 , it will be doubled .
This prediction indicates that we need to find alternative sources of energy in order to continue our daily life .
Clearly , it seems that the nuclear power is a good alternative .
However when we talk about nuclear energy , people will usually associate it with radiation , wastes and missiles .
Also public opposition was given as one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries .
With the increasing demand for energy and prices for fossil fuel , the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) comes out with the new concepts of the Generation IV nuclear reactors .
These reactors have the potential to provide safe base-load electric power with negligible pollutants (Hansen , 2008) .
Out of the six generation IV reactor concepts , I consider that the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of the best concepts for further development of nuclear reactor .
Opponents of the public of nuclear energy are worried about the safety of nuclear power in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl accident in 1986 .
Another issue is the problem of managing those radioactive wastes that are generated during the operation of nuclear reactors .
However , the generation IV reactors are able to burn existing prolonged nuclear waste , produce only a little amount of waste that will last for decades only (Hansen , 2008) .
These wastes are stored in a special concrete storage cylinder to prevent the radiation from leaking to the environment .
Besides that , the nuclear reactor design strategy of generation IV reactors for preventing accidents and mitigating their potential effects is defense in depth (Cohen , n .d) .
This will mean that there will always be a backup system to limit the harm done if something fails .
If that backup system should also fail , there will always be another back-up system to replace it .
In VHTR , helium is used as the coolant instead of water .
Since Helium is an inert gas , it will not chemically react with any material .
Furthermore , exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive , unlike most other possible coolants like water .
Lastly , the final argument made by the public is that there are many alternative cheap , clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and tidal .
Also it is possible to switch to using coal or natural gases to produce energy once fossil fuels depleted .
Yet these clean energy sources have their limitations too .
For instance , solar energy is produced when the sun is shining .
During the night or bad weather , the expensive solar equipment will be useless .
Also the amount of electric energy produced from this technology is far less than current power plants .
It is not feasible to build many solar or tidal powers all around the lands and seas .
On the other hand , Nuclear energy does not have all these limitations .
Fuel sources for it are virtually unlimited and could last much longer than fossil fuels .
Nuclear energy is also regarded as one of the clean energy available today as it doesn't produce any pollutants that contribute to environmental problems .
It is possible for nuclear energy to be the mainstream energy production when combined with other renewable energy such as solar power .
Nuclear energy also offers higher electric power efficiencies than the current power production .
Moreover due to VHTR's high operating temperature of above 1000 C , it offers the potential for cogeneration of electricity and hydrogen , alongside process heat applications ("Very-High-Temperature Reactor" , n .d) .
opponents proposed that nuclear powers are highly vulnerable as nuclear reactors have the probability of becoming terrorist target .
The incidents of core melt-down at Three Mile Island in March 1979 and the explosion and fire at Chernobyl in April cast a melancholy over the nuclear industry and it raised public fear of catastrophe .
In order to sway nuclear-adverse public , the Generation IV concept's reactors need to yield less radioactive waste at terrorist-proof facilities .
In term of security , reactors that do not reprocess nuclear waste are favored as plutonium waste , a key ingredient for developing advanced nuclear weapon , will not be generated .
To abstain nuclear proliferation , the other four reactors were eliminated , left with only two designs - very high temperature reactor (VHTR) and supercritical-water reactor (SCWR) , which would able to operate without having to reprocess and recycle plutonium waste .
Besides , Generation IV reactors employ nuclear materials , which are less suitable , or less prone to diversion for use in nuclear weapon .
For example , when  increasing the radiological intensity of materials , it is hard for people to handle it without severely exposing to radioactive if highly specialized shielding equipment is not used .
In term of cost , Generation IV reactors are designed to be economically viable .
The generating cost should not be too high but competitive as compared with other energy source .
On the other hands , the capital investment cost should be sufficiently low for developing nuclear system .
Some critics that VHTR's building cost are relatively expensive as compared to SCWR .
This is because the design of the cycle for SCWR is pretty simple as it does not require the use of jet pumps , pressurizes or dryers .
One of the greatest aspects about SCWR is the implausible small size of reactor itself , as compared as other reactors of Generation IV .
Nevertheless , some countries such as the United State and France prefers the VHTR rather the SCWR .
In spite of the fact that cost of building for VHTR is relatively higher , two products are generated for the price of one .
Besides , the VHTR deployment is earlier than most of the Generation IV reactors , which is aimed to be on the year of 2020 .
The United State energy bill would provide a sum of USD 1 .1 billion to build a research prototype at Idaho lab .
In short , VHTR is the best choice among the six Generation IV reactors .
In term of security , it produces no waste , especially plutonium , as waste goes directly into repository .
In term of cost , VHTR able to generate electricity and hydrogen for the price of one , which is estimated to be roughly $1 billion .
In term of performance , VHTR generates electricity at efficiency as high as 50% .
VHTR is likely to be the most advanced concept in terms of practical experience as Japan already operating a similar high temperature reactor at Oarai .
Nonetheless , VHTR faces material constraints as the materials used to design reactors must be able to withstand continued high temperature , intense bombardment in nuclear proliferation and corrosive reagents .
Therefore , it is ideal that GIF should start siphoning funds to conduct intensive researches on nuclear power plants .
Thirdly , the VHTR employs stringent security measures to combat intruders .
The whole perimeter is under 24 hour surveillance by armed guards .
Furthermore , in an event of a nuclear leak , they have a system distributing iodine pills to residents within a 10 mile radius .
Though these are impressive , the round-the-clock security cannot protect against attacks like crashes and the time taken to deliver the pills may be far too long to prevent much damage .
The MSR however , employs measures such that little or no fissile materials are emitted .
The MSR is highly protected from nuclear proliferation due to its clever waste recycling of fission materials .
It converts Uranium-233 into unusable fissile material by adding Thorium .
This cycle bypasses the stage where Plutonium-239 is produced .
(Andre , 2009) Instead it produces a variety of Plutonium isotopes that cannot be used to make nuclear weapons .
Without weapons grade plutonium in the purest form , the effectiveness of  . . is reduced the effectiveness of explosions .
U-233 is more radioactive compared to the conventional U-235 used today .
As a result , the usage of U-233 has also posed concerns to both staff working in the MSR .
More funding is needed to safeguard the staff handling fissile material .
U-233 also damages electronics , and thus , not feasible in a bomb .
However this additional safety cost incurred would be well spent if the threat of nuclear proliferation can be obliterated .
Using nuclear power is the harnessing of energy released from the nuclear fission of uranium atom .
This energy released is used to turn the turbines in the nuclear reactors and generate electricity from them .
There are new generations IV reactors which are proposed to provide better output and safer mechanism in operating them .
With these features taken into consideration , the thought of building the new generation IV reactors is getting more real .
However , the possibility of a core meltdown cannot be denied judging from the accidents like Three Miles Island and Chernobyl(Butler ,2004) .
Therefore , the concept of generation IV reactors should not receive further research and development funding due to three factors , security , cost and performance .
When the concept of the super-critical-water-cooled reactors is introduced , it will be much cheaper to build compared to the other conventional ones .
It is cheaper because of the reactor's efficiency and simpler design which just uses water as a coolant and it is readily available(Butler ,2004) .
Moreover , the introduction of this concept will produce electricity that is as cheap as those produced by coal and gas .
However , the cost of building nuclear reactors has to be evaluated first before even starting to build them .
(Foulke and Burnett ,2005) .
It is expensive to build a new nuclear reactor , taking into consideration the area of land needed , the cost of buying the nuclear fuel for energy processing , the cost of the coolant and the cost of the construction materials .
In the U .S , sixty-three billion dollars is needed to build a new reactor and the maintenance and the operating costs are not included in it(O'Reilly ,2007) .
The money invested can be used to improve healthcare or even  harness  other forms of energy like solar energy to produce electricity .
The building of nuclear reactors is not necessary for smaller countries in Asia like Singapore .
This is because nuclear reactors have a safety zone buffer of thirty kilometres and Singapore has a radius less than that .
Therefore , the cost needed to build the nuclear reactors can be used for other uses .
The stealing of nuclear waste raises a possibility of selling them on the market , causing a breakthrough in technology and more nuclear bombs to be made .
The cost of building a nuclear reactor is very expensive compared to the harnessing of other forms of energy .
The cost of the building does not include the cost of fuel , building materials and the cost of land needed to build the reactors .
With the increase in outside temperature , the performance of the nuclear reactors will drop as it is dependent on the temperature of the nuclear cores .
In conclusion , the supercritical-water-cooled reactors should not receive further research and development funding for it , the rise of terrorism and the making of nuclear bombs from nuclear waste make nuclear reactors a controversial issue .
Cries of terror and bloodcurdling screams filled the night air as the familiar dome shaped structure in the distance began to glow amber red .
In a flash , it was all over , all there was left was rubble .
All signs of life were obliterated and everything was razed to ground zero .
This may just be a typical scenario in the event of a nuclear explosion .
The Chernobyl accident that happened in 1986 had caused people to resent the development of nuclear power .
Many antinuclear groups such as the Greenpeace organizations have sprung up overnight to rally against the development of nuclear power for the fear of the recurrence of such nuclear catastrophe .
Besides being safe and economic , nuclear power is also environmental friendly as it does not produce any greenhouse gases such as Carbon Dioxide in the case of fossil fuel burning plants .
The spent fuel rod used in nuclear power plant can be reprocessed and reused , this reduces the amount of nuclear waste that need to be stored permanently .
is Under such harsh circumstances , many energy experts strongly advise that we should approach other new energy sources , such as bio-energy , solar energy and wind energy .
Nuclear power is also a promising alternative that we should not overlook .
Till now nuclear scientists and engineers have already put forward the new six generation IV nuclear reactor concepts .
Molten salt reactor is one of them and it adopts a molten salt mixture as a coolant in its reactor core .
Here is an evaluation of the MSRs in terms of performance , safety , waste and cost , compared to traditional nuclear reactors .
The Spacee article "Psychology and design process" , Mr . Wilpert acknowledged that the social perception of psychology and the social sciento us was the main reason why people cannot accept psychology as a useful method to improve the safety of systems in designing process (2006) .
Same as in the Columbia issue , a lot of people just focused on the physical cause of the accident and arbitrarily claimed that it was only the engineering errors that result in the final disaster .
It seems that the people above believe they can ensure the safety by just solving the existent problems .
However , I have to say that these people are so short-sighted that they did not find the fundamental solutions .
It is true that every time we can fix the known errors after the accident .
Nevertheless , it is just a kind of useless latter-wit .
On the contrary , with the help of psychology , we can actually analyze people's minds and behavresultedn order to find and deal with any potential problems in time .
In the following paragraph , I will focus on two aspects to explain my viewpoints , viz .
Design of the Space Shuttle and problem solving decision .
As  mankind has entered the 21 century , the need for fuel has become increasingly pressing , which has exceeded the amount of fuel required in the past century by most 50 percent .
To solve the complex function of the world's need for more fuel , the solution lies in , as suggested by scientists and engineers worldwide , the generation IV nuclear reactors , which are capable of generating the power needed at a far more efficient rate compared to the contemporary power plants .
There are altogether six designs for the generation IV reactors while this essay will focus on one of them named very-high-temperature reactor or VHTR in short and expound on the reasons why it is worth all the research and money put into it .
Generation IV reactors are designed to achieve certain goals , some of which involve generating clean and efficient energy , replacing fossil fuel and increasing resource utilization .
The VHTR is specially designed to achieve these goals because it can withstand core temperature as high as 1000 degrees , even the highest among all the generation IV reactors .
Having established some common understanding of the VHTR , there are basically three reasons why the VHTR should receive continuous funding and research .
First and the most concerned reason of all is that the VHTR guarantees a high degree of safety .
Being graphite-moderated and helium-cooled , it doesn't melt easily due to the extremely high melting point of graphite nor does it allow any corrosion of the chamber as helium is a very inert gas which is resistant to reactions that lead to corrosive substances .
This property should well fend off the critics using the meltdown accidents that happened at Three Mile Island and Ukraine , as the possibility of such accidents happening to a reactor able to function properly at 1000 degrees is insignificant .
Secondly , the VHTR produces energy in a very efficient manner .
The VHTR allows for more than 50% of more electricity to be produced from the same amount of fuel intake compared to the conventional reactors .
It burns up to 65% of uranium compared to only 5% for conventional reactors .
As the non-renewable resources are running out , the VHTR provides an excellent alternative solution to energy generation .
Thirdly , the VHTR produces a by-product , hydrogen gas , which is considered as another environmental-friendly source of energy .
At high temperature (700-900) , H2 is split from water and can be further utilized as fuel for transportation and factories .
This reduces burning of fossil fuels , like oil , which generates toxic gases .
This property , which can never be reached by the current reactors , serves to preserve the environment by replacing the contaminating fossil fuels using hydrogen gas .
Despite the fact that the VHTR brings tons of benefits to the mankind , there are certain negative facts which impede the officials from making up their minds on the funding .
The cost issue is certainly the most depressing thing among all .
For each nuclear reactor , an astounding amount of one billion has to be pumped into the construction .
As predicted , a generation IV reactor design is not to be realized before 2030 .
With some degree of uncertainty over the possibilities of putting a VHTR into operation , such a huge bill is difficult to be issued anytime soon .
Moreover , alternative solutions of fuel are not necessarily constrained by generation IV reactors as sources like solar power which require much less funding than the reactors are being intensely researched upon .
Hence the realization of VHTR is not as cost competitive as those alternatives .
Another problem is that the researches into the materials required by the containers and pipes are not going to produce useful results in the near future .
Due to the fact that the VHTR should withstand extremely high temperatures , the materials for the chamber must be ultra hard and corrosion resistant , many times better than those that we have already discovered .
These two problems , together with a few others , may disrupt further research into and funding for the VHTR .
In conclusion , for the long term consideration , the VHTR is worth the research into and money spent on it as it not only generates energy highly efficiently but produces a by-product which is also a source of clean energy .
The fact that the potential problems will be well dealt with should further strengthen people's belief in the VHTR .
First of all , opponents of this psychological approach towards engineering design insist that the faulty valve was the key factor and main cause of the incident , and that psychology could not have prevented it .
However , operators could have picked up this fault if the design of the instrument gave clear and proper signals .
In this case , the instruments that were used did not (U .S .NRC , 2009) .
Consequently , it resulted in a "Design Induced Human Error"(Nelson & Associates) , and this led to an aggravation of the situation .
It can be seen that if psychology had been incorporated into the design of the instruments , the engineers of the instruments could have anticipated such a problem and included a device to alert the operators in a case when the valve and its related parts fail .
The nuclear reactor meltdown in Chernobyl in the year 1986 has became a dark age in the implementation of nuclear power .
Since then , nuclear power has often been thought to be dangerous and therefore undermining the benefits that it can bring about .
In his article , Butler (2004) states six generation four reactor concepts including the sodium cooled fast reactor , which is much safer compared to older generations of nuclear reactors .
Therefore , technology can reduce the risks of nuclear power and therefore ensure the safety of it .
Thus , the implementation of nuclear energy to generate electricity should be encouraged .
Firstly , the reactor meltdown accident in Chernobyl , 1986 has became a reason to prove that nuclear power is dangerous and should not be encouraged .
However , the accident occurred in the year 1986 and there have been no similar major accidents since then .
Thus , it can be observed that technological advancements can increase the safety of nuclear power .
Donald (2004) indicates that the accident in Chernobyl was allowed to happen because the reactor was not placed in a containment building , therefore allowing the nuclear radiation to be released into the atmosphere , causing huge losses in human lives .
Donald (2004) also states that the Chernobyl accident would not happen in other nuclear power plants as they are all placed in a containment building .
This is the main reason as to why the reactor meltdown accident in Three Mile Island did not cause any deaths or injuries .
Therefore , it can be shown that technology can be used to reduce the dangers of nuclear power .
Nuclear power , an alternative source of electricity , could be the answer to this major problem .
According to a statistic by the "World Nuclear Association (2009)" , about 15% of the world's electricity generation comes from nuclear power .
Despite being the most prominent replacement for coal and fuel , nuclear reactors received strong opposition from the public masses .
The public's main concerns of nuclear reactors are the high cost of nuclear plants and nuclear research , the hazard that it poses and whether the nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases .
Nevertheless , further research and development funding is needed for generation IV reactor concept , namely the "Very-High Temperature" reactor .
As cited from Idaho National Laboratory (2009) , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor or "VHTR" is a helium-cooled reactor which is graphite-moderated , with a one time uranium fuel cycle .
It uses high core outlet temperatures that enable hydrogen and electricity production .
Firstly , detractors claimed that nuclear reactors and their corresponding researches cost lots of resources and money , so much that it is not economically worth taxpayer's money to build and research nuclear technologies .
According to statistics from "The Virtual Nuclear Tourist (2005)" , taking fuel , capital , operation , maintenance and waste related costs into considerations , coal cost 29 .1 $/Mw-hr while nuclear power cost 30 $/Mw-hr .
The difference in monetary value between conventional coal processing and nuclear power is not that big a difference .
Furthermore , "Very-High Temperature" reactors do not need to spend any money on waste recycling as all the waste goes directly to the repository .
This means that the cost of this technology is about the same , if not , less  than conventional coal processing .
Secondly , opponents doubt the safety of using nuclear reactors and the possible hazards that it might pose .
Ever since the Chernobyl accident , many fear that history will repeat itself .
They are worried that the safety of their children will be at stake .
According to history , there have been only two major reactor accidents due to civil nuclear power , namely the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
As referred from the World Nuclear Association (2008) , these two accidents are the only two in the 12 ,700 reactor-years of commercial operation of in 32 countries .
Moreover , ever since the Chernobyl accident which happened in 1986 , the standards for safety in nuclear reactors have greatly increased .
Unlike the past , nuclear reactors now come with equipment that prevent operational disturbances which will in turn develop into problems .
In addition , sub systems are also implemented to detect problems and prevent significant radioactive releases .
All these new implementations come in all generation IV reactors , including the "Very-High Temperature Reactors" .
Thirdly , critics questioned if nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases and claimed that nuclear power will never be able to replace coals and fuel in the near future .
As stated , nuclear reactors are already generating about 15% of the world's electricity needs .
According to the World Nuclear Organization (2008) , a single average nuclear power reactor generates about 12 .4 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy .
Generation IV reactors , namely the VHTR , generates not only electricity , but also hydrogen .
Hydrogen is much needed in motor vehicle industries where future vehicles will most likely run on hydrogen fuels when coal and oil eventually runs out .
According to the study , with proper experience in both techniques , there is no advantage in applying the Da Vinci Surgical SystemSystem (A .A . , 2005) .
This raised issue of whether is there a need to move to a stage of incorporating robots into the operation theatre .
With uncertainties of whether the safety and cost will be resolved , are they worth the risk to adopt when there are no clear advantages in them ?
"Try to use chopsticks through a very small hole .
You're not going to be very good with them .
But if you have a robot that can project the dexterity of your hands through a small incision , then you can do complex things" , cited Dr . David Yuh , assistant professor of surgery in the division of cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore .
(Kristen , 2005) In comparison to traditional approaches , the robotic system will have greater surgical precision , increased range of motion , improved dexterity , enhanced visualization and improved access .
These will benefit patients by causing less pain less pain , less risk of infection , less blood loss , fewer transfusions , less scarring , faster recovery and a quicker return to normal daily activities .
(Intuitive Surgical , 2009) For example , most heart surgical procedures are done through the sternum , a flat bone of the rib cage .
This method of operation causes much distress and pain to the patient as compared to if it is done using the Minimal Invasive System (MIS) approach .
However , human limitations do not allow a smooth MIS procedure when it comes to heart operations .
This is where the improved dexterity the robot offers becomes handy .
Experts have predicted that with the current ever-increasing usage of energy , the fossil fuels on Earth will be used up in the next fifty years .
Alternative forms of energy have to be developed to solve this issue .
Nuclear energy is one of the alternatives which can be used .
The very high temperature reactor (VHTR) is a Generation IV reactor concept which operates at around 900 to 1000 degree Celsius .
It has a higher efficiency than the conventional coal reactors .
However , there is much dispute over the use of nuclear reactors .
Safety issues and costs are the main reasons for the public to oppose the usage of VHTR .
Even with these arguments , there is still a need to develop VHTR as a source of energy for the future .
incomplete sentence
The public are afraid that the high temperatures in the nuclear reactors will be a major hazard for the people working in and those living near the reactors .
People fear that the high temperatures will increase the possibilities of having an explosion in the reactors .
VHTR uses helium , an inert and fireproof gas , as the coolant instead of water used by the conventional reactors .
Thus , it will not result in a steam explosion , which can happen in reactors using water as a coolant .
In addition , VHTR is designed to work under high temperatures .
It has a reliable safety backup system whereby in case of machinery failures , the reactor will submissively fall to a safe energy level , without damaging the reactor vessels or the fuel spheres , allowing corrections to be made safely (MIT , 2003) .
Hence , this shows that safety precautions have been set to prevent accidents .
On the other hand , instead of being a threat , the high temperatures can be used to produce hydrogen , which can eventually be converted into electricity for the public , making VHTR more efficient compared to coal reactors and even some of the other Generation IV reactor concepts .
In short , the high temperatures will not become a threat to the public as safety measures are taken to prevent accidents; instead , the high temperatures can be used to improve the efficiency of VHTR .
Finally , opponents of nuclear reactors fear that plutonium which can be found in nuclear waste will be used for terrorism .
Plutonium is an element which can be made into nuclear weapons; it is only available when the nuclear waste is reprocessed .
However , according to Butler (2004) , VHTR does not reprocess nuclear waste .
As a result , plutonium will not be separated out from the waste .
This can ease the fears of the public that terrorists will make nuclear reactors their potential target .
In brief , nuclear weapons cannot be made without plutonium; as a consequence , VHTR will less likely be a target for terrorist .
With the explosion of global population , the world is demanding more energy than ever .
Non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels will soon be depleted within decades and we need to find new sources of energy to sustain the global civilisation .
Current renewable sources such as solar power , wind power and hydroelectric power are not sufficient to keep up with the growing demands .
Hence nuclear power is becoming a more viable option as it produces consistent output of electricity in large amounts .
incomplete sentence .
Furthermore , the consequences of it are not  so well-known and researched  yet as nuclear technology has not been around for a very long time .
But in reality , burning of fossil fuels for energy are damaging the environment and public health too , which may , to a certain extent , causes even more damage than a safe operating nuclear power plant .
Nuclear power is a feasible choice to meet the demands of the world energy needs as the output is highly efficient and consistent out of all the renewable sources , new generation nuclear reactors are safer and cheaper to operate and are more secure not just with the heavy fortification but also simplified fail-safe mechanisms which can automatically prevent disasters triggered by accident .
In conclusion , the VHTR offers good prospects to be the next generation of reactors .
The flexibility and higher efficiency of VHTR allow it to be competitive in the near future .
Furthermore , non-proliferation of plutonium through VHTR process reduces the production of WMD .
However , the threat of nuclear accidents still persist and it is up to our own engineers to further resolve this threat .
Thus , funds should be provided in this case to strengthen the passive safety design in VHTR reactors .
First of all , opponents state that nuclear power has some safety problems .
First , they say that the generation Ikeepsre very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , which react in both high temperature and pressure .
It is very dangerous because nuclear reactors are very likely to explode under the condition of high temperature and pressure .
Second , the key element of the nuclear power Plutonium is a radioactive metal ebring , which would release large number of radiation in decay and reactions .
The radiation would do harm to human health in the long-term study .
Whereas , to the problem of high temperature and pressure , scientist put forward some corresponding improvements in generation IV reactors .
First , we take fluoride salts as the coolant for molten salts reactors in the reactions .
The fluoride salts are "thermodynamically stable (i .e . , they do not decompose upon heating)" and have the good effect of cooling CITATION WFo07 \l 2052 (W .Forsberh , Peterson , & Zhao , 2007) .
Moreover , comparing with other generation IV reactors like Gas-cooled fast reactors and Supercritical-water-cooled reactors , the pressure for molten salts reactors is low .
Furthermore , the molten salts reaction facilities are made of thick reinforced concrete .
Reinforced concrete has the characters of firmness and anti high temperature .
This kind of material can absorb radiation produced by the plutonium , so that the radiation will be greatly reduced .
Therefore , the high temperature and pressure in process and radioactivity of the element are not big problems to affect nuclear power research .
characteristicsBesides the safety , some people also concern the security of nuclear power .
Since most reactions of generation IV reactors are waste recycling reactions , the main element Plutonium may be stolen in the process of recycling .
Plutonium is also can be used to make nuclear weapons , it is possible to be stolen by some terrorists .
Thus , it would be a big danger for the world .
However , to this concern , many nations and international institutes in the world have put many efforts on security enhancement and have made some achievements .
To instance , National Nuclear Security of U .S has the Defense Nuclear Security program which is "responsible for securing the nuclear weapons and components , and hundreds of tons of special nuclear material in all forms , shapes and sizes" CITATION Nuc09 \l 2052 (Nuclear Security) .
In the future , there will be greater development of the nuclear security system to protect against the waste stealing and nuclear terrorism .
In addition , opponents state thaare also concernedoabout is also a problem of further research for nuclear power .
It is not only very costly to build a nuclear power plant , but also , the cost for waste recycling process is extremely big .
However , in fact , to do long-term perspective , nuclear power woulfor it to be stolenely less costly .
For example , there is a research to compare the cost of nuclear power and the cost of the most common power resource , coals .
Researchers point that taking 40 years as a period , even though nuclear power is more costly than coal power in the first 7 .5 years , it will be cost saving in the rest 32 .5 years CITATION Sol06 \l 2052 (Solbrig & Bnedict , 2006) .
Moreover , nuclear power can generate much more energy thaN the coal power and is more friendly to environment .
Hence , considering long-term interests , people should encourage further research for nuclear power .
First of all , safethas is always the primary concern when introducing a newly developed technology .
The researchers who are in favour of VHTR argue that the resource of VHTR , helium - an inertia gas with low chemical activity is much safer than sodium , the coolant of SFR .
If the sodium leaks from the core then there could be a tremendous explosion .
This could be a serious threat to safety .
Although it is true that sodium is relatively active , there is an extra loop in the SFR producing process in order to prevent the accident (Carlsson , Tucek , &Wider , 2005) .
Moreover , there are several cycles in the process of SFR and each individual is segregated .
Therefore it is hardly that the reactor will leak out .
Besides the chemical behavior , the operating condition is another element responsible for the safety .
According to Carlsson , Tucek and Wider's conclusion (2005) , the probability of incurring the accident of losing coolant is proportional to the operating temperature and pressure .
VHTR requires quite high operating temperature at 1000 Celsius and pressure .
On the contrary , SFR is best performed under low pressure and only 350 to 500 Celsius degree (Butler , 2004) .
Hence the operating conditions make the SFR practically safe as a result of the low possibility of incurring the losing coolant accident .
Lastly , there is no separate plutonium generated in all processes of SFR , which is a highly radioactive and toxic element .
As a result , the proliferation can be controlled .
Apart from the safety of nuclear power , the high efficiency is another factor that prompts the researchers to promote SFR method .
The Department of Nuclear Energy of University of California , Berkeley (2009) , announced that the thermal efficiency of SFR could be upgraded to 47 percent resulting from the reheat and inter-cooling process design , which is a breakthrough in terms of the efficiency of energy conversion .
Unlike the VHTR , the SFR utilizes metallic fuel with neutron spectrum , which is capable of transmuting the raw materials to green energy efficiently .
Not only is the efficiency the breakthrough , but also the recycle of resource is very remarkable .
The recycle model of SFR is unique ande best among the six methods in the fourth generation .
As part of the waste of SFR can be re-utilized again as the resource of the reactor , the whole process acts like a self-supply system .
This quality can solve the resource shortage problem of the majority of energy supply methods .
Also , the recycle concept best explains the green technology .
The world's energy is going towards depletion , and many countries are seeking  alternative energy sources .
To meet future energy needs , a framework in research for Generation IV nuclear energy systems have been agreed on by 10 countries , which later combine to form the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) to develop future-generation nuclear energy systems (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 1) .
Very-High-Temperature Reactor , also known as VHTR in abbreviation , is one of the six Generation IV reactors selected by GIF .
There are claims against building VHTR due to safety issues relating to materials .
Critics also claim that there are potential dangers in operating a reactor and disapprovals on high cost to build a VHTR .
Nevertheless , these arguments are not true and VHTR technology should be adopted as it is designed to benefit the society .
First of all , opponents who object in building VHTR claim that people are worried about the materials that need to withstand temperature up to 1000oC and high pressure (about 50 atm) .
This argument is not true as scientists and experts have done research on the materials need to withstand the requirements currently .
Chen and some associating scientists (n .d .) had already done some investigations on X-ray absorption and synchrotron X-ray for analysis of VHTR- materials (The Applicability of Synchrotron X-ray Analyses for VHTR Materials , pp .
1-13) , while Bill Corwin (2003) mentioned that demonstrations had already been done to 900oC and above 1000 psi (approximately 68 atm) (Materials for Very-High-Temperature Reactor , p . 13) .
Shuwen "Eric" Wang (2005) also pointed out that a new coating material zirconium carbide has been found (p . 6) .
With the scientists' strong commitment and dedication and strong foundation in research , suitable materials will be expected to be found in due time .
People are worried about the potential dangers brought by operating the nuclear reactor; however , the design of VHTR has assured people the improvement in its original gas-cooled reactor's safety features .
Helium gas is introduced as a primary heat coolant because of its chemically unreactive properties (Shuwen "Eric" Wang , 2005 , p . 9) and has good thermal properties .
According to GIF (2008) , VHTR is recognized in terms of safety features of fuel and reactor .
Passive heat removal system is developed to simplify the operation of the reactor , which requires no short-term human intervention (Shuwen "Eric" Wang , 2005 , p . 9) .
In addition , Shuwen Wang (2005) has also pointed  out that "improved control rods and reserve shutdown systems are capable of terminating fission process to control reactivity" (Very High Temperature Reactor Safety Characteristics , p . 10) .
These affirmations hold true that potential dangers are minimized dramatically .
The view that support the use of psychology could have prevented the accident shows that the design errors directly cause the accident and removing these errors would remove the accident .
As Wilpert (2007) states , safety of engineering design depends on three things , namely , effectivpconcernedowith safety rol and failure avoidance .
However , the Chernobyl reactor , reactor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalniy (RBMK) , was designed with problems of all these three aspects .
Firstly , in the RBMK reactor , the process of insertion of rods , which are to regulate the reaction speed , is inefficient and there is no fast rod for emergency .
It takes 20 seconds for a full insertion and this is too slow to prevent the core from running away when the reaction is under the unstable mode (Frot , 2001) .
Moreover , the rods are designed with graphite tip which , when first inserted , will increases the reactivity .
Secondly , the production control of RBMK is poor .
The core of the reactor is unstable at low power .
When the accident happened , the reactor was at a test of low power , working with only a quarter of full power .
Thirdly , the RBMK reactor has almost nothing to prepare for out coming gases .
Without either a system to filter exhaust neither gases nor a containment structure (Frot , 2001) , the release of radioactivity could quickly spread in all directions and causes more serious results .
As analyzed , by removing the errors above , the accident can be prevented .
Hence psychology should be functional for preventing the accident .
increaseHowever , the opposite side announces that whatever we can do with psychology would not prevent the happening of the accident .
The main support of this point of view is that human knowledge and experiences are limited and we cannot avoid all the mistakes even if we have excellent psychology .
Twenty years ago , nuclear power engineering had just developed and engineers lacked experiences .
Moreover , the experiences and development may come from testing or even accidents .
The opposite side actually argues with not very concrete reasons since almost all the design errors that causes the Chernobyl accident are within human ability at that time .
First of all , this error had already been noted three years before the Chernobyl accident , but it was not removed by any designer (SFEN , 1996) .
Secondly , the instability of the reactor RBMK had already experienceby the engineersexperienceme , but the warning did not change anything (Segodnio , 1993) .
For the third factor , the containment for leaking gases is not a complicated structure and what they should do is no more than investing some more money to build it .
For the facts mentioned above , we can conclude that the accident actually could be prevented if the designers gain good enough psychology that concern much for safety problems .
Nuclear power is nowadays universally acknowledged as a clean and economical energy source , and it is needed to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels which are limited due to geographical reasons and environmental concerns .
However , there were two serious reactor accidents in the history of civil nuclear power: Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 .
The latter one caused 31immmediate death and both spewed a heavy dose of radiation which has far-reaching negative effect on the ecosystem in vicinity .
Thus , to enhance safety , scientists and engineers are obligated to investigate  the incidents and find out the causes .
Like what Bernhard Wilpert once stated , it is never a single component failure that leads to accidents (Safety Science , 2007) .
One of the influential factors is the human error .
Targeting on this issue , the concept of "passive safety systems" has been proposed in the field of nuclear power .
Different from the active systems , theses passive ones require no operator intervention and merely rely on utilizing the gravity , natural convection (natural circulation) , materials' expansion on heating and other physical laws .
So far , although there have been several concerns raised on these systems , such as the understanding of their reliability , limited opportunity to manage events , etc . , they are reliable  , economical and safe to operate .
Another concern is that if a nuclear power plant has an entirely passive system , there is no or very limited opportunity to manage events or post the incident and perhaps operators will not be able to turn valves off remotely .
Nonetheless , director of reactor systems of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd . claimed that the design was robust and relying on gravity can possibly gain a ten-fold increase in safety than traditional pumps and valves (Mayson R . , 2002) .
Moreover , the objective of passive safety systems is to completely eliminate core degradation in the design (A .K .
Nayak , R .K . Sinha , 2007) which makes the reactions much reliable and back-up systems are set available to avoid totally reliance on only one kind of system .
Thus , the danger coefficient is greatly reduced .
Due to the fact that a passive safety concept offers an opportunity to effect a large simplification (in the form of reduction of human intervention and external source of power) , costs on the construction of nuclear power plants are cut down significantly .
As in a virtuous circle , the saved capital can then be put into more research use and equipment maintenance .
Therefore , safety is ensured step by step .
Within 30 years , nuclear energy has transformed from an exotic , futuristic idea into a world-shaping technology .
As a cheap and clean alternative source of power that is free from greenhouse gases , nuclear energy is now becoming more appealing compared with traditional fossil fuels , and its popularity can be easily perceived from the 441 operating plants in 33 countries worldwide by the end of 2009 (Lehr , J . , 2009) Nuclear Energy in the World Today) .
Although the nature of nuclear energy has associated it with various risks , they will not change the fact that the benefits it brings to mankind greatly outweigh any potential problems that may arise .
One more major drawback of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is that it has allowed the production of nuclear weapons .
As Einstein has said before , "I don't know what weapon will people fight with in world war three , but I know that they will use stones and sticks in world war four" .
The destructive power of nuclear weapon has long been a threat to the entire human being .
As concerning the 911 disaster , terrorists may possibly target nuclear facilities or use radioactive materials for massive destruction .
From my perspective , in cases like these , it is not the double-edged nuclear technology to blame , but the hands that touch it .
This is an unavoidable dilemma for the advancement of science and everyone has to accept the unforeseeable risks when they are enjoying the benefits .
Overall , nuclear energy holds bright prospects as a front edge technology that would allow us to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels , occupying less land yet generating more power .
However , in order for the industry to reach its full potential , we must find ways to address the problem of safe operation , waste disposal and security issues as well .
Lastly , SCWR gives a low cost of production of energy .
The opposition of nuclear reactors criticize that nuclear energy is expensive due to the huge cost required in research and development .
They also argued that are alternative methods like solar and wind power can be implemented .
However , nuclear energy is in fact one of the least expensive energy sources .
According to Moore (2006) , in 2004 , the average cost of generating energy from nuclear reactor was comparable with conventional methods in the US .
Furthermore , advanced research will bring the cost down in the future .
According to Butler (2004) , S .C .W .R is cheap due to its simple design compare to generation III reactors .
Also , wind and solar power are intermittent and unpredictable .
They are unable to replace big base-load nuclear plants such as coal like generation IV nuclear reactors do .
Therefore , nuclear energy is the only viable substitutes .
It is understood that with the building of Generation IV nuclear reactors , it will generate a large amount of jobs like hard labour during construction phase and highly skilled engineers for day to day maintenance and operation .
Day to day operation jobs are the key to solve unemployment issue as they provide long term employment opportunity in the country .
However , this may not ease the problem of unemployment problem in a country like Kosovo with high unemployment rate .
As 16 .5% of Kosovo's population in the agriculture sector indicating that the locals are mainly of low education level (CIA , 2009) .
This will result to have more foreign highly skilled engineers being employed for the daily operation jobs .
Therefore , constructing Generation IV reactors will only benefit the country mostly in the hard labour work during construction phase that provide short term jobs between 3 to 5 years but not in a long run .
Poverty is often link with the problem of unemployment in one country .
Initial study indicates that with the high operating temperature of Generation IV reactors , it will generate hydrogen and electricity (Bulter , 2004) .
The hydrogen gas is believed to a future source of fuel which can be sold to other countries as another source of income .
However , the income will not be useful to the locals as it will not be directed to them .
Developing countries should provide long term and stable jobs for their people .
In this case , alternate sources of energy like solar energy could be considered as the price of solar panels are on a decline (Solarbuzz , 2009) instead of spending billions of dollars building Generation IV reactors .
Solar energy is also environmental friendly like nuclear power and is free with the sunlight predicted to continue to radiate energy for another 5 billion years (Arnett , 2009) .
This will be a good solution as it provides stable job and also ensuring that energy is aplenty for a long time .
As the maintenance of a solar energy plant requires many low knowledge based technicians , this will help to create long term jobs for the locals .
This in turn will help to ease the problem of poverty and unemployment in developing countries .
Developing countries should solve the problem of high unemployment rate and poverty within the country as priority rather than to build a generation IV reactor .
The initial cost of building a generation IV nuclear reactor is a multi billion dollars project .
Furthermore , the Generation IV reactors are still in the research stage (Bulter , 2004) which suggested that there are still plenty of questions and uncertainty that link to the safe operation before it can be consider complete .
Therefore , funding should be directed to other energy source like solar power where solar energy are environmental friendly and free (Energy Information Administration , n .d) .
This will create many low knowledge based job for the developing countries as the local citizens are not highly educated .
As building a nuclear reactor might result in having more foreigners  being  employed than the locals as it is a high knowledge based job .
Among all these reactors , thehas gradually becomecritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) is the most suitable concept for funding and development .
The use of supercritical coolant would allow for a more compact design , since steam generators , dryers , circulation pumps and pressurizers would not be needed , hence achieving a better economy .
And it is also promised to have higher thermal efficienciesapproximately 45% versus the current 33% of light water reactors .
This system presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design .
Therefore , it is feasible to design such a kind of nuclear reactor .
However , SCWR faces some resistances .
Some people argue that its operation condition is highly required and there is potential hazard and worry of nuclear terrorism .
In spite of these opposing views , these problems can be solved through developed techniques and theories .
One of these opposing points is about its highly-required condition .
High temperature (510--550) and very high pressure (about 25 MPa) is required for SCWR .
This condition requires high-quality materials , and consequently , much money would be spent on research to find these materials .
Nevertheless , there indeed exist some advanced matals that can satisfy these requirements .
And many new successful studies are going on .
One of the ideal materials is the alloy MA956 .
It has excellent oxidation resistance up to 1370(2400) and significant creep strength up to its usually high melting point of 1482(2700) .
Thicker secay be used up to 1370(2500) .
Corrosion-resistance is excellent for this material .
Therefore , material is no longer a problem .
Furthermore , SCWR is promised to supply low-cost electricity , and simpler design can minimize the cost , too .
Thus it is acceptable and worthy to spend some money on the further material research .
As we mention the simple design above , many people's common opposing view is that lacking some kinds of designs may cause some unexpected dangers , since the design is still on paper .
But we should have known that we do not just use water as coolant only this time in SCWR .
In fact , many generation III reactors , such as advanced pressurized water reactor (APWR) , advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) , economic simplified boiling water reactor (ESBWR) , involve water as coolant .
The design and structure of the reactor are quite similar , and therefore we are very experienced in the design .
This system , as I mentioned before , presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design .
The eliminated design like circulation pumps , steam generators and steam separators would not affect the safety factor at all , while the eliminated pressurizworthwhiledspendingmay affect a little .
However , we can assume that experienced experts in this field can overcome such little obstacle .
obstaclesSince nuclear waste separates out plutonium , which is a key ingredient of nuclear weapon , many people may be concerned about terrorists' attacks on nuclear power plant or accidental explosions .
Security enhancement has already been made since the day nuclear energy was born .
We improve these security devices day by day .
By now , these techniques are very advanced .
Scientists have added steps to lengthen stored time of waste .
In fact , there are fewer accidental explosions in recent years .
And of course we specially make security systems to minimize the nuclear radiation if the plant is attacked by terrorists .
Besides , defending systems are enhanced and increased when a plant is built .
To conclude , despite these opposing arguments , SCWR has an absolutely promising future for the nuclear energy .
Therefore , it should be encouraged in further research and development funding .
As fossil fuels are non-renewable natural resources , it is unwise to be too dependent on them as our main source of energy .
Being non-renewable , the price of fossil fuels would only get more expensive as time passes .
Moreover , as burning fossil fuels to generate energy releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere , it would be ideal to find a replacement source of energy as early as possible to lessen the global warming effect .
All these major factors have have led many countries to start looking for alternative sources of energy to replace the usage of fossil fuels .
One of these alternative sources would be using nuclear power .
Currently , nuclear power is rejected by the public due to its risk of operation , cost and performance .
However , the new developments of Generation IV reactors show promises as future source of energy .
In order for these new generations of reactors to take over as sources of energy , resources must be invested into it before these ideas can turn into reality .
Out of these Generation IV reactors , the VHTR seems to be the most ideal to be invested for development .
In order to fund the development of the VHTR , support of the public need to be gained through evaluation of its security , costs and performances .
In order for the VHTR nuclear reactor to be ideal for commercial production of energy , a lot of research is needed .
The funds needed for this research would be very high .
However , if there is no other new sources of energy , the increasing energy demand would make the cost of oil and coal much more expensive in the long run .
The energy demand from US transport alone will cause the nation's oil imports to soar by 78% by 2025 .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 239 , Para .1) Hence , by investing in the research of VHTR , there will be less reliance on oil and coal for energy , making the costs of energy usage more stable and affordable .
Moreover , GFR is more environmental friendly as it has an advanced recycling technology that reduces the number of waste as compare with the VHTR .
To ensure sustainable development without the compromise on environment , GFR has used nuclear power to provide energy .
Thus , it has greatly reduced the excessive production of carbon dioxide .
According to world nuclear association , "the cost of managing and disposing of nuclear power plant wastes is about 5% of the total cost of the electricity generated ."(2009) .
Thus , nuclear waste has not only occupied space , it costs even more to solve the problem .
In terms of it producing lless waste , GFR has proved to be more outstanding than VHTR .
Building generation IV reactors will cost a lot but only reduce a small amount of world's greenhouse effect .
Building generation IV reactors will leave us in nuclear-weapon-danger and terrorism-danger .
What is worse , the technology cannot prevent corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
In conclusion , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
The cost of building nuclear reactors are expensive and the public argues that too much money will be spend on the research of VHTR; 1 .1 billion to build and to test the prototype (Butler , 2004 , p . 239) .
While it may be true that the cost is relatively high compared to other form of alternative energy , VHTR is build to last 60 years (Baccaglini et al . , 2003 , p . 19) and thus in the long run the overall cost in building is fully compensated by its length of service .
Over its 60 years of service , VHTR would have generated massive amount of energy that is worth more than the cost of building it .
Since VHTR does not incur any waste recycling , VHTR eliminates the expensive cost of building extra facilities for proper storage and reprocessing of nuclear waste .
The hydrogen gas generated as a by-product can also be sold to hydrogen industry to power hydrogen fuel vehicles .
Some people may believe that the performance of nuclear reactors are generally low and inefficient .
They belief that the high heat energy generated is a waste of energy in itself .
However , VHTR provides the solution to this as VHTR operates at 1000 C , the highest temperature among the 6 new Generation 4 nuclear reactors .
The high temperature means VHTR has the best nuclear energy conversion to electricity .
In fact , VHTR generates up to 600M Watt of thermal power and should be 40% more efficient than do most reactors in the United States (Svoboda , June , 2009) .
VHTR , the only Generation 4 reactor with high enough temperature to help the electrolysis process forming useful hydrogen gas which can then be used as fuel source for hydrogen fuel cars .
This means that VHTR generates both electrical and hydrogen fuel as a clean the energy for the future .
Moreover , the high temperature also enables process heat applications industry such as glass , cement , iron and wood pulp manufacture .
VHTR also incorporates the indirect combined cycle design for electricity generation , enabling a common heat source to be used for electricity and hydrogen generation .
This new design also reduces complexity and minimizes risks of system failure (Gauthier et al . , 2004 , p . 9) .
For the past few decades up till now , nuclear power has faced strong opposition from people worldwide .
This causes very few nuclear reactors to be constructed worldwide in recent years .
Nuclear power has its benefits , it is more environmental friendly as compared to renewable resources , we are in the midst of producing a nuclear hybrid reactor which is much cleaner and efficient than the current class IV reactors (Butler , 2004) and they are relatively safer than before .
I firmly believed that nuclear power should be pursued .
Nuclear power should be pursued , in recent years there is a leap in nuclear technology .
A hybrid nuclear reactor known as the International Thermal Nuclear Reactor (ITER) is currently being developed in France .
ITER has significant benefits over the current class IV reactors , it produces less nuclear waste and is more efficient in its production of electricity this could indirectly mean that cost of producing electricity with the use of the hybrid reactors will be much cheaper .
ITER produces neutron as its waste which could be burned up rapidly (Gerstner , 2009) .
While the class IV reactors , produces nuclear waste that contains plutonium and uranium , they incurred a high reprocessing cost and till have 4% of the original nuclear waste left over .
Almost all of the nuclear waste that could not be reprocessed is being being buried in landfill sites that could take million of years to decompose and also contaminate the land rendering it useless for other purposes .
This cost of reprocessing nuclear waste makes up the bulk of the maintenance cost incurred .
The ITER could do without the need to reprocess its nuclear waste and therefore could bring the cost down of producing electricity .
Another more significant advantage is the performance of the ITER , being able to produce ten times the power as compared to previous versions .
The ITER utilizes a new technology to contain the nuclear material in a doughnut shaped ring surrounded by a strong magnetic to stabilize the nuclear material thus enhancing its stability and efficiency .
ITER is still at its infancy it make take another 20-30 years before the first plant could be commissioned in Europe .
Nuclear power should be pursued for its environmental friendliness when compared against other forms like coal and diesel power plants and also its improved track record in safety .
Nuclear power plants do not emit huge amounts of green house gases like carbon dioxide when compared against traditional coal power plants .
Since the earth is experiencing global at a rate never seen before , there is a more urgent need to look into ways which we could cut down on green house gases emissions .
The proposed alternative would be the use of nuclear power plants to generate electricity .
There have  been no major incidents involving nuclear power plants since the Chernobyl incident in 1986 .
Nuclear power plants now follow a very strict set of operating procedures which prevents any accidents example leakage from happening .
They are heavily protected by security forces , this will deter any terrorist from attempting to hijack a nuclear plant .
supportin factThe most doubtful question still appears in public is about the safety design as well as security stion to against any attempt of terrorists or saboteurs .
Many assays have been made by engineers to create many unique features to tighten the safety .
The modular design approaching  , which has high level safety requirements  , is possible to keep the core in a safe cosearching forf there is any coolant loss accident  , secure the radioactive releases in three layers of stout barriers , while it minimizes number of classified system to maintain the simplification .
These designs will prevent any try to cause accidents to reactor from outside .
On the other hand , the safety design factor come from endeavor to overcome currents difficulties: heat- resistant fuels and materials , high fuel burn-ups , and temperature control .
First , researches has showed the modified 9Cr1Mo steel could be chosen because it has a negligible creep domain in a high temperature range 400-500C  ,yet its precious mechanical properties has no significant change in estimated 60 years of operation under the radiation working environment .
Furthermore , a C-C composite has been selected to make control rod cladding working in high neutron flux and high temperature condition .
Otherwise , engineers has selected are two nickel base alloys , alloy 230 and alloy 617 to make the Intermediate Heat Exchange  .
They have been tested to operate at high temperature at the outlet core ( 850C)  , while they can keep mechanical properties , withstand corrosthe endeavourmpure helium atmosphere and avoid nitride in mixture of helium and nitrogen atmosphere .
Second , many experimental works have been made to recover the TRISO fuel fabrication with UO2 covered by good quality TRISO , modified by replacing old SiC with new ZrC coating .
Accordingly the new fuel will improve performance drastically , reaching burn-up basis of 80GWd/tHM and withstand very high temperature ( 1600C) , yet without making any significant radionuclide release  .
It would not only enhance the efficiency but also raise the thermal margin under transient condition .
Besides , public's opinions also concern about the problem of performance , the cost and the environment affection if we accept this nuclear reactor .
It is obvious that the cost of one nuclear reactor is very high  , but if we apply it to this next generation reactor , it could be meaningless .
Since this one can operate in very high temperature  , with optimized designs and enhanced fuels , hence it can produce a massive amount of energy  .
Thus , goverhave nt can easily lower the cost of electric energy retrieved , which make cost of nuclear energy competitive to the others  .Furthermore , safety design also eliminate the chance of leaking radiation , make nuclear reactor a absolutely clean energy .
It should be evident that all public opposition can be solved entirely by new technology and concept .
As a result , we can affirm that the concept of Very High Temperature Reactor should be a first priority in further researches and funding to quickly turn it into reality in near future .
The cost of generation of nuclear power is comparable to the generation of electricity using coal as a fuel .
In terms of fuel costs , both the costs are almost equal , as the transportation of coal nullifies the cost of the uranium used in nuclear reactors in generating the same amount of electricity .
The capital costs are more in nuclear reactors due to the safety issue involved in construction , when compared to the conscapabilities , the NRC . . .ction of coal plants .
The maintenance and operation costs are higher in nuclear power plants due to labour , replacement of plant parts , license fees and local property taxes .
The waste related cost for coal is mainly due to ash , whereas in nuclear plants it is from the radioactive waste generated .
Indeed we can not deny that there exist some other problems about SWCR , some of whirise  int been completely solved yet .
For instance , opponents criticize that some materials are not easy to find and some waste are difficult to deal with .
But these should not be the reason for abandoning the development of this promising nuclear energy .
Even traditional energies have all kinds of problems that we can not avoid .
By contrast , SWCR has successfully brought down these side effects to quite an acceptable level .
If further funding of research can be devoted to optimizing SWCR , it will become more mature and we can gain a kind of promising energy for the long run .
With the need for energy increasing rapidly nowadays , nuclear energy is drawing much more attention due to its huge power and non-emission of greenhouse gas .
To apply nuclear energy properly can greatly benefit human beings .
However , once there is any tiny error in the process of using nuclear , terrible disasters may happen .
In the history , there have been cases such as the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion and the Three Mile Island accident , which were catastrophes caused by the misuse of nuclear power .
Thus , how to make use of nuclear energy safely and efficiently has become the core problem for modern society .
To develop the fourth generation of nuclear plants aims to ensure the security of the application of nuclear energy , especially to protect nuclear plants from terrorism and incorrect operations which can lead to very serious results .
For instance , the careless operation and the designing flaw in Chernobyl gave rise to countless deaths and homelessness .
Furthermore , plants cannot grow there in tens of years , and milk is not allowed to be produced there in over a hundred years .
With present science and technology level ,  nuclear power can be used by human beings for approximately 20 years .
The estimated year to deliver supercritical-water-cooled reactor is 2025 , and it is within the period that the nuclear energy on the earth can last .
Safety issue has always been the most controversial focus on nuclear energy .
Proponents have argued about the safety factor .
Nuclear and radiation accidusehave alerted the critics .
Due to the complexity of nuclear reactors , nuclear energy goes wrong easily .
This could result in significant harm to human body , as it has shown in Pennsylvania radioactive steam leak in 1979 .
(BBC , 2005) Safety should be guaranteed before proceeding .
The VHTR has proved to be greatly advanced in the safety aspect .
The combination with Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor system proves to be efficient in dissipating heat andthe publicnting radioactivity leak .
The new generation plants are inherently very safe .
Safety is assured in the new system .

In Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries , around 80% of health care expenses are covered by public spending , mostly through subsidies to public hospitals .
That figure stands at 85% in Sweden and the United Kingdomand  81% in Japan .
However , in the United States the figure stands at 45% , and it is now grappling with a controversial reform plan to provide universal healthcare coverage .
As rising health issues and living costs emerge as a threat to social stability and economic growth , the government must manage public spending on the elderly effectively .
The benefits of economic growth would help to ensure the continuity of social benefits for the elderly , and by increasing the national income , there will be surplus to spend more money on the social needs of the nation .
For example , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hasstated .
The government will extend more loans to local companies and spend $600 million over the next two years on training workers .
The budget would most likely take an aggressive and long term approach to reduce costs , assist businesses and help Singaporeans overcome the current situation in order to be in the pink of economic health again .
There are differing views about health insurance to be subsidised from current budgetary surpluses , and about the Government financing more of its longer-term development expenditure by borrowing from its reserves so as to free up current revenues for social spending .
Social subsidies should be evaluated on their merits and the ability to sustain them without burdening future generations by borrowing from reserves .
Social subsidies should not be expanded simply because there is currently  a budget surplus .
Spending needs are growing in many areas , not forgetting social spending  ,but the government budget is expected to be tight , therefore our challenge will be to manage the increase in social spending as our population ages , and to focus subsidies on those most in need .
The financing philosophy of Singapore's healthcare delivery system is based on individual responsibility and community support .
Patients are expected to co-pay part of their medical expenses and to pay more when they demand a higher level of service .
At the same time , Government subsidies help to keep basic health care affordable MOH (2009) .
As such , the government plays a significant role in providing health care services for public , but the government can only do this much .
To help Singaporeans to pay for their medical expenses , the Government has put in place a financing framework , which consists of Medisave , Medishield , ElderShield and Medifund .
Thus , government policies to enhance overall productivity will help maintain living standards , despite a shrinking labor force .
Policies that favor income distribution towards capital will also raise the return on capital , which will enhance capital formation  , and in turn raise labor productivity and  the national income .
(author ,year) .As opposed to an ageing population , Singapore will have a sector of un-employed people without families  ,who are either single or divorced , with perfectly unsound financial management and diagnosed with chronic illness .
The fact that they cannot contribute to their MediSave since they don't have a job is resolute .
When they reach a tenable age for retirement , they will be unable  to pay for their medical bills since they do not have adequate savings .
The Government will continue to subsidize health care to bring the cost down to an affordable level for this group of people which makes up a large number of the population .
As the  population ages  , the importance of public spending on the aged with regards to healthcare should be managed effectively without having to over spend or iinadequately provide .
Social subsidiaries should be evaluated thus reducing unnecessary spending by allowing the Government to finance more of its longer-term development expenditure which in turn brings about greater economic growth .
With economic growth , the financial burden will be lessened allowing more money for spending on social areas .
Needs better paragraphingcies will increase the older workers chances of continuing their employability , due to the reduction of employer's CPF contribution rate and build up their retirement savings (MCYS , 2008) .
With more people in the workforce , productivity will increase , which will at the same time enhance the economy .
The Eldershield scheme was improved in 2007 to make step-down care services affordable to the elderly  , in particular the low wage elders (MCYS , 2008) .
With this scheme , the elderly are able to afford the services which are specially created for them .
Daycares centres and day rehabilitation centres allow the children of the seniors to work productively knowing that their parents are in good care .
Furthermore the elderlyelderly people can interact with other people at these centres , thus they will not feel lonely .
Therefore , there is a holistic approach towards the healthcare  , eldercare of the elderly , which goes with the committee's vision(MCYS , 2008) .
A new scheme , Wellness Programme was created recently to promote healthy lifestyles and social networking for citizens  , especially the elderly (PMO , 2009) .
An active and purposeful life can improve the wellbeing of an individual (MCYS , 2006) .
Furthermore it will even delay the onset of age- related chronic diseases (MCYS , 2008) .
Thus , with a healthy body and mind , the elderlyelderly people are able to continue to contribute to society  which in return will benefit the nation .
The Council for Third Age (C3A) was formed under MCA , to further promote active ageing through community-based projects (MCYS , 2006) .
Their major events to create public awareness are the Senior Citizens' Week and Active Ageing Festival .
In conjunction with the annual event , C3A created a Senior Citizens award to honour role models and active senior citizens in the community (MCYS , 2006) .
These initiatives will hence foster family bonding and community spirit , thus a positive environment for everyone to age healthily .
Judging by the policies made for the elderly it is clear that the government has invested a large sum of money in them .
On the other hand , instead of trying to change what cannot be changed like personal health and family upbringing , there should be alternative ways to solve this problem .
The Education System can be an area worth investing in .
Children should be taught the importance of filial piety and a healthy lifestyle .
After all , these children will eventually be part of the elderly population .
If these moral values are cultivated in the system from young , there will not be a need to create schemes like the Maintenance of Parents Act .
However , there are bound to be minorities who will think otherwise .
Everybody will eventually be part of the elderly population and would like to be treated humanely and be loved by their family .
The government has been trying to ease the process through implementing policies .
Citizens should do their part too .
Singapore's only resource is its people , thus a collective effort from each and every citizen will make a vast difference .
As our Prime Minster Lee Hsien Loong highlighted in his 2009 National Day speech , "If we stay cohesive , then we can overcome our economic challenge and continue to grow (PMO , 2009) . "
The world's population is growing older .
By 2050 , one-fifth of the population will be 60 years or older (United Nations , year) .
To prepare for the growing demand of the ageing population , more government funding is required for providing better infrastructure and amenities for the elderly .
However , if public spending is not limited , the increased expenditure on the elderly will be at the cost of the country's development .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development , which in turn can help to solve the problems of the aging population .
Firstly , public spending should be diverted to promote economic growth .
Economic growth is seen as the key to resolving issues relating to an aging population .
With economic growth , the average income will increase , and thus ,  Furthermore , with the increased income , the government can impose more tax and use it to introduce more or to continue existing welfare programs for the elderly .
The Lewin Group and The Nelson A . Rockefeller Institute of Government (July , 2004) found that states of less fiscal capacity on average , spent less on social welfare programs than states with higher per capita incomes .
Thus , public spending should be channelled to promoting economic growth which can help to continue or enhance welfare programs .
Next , public spending should be channelled to the education sector , to allow more people to get the chance to go to school , to improve the standard of education , and  to encourage research and development at tertiary levels and beyond .
With more educated citizens , there will be a more productive workforce (Ramphele " Rosovsky , 2000) .
In addition , as the standard of education increases , and more research and development is conducted , the likelihood of technological advancement is higher .
Advancements in technology can improve the healthcare of the elderly , as more or better treatments for illnesses due to old aged are discovered .
Thus , public spending should be diverted to the education sector  and to promoting research and development , which can improve the welfare of the elderly in both the long and short run . 
However , new or improved treatments arising from advancements in technology  will incur  higher health care costs .
Furthermore , limiting public spending on the aged is not an easy task .
This is simply due to fact that setting a limit that is too low may result in some elderly not receiving adequate medical care and home care , and setting a limit that is too high may result in an increased burden on government policies and on the working population in society .
Thus , the government needs to prevent  health care costs  from escalatng too much and also to decide how much funding should be set aside for the elderly .
The government can lower healthcare costs by providing the elderly with cheaper but adequate alternatives .
The Singapore government is expanding its step-down care sector , by increasing the number of community hospitals , nursing homes and home care , which can provide the elderly patients with sufficient care (Majid , 2009) .
The government should decide on the segment of the population that requires government aid in old age before calibrating the essential funds required for the elderly .
Elderly people who are financially strapped and/or have no spouse or intermediate family members to take care of them should be taken care of by the government .
The government can identify this group of elderly by conducting means testing .
By adopting the use of means testing , it allows lower income patients to enjoy more subsidies than higher-income patients (Ministry of Health , 2009) .
The government should then carefully decide the necessary healthcare spending that has to be supported by the public sector , as excessive spending or spending that exceeds the means of the government will lead to the future generation having to pay higher tax , as the successor government is left with huge bill (Tan Ho , 2008) .
Different societies use different methods to finance their healthcare .
In Singapore , the government finances health carehrough a combination of taxation and private or national insurance schemes to provide affordable healthcare to its people (Lim , 2001) .
However , with limited resources , the government needs to allocate resources in such a way , so that development in one area will not be at the cost of another .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited , so that funds can be used for other developments which can help solve some of the some of the issues that accompany an an aging population .
Population ageing is inevitable .
In this modern age , there is no doubt that up to date research and development on policies is imperative to identify problems that the elderly face .
It also contributes to providing applicable solutions to ease the greying population which is gradually growing in society .
Therefore , it can be said  that research and development is the pathway to relieve the ageing process .
A greying population exists when a declining proportion of the young e .g .
children and youths , and an increasing proportion of the old e .g .
people age 60 and above , occurs .
This imbalance ultimately affects the healthcare industry and gives rise to the frequency of a person being diagnosed with chronic diseases .
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) 2002 , an older person's independence is threatened when physical or mental disabilities make it difficult to carry out the activities of daily living .
In line with that , there will an increase for demand of medications to prevent and treat chronic illnesses and also to improve quality of life .
A need for expanding social care services for the elderly  as well .
In dealing with an ageing population , research and development has pushed countries to move forward in a new paradigm of ageing .
Active ageing is the primary focus .
It is a process for utilizing opportunities in health ,  to enhance the quality of life of ageing citizens .
One of the strategies is to encourage longer employment for citizens and lower barriers for the employment of elderly people .
The current trend towards early retirement in industrialised countries is largely the result of public policies that have encouraged early withdrawal from the labour force (WHO , 2002) .Therefore research and development is essential to change such policies .
Based on research , when people work longer , it can offset increasing costs for public pensions due to the  Furthermore , working longer keeps one's mind constantly generating thoughts and ideas .
Those who remain engaged in activities involving multiple tasks , requiring communication , interaction and organization , and those who continue learning , and constantly challenge their brains , earn the greatest protection (Wall Street Journal , 2008) .
Hence ,  is not susceptible to developing old age illnesses and disabilities .
Research and development is also important to measure to what extent the government should provide sensible solutions in terms of expenditure to support medical requirements for the aged .
As previously mentioned , an ageing population has a high demand for medications and social care services .
Through research and development , it is said that the government should support these demands .
However , a limit has to be established so that spending is not extravagant .
It is also vital that a perspective is set on the government not being the sole agent to relieve the ageing process .
Private practices of healthcare professionals , social care services and organizations for citizens also correspond to the aged .
In Singapore , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong  that the health care system will be restructured for the ageing population .
For instance , he said one key step is to link up acute hospitals with community ones , where patients can receive treatment at the acute hospital , and then recuperate at the community hospital (Channel NewsAsia , 2009) .
It is undeniable that research and development is important to ease the greying population .
However , some policies may not only bring positivity .
An extension in the working lives of the elderly , can bring negative effects .
The ageing population is often associated with poor health  It will also be harder for  to acquire new skills that can benefit industry .
Besides  , some older workers cost more than younger workers due to the seniority payment system .
As a consequence , older workers are considered both vulnerable for dismissal , or to be targeted by companies wishing to make workforce reductions .
They are also less able to find new jobs should they loose their current work (Bernard Casey , 1998) .
However , these negatives are outweighed when active ageing takes place as the new paradigm for the aged .
Older people are active contributors in this age-integrated society .
They can remain as active providers and beneficiaries of modernization .
Research and development  is relatively important in determining the direction of an ageing population .
Deterioration of a greying population due to problems associated with it can be addressed via strategies formed from policies for the aged .
Active ageing  ,as the new paradigm of ageing , is the key to overcoming healthcare challenges and other problems arising with the ageing population  .
These challenges are not only the concern of the government .
Other sectors should collaborate to produce the best solutions to ease the ageing population .
Lastly , it is essential for there to be continuity in research and development to be able to create  policies that suit the needs of the elderly . 
The problem of the increasing  aging population has become a major issue now .
The situation is particularly serious in Singapore , which , according to a recent story in The Business Times (2004) , is the most rapidly aging of all Asian countries .
This situation brings various consequences , such as  decreasing productivity and the health problems of the elderly .
Actions such asbuilding more hospitals and upgrading home care should not be the most important tasks  With the current economic crisis , the government should be much more concerned about the development  of the country , and limiting spending on the elderly and using the money on others areas ,like the economy  and  technology  to develop the country .
Developing the economy of a country is an important task .
Economic conditions in Singapore have been affected by the huge loss in wealth from the collapse of the stock market that came with global crisis(Thangavelu , 2008) .
As a result , the government should put effort into reforming the country's economy .
After reforming the economy , the condition of the country can remain the same as before  Then , people can get their own occupationand have a stable income for living .
On the other hand , if the economy crisis becomes more serious , more people will lose their jobs .
Once they have difficulty earning money , they might rob , steal , kidnap , or kill somebody to get money and crime will increase .
So , developing the economy is more important than helping the elderly .
Moreover , together with the development of the economy , productivity  will also rise .
The government can also increase taxes so that  money could be used to  maintain welfare programs  continuously .
This is why developing the economy is more important and more beneficial .
Besides , developments in technology are more essential when compared with the expenditure to be spent on the elderly .
With more funds from the government , scientists can do more research From this research , scientists can discover new methods and also invent more products that could bring benefits to society . . For example , advancements in the medical field can saves more people's lives .
Inventing new machines or having new medical methods to cure diseases not just save more people and decreases the deaths , it can also help to prolong one's lifespan .
Thus , the elderly can stay longer with a healthy body ,  .
Diverting money into this area must be very helpful to all people , including the elderly .
In fact , the aging populations who do not have families or who have a disability really need help from others .
When they are sick , because  they do not have families or have a disability , they cannot take care of themselves .
Thus , the welfare programs will be  vital  for them .
But this does not mean that the public should spend a lot on helping them .
One of the reasons is that people without families and  people with disabilities are just the minorityThe majority of the elderly have their own families and they will take care of their elderly .
Furthermore , because  Singapore is a country  influenced by the Confucius way of thinking which emphasizes  filial piety , the young generation know their obligation to take care of the elderly .
Thus , limiting public spending on the aging population and diverting the money into other areas of the development of country is one possible solution . .
In conclusion ,  public spending on the aging population should be limited and diverted to the economy  and the technological development of the country .
Economic development can stabilize the condition of the country , increase productivity and  government income which could then be used for the elderly ,Technological development can also bring people healthier bodies .
Thus , diverting money to other areas of the country's development will not just solve the problems of the aging population , but will also bring every person in the country a lot of benefit .
Senior citizens have contributed a lot to making  what people enjoy today .
From fighting for independent , to paving the way for our generation today to live in comfort , their services are immeasurable .
It is therefore every citizen's duty to pay back what they have inherited from them .
Thus , public spending has always included  spending on elderly .
Unfortunately , there are so many there is public outcry by the younger generations who claim that  public spending on the elderly should be limited for the sake of the country's development .
However , this essay will argue that public spending on the aged should not be limited because not only the elderly will get the benefit from the spending  , but indirectly ,  society will also benefit .
The main reason is that spending on the elderly will stimulate the economy .
This is because limiting public spending  on elderly only transfers the responsibility to their family .
Their family has to bear larger financial responsibility to take care of the elderly .
Try to imagine how heavy the burden is for a family to take care of two elderly  , or even more .
So , it will be an extra burden to the family and they will have less to spend on other areas such as entertainment .
On the other hand , if there is no limitation on public spending on the elderly , it will definitely reduce the burden for their family and help economic growth .
This leads to another pointwhich is that the spending of elderly will reduce  As an illustration , the rising cost of health spending  will make the burden for the young become heavier and heavier .
Most of the family will not able to afford this and  may feel stressed of depressed .
As a result , conflict and argument among family members may occur  .
Besides , many other issues such as education and bank loans will become family problems .
On top of that , families and local communities will have to deal with that by conducting various activities such as family days and talks , and the government will have to bear the cost .
Obviously , instead of spending on community activities , why not spend on elderly and build up a good image ?
Another bane of contention is that public spending on education can be reduced .
This is because when there is no limitation on public spending on the elderly  When people less on the elderly , they are able to invest more in their children's  future education by saving for  education fees of the education scheme .
Therefore ,children today will not face financial problems regarding their education in the future .
Indirectly , the government can spend less to help people in higher education but can still built  an intellectual society .
It is clear that the benefits are not only distributed amongst the elderly but also amongst the younger generations .
Thus , not limiting public spending on the elderly , kills two birds with one stone . 
Basing the argument on the fact that public spending on aged should not be limited ,  it is important not to neglect other areas of the country's development  .
Although the tendency is for  public spending to be increased , especially for the elderly , it doesn't mean that other areas of the country's development have been taken for granted .
The government should plan their public spending carefully , so that they will not face the problem that they cannot afford  education , security and economics .
This will be a fairer system instead of limiting  public spending on elderly .
The elderly have contributed their whole journey in life for the nation and family so that people today are able to enjoy the fruit .
At the time as enjoying the  fruits of their labor , it is important to reflect back on their effort and appreciate it .
In short it is actually payback time  .
Senior citizens deservedly need their rest time to bask in the glory of bringing up their children successfully .
Never ever forget that old age is a reality that everyone has to face one day .
So should public spending on the aged really be limited ?
A Reasonable Expenditure on the Elderly Aging population , defined as ,  "a shift in the distribution of a country's population towards greater ages(Wikipedia , 2009) ," began to take place in every country and region across the world during the last century .
Due to the large population of elderly , the aging issue is raising more and more concerns in  society .
One of the concerns is that governments need to spend more on the elderly to ensure their physical living standard as well as their psychological well being .
However , it has been proposed that such actions can not fully solve the problems .
Therefore , the governments should invest in other areas so that the development of the country will ultimately resolve the aging problems .
Improved will benefit the  since technological advancements can enhance productivity , and the economic growth will ensure the continuation of the welfare program .
First and foremost , the progress of technology increases the country's income so that the country can take better care of the elderly .
History has shown the extraordinary benefits brought about by  technology .
In the Industrial Revolution , the arrival of sophisticated machinery "mark[ed] the transition from a stable agricultural [society] to a modern industrial society(source ,year)" .
The economy grew immediately and Britain became the most powerful empire during that period .
In recent years , computers have been used in every aspect production , ranging from mass production to  This involvement has freed people from demanding and repetitive jobs and at the same time increased the efficiency of production .
The increase in efficiency   more revenue to the country and therefore the government can spare more money for the elderly .
Moreover , positive economic growth  can ensure the continuation of welfare programs .
The welfare programs mainly aim to provide financial aid to individuals who are in need .
In most countries , the unemployed , disabled and the elderly are the major targets .
The government , together with some private organizations , is one major sponsor for the welfare program .
Generally speaking , the government will spend a certain percentage of its annual income on the welfare .
Take Italy as an example , according to Wikipedia(2009) , the pension payments are reported to be supported by 18 .5% of the total income tax .
However , such a large proportional expense can only be achieved under the condition of a stable economic environment .
Facing the US economic downturn , President Obama has enabled a series of economic stimulus plans which include the "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009" .
The Act mainly targets at cutting federal tax , providing benefits for the unemployed and increasing spending on education , health care , and infrastructure .
The total investment on the Act is about $787 billion dollars(Wikipedia , 2009) , which make up a large proportion of the total income .
Hence , the expense on welfare , especially the elderly , has been largely cut off .
Therefore , ,  Although the government should invest its expenditure on the country's development , it does not mean that the government should cut pension payments .
Unlike traditional Asian families which play a key role in taking care of the old , most western families have a looser connection among their family members .
The elderly , in most cases , live separately from their descendants .
Besides , some old single women have a very low income to support their life .
If the government cuts the pension aid , the social cost and repercussion on families and local communities may be higher .
Hence , not only the family but also the government should bear the responsibility of taking care of the old .
The government needs to spend a  reasonable amount of money on pensions and elderly facilities .
To sum up , the government should control the expenditure on pension costs and make more of an effort to develop the country economically .
In a technology advanced and economy positive society  , the elderly can receive better care and protection .
Many people agree with the idea that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Taking the following factors into account such as the soon retiring baby boomers , the higher life expectancy of the Singapore population and the persistent reduction of birth rates over the past few decades , it is clear that a dramatic demographic change is on the cards .
It is undeniable that  society is aging , and there will be  increased needs for more healthcare , pensions , homes , and other social welfare considerations for the elderly .
However , there should be a limit to the country's expenses on the agedso thatt instead of focusing all their efforts on trying to tackle the problems directly , government should step back and take a look at the bigger picture .
Addressing other issues that contribute to a country's development such as economic growth , education and the military is just as important .
An important issue that affects a country's development is economic growth .
According to a sample of OECD (Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development) countries , which consists of 30 large economies , One percent a year increase in output growth over the next 50 years might only just ease the increase level  .
Thus , substantial increases in economic growth would be needed to offset the increased costs of aging (Visco , 2008) .
Economic growth could be achieved with greater productivity .
Government and companies could hence import or invent better technologies to increase productivity .
Singapore could also enable more young people to work as well as encourage longer work lives (by encouraging "flexible retirement" arrangements) to increase economic growth (Jackson , Howe , Strauss , Nakashima , 2008) .
A prosperous economy would allow major public pension reforms while reducing the burden on the people .
Therefore , equal or more amounts of money and attention should be given to the country's economic growth .
Education is one area of a country's development that should never be overlooked .
Investment in education benefits the individual , society , and the world .
Education in Singapore aims to shape citizens to be "responsible to family and country ," and to "have courage and conviction in facing adversity ."
It also aims to shape the potential leaders to be "committed to improving society" and "be able to forge breakthroughs in a knowledge-based economy(Ministry of Education , 2009) ."
Within the 12 pillars of competitiveness , education takes up 2 pillars , health and primary education and higher education and training , in determining the country's economic competitiveness (Schwab , 2009) .
An educated and skilled workforce contributes  to the knowledge-based economy .
Studies link education to economic growth as it contributes to improving productivity which leads to higher income and improved economic growth (The World Bank , 2009) .
Education also reduces crime , and promotes equality , justice and intercultural understanding (The World Bank , 2009) .
It is very important that Singapore should maintain its education system to ensure the political and social stability as well as the economic prosperity of the country in the future .This is  also of great importance to the country's development and to its aging society .
Singapore should  also realise  that youths are treasured assets in aging societies .
Hence defence  and military strategies should be carefully thought out to prevent the loss of lives .
Singapore should look at more substitutions  The military could also look at offering immigrants citizenship in return for service  , as well as hiring freelance mercenaries from foreign countries (Jackson , Howe , Strauss , Nakashima , 2008) .
Given the dropping birthrate , Singapore should take greater care of her young men and at the same time , being a small country , she must be able to protect herself .
Hence the military is one important issue that the country should also look at and invest in .
However , it should be understood  that not all elderly  have families or are able to take care of themselves .
Hence countries should have a margin drawn according to the number of people who really need help from the government  before setting the limit for public spending on the elderly to ensure that they are taken care of .
Singapore could set an age limit and look into the cases of each elderly person who might need the help from the government .
Funds should only be given to the elderly if their medishield and medisave are used up , and by judging each case individually , an appropriate amount can be  given to the elderly .
For example , public spending for an old lady suffering from a disease should be given more funds than an old man without any income or family .
There are many  that make up a socially and politically stable country .
Instead of merely focusing on public spending for the aged , we should also look at a broader base of challenges that an aging society will bring to us .
Singapore should continue the balance in distributing the right amount of attention to not just the aged but also the youths .
Singapore should give equal or more attention to economic growth to solve the aging society ,  Attention should also be paid to other factors , such as the education and military strategies  , because only with balanced , wise and well-planned and governed policies , can there be a prosperous and strong nation .
Fast aging populations have increasingly become a serious problem especially for many developed countries .
One of the many causes of a fast aging population is that many people choose to have very few or even no children due to  factors such as the high cost of  .
Childcare costs in Singapore  average $670 a month .
Hence , it has been reflected in official statistics  , that the replacement rate in Singapore was only 1 .29 last year , way below the 2 .1 replacement rate needed for a population to maintain its current size in the long term (Li , 2008) .
In addition , the elderly often incur higher costs in terms of healthcare and other miscellaneous needs .
Hence , with such demands from the aging population , it is imperative that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
Large and long-term healthcare expenses can substantially drain the resources of many of the elderly , especially for those without any savings for their retirement .
This may include people with serious health problems who are often unemployed or unfit to work .
Therefore , these people usually do not have any income In fact , some of them might even be receiving financial aid from the government .
In addition , older people also tend to have  especially during a recession  .
Firms actually prefer to employ the young who are more productive .
For example in New York , workers ages 45 and over actually form a disproportionate share of the hard-luck recession category , the long-term unemployed (Michael ,  2009) .
The financial problem faced by these unemployed is also worsened by the high cost of living in  developed countries .
For example , in Singapore , the high cost of living is actually caused by  spending  on necessities like financial products and transportation (Tan , 2008) .
Hence , with such a high cost of living , the income of these elderly is just enough to feed themselves .
Saving seems to be an impossible mission for them .
Therefore , public pensions and government incentives will be a vital source of money to support the elderly that are among those without savings .
It is important for society to show its appreciation for the contribution made by the elderly .
A Chinese saying goes like this , "As human beings , we should not forget the past because without the past , we will not have what we have in the present ."
The elderly , in their younger days , have made many important contributions to  society .
As pioneers who arrived in a relatively unknown Singapore , the elderly toiled and contributed  to its success today .
Since the majority of the older people believed that the government should provide for them as they are at their most vulnerable (Shanas , 1980) , the reduction in public spending on them will set up a framework for criticism against the government show no appreciation for the sweat and toil that they have willingly given .
However , taking care of the elderly should not be the sole responsibility of the government .
Every individual should try to play their part in dealing with the problems of an aging population .
Therefore , other strategies should also be introduced to cope with the problem of an aging population .
For example , the better-off should try to support their own elderly parents through ways such as giving them a monthly allowance etc .
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore  also made  a National Day Rally Speech this year to stress  filial obligation for parent maintenance .
In addition , the money spent on the country's development in the area of education and economy can also help to solve the problems of an aging population .
For example , the economic growth of the country can help to ensure the continuation of welfare programs due to increased revenues of the country .
Education can also help to raise the awareness of the young as well as increasing their understanding of the need for them to play a part in dealing with the problems of an aging population .
In conclusion , it will definitely be better if public spending on the aged is not limited  However , when making decisions on government spending , the government should also take into consideration the existence of other problems and the need to improve other areas of the country .
The country is not only made up of the elderly .
The majority of the population is still the young who are now sweating and toiling for the country , just like the aged did in the past .
Hence the government should also divert some of its resources to improving the lives of the aged for example by providing subsidies for having children which not only reduces the cost  of having a child but also encourages people to have more children , thus increasing the replacement rate .
On the other hand , strategies such as means-testing , currently adopted by the Australian Government , should also be implemented in other affected countries , to ensure that all public spending is necessary (Peter G . Peterson) .
a policy similar to the above .For instance ,and how much of a particular facility an individual could use and to what extent .to spend money on , Another great advantage of economic growth is that it raises the real income of people .
As a result Government use of either increase or decrease of tax , but will also increase the total spending on such programmes in real terms .rFor instance ,have more resources and hence require less taxes a consequence a family would be able to increase its spending on its older members .
On the other hand the state could also receive more taxes now that people have increased income and use the money for further betterment of thlIn terms of an economic downturn ,D so the medical facilities would be more tecthe ageing populationnced and be cheaper to produce due To counter this ,r technology , hence services from such facilities would become cheaper and hthe economic conditions .ll would fall .
The rapid advancements in genetic research and technology over the last few decades have led to a host of important advances in the detection of genetic conditions and diseases .
These developments have also raised concerns about whether carriers of a known genetic risk has the duty to inform his relatives about his genetic test results .
According to the National Human Research Genome Institute (2009) , genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies alterations in a person's gene , chromosome or the level of key proteins coded for by specific genes .
An individual who only has one altered copy of a gene is known as a carrier .
Carriers will not be diagnosed with the disease but can pass on the alteration to their children .
On one hand , some may believe that carriers do not have the responsibility to reveal their genetic test results to their relatives as discrimination and excess worrying may occur .
On the other hand , it is more logical to believe that carriers have the duty to inform their relatives regarding their tests results so that their relatives can make informed choices related to their genes .
Hence , a carrier of known genetic risks should be compelled to reveal their genetic test results to their relatives .
critics perceive that  .
Sociologists note that relatives of carriers of known genetic risks may be denied  health insurance policies or be made to pay higher premiums since they are at higher risk of developing the disease (Health Plan One , n .d .) .
This is because insurance companies being mostly profit-orientated would predict any possible added costs and take pre-emptive measures to avoid these costs .
In addition , healthy and qualified relatives of carriers may be denied employment opportunities (American Medical Association , 1991) .
One reason for this could be that employers may have the misguided belief that they have to spend more  in order to ensure the working environment is safe for these employees .
The consideration of extended medicalleave that these employees may take in future may deter the employers from engaging their services for fear of loss in efficiency at work and trouble in finding replacements .
As such , companies will tend not to employ individuals who have a medical history of genetic diseases .
However , these arguments fail to consider the measurements in place to protect insurance and employability for relatives of carriers .
Paddock (2008) asserted that the enactment of laws such as the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act 2008 in the United States would prohibit insurance companies from rejecting clients due to genetic information and forbid companies from using genetic information for hiring decisions for individuals .
Moreover , a mathematical model to work out the  mortality for individuals associated with higher risks of illnesses such as Hungtinton's disease will guide insurance companies to formulate reasonable levels of premiums (Watts , 1999) .
Hence , genetic information will not be used against family members who apply for an insurance policy or a job .
detractors argue that the genetic information of carriers will cause unnecessary worry for their family members , especially in the case of multi- factorial diseases .
Medical professionals contend that these family members may experience psychological effects such as fear , anxiety and depression , which would affect their lifestyle (Yap , 2005) .
They note that multi-factorial diseases such as coronary heart diseases may occur in isolation , with affected children born to unaffected parents .
Furthermore , the Mendelian pattern of inheritance is unclear even though there may be multiple cases in the same family (Lobo , 2008) .
As such , family members will be uncertain if the disease is present in the family line and fret about the medical conditions of their future generations .
Nonetheless , this argument ignores the possibility that counselling sessions can be provided for the family members .
Psychologists assert that some family members can consult genetic counsellors about their risk of contracting the disease , and hence overcome their fears (Adams , 2003) .
This measure is usually recommended for multi-factorial diseases as there is a higher possibility of uncertainty in one's health .
Hence , worries of family members can be eliminated .
Indeed , carriers of a known genetic risk have the duty to inform their relatives as it would aid their relatives in decision making .
Ethicists assert that these relatives will be alarmed .
However ,  such information would encourage them to perform the disease testing in which genetic results may allow them to make informed decisions especially during family planning .
Rosner (2009) argued that this is important for the Jewish community as it is illegal to abort a child during pregnancy .
With the acquisition of genetic test results , couples may consider adopting a child instead of conceiving one .
In addition , couples could be mentally prepared for their child's future as  .
In all , carriers have the obligation to inform their family members of their genetic test results since the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages .
In future , genetic testing may be more common and more people may feel the need to share their genetic results .
Genetic testing is the study of a person's genes , chromosomes and proteins to determine whether the person is prone to a certain kind of disease and whether the person is a carrier or not (Cancer .net , 2009) .
When a person is found to be a carrier though genetic testing , the dilemma arises as to whether the carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as the carrier will not get the disease but the carrier can pass the disease to his or her children (Frequently Asked Questions About Genetic Testing , 2009) .
In my view , a carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as firstly , there is a possibility that they might get the disease or they might be a carrier too and hence they have a right to know .
Secondly , the carrier can get moral support from his or her family members despite the possibility that the carrier might face discrimination upon disclosing his results .
A carrier should tell his or her relatives as they might be at risk of getting the disease or being a carrier too (Lea , Williams and Donahue , 2005) .
This is because the carrier got the disease through a parent , and thus the carrier's siblings and the carrier's children might have also gotten the altered gene .
Hence , it is important to inform the carrier's relatives so that they can go for the testing to check whether they are carriers or have an inherited disposition toward the disease .
If they were found to be a carrier , they have the chance to choose to not to reproduce or  be mentally prepared about their children's health in the future if they decide to proceed with having children .
After all , taking care of a child with a disease is not an easy task .
They should consider whether they are prepared to look after the child if the child gets the disease as it is not only financially exhausting , but mentally tiring as well .
If they were found to have the probability of getting the disease , they could then be more mentally prepared due to the early notice .
Thus , by being informed  about the genetic results of a carrier , the carrier's family members can better plan their future and be mentally prepared for the worst .
Another reason why a carrier should tell his or her his genetic results is because his or her relatives might be able to provide support to him .
After knowing that he or she is a carrier , he or she will have many worries and even guilt if his or her offspring has got the disease though him or her (Cancer .net , 2009) .
The carrier may also feel "imperfect" and have lower self esteem because of this situation .
During this period of time , support from relatives , which can help in coping with these negative feelings , is especially crucial to the carrier (Finucane , n .d .) .
After all , family members are the closest people to the carrier and only their support can make him or her feel better .
Hence , a carrier should tell his or her relatives of his genetic test result .
Others might argue that  telling relatives about the result , a carrier may result in discrimination from his relatives .
This is supported by a survey conducted in 1997 , which has identified more than 200 cases of genetic discrimination out of 917 people who responded (Genetic Information and the Workplace , 1998) .
Some carriers might face problems such as being isolated as if they have a contagious disease , being talked about behind their backs or even being blamed for passing on the disease when relatives are diagnosed positive for the disease (Finucane , n .d .) .
These situations will only make the carrier unhappy and hence many choose not to tell their relatives about their genetic results .
However , the situations mentioned above rarely happen within a family .
Most of the discrimination come from  employers or  insurance companies .
This is proven by another survey which has found that 550 people had been denied employment or insurance due to their genetic defect (Genetic Information and the Workplace , 1998) .
Hence , by telling relatives about one's genetic result will not face discrimination .
It is only when the public get to know about it  will a carrier face discrimination .
Furthermore , family members are the closest people to the carrier and if they do not support each other , no one will support them .
Hence , a carrier should tell his or her relatives of his genetic test result as discrimination by relatives is rare .
In conclusion , a carrier should tell his or her relatives about his genetic result as there is a possibility that they might get the disease or they might be a carrier too and the carrier can get support from them .
Although some might argue that the carrier might face discrimination if he discloses his results , this is generally not the case; hence , the fear of such discrimination should not prevent one from revealing his genetic result .
With the advancements in medical technology , people can find out and understand the various causes of diseases .
In the past , people thought that diseases were mainly caused by natural calamities and bacteria or viral infections .
It was not until recently that scientists and researchers found out that  human's genes are the cause of certain diseases such as heart diseases , cancers and diabetics type 1 .
By making use of genetic testing to test one's genes , one will be able to know whether one will develop any genetic disease or carry any disease-causing genes .
Individuals who undergo such tests will find that the outcome of the tests affect not only them but also their family members .
This is because there may be a possibility that they will suffer from the genetic disease as well .
Hence , the individual faces a dilemma of whether or not to reveal the test results to them as his family members may not accept the fact and will be adversely affected by the harsh reality .
Nevertheless , an individual should be obligated to inform his family members of the outcome of the genetic testing as  doing so will bring benefits to both parties , such as enabling them to provide support to each other and to take careful precautions to reduce risks of infection .
In the face of the possibility of getting an incurable disease that will affect a person for life , it is important that family members can accompany and support him along the journey to fight against the illness .
Furthermore , family members will tend to be more understanding toward relatives who are ill and help them financially , such as providing for their daily expenses and medical costs .
If a patient's family members are not aware of his condition , he will suffer silently and it is more likely for him to succumb to the illness .
For example , a local celebrity , Chew Chor Meng , who is suffering from Kennedy's disease , has revealed  to his family and the public  his genetic disease .
Instead of feeling pessimistic towards life and being discriminated against by the public , he has received encouragement from the public and support from his family that has made him more resilient and optimistic in fighting against the disease .
Hence , individuals should be obligated to inform their relatives as it is beneficial for themselves in terms of fighting against genetic illnesses effectively .
Secondly , individuals should inform their relatives as it is their moral responsibility towards them .
there is a saying that "prevention is always better than cure;" relatives who are informed earlier of the carrier's genetic results can take earlier health precautions to reduce the risks of infection or the severity of the effects of the disease (Varga & Sturm , 2008) .
For instance , they can change  their lifestyle such as changing bad eating habits , saving money for their future and exercising more frequently .
Even if they do not develop the genetic diseases , the precautions taken at an earlier stage of their lives may protect them from other forms of illnesses that may not be caused by their genes .
Some may argue that individuals who have undergone genetic testing should not be obligated to inform their relatives for fear that they will lose their privacy and cause their relatives to suffer from the emotional burden of feeling guilty and anxious about whether they would suffer from the disease .
However , there have been laws set up to prevent discrimination against individuals who suffer from genetic diseases .
For example , the United States Government has implemented the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to prevent individuals from discrimination at work and from getting an insurance plan (Genetics and public policy center , 2009) .
Hence , with the governments' efforts to implement laws to protect individuals' interests , they should feel assured of their privacy .
Moreover , genetic counseling groups have been set up to help affected individuals and their family members to handle their emotional distress through counseling sessions (Norrgard , 2008) .With counseling , trained and professional counselors can provide good advice to individuals to help them make better decisions and to clear misconceptions of genetic testing .
Eventually , individuals and family members will be able to accept the fact and face it positively .
with a healthy mindset  , they are more likely to win the battle against their illnesses .
In conclusion , individuals should be obligated to inform their relatives of their genetic testing results as they can provide support for each other to overcome the illness more effectively .
If they do not do so , relatives who are kept in the dark may suffer more as they would not know to take earlier precautions to mitigate the effects of the illness .
Therefore , individuals should inform their loved ones of their situations so that they can help each other through the difficult times .
Many diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease , cystic fibrosis , Huntington's disease , dementia , Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer may be identified through genetic testing (Access excellence 2009) .
Even though a positive result on a genetic test only shows a higher risk of developing the disease , such information is very important and crucial as knowing about one's predisposition to such a disease may help to reduce the risk of developing it as one would then seek to control one's lifestyle as environmental factors play an important role in the onset of certain genetic diseases  .
Thus , if tested positive for these genes , the individual should be obligated to tell his family members .
This is especially true for fatal diseases and diseases which are strongly connected to genes .
This is important to ensure that early steps are taken to reduce the risk of the carrier and his family developing the disease .
In addition , he should also bring his family members along for genetic counseling so as to prevent unnecessary emotional distress due to their possible misinterpretation of the genetic test results  .
Firstly , it is beneficial for the individual to inform his family members about his result as his family may help to reduce emotional distress .
While genetic counselors may give advice on how to reduce the likelihood of developing the disease , family members may provide the individual with emotional support .
This is very crucial as emotional distress might lead to a higher chance of developing the disease .
Hence , it is better for the individual to share his genetic test result with his family members .
Some may argue that the individual has the right to protect his privacy by not revealing the information , so it is up to him who to reveal it to .
However , it is the individual's responsibility to tell his family members regarding his genetic test result .
This is because it might be harmful for him to keep it  a secret as he might become emotionally disturbed by it .
According to a survey done on women regarding factor V Leiden (FVL) , 77% of the women were emotionally disturbed by their genetic testing results  .
When people are emotionally disturbed , they might not be able to think rationally which may be harmful to the individual's health as it may result in depression and an unbalanced diet .
Some individuals do not want to reveal their genetic test result to their family as they do not want their family to be worried .
However , not knowing the true reason that caused him to be emotionally affected will cause this family to be even more worried .
In addition , the family may consult genetic counselors to seek for advice on how to reduce  .
Secondly , the inherited genetic disease may affect not only the individual but his family too as they might also have the defective genes .
Diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia do not show early physical symptoms .
Hence , by informing his family about the known genetic risk he has , a carrier may encourage his family to go for genetic testing too .
This is beneficial as it helps to increase the family's awareness and preparedness for the disease .
This may actually help to save lives .
If a person is a carrier of a genetic disease , he might pass it to his offspring .
However , this may be prevented through the In-Vitro Fertilization(IVF) method .
In IVF , only the embryo that does not have the defective genes will be implanted in the mother's womb .
Thus , the offspring will not have the defective genes , hence lowering its possibility of developing the disease .
Others may argue that in the case of cancer , the presence of altered copies of the inherited gene accounts for only 5 to 10 percent of all cancers and the majority of people who develop breast cancer or colon cancer did not inherit such genes (Access excellence 2009) .
The presence of such genes only increases the risk of developing cancer and environmental factors play a much more important role .
Thus , there is no need for the individual to tell his family members about his genetic test result as genes do not play a very important role in the development of such diseases .
However , though it is true that environmental factors play a more significant role , the presence of such genes in the case of breast cancer greatly increases the possibility of developing the disease .
Out of every 100 women who inherit a mutated gene related to breast cancer , as many as 60 will develop breast cancer by age 50; by age 70 , approximately 80 will develop breast cancer (learn .genetics 2009) .
Hence , in knowing this information at an early stage , early preventive measures can be taken to reduce the possibility of developing the breast cancer by controlling one's lifestyle .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic disease should be obligated to inform his family members about it as both he and his family will benefit from it .
Genetic testing is a type of testing which identifies changes in chromosomes , genes or proteins .
It is also a test that analyses and detects heritable disease-related genotypes , mutations , phenotypes or karyotypes .
some examples of genetic tests  are newborn screening , diagnostic testing , carrier testing , prenatal testing and others .
People who undergo the test will be notified of the results .
Some of them may show a positive result as a carrier of a known genetic disease .
If they know about it , should they tell others , especially their relatives ?
I believe that they should tell their relatives  .
Firstly , the person should reveal the results to his or her relatives as  .
Everyone should be responsible and play an important role in the family .
As we know , Huntington's disease is incurable and inheritable by the next generation (Myers , 2004) .
If a person shows a positive result for this disease and not  reveal to the family , this disease will be passed on to the next generation easily .
It will also cause many people in the family tree to suffer from this disease .
This is not a responsible action .
Although some might think the decision to undergo the test is considered as a personal choice (Norrgard , 2008)and that it is the individual's choice  whether to tell the result or not , the responsibility of protecting and saving the family from getting the genetic  disease outweighs one's personal choice .
Thus , in order to protect the family , a person should tell his relatives the result of his genetic testing .
Moreover , the individual should tell his relatives about the result of his genetic testing as it will  .
"Prevention is better than cure" is the slogan always used by  doctors .
If they  know about the  , they can seek  help from doctors in order to prevent developing the heritable disease (Takala & Gylling , 2001) .
Breast cancer is the second killer in the world .
This cancer can develop at a risk of 85% for the person with the mutated genes (Wahrman , 2009) .
Individuals can reduce the risk of getting this disease  .
They can reduce the chance by practicing a healthy lifestyle and through other means .
Although some diseases like Huntington's disease and Down's syndrome are unpreventable (Brown) , potential carriers can find out about them earlier if a relative who is a known carrier reveals his genetic test results to them .
They can then be prepared for these diseases and not become depressed about them easily .
Thus , in order to apply earlier prevention for the family , the individual should reveal his result .
Finally , individuals should tell the result of their genetic test to their relatives as it is a public issue .
A positive result is not considered as a personal problem or  bad luck .
It may involve the family or even the society .
The risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer increases up to 85% when there is a gene mutation (Wahrman , 2009) .
This problem is common to Jewish women of Eastern  .
If some kept their disease a secret until death , we would not have known that it posed a serious problem to society .
Although people kept the secret as they were scared of being discriminated against by societyand therefore  chose to keep the result unrevealed (Wahrman , 2009)  , there is an act called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) which can protect people with a genetic problem from discrimination .
They do not need to worry about the discrimination any more .
Thus , people should reveal their genetic test result to their relatives as  .
In conclusion , the individual with the positive result in genetic testing which shows he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk should reveal this  .
This revelation of the result can help many people , including the carrier himself .
Therefore , he should not keep it a secret .
Firstly , it is imperative that a carrier of a disease related to genetic disorder tell his or her relatives as soon as possible .
Some of these diseases are curable if treatments are sought early .
Such is the case for the genetic disorder Phenylketonuria which can be identified by genetic testing .
Infants who inherit this disorder will look perfectly normal during the first 6 months of their birth .
Failure to identify and treat Phenylketonuria in time , however , may result in mental illness at the later stages of the babies' life(Schuett , 2008) .
There are some who think that the disclosure of a genetic testing result is unnecessary and they argue that it may bring immense grief and worry to relatives of a genetic disease carrier .
However , without being warned of the possible risk of inheriting these diseases , they would probably not go for their own genetic testing and hence would run the risk of undergoing  late treatment for a disease related to a genetic disorder , which may have catastrophic consequences .
Secondly , the choice to undergo genetic testing is a personal one , regardless of the genetic testing result of another family member .
While carriers of such diseases should reveal theresults of their genetic testing so as to warn their relatives about the possibility of the latter being carriers as well , it is still up to  their relatives to find out whether they themselves had indeed inherited any genetic disorder (Norrgard , 2008) .
Since it is never certain that one will inherit a disorder from one's parents , the disclosure of the result of such a test would therefore not bring any direct harm to one's relatives .
In addition , people who disclose their genetic information are worried that they may face genetic discrimination , for instance , when applying for jobs and insurance .
However , laws such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) in the United States have been passed so as to ensure this would not happen(Norrgard , 2008) .
Admittedly , there are bound to be repercussions arising from the disclosure of such information .
Inheritance(in terms of money and assets) that one will receive is one of the aspects that may be affected by the result of one's genetic testing result .
For instance , the less healthy child of a rich tycoon may be discriminated in the choice of a successor .
However , should such important information that may potentially save the lives of one's relatives be withheld due to these personal benefits ?
In addition , some are worried that revealing such information to their offspring may affect the latter's psychological well-being(Living with , 2009) .
Nonetheless , with proper genetic counseling which is usually accompanied by genetic testing itself , parents may decide the best way to deal with this information .
In conclusion , the result of one's genetic testing may not only affect oneself , but others too .
If this crucial information is shared among relatives without self-interest , it may even save lives .
Although this disclosure may inevitably bring about discrimination in both the family and outside the family , it is certain that concerns with health should outweigh monetary benefits .
Moreover , efforts have been made by the government to pass laws such as GINA to prevent genetic discrimination .
Hence , with proper guidance such as genetic counseling , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives about his genetic test results .
"Blood is thicker than water" .
Indeed , if one possesses an allele that might develop into a crippling ailment , one should not remain silent as family members can help to share the burden (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
This may also lower the risk of developing stress-induced illnesses such as cancer as well (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
Relatives prone to the disease can also take necessary precautions to prevent the illness from developing (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
Yet , not everyone might have the freedom to do so , fearing that family members might not be able to accept the news .
However , decisions to withhold information on one's genetic test results only have short-term benefits and fail to consider the bigger picture such as situations in which one's family eventually discovers one's secret .
Certainly , that may cause an even bigger heartbreak (Pelletier , 2005) .
Hence , one should be obligated to break the news early to their relatives .
Earlier disclosure of such information allows the family to provide emotional support when one needs it most .
Initially , upon receiving the test results , individuals might exhibit a multitude of reactions ranging from depression to anxiety to anger (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
This is the time when family support is most essential for one as members can help to share the problem and advise how one should handle the problem .
However , there are cases where one may not have the liberty to share the information with the family due to the unstable condition of another member .
One may also resort to this in order not to further burden that loved one .
However , doing this may result in bigger repercussions when the family member involved finds out and is overwhelmed by the news (Pelletier , 2005) .
Hence , it is essential that one should notify one's family about one's condition as soon as possible .
Besides being able to receive family support , letting others know about one's genetic condition is also a form of relieving unnecessary stress .
Conversely , keeping such important secrets to oneself in the long run  might actually develop into stress which may exacerbate one's current condition and trigger certain stress-induced illnesses such as cancer  (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
Critics  may feel that individuals may get discriminated even within their which may be a source of stress for them (Wolff , 1996) .
Consequently , a disadvantageous situation is created instead of a beneficial one .
Nonetheless , not all families are unloving .
Hence more often than not , one should be frank with one's family and not withhold any results of the genetic test .
Early disclosure also allows relatives to take early precautions (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) and prevent themselves from succumbing to the disease as well .
An example of such precautions is to have one's family shifting from their usual unhealthy diet to a healthier one .
As such , one's family may be 'empowered' (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) to make apt decisions which reduce the risk of developing the illness .
Some note that even though the disclosure empowers one's relatives to take precautionary measures , it might end up causing  anxiety among family members (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
In spite of this , some form of prevention may be better than none at all .
As the saying goes , "prevention is better than cure" .
Thus , it is crucial that one should tell one's family about his genetic condition .
In this respect , one should tell one's about one's genetic condition .
This will enable one to be able to receive emotional concern , to prevent any stress build up and to allow one's family to take precautions against the particular disease .
There are certain disorders that exist  that  have adverse effects on the health of individuals .
Genetic testing is then carried out to determine if a person carries genes for certain inherited disorders .
Of course , if the disorder is treatable , one would not worry so much about the consequences .
However , if the disorder turns out to be non-treatable , the ethical issue as to whether the carrier of the known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives arises .
The issues of privacy and discriminationsupport the position that the carrier should not be obliged to disclose the information to his relatives .
Firstly , a carrier should not be obligated to disclose his genetic to his relatives as he has the individual right as a patient to privacy .
Privacy plays a very important role in a person's life as it "helps individuals maintain autonomy and individuality" (Privacilla .org , February 12 2001) .
Everyone has his own right to decide whether his personal information should be revealed to third parties .
Without the right to protect his privacy through withholding genetic information of his disorder , the person would feel violated  .
Therefore , the carrier should not feel obliged to reveal his disorder .
Secondly , discrimination from  relatives affects the carrier's decision in revealing his condition .
One might never know how one's relatives would react upon knowing the condition of the carrier .
The reactions can be extreme , either keeping a distance away from him or sharing the pain together with the carrier .
For example , some relatives would have the thinking that the genetic risk of the carrier would bring about a bad reputation to them so they may start to distance themselves and try to eliminate all contact with him .
Discrimination has been found to have harmful effects on people such as putting them at a high risk of depression .
It is already bad for a carrier to have a genetic risk; it would be much worse if depression strikes him .
Thus , a carrier should not be obligated to tell his relatives about his genetic risk .
Admittedly , "a conflict between the well-being of the relatives could occur" and so , a carrier should be obligated to tell his relatives about his genetic risk as the information could be of importance to them (World Health Organization) .
(Bioethics Advisory Committee Singapore , November 2005) .
However , timing is  important  so one should think of the consequences before revealing one's genetic condition .
For example , "if a woman discovers she has a disorder and her sister is pregnant" (Nuffield Council on Bioethics , December 1993) , it would not be the right time to her genetic condition to her pregnant sister as the anxiety caused may affect the foetus .
Hence , a carrier should not be obliged to tell his relatives about his genetic disorder .
In conclusion , it is the social and emotional aspects that affect the carrier's decision on whether or not he should make known his genetic risk to his family members .
Timing is also an important factor  .
Thus , a carrier should not be obligated to tell his relatives about his genetic risk .
The controversy of whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives has been highly debated within the bioethics community (Mehlman , 2009) .
Individuals may choose not to reveal their positive test results to their relatives after taking the test , as they fear that their family will not be able to cope with the pressure since they are potentially at risk as well (Haidle , 2005) .
