The law states that the employer is entitled to monitor worker movements and conduct during working hours , so long as the means employed are fair and reasonable and do not unjustifiably disadvantage employees (Roth 2006) .
However , we have to note that RFID is a special surveillance technology with unique characteristics and implications .
Hence , some special provision may need to be made under the law to account specifically for RFID .
Finally , criminals will be able to use RFID tags to help pick their targets .
For instance , they can attach RFID tags onto wealthy people and this would allow them to track their daily routine and whereabouts and can thus work out their robbing or kidnapping plan .
In addition , terrorists can also use RFID to bomb citizens of a particular nationality by setting the bombs to explode when such citizens are nearby .
However , the opposition may argue that another novel surveillance technology will probably be invented to counter against such criminals .
Moreover , the main intention of RFID is to protect the society since the police can use the technology to detect criminals .
The opposition may not be completely correct since it will take time to produce a new technology to close in on the criminals and several crimes would have occurred during this period .
Also , a vicious cycle will be created by the criminals using RFID to attack their targets ,  followed by the police using RFID to detect those criminals .
There will be no end to this and therefore RFID should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned , not only because it violates an individual's privacy but also because it could  encourage more potential criminals to commit atrocities and  stir up the greed within businessmen .
It is not a dream for your parents to know where you are and what you are doing any more , even if they are both miles away from you .
In the 21st century , the superman is not the only one who has the power to  what is in your bag without asking you , but ordinary people can also have the power to do so . . What they rely on is not a magic mirror but a kind of surveillance technology called RFID (radio frequency identification) .
By implanting a chip to human body or attaching a tag to a product , the information of a certain person or an object can be scanned easily by a scanner .
However , does a child really want his or her parents to track him or her all the time ?
At the same time , will you feel comfortable when everyone can have the access to know what you are taking with you ?
The convenience and problems this technology brings to us make it hard for us to decide whether it should be legal to track people making use ofthe technology .
In this case it cannot be denied that RFID is a beneficial technology , while it is an "expensive and intrusive way to track people" , because of three main reasons (Schatz , 2006) .
Firstly , the RFID technology is still immature , which means we cannot guarantee both the accuracy of information we get and the harmlessness of these chips implanted in our body .
Actually , when two or more readers want to scan the same tag , the "signals from their scanners may overlap" which will cause the tag "unable to reply" (Reported on Techonovelgy .com) .
We call this reader collision .
Similarly , "tag collision" may occur when "tags are present in a small area" (Reported on Techonovelgy .com) .
Furthermore , the RFID chips work by using electromagnetic waves , which may have some potential harm to our bodies .
However , people may argue that the chips and tags will be tested before using .
As another evidence for this technology's immaturity , there is no "standard" (Campbell , 2004) in this area .
As a result , the organizations which conduct these tests are the RFID companies themselves .
Thus their accuracy and safety declarations are usually not objective .
Secondly , tracking people may result in privacy crisis , which can cause more serious problems .
When you are implanted with a RFID chip or when you take some objects with RFID tags , the information about your location , your purchase list and so forth can be easily disclosed .
You can never have a leisurely afternoon , because your fellows can always find you during your vocation .
You can never keep your diet a secret , since your neighbors can easily know what you buy for food today .
The RFID supporters may argue that a lot of protecting means is provided in this case .
However , they should take note that electromagnetic waves are neither some entity which can be locked in a safe , nor digital data which can be stored in a computer .
"Coding" or "adding pin numbers" to them cannot stop people from getting them (Reported on Technovelgy .com) .
Thirdly , it is purposeless to track everyone .
It is true that RFID is really helpful for finding  lost children or tracing thefts .
However , only a very small percentage of people will get lost .
Similarly , not so many products will be stolen .
It will be meaningless and costly to track everyone just in case some of them may get lost someday .
Based on the three reasons  above ,  RFID is not reliable enough to give correct information about the tracked person .
Meanwhile , it may invade  users' privacy .
Finally , it is costly as well as unnecessary to track people .
Thus , it should be clear that tracking people by RFID should be banned .
Surveillance technology has been an increasingly important tool in both public and private sectors over the 50 years .
It is widely used to monitor an individual's activities and behaviors , for instance , to reduce theft or to enhance security .
The few examples of surveillance technology are digital video recorders , hidden spy cameras and RFID .
RFID will be the focus in this context .
RFID stands for"Radio-Frequency Identification ," which is a technology that uses radio waves to identify people or objects .
The use of RFID tags on products and humans have raised concerns for unauthorized access and invasion of privacy (Sottile , 2005) .
However , I do not agree that surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used in tracking people because of its important benefits like the prevention of children kidnapping and the improvement of elderly health care .
RFID technology , tag or implant , is useful in tracking children for kidnapping prevention .
Mexico ranks the second highest for the number of abductions  in each year (McHugh , 2004) .
As the kidnapping rate in Mexico rises , a Mexican firm implemented RFID implants to prevent kidnapping .
Xega , a security firm , offered RFID implantation to help in locating kidnap victims and it had been to proven to be successful as the business is booming (Rosenberg , 2008) .
In addition , a fashion designer Lauren Scott came out with a line of children's clothing that uses the RFID tag devices to track a child that has been taken more than 30 feet beyond their home .
The design was sold in the Spring of 2006 (Sottile , 2005) .
Although the parents can  keep track of their children  through a RFID reader ,  the safety of children is more important than their privacy .
Thus , RFID can be used to track a child as it can prevent kidnapping .
RFID technology can improve the health care of the elderly .
Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Intel Research Seattle found out that the caregivers can monitor the seniors' daily activities through the data received via internet from the RFID readers and record when and which tagged items they have picked up (Baard , 2004) .
This also means that the elderly will lose their freedom in which food they eat and thing they do .
However , caregivers need the real-time data and the record of an individual's normal daily routine  to identify any significant changes which , according to physicians and experts on aging ,  often indicate onset of illness and cognitive decline (Baard , 2004) .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track seniors' daily routine can improve their health care through early detection of health problems when they are at home .
In conclusion , RFID is useful to track children's activities and seniors' daily routine to prevent kidnapping and improve health care respectively .
I disagree against the idea that surveillance technology such as RFID should  be used to track people as some of its benefits are more important than privacy and freedom concerns .
The use of surveillance technology to track people has become possible due to the advancement in technology .
Among the technologies available , radio- frequency identification (RFID) is emerging mainly due to its ability to transmit information wirelessly via magnetic fields as well as the possibility of low cost tag in the future .
(Michalek , 2008) .
Even though the use of RFID in human tracking could help to improve on the safety and security , there are several threats such as privacy and health hazards that we need to consider .
Therefore , RFID should not be used to track  people when threats outweigh the benefits  .
One of the main concerns on RFID tracking would be privacy  .The use of RFID tags on consumer products could track humans in an indirect way .
With the function of wireless transmission , manufacturers and retailers would be able to track every single product and hence help to maintain security and keep track of the sale and stock .
The benefits go to the manufacturers and retailers but not to the consumers as the ability to keep track of the products that every single consumer bought would expose the identity of the consumer and intrude upon one's privacy .
(Hamblen  ,2007) In hospital , RFID implants have been used to store patients' clinical information with the claim that they could help to improve  medical services .
It is very hard to ensure that patient's personal information is solely used for clinical  purposes .
Both of the previously mentioned usages of RFID face the same distinct problem which is third party tracking .
(Hamblen  , 2007) .
This is mainly due to the reason that as long as one's antenna  could receive the same frequency  as the RFID tag , he would be able to track all the information .
The other main concern would be the health hazards .
According to some of the studies conducted  on tissue reactions to microchip implants in laboratory animals , 0 .8% to 10 .2% of laboratory mice and 2 cases in dog  developed malignant tumors  caused by implant chips  .Although the tests were not done on humans ,  the result is relevant to humans as humans are naturally subject to malignant tumor in response to foreign body implant .
(Albrecht , n .d .) One might argue that health hazards could be eliminated if RFID tag is used to replace the implant chips .
Long term exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by the antenna could be another health hazard that could not be treated lightly .
In conclusion , RFID usage in human tracking is not as simple and beneficial as we may have thought of .
There are a lot of hidden threats such as privacy issue and health hazards which we should really consider .
Thus , RFID should not be used to track on people .
Technology such as in surveillance had been an integral part of mankind's progress in the past , and it will continue to play a vital role in the 21st century .
There is an increase in the use of surveillance technology such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) these days especially in passports and hospitals .
These uses of surveillance technology have in many cases , brought about many benefits to mankind but there is also an increasing call for the ban of the usage of surveillance technology to track people as many are concerned with the loss of privacy and the exploitation of personal information .
However , we should never ignore the benefits that surveillance technology brings which outweigh the concerns .
Many countries are beginning to use RFID technology in passports .
By implanting RFID into passports , it will enhance security and at the same time , facilitate travel .
The RFID system will be embedded with the travelers' information and their travel history will also be automatically updated .
In addition , plane tickets implanted with RFID technology can also be issued .
These tickets will have the passengers' information in them and this will help to ensure a much efficient boarding and prevent unauthorized person from boarding the plane (ActiveWave Inc . , 2009) .
opponents of this position argue that RFID-installed passport is in fact , less secure than normal passport as anyone may be able to attain someone else's personal information with an RFID-reader .
They further argue that information in passports can easily be copied and embedded into a forged passport (Campbell , 2004) .
However , those arguments are not entirely valid as the US State department has highlighted that many precautionary measures have been implemented to prevent such security breaches from happening (Broache , 2006) .
The passport will be installed with a metallic layer which prevents others from obtaining information of the passport holder from a distance .
In addition , the information of the passport will be encrypted into codes and will only readable by authorities that are able to access the database (Broache , 2006) .
Although the use of surveillance technology in passports may not be perfect , with the rapid advancement in technological research , continuous improvement can be done in order to further enhance the security aspect of a passport .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used in tracking people for security purposes .
Another area in which surveillance technology has been widely used is in medical sector .
RFID have proven to be very useful as medical staff will be able to access the patients' medical and personal information quickly anywhere with just an RFID-reader (Stein , 2006) .
This enables doctors to get to know patients' medical condition quickly especially in time of emergency and also allows the patient's family members to be contacted immediately .
In addition , RFID can also be used for tracking of patients .
Tracking of patients using RFID helps to solve the problem of medical staff searching for patients that were lost when moving about between medical facilities for treatment .
This will raise the efficiency of treatment done in the hospital and also prevent patients from leaving the hospital without receiving full treatment .
According to Cox (2008) , a study was done by Spyglass Consulting Group in 2008 and the result has shown that the usage of RFID technology in hospitals has tripled since its last study in 2005 .
The increasing use of RFID technology in hospitals not only in the United State , but all around the world is a testimony of a growing approval by the medical staffs and general public alike , of the use of RFID technology in hospital .
The advances in technology have brought about much convenience to the society of modern times .
Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of it .
RFID is an automatic contact-less identification and data capturing technology using Radio Frequency (RF) signal .
The data can be read from a distance without the need of line of sight .
It can be used to track workers in dangerous working environment and identification of patients in hospitals .
To complete a RFID system , a tag which is known as transponder and a reader which is known as a transceiver is used used .
The tag emits RF signal which is received by the reader and data will be captured on the computer .
Although there are arguments that using RFID is invading people's privacy , the benefits are more prominent .
Thus , RFID should be used to track people .
RFID is used in dangerous workplaces to help in ensuring the safety of the workers .
Mining fields are one of the places .
Miners have to work in confined spaces with stale air , coal dust and hazardous equipments .
The used of RFID can help to minimize the risk involved .
In China , mining team used KJ-241 personnel and equipments locating system to track their miners (KJ-241 personnel and equipments Locating system for mining , 2007) .
Wearing the RFID tags allows the movements and attendance of the miners to be monitored .
In the case of accidents , the supervisors can get information on the numbers of trapped miners in the mining fields (KJ-241 personnel and equipments Locating system for mining , 2007) and through this  be able to plan evacuation routes .
This will greatly increase the efficiency in dealing with emergency .
Hence , RFID has good use in terms of tracking people .
Hospitals are another area that using RFID to track people can be of great effect .
Patients , doctors nurses do not need to have any RFID chips implanted in them .
They just need to wear removable RFID bracelets to allow the tracking of their movement .
This is especially useful when dealing with at risk patients with alzheimers (Healthcare Solutions n .d .) .
It will dangerous for them to roam around  hospitals alone as there are dangerous equipments and they may cause hindrance to life saving procedures .
Therefore , the hospitals staff are able to track  patients' movements using the RFID bracelets on them .
The most controversial issue in the use  of RFID to track people is the invasion of privacy .
Products bought by consumers may have RFID chips attached on them .
These chips are difficult to remove as they can be as small as half-millimeters squares in size and as thin as paper .
Usually , the chips are placed at area of products that are less visible (RFID tags are difficult to remove n .d .) .
Unknowingly , the movements and information of the consumers are being tracked by the vendors selling the products .
This can be seen as a form of invasion of privacy (Harper ,J .
2004) .
However , the used of RFID to store information can bring about much convenience and efficiency in hospitals .
The tags that patients wear contain their medical records like allergies , family medical history , current medication which the staffs are able to access with the help of RFID reader .
This greatly improves the efficiency in hospitals as compared to the past when all the information are documented in paper (Latest RFID Development Kit for Hospital Tracking Solution n .d .) .
Once again , this shows that RFID should be used to track people .
Technological advancement has made it possible to track people using electronic devices .
This inevitably has brought about many debates on the moral and ethical grounds .
There are views that it should be allowed on the grounds that such tracking devices actually bring about many benefits , but these benefits come at a heavy price; our privacy and rights .
Thus the use of surveillance technology should not be allowed .
the installation of surveillance devices is  getting common and it is actually a demonstration of the lack of trust between the management and the employee .
The productivity of the employee is a major concern of the company .
Such devices enable the management to keep an eye on the employees' activities making sure that it is in compliance with the company guidelines and theperformance of their duties .
However , the taking of such  a measure by the management is a violation of the employees' rights and privacy .
It will inevitably strain the relationship between the 2 parties and affect employee commitment and motivation towards their work .
In the end the productivity of the company will suffer as well due to the drastic change in the work culture .
Many surveillance devices like RFID are  actually capable of storing information , and hospitals have used it in tagging patient with critical conditions .
The advantage of it is that all the vital medical history of the patient can easily be retrieved if there is a need for emergency procedure .
That would save a lot of preliminary assessment procedures and help avoid many unnecessary complications like allergies .
On the surface the ability of the devices to save life seems remarkable , but it has serious risks of being abused .
Medical history of a patient is confidential , and storing all these information on the RFID tag/chip risk leaking out these information .
It is actually technological feasible to steal such information with just the access to a compatible tag/chip reader .
It is against one rights and privacy if such information got leaked , and prominent figures like celebrities and politicians are most likely the target of these hackers .
In 2006 , RFID was implanted into employees of citywatch .com working in the classified department , this ensure that only authorized personal has the rights to access the sensitive legal data and images .
The use of such sophistical technology no doubt preserves the integrity of these data , but it gave rise to the concern being tagged against one's will to be remained employed .
The implantations process is a "quick and relatively simple procedure" , but the removal of it is not .
These chips might migrate over the years or may have been placed too deeply .
Specialist like plastic surgeon and X-ray might be required to remove the chip .
In another word , if one was tagged , he risked being permanently marked for life due to the difficulty of removing the chip .
The use of RFID for tracking purpose exist as early the 1970s by the farmers to keep track of the cattles herd eating and reproductive habits .
It is still commonly used for tagging of endangered animals to aid in the study of their behavior in order to preserve their population .
Such technology has now being shifted from the animals and to be used on humans it is very degrading and this act displays a total lack of respect towards the tagged personnel .
As mentioned in the earlier passage , the removal of such tag is not easy and it poses a very high risk of leaking out confidential data of the personnel against his wish .
Hence , the use of such tagging devices should remain on the studies of the endangered wildlife and never on human .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology on tagging tagging people people poses a very  high risk in leaking out personal privacy data and it is an invasion of personal privacy .
The removal of an implanted  chip was not easy even if one wishes to reverse it .
Lastly it is an extremely degrading act to a fellow human , tagging him like a cattles in the farm , and hence the use of surveillance technology like RFID should be banned .
One important reason why we should use RFID is that it can help companies to improve working efficiency as well as protect the;r assets .
Company can make a standard on working time according to the conditions of the workers by putting an RFID tags on the them (Barkeemergence Besides , by tracking employees using RFID tags , managers of the companies can locate their workers immediately therefore they can know whether he or she is doing the job right there .
In this way , companies can make their goal in a much faster way .
Moreover , for retail company , RFID is also a possible tool for them to reduce tt and sabotage .
Since they can tracno main clauseD can help to keep companies assets as well .
company Another reason of using surveillance technology such as RFID to track people is that it can help to prevent crimes .
On important occasionCompanies there are a large number of people involved , it is nearly impossible for police and security stuffs to identify the criminals when crime occurs .
However , with the help of the surveillance technology , policeman can identify the crinimals very fast and catch them or pay attention to the suspicious at very first to prevent the crime before it can be committed .
In this way , such technology like RFID ccompaniessed to keep public safety .
While those who are against the surveillance technology insist that tracking people with RFID is a kind of intrusion to privacy and it shows disrespect to the individual .
They argue that the potential threaten of RFID is substantial sincestaffntains so much private information , therefore , if abusing RFID will lead to a serious consequence .
However , legislation is already in place national level and data protection authorities have been estahed to safeguard the unauthorized use of personal data(RFID Consultation , n .d .) .
Furthermore , the authorities have elaborated working documents on Data protection Issues about RFID to rigorously guide RFID deployers on application(RFID Consultation , n .d .) .
Therefore , the data acquired from individuals with RFID will be safely kept to ensure the privacy of the individual .
elaborateIn conclusion , it is apparent that the surveillance technology such as RFID to track people is an useful tool this modern society .
Since it substantially improves the efficiency of the employees of comthreatnd helps to protect assets .
Additionally , it is a effectivinformation .
Therefore inthe abuseiminals and preventcrimes atconsequencesing .
Thus , if we can utilize this kind of surveillance technology more appropriately and keep more strict regulation on its application all long , it will surely be supported worldwide .
As the application of surveillance technology such as RFID is becoming more common and widespread , the community has raised an that the tracking of people of tracking people using these surveillance technologies will harm human rights .
However , I think that the benefits of such surveillance technologies outweigh the cost cost of intruding human's privacy .
These technologies are beneficial in medical field , social security and natural disaster rescue or investigation .
There are several applications of surveillance technologies in the medical field .
One of them is implanting a RFID chip which contains the medical record of the patient in their body .
This RFID chip plays an important role to let  doctors to access to the patients' medical information when the patients are incapable to communicate ( Ahuja ,A . , 2006 ) .
With this easy access to patients' medical information , the fatality rate due to lack of information available to medical personnel will be reduced dramatically .
A solid example for the benefit of surveillance technology in medical field is the implanting of RFID chip into Alzheimer patients ( Swedberg ,C . , 2009) .
With the help of the chip implanted in these patients , medical personnel will encounter less difficulty in understanding the patients' medical information even if the patients' suffer from loss of memory due to the disease .
Furthermore , surveillance technologies can also be used to improve the social security .
Equipped with these surveillance technologies , our family member can locate us easily and hence decrease the kidnapping rate .
This application is proven to be effective when the Mexican Agency tried to use these surveillance technologies to curb the kidnapping epidemic in the country .
In the same time , the United States also implemented the use of surveillance technologies in their prison to control the violence rate .
The 60% decrease in the violence rate in these prisons proved that surveillance technology is effective in preventing the violence from happening ( {Kanellos}[HYPERLINK: mailto:michael .kanellos@cnet .com] ,M . , 2004) .
Thus , surveillance technologies in tracking people might be a good alternative in preventing criminal act from happening .
In addition , these surveillance technologies are also very effective during  rescue operations or investigations .
An implanted RFID chip can help the rescue team or investigation team to identify the deceased in case they were disfigured or trapped .
As an example ,  during the 911 incident rescue operations , the firefighters wrote their badge numbers on their arms so that they could be identified in case they are disfigured or trapped( {Kanellos}[HYPERLINK: mailto:michael .kanellos@cnet .com] ,M . , 2004) .
Thus , it will be much more convenient effective if these firefighters have implanted RFID chip which record their information .
It is no doubt that there are disadvantages in using surveillance technologies in tracking people .
However , surveillance technology is a tool; all technologies can be used in positive or negative way .
Just like the drugs , it can be used as poison but in the same time it is the medicine .
Although applying surveillance technology on people might lead harming human rights , we can minimise this situation by raising the security level of these RFID chip by encrypting the information it contains .
Surveillance technology helps to ensure security in the society .
It is useful in anti-terrorism .
Surveillance technology can be used to track the movement of the terrorists and arrest them before they cause greater damage to the society .
In New York , a group of men are under surveillance as they are suspected in a plot to use homemade bombs to attack New York City commuter trains (Hays & Barrett , 2009) .
With surveillance technology , such incidents can be prevented .
Thus , this results in a better security in the society .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be used to track people such as terrorists to ensure better security .
Surveillance technology can help to increase work efficiency .
In works that involve delivery , RFID can be used to ensure that employees do not go to any unauthorised places or misuse the vehicles during work .
Similar situations can be seen in the military vehicles in Singapore .
The movement of the vehicles are tracked to ensure that soldiers follow their tasks and do not misuse the vehicles for other personal reasons .
Critics of this position claim that it is invading their freedom .
However , during working hours , employees should be following their work .
They should not misuse the vehicles unless it is an emergency .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track people to increase work efficiency .
The opponents of surveillance technology argue that surveillance technology invades privacy .
As a result , surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
This argument is insufficient as security and safety are more important than privacy .
Privacy should be compromise for security and safety .
Hence , surveillance technology should be used to track people to allow better security and safety .
Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated .
This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due tocausenhealthy environmenisThe only way tspacesfy the increasing demands ofobtained is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodaof more nthat are inhospitableith the sdesertses .
It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there .
Besides a better usage of lands , a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath .
For example , countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system .

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern .
On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers , so the secret data and documents may be stolen .
On the other hand , some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks .
The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification .
This card contaitechnologicalta to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben , 2008) .
As we can see , the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability .

Nuclear technology has come a long way since Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917 .
The subsequent realization that the additional neutrons produced from fission reaction could induce a nuclear chain reaction has sparked off widespread interest in nuclear technology .
Since then , nuclear technology has been through wars and  arms races and has found many applications in the medical , industrial and energy fields .
The development of nuclear technology was also heavily influenced by public opinion , especially after disastrous accidents occurred in nuclear power stations .
The steady growth of nuclear power in the 1960s was hampered by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 and the growing voices of the anti-nuclear movement .
The leakage of radioactive gas into the atmosphere prompted the many anti-nuclear demonstrations that sprang up across  America in the following months .
Although the reactor was eventually cleaned up and decontaminated , the damage dealt to nuclear power was irreversible and caused its subsequent decline .
This is especially evident in the steady drop of the number of nuclear reactors built , a statistic that was rising prior to the accident .
With rising oil prices and growing concerns of global warming , countries are looking to nuclear power to solve the energy needs of tomorrow .
China , the factory of the world , consumes phenomenal amounts of energy to fuel its economic growth .
To partly offset this gigantic demand for energy , China has launched an ambitious program to produce 16% of its electricity from nuclear power by 2030 .
This endeavor to produce more nuclear power has stimulated the development of safer designs of nuclear reactors .
One example is the Pebble Bed reactor , an innovative design that is being actively researched in China .
Safety concerns characterize the basic concept of the Pebble Bed reactor with its passive safety design .
In this design , nuclear fuels are contained in spheres or 'pebbles' of graphite .
Hence the nuclear fuels are contained in a more stable environment .
When machinery failure occurs and reactor temperature increase to extremely high levels , the reactor does not undergo a meltdown or explode; instead , temperature just stays at the high level until the heat can be dissipated or cooled by coolant liquids .
In conclusion , nuclear technology development has always been driven by social factors .
World War 2 has given it momentum in its initial research , but it will be mankind's need for a renewable and environmentally friendly energy source that will drive nuclear technology's future developments .
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which traps heat within the Earth .
As such , global surface temperature has risen by 0 .74 degree Celsius for the past century .
Global warming has brought along devastating problems which will affect the lives of many if ignored .
Engineering can help to address this issue by designing technologies which are capable of producing little or no carbon dioxide .
According to Khandani's article on 'Engineering design process'1 , there are five steps to designing processes .
First of all , we have to define the problem .
One of the main causes of global warming is the excessive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
To reduce heat trapped within the atmosphere , carbon dioxide level has to be reduced .
Engineers will have to design technologies which keep carbon dioxide emission to the minimum .
Presently in the market , there are already technologies which can replace present day equipment and emit less carbon dioxide .
However these products are not manufactured in large quantities due to high cost of production and low demand .
As such , engineers will have to design technological products which are able to keep both carbon dioxide emission and cost to the minimum , yet perform as efficiently as the present day products .
Second , engineers have to gather relevant information to assist them in generating ideas to tackle the problem .
As the subject has been discussed for quite some time , relevant information is readily available on the internet and  in magazines and newspapers .
Third , engineers have to generate multiple solutions to solve the problem .
These solutions may be generated by analyzing existing products to find out how the weaknesses can be improved while retaining the strengths .
We must also value-add the product to make it even more attractive .
On top of that , engineers can also obtain a variety of similar products and analyze them together .
Constantly combining ideas will result in better solutions being formulated .
Fourth , engineers have to analyze all the solutions which they have generated and apply professional knowledge to decide on a solution .
Engineers will have to use their technical knowledge to analyze the feasibility of the solutions .
They will then analyze the solutions in the economic and social aspects .
These products have to be sold in the market; hence , consumers must be convinced that these environmentally friendly products are as good as the present equipment in terms of performance and cost .
Therefore careful analysis of a product has to be made before selecting a solution for testing and implementation .
Last of all , engineers have to test and implement the solution which was selected in the previous step .
According to Khandani's article , engineers can test the solution by prototyping or concurrent engineering .
Prototyping involves constructing the prototype and testing it under real conditions .
Full scale production will not take place until extensive testing has been done .
Concurrent engineering requires a prototype to be constructed and the design is fine-tuned along the process .
However this tedious process is made easy through modern computer-aided design , analysis , and manufacturing software .
These computer simulations take significantly shorter time; hence , they are a preferred choice as it means that the product can be sold in the market in a shorter period of time .
Through the five designing steps , a process can be designed to meet the need to decrease carbon dioxide level .
Engineers design products or systems that meet human needs .
One current human need that should be given priority is the search for renewable resources .
Everywhere in the world , fuel is used extensively .
From large scale power generators to the basic cooking at our homes , fuel is essential for all of these to happen and work .
Research has shown that fuel consumption has increased twenty percent over the last decade , and has projected that the depletion of fuels is drawing .
In addition , burning of fuels emits various harmful gases which pollute our fragile environment .
These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Engineers around the world have already started on working on this problem .
To guide themselves in this heavy responsibility of saving the earth , they have used a set of simple steps  , known as the Engineering Design Process .
This process consists of five major steps , mainly defining the problem , researching on information pertaining to the problem , brainstorming of ideas , filtering of the ideas , and lastly implementing the ideas .
Firstly , we can define this worldwide problem as the search for alternative resources to the existing near-depletion fuels .
Since fuels are non renewable and emit so much harmful gases , the alternatives that we are looking for should be a renewable energy source and not emit harmful pollutants .
Next , we have to gather relevant information about the problem so that we are able to ensure that the solution we are looking for is able to solve the problem directly .
Studies have shown that an average of 2 lbs (pounds) of fuel is needed to produce 1kilowatt of power .
In addition , we realize that burning of fuels produces a large amount of greenhouse gases .
Thus , the alternative resources we are searching for must be able to produce this large amount of energy to replace fuels , as well as not emitting that huge amount of harmful gases .
After identifying the important factors , engineers proceed on their search for solutions .
They will generate and brainstorm innovative ideas .
Alternatives such as the use of water energy and wind energy are some examples .
With these ideas , we have to analyse and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of them .
An example is water , which is a good renewable resource and is plentiful .
However , water energy can only be a small option due to the feasibility .
This is because a large body of water is needed to harness the same energy produced by a small amount of fuel .
All the solutions will be thoroughly analysed by  engineers before coming to a conclusion .
Lastly ,  engineers will put their solution to test and ensure that the solution is able to solve the problem .
As such , engineers made use wind turbines and water hydraulic generators to harness the wind and water energy respectively .
Harnessing the wind and water energy may not be the best option , but both sources are renewable and are able to be used to slow down the depleting resource - fuel .
This has shown that the engineering design process is essential in solving problems , and it ensures that the problem is thoroughly looked into and  that the engineers are generating ideas that target the main problem , the depletion and harmful fuel .
Many years ago , the situation is different .
In 1931 , Qian Weichang entered Tsing Hua University , major in history with 0 marks in mathematics and physics .
However , after one year study , he found history not suitable for himself and became interested in physics and showed great talent .
When he appealed to change his major , the professor saw his creativity and eagerness , so hethe whole society appeal .
After seing and studying , Qian Weichang made many great breakthroughs in physics .
However , this kind of story cawasnever be found in modern days .
Recently , a student got a very goomajoringult in the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) , but he did not year'sr the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him  100 ,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his provinyears of 
topthe secondaryfor anotherCreativity is developed by students' exploring through their self-learning .
However , the present education system leads students to another way .
Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Another big problem is that Chinese pexplorationally do not value innovation enough .
In China , it will take several years for a new technology or new engineering design to be put tice .
Mresources many of the patents will never be used in production .
Most factories are not willing to spend money and time on innovation .
This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
haveandHowever , in developed countries , people really appreciate innovation .
When a new technology comes out , usually it will be put into use within two or three months .
Therefore , people are well motivated to do research and design , and industry updates frequently .
Finally , great innovation may come .
21st century will be a more competitive and challenging opportunity for China to develop .
Whether China can take this chance to catch up with those well-developed countries or even surpass them depends on China's trail of solvina can come up with effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation , China's pace to flourish may become even faster .
With the increase in human population , the human race has come to a point where desperate action needs to be taken to feed the millions of people in starvation .
Statistics show that the numberis only continuing to grow with the existing population explosion .
If the need of feeding millions of starving people is put forward to an engineer , he can view it as a broad topic with many possible solutions .
Some solutions  would be to design plants/fertilizers that give higher yield or working with health experts introducing new ways to control population growth .
From that point onwards he could design different possible approaches to what he expects to do .
He could genetically modify the plants genome to match with a plant that gives greater product or he could create a new genetic material for a higher yielding food plant .
Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important .Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and  agrees with existing international laws .
At this point also any available detail into the viability of the method is valuable .
Lastly comes the most crucial part of an engineering design process .
This determines how accurate the engineer has been in his work and also if he has looked at nature as a  factor during his designing process .
The testing stage is usually either the most rewarding or the most heart- breaking stage of a design process .
Even though the solution seems perfect according to calculations , there are "nature factors" that we cannot control which still affect any process  under the sun .
It is likely that this genetically modified plant with three hundred percent yield is actually not surviving until harvest .
If that is the case , what the engineer would do is to analyze the problem at hand and point out exactly which part of the solution needs to be modified .
Another aspect of great engineers is their ability to optimize processes .
This includes less useless waste , more recyclable waste material and high productivity .
So any engineering process can be continuously modified into a faster , better and greener one .
It is self-explanatory that every engineering design process is naturally a cyclic process .
There is no definite correct solution for the question at hand .
With the many possible solutions , what a smart engineer does is to figure the best solution and introduce the best way of executing it , so that the need is fulfilled immediately and effectively .
The process of developing a new product based on innovation is not an easy task for  innovators .
Innovators , who  normally work with a Research and Development department , have to recognize the needs from the public or through research , and are requiredrequired to spend countless days and nights to understand the problems , to produce solutions to the problems , to convert the solutions into practical products and to commercialize them .
By diffusion and adoption of the innovation products by the public or specific users ,  innovators have to face the consequences .
These are not the only challenges that  innovators are going to deal with .
In order to process from the initial stage of innovation development to the final stage , the most important issue is to have a huge sum of fund for development and commercial purposes .
So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that  innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Innovators require development fund in order to obtain their needs , such as hardware equipments to work on their prototypes .
But at times , there are some critical situations that happen or affect   manufacturing company; then  innovators somehow get to be involve too .
For example , if the manufacturing company did not earn profit in the market , then in order to reduce the cost and prevent the loss from getting worse , the manufacturing company has to stop funding the innovators for their prototypes development .
Then the innovators have to stop all work for the development .
For another example , during this recent economic downturn , most of the major manufacturing companies are slowing down in manufacturing existing products and releasing new products .
This shows that the manufacturing companies are trying to reduce the unnecessary burden to maintain the companies' stand .
Therefore , this is one of the major factors that will definitely affect the innovators from developing innovation products .
Another challenge that  innovators need to be concerned about is commercializing the finalized products .
In this final stage , it is all about  packaging , marketing and distribution of the products .
There are cases where marketing departments do not wish to market the innovated products due to various reasons .
For example , the marketing department thinks that the innovated products are not relevant to what the company is selling .
Therefore , the innovated products are unable to meet the consumers .
Another example is that the marketing department has set the price of the innovated product too high; therefore , it fails to obtain the sales target for  selling the innovated product .
So , this is another major factor that  innovators have to face .
In brief , innovators have to face many challenges when they want to develop new products .
They have to obtain fund from  investors in order to develop their innovation prototypes and require help from the marketing department to have their innovation products for sales in the marketplace .
However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .
Political issues usually become realized in the beginning and final steps , especially in the last step .
In thsatisfyng step , we have to define the problem in a clear and unambiguous way .
Besides , a clear recognition of the real need is also important .
However , in some cities of China , the government wants to minimize the time speengineeringoblem solving process to show their problems in handling problems and force the engineers to skip the first step or just accept the information the government provides .
And in the end such a design may turn to be useless as it does not meet people's demand .
In the last step of design , political issues also disturb the process significantly .
For example , in my hometown Harbin , the government decided to develop an underground traffic system .
This design was welcomed by most of the citizens and the whole design process was carefully carried out .
However , when the design had been carried out for a few weeks , it was stopped .
The government's explanation was because of safety consideration for earthquakes and some other disasters .
But such explanation was of non-sense as the engineers did not see such possibility during their designing; otherwise the design would not be carried out at all .
Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
In this example , there is nothing wrong with the original design work , but the design still cannot be carried out due to political inconsistent between the city government and higher level authorities .
The similarities of political obstacles in both two steps are that such problems cannot be easily solved by the engineering group , in other words , the political problems are unavoidable to some degree .
;inconsistencythe workthe haltforAnother problem , financial issue , is quite common during design process .
It affects the analyzing and test step most seriously though it can affect almost every step of design work .
For most design work , the engineers are always employed by some organizations or companies .
Without financial support , the collection of relative information and research of the various solutions have to be done in a simpler maand thusrforces may lead to the final failure of a design project .
During these two steps , different solutionInld be carried out in a smaller scale to examine their characteristics and to test their performance in order to make a decision .can alsonot enough fund is provided , the experiment may not be as precise as it should be to minimize the cost .
Such simplification may lead to an incorrect choice .
Besides , the lack of financial support or sudden stop in the financial support may even lead taftere incomplete of a project .
For instance , there is one half-built bridge near my home .
It was hamstrk of funds .
Compared to the political issues , the financial problem affecan explanationps anmore common around the world .
But engineers sa possibility little to avoid such problems
and is moreincompletionIn conclusion , the two most significant problems that hamthe designe engineering design process are poand theitestingand financial problems .
Both of these two problems , though affecting different processes , can lead a completely failure of a project .
Therefore , governments and authorities should pay more attention to these problems in order to get better design work for the country .
Legend has it that the world is created by God .
This may be true; however , God didn't give us a perfect world .
Humankind always has needs and demands because people want to lead a more comfortable and easier life .
So , they try to invent things which could help them achieve their goals .
Therefore , in modern society , engineering has become more important; the role of an engineer is to design a safe and efficient product or a system that minimizes the damages to the environment or brings benefits to the human kind .
There are various fields which engineering plays an important role in our daily lives , such as entertainment , healthcare , transportation , real estate , and so on .
As what Khandani(2005) said , a company's survival depends on whether its products are in high demand by the society or not .
Most companies are more interested to invent entertainment electronic goods such as flat LCD screens , smaller and smaller mp3/mp4 players , touch screen hand phones , more portable laptops , and so on which are most demanded in the market .
Though these products are highly sought-after and trendy , they are not the most essential things to people unlike healthcare products .
For example , a person can lead his life peacefully without a laptop or hand phone , but , can a person survive happily with the absence of good health ?
The answer should be 'No' as health is the first priority in a person's life .
If a person is feeling unwell , he will have no mood to enjoy any other facilities and products .
Thus , one current human need that should be given priority is nothing else than healthcare products .
Among quite a number of healthcare products available in market , prosthetic limbs play one of the most important roles .
Prosthetic limbs are artificial legs or arms which replace the missing parts of the body .
They are needed for various reasons , including congenital defects , accidents or  some diseases .
Losing a body part can make a person's life miserable .
They may lose not only mobility but also self-confidence .
In this case , prosthetics limbs can help those disabled people to regain their mobility and confidence .
So , designing the prosthetic limbs should be encouraged as it can really change a person's life .
According to Khandani(2005) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes , which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
When defining the problem , the cost , safety and liability , comfort , ergonomic and simplicity must be taken into account .
For example , most of the disabled cannot afford to spend a lot of money on those prosthetic limbs or some of them have an allergy to the materials used in the product .
Before considering the possible solutions , we need to collect all the information that relates to the problem so that we can avoid redefinition and wasting time .
After we confirm that the problem is real and a new solution is needed , we then proceed to step 3 in which we have to brainstorm the multiple solutions .
In this step , we can do it in two ways: to improve the existing idea by finding out the weaknesses or to come up with a totally new and creative idea by researching and testing .
Once we have alternative solutions to the design problem , we can analyze them and decide which one should be the most suitable for the needs .
Finally , we can implement and test the design we have chosen and if we find any problems , we can go back to step 4 and select another solution .
Well designed prosthetic legs can give a disabled person a new taste of life .
According to the article about an amputee sprinter , Oscar Pistorius , who does not have both legs but wants to take part in 2008 Olympics with his J-shaped blades(artificial legs) made of carbon fibers , confidently said that " there is nothing he cannot do that able-bodied athletes can do ."
This is the proof that how a successful design can be beneficial to a needy person .
To sum up , apart from the prosthetic legs , there are still many other areas in healthcare industry that need to be improved such as artificial kidney , artificial hearts , pacemakers , medical imaging and diagnosis devices which are very advantageous to humankind .
Governments should also encourage more the research and development of these products .
With the systematic design processing , there will be more upcoming amazing healthcare products in the future .
The cost of raw materials has risen significantly from the year 2003 to the year 2009 and it has affected the electronics supply chain .
We will look at two very important components in the manufacture of electronic components , gold and copper .
From the points above , we can see that due to the increasing price of raw materials , it is very difficult to come up with new products consistently as it is very costly to build them .
High selling price of the product will often deter potential customers and hence result in a fall of profit .
Lastly , engineers must ensure that the product is safe to use or it will end up not only spoiling the reputation of the company but even injuring or killing someone .
The price of gold has risen from about US$380/troy ounce in June 2003 to about US$960/troy ounce in June 2009 ("Trend") .1 Gold is a very important component in electrical conductivity and thus is often used in contact points such as the communicating interface between the graphics card and the motherboard .
Hence designs that need a large amount of gold may not be feasible .
When engineers turn to other types of cheaper materials , some functions and accuracy of the end product may be sacrificed .
However , if the engineers are to stick to their original design , the cost of the end product will be high .
The high cost of the product may deter possible customers and in the end , the profit of the company will drop .
One example would be the grounding of electronic devices .
When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally comes into contact with the device .
If the current is very strong , there is even a chance that the user may die .
Another example would be the case of Apple's iPhone .
There are many reports around the internet and on newspaper stating that some users' iPhones exploded and the main cause is due to the overheating of the lithium- ion battery .
Lithium-ion battery has a temperature tolerance of about 60OC and anything above that will make the battery unsafe for use .
In the worst case scenario , the battery explodes , causing injury or death to the user .
Hazardous products can tarnish the reputation of the company and sometimes even result in the loss of innocent lives .
Thus it is very important for engineers to do repeated trial tests of the product to ensure that it is free of faults .
The engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current  to cater to  .
This process has always been seen as indispensable as part of the country's economic growth in the manufacturing sector .
However , the results of the recent National Innovation System (NIS) survey show that Singapore has a long way to go in its development of an innovation-based economy , especially in comparison to the other OECD countries .
As we understand the relevance and importance of engineering design , we will come to realize that in reality there are several factors that prevent the progress of engineering design .
Firstly , engineering design processes incur excessive costs .
Due to high global demand in the world's limited natural raw materials , the prices of copper and silicon have rocketed sky high .
Engineering processes for innovations such as the wafer fabrication and semi-conductor industries are directly affected by the prices of the raw materials .
As a result , research and development in these fields today have become significantlymore costly compared to R & D costs in previous years .
In Singapore , there is  a certain fixed amount in the country's national budget allocated to the research and development sector .
Since it is more expensive to conduct creative engineering research , it is inevitable that there would be a slight reluctance in contributing more assets to engineering design by the government; hence , the reality of the support given by the government is weak .
Moreover , the government also has other areas to spend their resources .
Some feel that in these tough economic times , it is wiser to splurge the money on restructuring the economy or providing more incentives to instill entrepreneurship , rather than investing in research in engineering design .
Hence , the area of innovative research and development in engineering is not driven to full swing .
Secondly , the amount of creative people in Singapore is small , which may be a major reason for the hampering of innovative engineering design .
The population of Singapore is scarce compared to other countries in the region .
In countries like China and India , the populationamount in the billions whereas the population of Singapore is only 4 .5 million .
The fact that Singapore has limited human resource limits the number of creative people in the country .
For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in  China .
As a result , the number of creative Singaporeans would be much lower relative to other countries .
Although there are many Singaporean-based driven engineering design projects like NEWater plants , much of our economic success  is highly dependent on other countries .
For example , most of our latest mass spectrometry equipment used in the area of engineering design is largely obtained from Germany .
In areas of mechanical engineering , our latest machineries are either bought or are replicas of  models in Japan .
The impact of having a limited amount of creative people has resulted in Singapore having to resort to buying foreign-based engineering design equipment from overseas .
In conclusion , even though we realize the importance of engineering design processes in innovation , there are still problems like rising costs and population scarcity  that hinders the progress of the engineering process .
Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .
One typical example is the invention of "post-it" notes .
There are some similarities and differences between serendipity-based technology and technology developed through researchsuch as the technology used in a refrigerator .
Firstly , both serendipity-based technology and technology developed via research are initiated by the realization of problems and needs .
When people encounter problems or have demands on certain things , they will usually try to solve the problems through research and development .
The invention of the refrigeratorwas in the 1910s as  people were facing the problem of food storage in summer when  no icehouse could be used .
Research and development was done to solve this problem and eventually boosted the invention of the refrigerator .
This is how most conventional technologies have been invented .
Similarly , bearing the problems and needs in mind , when unexpected experiment or research results come up ,  researchers or scientists  would just apply these to solve some other problems which may be totally unrelated to their initial research objectives .
The Post-it note was invented in this way  .
3M , the famous Scotch tape company , discovered an unsuccessful bonding agent that could not stick paper tightly hundreds years ago .
However , the 3M researchers found out this failed bonding agent was suitable for attaching notes which satisfied many people's needs .
Thus the post-it note was invented from this idea .
In this manner , many other serendipitous technologies have been discovered and have solved many  problems .
Thus , it is fair to say that both conventional technology or serendipitous technology are stimulated by the realization of problems and needs .
, another similarity between conventional technology and serendipitous technology is the process of development and commercialization .
After the discovery of the creative inventions from either research or serendipity , the more important step is the integration of the inventions .
In this process , the attractiveness and practicality of the inventions are improved such that they can be converted into useful products which are accepted by most people .
If the refrigerator had remained as it was invented in the 1910s and no further development had been made to improve its quality , the refrigerator would just be an unsuccessful invention due to its low efficiency and high cost .
After converting a new technology into a useful product comes  the process of marketing; that is , how other people get to know about your products and are convinced to use them .
For example , the 3M researchers sent their post-it products to Fortune 500 companies' presidents and secretaries to publicize their products .
Finally 3M achieved a huge success as its products were world-famous through the Fortune 500 companies .
From these two examples  , it is clear that another similarity between conventional technology and serendipitous technology is the process of development and commercialization which involve a lot of hard work .
Besides the similarities , there are some differences between research-based technology and serendipitous technology .
Firstly and most significantly ,  conventional technology , a process of research is required .
Research is usually based in certain organizations and it requires some time , funds and resources before the researchers can finally obtain the expected results .
In the invention of the refrigerator , many companies like General Electric , Kelvinator and Postum organized  research groups to invent and develop the refrigerator .
However , for serendipitous technology , research is not a necessary process .
Many new ideas may just be generated from daily life , from mistakes made accidentally or during research for other technology .
For instance , the idea of the post-it pads was  generated from a failed product when 3M researches  to invent a new bonding agent .
In addition , serendipitous new ideas can be generated by anyone .
The only challenge is whether or not they can grab the opportunity and do further development to make the ideas into useful technologies .
However for conventional technology is limited to people with professional knowledgelike researchers or scientists .
In conclusion , although serendipitous technology seems easier to achieve than research-based technology in the research process , it still requires a lot of hard work to further develop  and one still needs to acquire the essential knowledge before one would know how the unexpected discoveries can been used to solve the problems  .
Thus , a serendipitous technology can be seen as a conventional technology obtained with less research .
Concerning financial difficulty in engineering innovation , there are two aspects .
First of all , the biggest problem is the whole country lacking money .
As most people know , China , like most of the developing countries , is not as rich as the developed countries , such as Singapore .
Making creations is quite a money-consuming job , so engineers in China adifficulty that thertosinnovative inventionsareey put into ithe educational background of the Chinese China is the efficiency of production .
Thus , more resources are distributed to production instead of innovation .
Besides the first problem , the second one related to finance is that the average income of common Chinese people is relatively low .
An industrial invention needs users immediately after it is created by engineers or it may soon fall out of the market and then eliminated by the society .
Chinese engineers are not short of fantastic innovating ideas but market .
The electrical and the gas cars have been applied for some time .
Over 10 years ago , some states in the U .S . decided that 10% of the total number of cars must be environmentally friendly , that is to say , cars running on electricity or gas .
(Rogers , 2003) Up to now , in China , only some public buses in Beijing run on gas whose fuel is supported by the government .
This comparison does not mean that Chinese people are ignoring the environment but most of us cannot afford an electrical or a gas car which is far more expensive than a common one using gasoline as fuel .
Very similar to the non- polluting cars , China also has lots of creative engineering innovations , but due to higher cost than old products of the same kind , they cannot be accepted by the market .
This problem greatly slows down the pace of creation and invention in China .
compared totheir highermanythe case of the non-polluting carsthe Chinese(Rogers , 2003) .For example , thethey lack the market for their innovationsinnovativedo not lackto be marketed successfully There are two aspects with regard to the problem of funding for engineering innovation .ese education has a bigger of over 200that theears .
Through tlackssands of years , most Chinese scholars are greatly affected by the Confucianism .
One of the core theories is to teach people to obey the rules and regulatirequires substantial fundinge , is like breaking the old rules and regulations and creating sometinsufficientTfundings , in fact , not encouraged by the traditional idea of Chinese people .
As a result , people with Chinese educational background tend to apply the old inventions better tSecondem
It is very complicated to find out reasons hindering innovation in Chinaile finance and education do have some effect on it .
Despite the obstacles mentioned above , China is now mohave beeng its focus to build innovation-enConfucianism , oneged society .
I believeof which ishese problems obstructinggineering innovation will be solved in the near future .
In today's context where failures are condemned and successes are applauded , scientists , researchers and engineers are expected to discover new technologies and innovations which are exact and practical the first time round .
This is also illuminated in organisations and bureaucracies , which are structured to provide stability and continuity , being inflexible towards nurturing innovations (Rogers , 2003) because failures will tarnish their reputations .
Hence ,  have begun to adopt a secretive approach towards inventions and they go "underground" for research and development .
This is termed as skunkwork .
Understanding the differences and similarities between such a path that inventors take and conventionally generated technologies will help us to better appreciate their efforts & the hardships they have to go through in their endeavours .
Despite their seemingly fishy name , skunkworks are actually maintained and driven by professional individuals , highly trained in specific fields , similar to personnel who are involved in conventionally generated technologies .
For instance , during the pioneer year of the National University of Singapore's Formula Society of Automotive Engineering (NUS FSAE) , outstanding undergraduates who show exceptional talents and skills among their peers were selected to work on a new project of building an eco-friendly race car to compete on the international platform .
Having considered the uncertainties and their inexperience towards the new project , the team had to keep a low profile and work behind closed doors as the university's reputation was at stake if they were to fail .
Another similarity between skunkworks and conventionally generated technologies is that both are given adequate funds and resources by the authority to maintain their operations .
For example , being a highly classified project , the Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects Division , an American aerospace company , was funded by the government to develop the latest aircraft to fight in World War II (Roger , 2003) .
Likewise , the Singapore government has also invested heavily on the transportation system in her plan to build better and more cost efficient MRT stations over the next 6 years (STBT , September 2009) .
The provision of funds and resources is critical towards the productivity of researches and innovations .
However , in order to escape routine organizational procedures , inventors and researchers working in a skunkworks environment are more often abused in contrast to the people working withina conventional system .
This is because , with little supervision , working conditions and workplace safety are often unregulated and compromised .
For example , the creation of the Macintosh was the collaborated effort of fifty computer designers who worked day and night under an abusive and aggressive leadership (Roger , 2003) .
On the other hand , within the conventional system , innovators are supposed to abide by strict workplace safety guidelines and routine organizational procedures .
They work in a conducive environment to accomplish their tasks .
To conclude , both skunkworks and conventionally generated technologies are undertaken by a group of professionals who are given adequate funds and resources .
However , they receive different forms of treatments and work in different environments .
This is to meet the society's expectation for them to come out with inventions which are correct the first time round .
From the past to the present , many important innovations have surfaced .
Some of these innovations have been shaped by technology while others have been created from the needs and desires of society .
A crucial invention which has eased man's ways of living is the aircraft .
According to  "Centuries of dreaming preceded the first successful flight" which suggests that the basis of this innovation was  man's dream to fly like the birds they see in the sky .
Hence , aircrafts were a socially determined technology which has developed over time , catering to the needs of humanity .
Firstly , the military aspects was crucial in shaping the aircraft .
Planes of the present versus those of the past show a noticeable improvement in agility and speed .
In World War I (WWI) , for example , planes were fairly slower and more bulky; as mentioned by  "Huge biplane bombers with two , three , or four engines were introduced in World War I" .
However , the military learnt from the fighting techniques used in combats during WWI and required aircrafts which were able to negotiate tighter turns and break the speed of sound so as to evade enemies or catch up with them .
World War II showed improvements in the design and ability of aircrafts , making them smaller and therefore swifter .
In addition , fighters of today are even more advanced and able to break the sound barrier .
Take for example the "F-15 Eagle , which excels at air-to-air defence tactics and which has a maximum speed of over Mach 2 .5" , or "the F-16 Falcon , a highly maneuverable all-purpose fighter-bomber" (AIRPLANE , 2009) .
These planes are a mark of development not only in speed but also in agility .
Most importantly , we see that the needs of the military were a driving force behind the development and enhancement of the aircraft .
Secondly , social factors have guided the growth of planes .
The globalised style of living which has translated to the need to transport increasingly large numbers of passengers , and the need for fast delivery of goods or letters have been some of the social issues that have shaped the airplane .
It is noticeable that the size of commercial planes has increased over the years in  response to  the rise in global travelers .
In the 1930's , a DC-3 "carried 21 passengers" (Commercial Aviation) , while in the late 1950's , the "DC-8 could carry 258 passengers" (Commercial Aviation) .
The Airbus' A380 in our world today carries up to "525" passengers (A380 Family , 2009) .
A logical rationale for the creation of such a large capacity airplane would be the increased demand in air travel due to globalisation .
Moreover , the U .S . Post Office Department  for domestic airlines between 1918 and 1927 as mentioned by  Likewise , in today's world , global air freight agencies such as "DHL" or "Fedex" require planes that are able to travel long distances fast in order to ensure that mail is delivered to end users in the shortest time possible .
Therefore , it is evident that globalisation and the need to send parcels swiftly to customers have in a way shaped aircrafts .
In conclusion , the aircraft of today , a socially determined technology , has developed from its ancient clumsy and slow predecessors to its new age , swift and agile successors .
These modifications would indeed not have been possible if not for the varying social as well as military requirements during different eras .
When there is a need for something , a technology is created to solve the problem .
The same applies for the eco-friendly car .
There are many factors that contribute to the creation of the eco-friendly car .
The factors are - political , economic , technological , environmental and social .
In 2006 , a documentary film , An Inconvenient Truth , written by former United States Vice President Al Gore , sparked a series of heated discussions after it was screened in cinemas .
It sent a message to the world about the drastic environmental changes due to decades of environmental abuse by mankind and what will happen if we choose to ignore this issue .
Subsequent actions were taken by the American government to administer a regulation that car companies could only sell ninety percent of cars with normal machinations while the other ten percent had to be eco friendly cars .
This implied that automobile companies had to pull in large sums of money for research and development work to create and promote the sales of such cars .
Without pressure from the government , no automobile company would have taken the initiative to manufacture and market out those vehicles .
Today , economic factors also stress the need for eco-friendly cars .
However the cost to finance this project will be high as much research and development has to be done .
Even though it is expensive to develop eco-friendly cars as they cost around two to three times more compared to gasoline powered cars ,  this move is vital due to the slow depletion of natural resources for vehicle consumption which leads to the increment of fuel prices .
In the long run , it will not be economically viable to own a gasoline powered car .
One reason for this is that the servicing costs are lower for eco-friendly cars that operate on electricity as compared to gasoline powered automobile with internal combustion engines .
Compared to the fuel powered car , the eco-friendly car may be at the losing end due to its speed , its mileage and time taken for battery chargingwhile Fuel powered cars are capable of running longer distances , do not require battery charging time and are capable of reaching maximum speeds within seconds .
However , eco-friendly car developers are constantly coming up with newer technologies to improve their cars so that in the near future these cars would definitely function just as well as the gasoline powered cars .
One of the main purposes for the creation of eco-friendly cars is the environmental factor .
The need to reduce pollution levels plays a very important role in the development of eco-friendly cars .
Since the past decade , people have been getting more conscious of the damage that we have been inflicting on the earth .
As mentioned , the Inconvenient Truth has shown that there is a direct link between carbon emissions and the rising temperatures of the earth .
Statistics have shown that in the past century , carbon emissions have sky rocketed to ridiculously high levels and carbon emissions mainly comes from us humans when we burn fossil fuels for our own usage .
As carbon dioxide "stocks up" in the atmosphere over the years , it traps the sun's heat , thus creating global warming which eventually leads to various climate changes .
Using eco- friendly cars would reduce the carbon emissions per car drastically .
One of the first things we can do to help conserve the environment is to switch from gasoline cars to eco-friendly cars .
As awareness of the effects of climate changes grows , people realize that it is their social responsibility to try to undo the environment damages to the best of their ability .
Hence , more people are seeking  greener alternatives .
Even British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , has urged that all cars in Britain should be green by 2020 .
In conclusion , the creation of eco-friendly cars are shaped by the factors mentioned above and I believe that not only is this creation one of a kind , but also that it is here to stay and that it is one of the key creations for the future generations to further develop .
In the rapid economic development of the 21st century , the demand for energy is increasing .
However , the Earth can only provide us limited energy .
We cannot increase the amount of fossil fuel  .
Hence , the use of renewable energy is very important in our planet's future development .
There are many alternative sources of energy that can be used and applied in our life , such as solar energy , light energy , wind energy , water power and so on .
Not only do all these alternative sources of energy help help reduce our dependence on non-renewable energy sources , but but the power generation processes for renewable energy are also friendlier environment .
Currently , since people realised the features of environmental protection and the economic efficiency of  solar energy , the use of solar energy has been made use of more and it has become widespread in ordinary life .
Energy from the sun's rays is known to be very environmentally friendly as it is a clean form of energy .
In order to produce electricity or thermal energy , only the sunlight is needed .
only a solar collector and solar panels are needed to convert energy into electricity .
Another advantage is that it costs less than conventional power generation and heating .
In return  , but this also means there is no need  to maintain the heaters .
However , solar energy is available in the evening , so that energy storage is an important issue to providing a continuous supply of energy .
In order to keep providing heating ,  an efficient method to store solar energy is by using heat-of-fusion units which use chemicals to change water to a solid form .
, except that the liquid absorbs the sun's rays and then the chemicals convert the liquid to a solid so it traps the energy .
Then the incidental heat traps are installed to warm the floor and house .
A stone floor is required so that the heat can come into the window and be absorbed into the stone floor .
The floor is warm during the day but cools in the evening as the heat from the floor rises up and warms the house during the evening . 
variousa sustainableprovidingThe world in thebegin with , there are many possibilities for alternative energy resources .
Natural movements such as tide , wind and wave can all be used for genvariousg power .
THowever , thesolar technology , which converthumans radiant light from the Sun into heat , can also be applied to many industries .
Nuclear power iore widely acceptedpricesused as an insufficientational energy agency reports that 2 .1% of energy and 15% of electricity are provided worldwide by nuclear power in the year 2005 (Key World Energy Statistics , 2007) .
It shows that nuclear power may gradually replace traditional oil and petroleum .
Furthermore , non-traditional renewable energy such as hydrogen fuel and biodiesel are studied by engineeringare designingrchers and they may be put into practice for real industries somed

Technologies are always developed to cater to certain needs of people , whether to provide better methods of doing things or to develop tools that facilitate working and living .
Technologies are also consistently refined to meet changing needs of customers .
This also applies to virtual technology , which was developed within a specific social and technological background and was evolved to meet increasing needs in a changing environment .
Virtual technology was first developed to address the need for extensive communications .
By the 20th century , with the development of modern technology , communications had been made more and more convenient .
Theexcitement brought by modern technologies  boomed the demand for more extensive interactions , not only with friends but also with strangers .
At the same time , new technologies  also raised the issue of privacy .
Thus , it was not surprising to observe an increasing need for a convenient and cost effective platform where a large group of people are able to communicate , transcending geographic barriers , while retaining a certain level of independence and privacy at the same time .
To address such increasing social needs , the concept of a virtual world was  .
Virtual technology was first designed with a series of unique properties to address the observed social needs by engaging a large user population .
A multi-user online environment was created , allowing a large group of people to get connected at the same time .
This  made interactions among a great number of users  possible .
The user-friendly operation platform designed  made the virtual world more accepted by the public and the simplified operation process  also made virtual technology more adaptable to IT laymen .
In addition , with the establishment of facilities and the popularization of computers , virtual technology became more and more accessible and  engaged increasing numbers of people .
The low cost of virtual technology , as compared with that of other types of communications such as the telephone ,  also attracted numerous users .
However , asthe social environment changes , the initial virtual technology developed has become insufficient to meet increased social needs .
Virtual technology has hence been refined to meet the evolving needs .
Factors such as the business environment , changing educational styles and new military demands have shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions making use of virtual technology have been designed designed to address each specific need .
The development of virtual technology has been largely influenced by the world's booming economies since the start of the 21st century .
New technologies have made people realize the underlying economic opportunities beyond geographic barriers and national boundaries .
People have been looking for more convenient and cost effective methods for transactions and business cooperation .
Catering to this need , a series of solutions have been developed based on virtual technology .
One of them is e-commerce websites where  virtual interfaces enable convenient and efficient transactions of goods and services .
Another example is E-conferencing which allows a staff to attend  conferences even while away on business trips and which has made business processes much more efficient .
Virtual technology has also been developed to meet educational needs .
This especially applies to places where educational resources are limited due to geographic barriers .
E-learning has provided an alternative way to attend lessons conducted by teachers in classrooms .
It has not only made education in such areas possible but also made education more cost effective .
In addition , E-learning has developed a new style of education where self-initiated learning is advocated .
Another example of virtual technology being developed to meet educational needs is business simulation games where the real business environment is simulated and students can learn from  .
Such business simulation games have been largely used as innovative learning tools in world's business all over the world .
Apart from the demands from business and education , other factors have also shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions have been designed to meet these needs .
An example is  virtual training devices used by the U .S . army  .
To sum up , virtual technology , like other types of technologies , was  socially and which has evolved to meet the changing needs of the society .
Thus , the development of virtual technology has been shaped by social factors such as the business environment , educational needs and military demands .
This is because technologies are meant to serve people .
Hence , only those innovations and technologies that solve social problems and cater to social needs are considered to be meaningful .
The sustainable development of China's economy largely depends on the progress of science and technology .
Meanwhile , the level of development of science and technology is an important symbol  of a country's strength .
"Innovation" is a popular word around the world these days , and there are myriad of facts to show the importance of scientific and technical innovation .
However , problems inevitably generate and affect the process of innovation due to  improper strategies or methods .
, there are two major problems in China .
One is that some engineering designs do not meet the needs of the the market .
In other words , these designs are produced without adequate market survey , so they turn out to be unwelcomed bythe public .
Though the designs are products of fantastic conception , they become useless as rubbish once booted out of the market .
After China adopted the policy of reform and opening-up , the Chinese government has long been encouraging people to make varieties of innovations .
Nevertheless , it does not mean that whatever design can be turned into a product .
The key is still the needs of market .
In addition , among all applicants of patents ,  .
An individual has an obvious disadvantage compared with teamwork , and that is to say an individual cannot handle everything well at the same time .
Without market survey and access to  , it is inadvisable to make designs blindly by divorcing oneself from reality .
No amount of such designs would be meaningful .
The second problem to hampers engineering design processes  is the patent policy .
China has long been a great country of patents , but the commercial success of these patents is quite rare .
The basic reason is many patents do not have the preconditions to commercialize themselves .
Most Chinese patents are "Appearance Patents" , not "Innovation Patents" .
Appearance patents are a rather tough issue and among the patent infringement cases in China , more than 90% belong to this kind .
appearance patent applications do not need to be censored .
As long as the application documents meet the required format , the patent will be approved .
The rapid applications for patents have caused large numbers of patent infringement cases .
Statistics show that , "just in 2005 , China's public security organs at various levels arrested more than 45 thousand suspects for IP infringement and people's courts at various levels accepted 3567 criminal cases at the first instance ."
Now the disputes of patents have been the most serious trouble in the  development of some companies . 
Conditions in developed countries may be different .
For example , in America , all patents must be censored so the cases of patent infringement are fewer than China .
Normally patent infringement lawsuits can be settled out of court due to the high cost and complicated procedureswhile in China , with the simple procedures and low cost , patent infringement lawsuits have even become a tool to make unfair competition between companies .
The Chinese government is now paying attention to reforming the patent law and the new law will be put into practice in October .
In conclusion , China is sparing no efforts to solve problems in order to make innovations real intellectual products .
The principles are establishing a perfect patent system based on the market need .
The emphasis should be put on the propaganda of intellectual rights protection , so that people can understand its importance and learn to protect their rights .
Every country will encounter problems in its development .
As a developing country , China is now facing problems in many fields .
This essay discusses two problems which significantly hamper engineering design processes of innovations in China .
The two problems are the situation of education and public policy on industry .
The problems bring some effect on engineering design in two aspects , independent innovation and engineering application .
First , the situation of education in China is a problem for innovation .
It is accepted that Chinese students are good at science .
They have a solid foundation for math and physicsand they can solve complex and difficult problems in short time .
However , these are just results of long-term training .
China's education is a typical exam-oriented education .
Now , this situation has become a problem for the nation because the present generation lacks creativity and innovation  .
In China's education system , students are only required to receive knowledge and repeat exercising to consolidate their knowledge but they neglect to explore the knowledge further .
Chinese students are taught to remember many formulas and  rather than ask questions .
Under this mode of education for a long time , people's thinking is limited and rigid .
The president of the Chinese University of Science and Technology pointed that students' lack of innovation would become the bottleneck of development of China in the future ) .
In addition , there are still many inadequacies in the policies of science and industry .
In China , economic policies are very wide but policies on developing the scientific industry are strict .
For example , the investment and concerns that the nation puts on technology research and engineering are deficient (Xin , 2005) .
which needsmany support to  .
However , the policy of engineering and industry cannot meet these needs .
The state only put investment in specialized research institutes .
In the actual production and application of new inventions , the support from the government is not nearly enough .
These two problems would bring some effects of engineering design and innovation in China .
First , because of the mode of education , most engineers and scientists are relatively weak in creativity .
This directly affects the process on innovative engineering design especially on  .
In the technological age , since independent innovation is very important to a nation's development , the society needs  people with innovative talent .
Engineers need to generate multiple solutions based on different conditions instead of merely learning from other countries' research and findings .
If engineers do not come up with new ideas , they cannot find the best solution for the problems .
Moreover , the policy on science and engineering also affects the process of engineering application .
Due to insufficient investment in research and engineering practice , engineers cannot use the most advanced equipment to do analysis and testing .
Many theories cannot be put into implement .
As a result , the field of engineering design is slow in progress and there are still a lot of complex problems left unsolved .
In conclusion , the structure of China's education and China's policies on engineering and industry are two significant problems which hamper innovative engineering design processes in China .
If engineers are in defect of creativity and innovation , it would be difficult for them to  and make improvements .
At the same time , without enough support , development of engineering design would proceed slowly .
The first problem that hampers design and innovation in China is China's low-end industrial structure .
China industry is mostly at the lower end of the world production chain , which means the production in China is energy- consuming , labour-by a lot of people and countries to prosperChina devotes a lot of resources into production , the added value for innovation is low .
For example , a factory inthe innovational processduces toys for a Japanese company and these ta particular stageto North America .
Out of 10 dollars made , this factory only have 1 dollar , while the Japanese company gets 9 .
The reason why this factory gets so little is that the design belongs to that Japanese company .
What this factory does is simply producing the toys .
In reality , there are thousands of such factories in China , which reflects the situation of China's low-end industrial structure .
As a consequence of China's low-end production which gains profit from mass production and resource consumption , China companies mainly focus on lowering cost , rather than creating innovative ideas .
Therefore , very little money is devoted to design process for innovation and these companies only repeat this low-end production circle .
In addition to China's low-end industrial structure , the bad situation of intellectual property protectChina'sldesign and innovation industryrs engineering innovational process .
In China intellectual propermeans thatgproduction-protected .
Penergy-consumingrate version of software in veryst cities .
There are some prdevotes a lot of resources to productionoreign companies .
Due to certain reasons , this situation is not expected to improve a lot in the near future .
Since the right of inventors and innovators is not well-protected , people are unwfactory only hasnew products .
Therefore , innovation is discouraged by lack of protection for intellectual property in society .
To sum uthehina's low-end industrial structure and bad situation of intellectual property protection are the two major problems that hamper engineering designa .
Low-end production pattern makes companies focus on cuttitst , rather than making innovation , while lack of protection for innovation makes peopleChineselling to generate new ideas .
When China tries to promote engineering design process for innovations , these are the two problthe design processld tackle .
On September 4th , 2009 , a piece of startling news  quickly spread  all over the world .
After several years' effort , magnetic monopoles were detected by  researchers from the Helmholtz- Zentrum Berlin fur Materialien und Energie  , in cooperation with colleagues from Dresden , St . Andrews , La Plata and Oxford (Magnetic Monopoles Detected In A Real Magnet For The First Time , 2009) .
Obviously , the discovery of magnetic monopole indicated a great progress in the field of physics .
People may think about what led to the success of the discovery of magnetic monopoles .
Generally speaking , the development of technologies is always viewed as technologically determined or socially determined .
In this case , the discovery of magnetic monopoles was most likely to have been promoted by advanced technologies .
However , social determinism , which can be defined as technology being boosted by social factors , is also an important factor in the development of technologies .
To specify , social determinism can be further categorized into several distinguished factors , such as economic  , military  , and government  .
Nowadays , it is common to see a person carry a laptop everywhere , which was unimaginable thirty years ago .
The appearance of the laptop was due to  demands from workers in companies .
In the old days , there was no laptop ,  only desktop that workers had to share  to do their  work , causing great inconvenience .
In order to solve this problem , a person called Mizoguchi in Toshiba Company came up with the idea of inventing the laptop (Rogers , 2003) .
With the help of engineers , he finally invented the laptop that we currently use , and undoubtedly , his achievement made a great success in computer marketing .
Until now , the laptop is still a necessary tool in people's daily life .
One of the reasons for its success was that laptop greatly catered to people's needs .
Thus , after briefly viewing the development of the laptop , we can conclude that the appearance of this marvelous invention was initially driven by the demands of the people , and then its development was supported by technologies .
For many years , people have always been trying to come up  technological innovations which are environmentally beneficial .
Thus , , electric cars were invented .
Instead of using gasoline , electric cars used only battery power , which no longer caused air pollution and reduced the cost as well (Rogers , 2003) .
However , because electric cars could not travel far distances , and it was not convenient to get theirbatteries charged , electric cars finally lost out in the market , due to its restriction of usefulness .
Nevertheless , electric cars are still regarded as a great trial innovation which needs further technology support to make improvement .
From the examples  above , we can conclude that generally , the development of technology is determined by both technological factors as well as social factors .
More precisely , the appearance of  innovation is initially motivated by socialdeterminism , and then it needs technological support in the process of development .
Last but least , any technology must be designed well using advanced technology skills , otherwise it will most likely  lose out in the market .
advantagecould alsoFirstly , using solar cars could effectively reduce the emission of greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide .
It is stated that a significant parf of carbon dioxide emissio due to burning of fossil fuels , such as gasoline and natural gases .
(What is the best possible solution to stop global warming ? , para .

In this way , people no longer have to worry about the exhapartof gasoline resources .
Besides , using solar energy actually cost nothing , which ensures that solar cars could be affordable in the long run .
However , solar cars are still not popular in the market due to the high cost of production and low feasibility .
Thus , popularizing solarrs requires lowering the price and enlarging the capacity of solar bacostsy .
Actually , it is not easy to lower the price of solar cars since currently the materials used to make solar cars are high-tech aero-materials which are quite expensive .
Therefore , in order to lower the cost of production of solar cars , development of new materials is crucial .
Besides , the current development of solar battery is not good enough to afford long-distance driving .
Though newly developed solar battery can support hundreds of miles , it requires a rather critical weather extremely sunny days .
miles of drivinga newlytheirIn conclusion , replacing traditional cars by solar cars can effively control the deterioration of global warming , but further improvements are needed to widely popularize the use of solar cars .
"Air pollution is responsible for 310 ,000 premature deaths in Europe each year" ("Air pollution causes early death ," 2005) .
Many people may not think much about air pollution because they can hardly feel the effects of it .
However , results have proven otherwise .
This is the reason why better air quality is a human need that should be given priority .
Air pollution is the main reason why the world is suffering from bad air quality thus we should look at ways to cut down  air pollutant emission .
There are some current solutions available such as primary regulations , control devicesand increased fuel efficiency .
However , air pollution still persists .
Hence , we should look at other alternatives like engineering design processes that might provide a solution .
Engineering design processes such as improving battery technology for automobiles , and designing better control devices are possible solutions .
Air pollution has led to health issues like respiratory diseases and premature deaths .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (2008) , "on average , each of us breathes over 3 ,000 gallons of air each day ."
This means if the air is polluted , everyone will be affected .
These air pollutants are transmitted through air thus the toxic air pollutants produced from one country would affect its neighbouring countries as well .
Health issues caused by air pollution not only affect the individual but also  the world economy because those who are affected will not be able to work .
In order to solve the problem of air pollution , we got to improve  the current battery technology and come up with better control devices .
Improving  the current battery technology is one of the engineering design process that can solve air pollution .
A recent report from Toronto Public Health (2007) states that related air pollution contributes to about 440 premature deaths and 1 ,700 hospitalizations per year in Toronto ."
Most of these traffic emissions are produced from the combustion engine of gasoline vehicles .
However , gasoline vehicles are still higher in demand as compared to non-gas emission vehicles , electric vehiclesbecause of the short lifespan of the battery its relatively more costly price .
According to Environmed Research (2009) , "Batteries are heavy , wear out quickly with repeated recharging and require expensive , rather scarce materials such as lithium ."
By improving  battery technology to meet these shortcomings , the world may be willing to switch to electric cars , the more environmental-friendly choice .
Besides improving  the current battery technology , designing better control devices will be another engineering solution to industrial purposes .
Emissions from power plants contribute to over 2 ,800 lung cancer deaths and 38 ,200 heart attacks annually in the US ("Deadly power plants ? ," 2004) .
Air pollutants from industrial sources made up to more than half of man-made emissions .
Some of the current control devices available are scrubbers and nitrogen oxide control devices .
For scrubbers , there are external and system parameters that affect  efficiency .
Thus , they cannot maximise their capabilities .
As for nitrogen oxide control devices , the cost of effective devices like the Selective Catalytic Reduction is extremely high .
However , coming up with scrubbers and nitrogen oxide control devices that are more costly but control efficient will definitely reduce a significant amount of pollutant emission .
In conclusion , even though there are many available solutionsto air pollution  , the world is still suffering from bad air quality leading to many health issues .
Engineering design processes are able to provide the world with effective solutions like better battery technology and control devices that will improve the air quality of the world .
With the air quality improved , the world will be able to lead a clean and healthier life .
In the article , "The Generation of Innovations" , , Rogers (2003) stressed that the engineering design process for innovation includes "problem recognition , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and consequences (p . ?)" .
For my home country , China , although its design process for innovation has  improved a lot , there still remain several factors which hamper significantly the innovation process  .
Based on this idea , this essay will focus on two factors and explain their corresponding effects on certain design stages .
The first factor is the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises .
According to "Wikipedia" (2009 , para .1) , a state-owned enterprise is defined as "a legal entity created by a government to undertake commercial activities on behalf of an owner government , and are usually considered to be an element or part of the state" .
Since the major interest of a state-owned enterprise is controlled by government , a state-owned enterprise can receive long-term economic and resource support from government .
Employees of state-owned enterprises don't have to worry financial matters and  .
In addition , the line between the functions of the government and enterprises is not clear .
Due to  political interference in stated-owned enterprises , state-owned enterprises and other type of enterprises do not compete against each other on an equal basis .
With regard to the first factor above , there emerge two impacts .
Firstly , the directors and managers of the state-owned enterprises exploit their position and power in the company to advance their own private interests .
The phenomenon of corruption is very common as well .
Thus , the money which goes into operation is largely reduced .
Furthermore , the motivation for most employees working in state-owned enterprises is to pursue  impressive salaries and excellent welfare .
As a consequence , most  managers and employees have no sense of professional dedication and responsibility .
They are lazy and not interested in discovery .
Even if employees encounter some good ideas by chance , they may not want to put some effort into doing research and converting the ideas into production .
Thus , the above two impacts will affect the design stage , especially  stage  .
State-owned enterprises which play important roles in controlling and leading other types of enterprises in China  will hamper China's design process for innovation  .
Apart from the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises , economic shortage among China's private companies also hamper the innovation process .
Unlike state-owned enterprises , private companies have no steady economic support .
They have to prepare for competition and the possibilities of bankcruptcy .
Most of the private companies may also lack funding , equipment and materials for operation and production .
With regard to the second factor , another two impacts should be considered as well .
One is  undesirable production .
According to Rogers (2003) , technology requires software and hardware components .
Since most high quality and accurate equipment is very expensive , some private companies can not afford it .
Poor equipment in private companies may lead to large uncertainty in the design stage .
This could further lead to undesirable production .
In addition , due to  economic shortage , private companies may not be able to hire people with high-educated knowledge and rich experience .
Hence , the design stage , machining stage and commercialization will be affected .
In short , there are many factors that may hamper China's design process for innovation .
Loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises and the economic shortage of private companies are the two main causes .
If these two factors  are improved , the whole design process for innovation in China will be enhanced significantly .
It is widely believed that there is no  strong connection between technology innovation and examinations  based on MCQs .
However , there still is .
Some technologies can be created via scientific research whereas some are accidentally developed .
Comparing two typical examples of innovation  , penicillin and vaccine  , we  see some similarities as well as differences in  three main areas: progress of research , financial inputs and overall impact .
First of all , the way each technology was invented was different .
With the discovery of penicillin ,  the technology was a huge serendipitous observation .
Alexander Fleming , the Scottish scientist and Nobel laureate , was "puzzled by the fact that the biological materials he was studying in petri dishes were occasionally dying unexpectedly .
Upon investigation , the cause turned out to be the first antibiotic to be discovered ,  It has been rightly said that: His failure in doing his initial research as he intended brought him to a new discovery for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize .
By contrast , the discovery of vaccine involved a kind of technology based on a sequence of basic research , followed by applied research , leading to the the development of the vaccine By this way , all the processes were often set up from the beginning , though sometimes mistakes were found  .
Many people are strongly convicted that conventional research is often more costly than a serendipitous one However , in some cases the opposite applied when an unexpected observationobservation in requires financial support that of a scientific one .
The reason for this seemingly-contradictory surprise is that  .
The total costs for an accidental one , therefore , can still be enormous .
For instance , the discovery of penicillin still cost as much  as the discovery of vaccine .
In short , it can be concluded  that  kind of research , whether conventional or serendipity , does say nothing about how much  financial support  it requires .
Of course , it would be a mistake without mention the importance of these two kinds of research in our society .
Both vaccine and penicillin can be considered a huge success because  provide better preparation for diseases .
However , their impact on the whole society is still different in that:

ThetoprocessesTo sum up , there are two main problems that wprocessesecognized as the factors that hamper eneering design process , namely low technological standards and not highly valued proprietary intellectual property .
In orInventorsve engineering dproductsrocess ancrease pethemnnovation , China needs to solve these main problems .
Like many other technologies , nuclear technology first came into use to meet military demands .
Since nuclear weapons are of mass destructiobut , inifact ,kers of countries all over the world prohibit research of nuclear technology's application in military aspect and a non-proliferation treaty has been open for signature since 1968 (International Atomic Energy Agency , 1970) .
However , this act also hinders the investigation of nuclear technology since it restricts the enrichment of uranium .
American president Obama once said that highly enriched uranium around the world worried him most (Lafayette , 2008) .
Due to nuclear technology's special application in military aspect and the complex international situation , it may be difficult for some countries to master nuclear technology and this characteristic is described as proliferation resistance (International Atomic Energy Agency , 2004) .
Other than this international regulation , environmental concern is also an important ddemands .
However , sincetor in shaping nuclear technological innovations .
Before applying this powerful technology for energy or military use , safety matters must be taken into consideration .
Nuclear radiation has shown its horrifying destructive power in Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions .
The nothThisbyl aent which caused 30 immediate deaths and affected an area of a 30 kilometer radius also reminds us of nuclear technology's potential for causing disasters from time to time (World nuclear association , 2009) .
HencThus , duethe environmental factor also contributes to the difficulties in nuclear technology's popularization and a lot of conventions regarding safety matters in nuclear technology resulting inlication have been ratified after the accident .

contributeenvironmental factorsAssessment of costs and benefits is necessary for all technology applications .
Since the uranium reserves are difficult to find with presinnovationogies , the cost of applying this technology as energy source is relatively high compared with gasoline and natural gas (Du & Parsons , 2009) .
Besides , it also costs large amount of money to deal with spent fuel and radioactive waste .
According to a summary on energy solutions , designing , building of a nuclwithinr p30-kilometereaning up the plant after its operating license expires" will total as much as 2S dollars( Maryland pirg , n .d . , para 3) .

Nuclear technology's spethrough function in military usage makes internatiouraniumcooperation in this technology extremely difficult; the radioactive character of this technology causes a lot of environmental issuea large amountst in some applications is still high .
However , with increasing industrial demands , oil reserves are at depressed levels; so it's highly likely that we will have to seek solution in nuclear technology in the near future .

Gathering wherenent information is a crucial stage in engineering design processes , however , being nresources quite often .
As stated by Khandani (2005) , collecting enough information before finding  .

Designing a new industrial system or product which works more efficient with less energy consumption is a complicthem is theess thus needs sufficient analysis on information .
Only by doing this we can make it clear that what umnd whether a proposal is applicable .

Usually , a kind of paint is used to retain the heat indoors .
However , this kind of paint will soon loselectingts in areas where acid rain is common .
Thus , without noticing this important information , the project will be definitely a failure .

Firs and foremost , r code emerged and developed as the timeitsequiredt demand of retailers to increcodesefUsing barcodes athoseeration predicted the emergence of bar code .
According to Seideman (n .d .) , as early as in 1890 people realised their need and invented punch cards which played partial role of bar code .
However , the first application area of bar code was not supermarket or the bar codebut railroads .
Unfortunately , the implementation of bar code in railroad industry failed because it did not fit the industry perfectly and its fthe bar code were not completely utilized .
On the other hand , retailers then were just in need of a system like bar code .
In 1966 , a grocery industry meeting regarding implementation of bar code was held by RCA (Seideman , n .d .) .
It was then that this technology began to flourish .
Today the demands of users are still shaping bar code , expanding it to more application fields like libraries and post industry .
postaland thethe bar codeToday , Firsther factor thatthe bar code bar code's development is the economic concerns .
As bar code is designed to store information of the products , all products have to be itselled .

So economy cost became a big concern .
Due to this reason , bar code walikemthe bar coded as soon as it was invented .
The concernthe bar code the techthe supermarketard , and eventually came the bar code we use nowadays .
Having sethe bar codee ecthe railroadoncerns of users , bar code wins users' heart quickly .
Since its first read in 1974 , bar code has been adopted for 35 years (Shih , 20the bar code The economic factors have been shaping bar the bar code making it survive even facing the great competitor RFID (Shih , 2009) .
In addition to the demands athe bareconomic concerns , the e range of users helps the barimprove bar code .

It is clear that glcodesization is ineconomice which means bar code has to adjust itself to mthe bar codealization .

Bar code thus been standardised since 1970s and it is being improved accordingly (Seideman , n .d .) .

Because of users' demands , financial capabithe bar codeusers and widethe bar codef users , bar code is shaped to an innovation which is globally recognized and essential to the world .
The shortage of natural resources means that all raw materials required for engineering design process for innovations would have to come from imports .
This by itself poses problems such as greater costs incurred for innovations , shipment fees , as well as a delay the design process .
The higher cost makes it expensive for engineering designing processes .
Hence groups that do not have funding or sufficient funding will be held back .
This is because the designing process usually involves a lot of trial and error , using various materials for different parts of the innovation , in order to optimize the best working conditions for the item of innovation .
The delay in shipment of raw materials causes a lapse of time before the materials can reach Singapore .
This results in a delay of the testing of the engineering design which slows down the whole engineering design process .
Professor Seah (2009) mentioned that for Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) their first formula race car took 2 years instead of 1 to be produced , partly because of a lack of raw materials and funding .
The long shipping time and greater cost due to importing of raw materials delayed the engineering design process as they only had a plan of the race car but no chance to physically fabricate the parts and build the car , while the raw materials were still on their way to Singapore Another problem which could greatly affect the engineering process for designing is a lack of funding .
The designing process requires a large amount of raw materials for repeated fabrications of each part with different materials in order to obtain the most suitable material to optimize the function of the product of innovation .
Even for the same kind of material , it might have to be used several times as the part fabricated is not necessarily always in the expected condition when it is first made , resulting in a wastage and hence greater consumption of raw materials and therefore a greater cost incurred in the designing process .
Without funding , this step of designing would be impossible especially if the raw materials are required in large quantities .
Innovations which require expensive raw materials will be impossible to proceed if there is insufficient funding .
One innovation which went on very well in Singapore as a result of funding is the desalination of sea water .
Water supply has always been a key issue for consideration by the Singapore government .
Singapore has been very reliant on neighboring countries such as Malaysia in supplying us with water .
This dependence on neighboring countries for water creates a need for Singapore to become more self-reliant  Hence when the idea of water desalination first came out , it was greatly funded by Singapore government for further improvements in Singapore .
Water-technology .net claims that Tuas desalination  water at 110000 cubic meters , enough to meet 10% of Singapore's daily water needs( 110 ,000m3/day , n .d .) .
Therefore , availability of funding plays a great role in affecting the engineering process of designing .
With funding , there can be further research and development into improving the innovation even after it is created .
In conclusion , the engineering process for designing for innovations is greatly dependent on the availability of raw materials and funding .
The delay or shortage in either of them will lead to a lapse or even stoppage of the designing process .
Innovations may be affected either by social determinism or technology determinism .
The UK Technology Education Centre states that "Social determinism refers to the hypothesis that social interactions and constructs alone determine individual behaviour (as opposed to biological or objective factors .
Nationmasters .com states "technology determinism is a theory which points to technology as being the force which shapes society ."
Social determinisms affect demand for products and thus the revenue and profit .
affected by social determinists .
Its success is determined mainly by three factors:  perception of the product , economic factors and social factors .
The most important factor that has contributed to Toshiba's success is changes in company's perceptions towards the product .
Before the laptop was invented , the company was only selling desktop computers .
At that time , business of the company's computers was poor and hence the investors were not willing to invest time and labour into the project .
However , the inventor , Mizoguchi , was not disheartened and worked in the dark .
After the first laptop was  produced , corporate executives were still against the idea of selling it .
Fortunately , Mizoguchi's product caught the eyes of the senior vice president of Toshiba Europe and thus he offered to sell ten thousand laptops in a year .
Even though the project took an extra two months , it helped to increase the market share of Toshiba .
This example shows that  change in perception leads to different outcomes If there had been no changes in views of investors , Toshiba laptops would not have existed in the current market .
Besides the company's perceptions , economic  also play an important role .
Resources and funding are required in an innovation to help improve it .
One is not able to come out with successful innovations by dreaming of their achievements .
Coming out with new products requires support .
For Toshiba , the profits earned from the sales of the laptops were further invested to improve the quality of the later-produced laptops .
If a product has no financial support , it will not be successful as it not able to keep up with the challenges of the newly developed technology .
The most important factor that contributes to any innovation is the response of the public .
Consumers are important groups of people who will determine the success of the product .
At that time , the offices were cramped and there was no space available for workers to place their desktops .
The newly invented laptops were able to overcome these problems because of their small size and the ability to be carried around conveniently .
This convenience  efficiency of workers as they  now able to work from anywhere in their offices besides their desk area .
As mentioned in the Rogers (2003) article , "By 1988 , Toshiba commanded a 38 percent market share for laptops in Europe and 21 percent in the United States; a year later , it commanded 46 percent market share in Japan , despite the quick reactions of its competitors ."
More technology savvy people  for  and thus the company constantly innovated and improved in order to bring the invention to greater heights .
The Toshiba laptop was successful because of economiceconomic and social factors and the change in the company's perceptions of the product .
It is not possible to succeed with only one factor .
Therefore Toshiba needs to consider all factors during their innovations .
The first difference is the purpose and the process of the research .
Usually , the normal research is due to a certain need in life and wantwereo make some discovery to meet the need .
All the process in the research is to serve the purposerast , there is always no specific need for the serenitous discovery and the research which makes the discovery is usually for other purpose , and the serendipitous discovery is usually due to unexpected result of a normal the A good example is the discovery of Post-it notes .
3M Company wanted to find a kind of super glue but unexpectedly they found this kind of glue that was not strong but could be used several times .
But this unexpected result led to the successful product of a new kind of notes which is now well knownPost-it .
(Rogers , 2003)
The other difference between a normal discovery and a serendipitous oot a big pprocessesbecause the discoarery is for serving a specific purpose .
So the usage of the discovery is quite clear .
But for serendipitous discovery , as the discovery is unexpected nobody will know purposesential use of it after the discovery is made .
Even there is a possibility that nobody will notice it .
So it is much harder to turn it into use .
But fortunately , we got very smart and careful people who weree to find them and find a way to use them .
For example , during World War I , a tish scientist called Brearly wanted to inventproduction of strong material which could be mathe wellnknown Post-it guns .
But he only invented a kind of material which was bright luster than other materials but not strong enough .
He was disappointed .
But later he thought why not made this beautiful material into dinner set ?
Finally , it turned out to be a great success .
(Accidental Inventions , 2008)
a makewas notbrighterhadAlthough there are differences between the two types of discoveries , there is also some similarities between them .
For example , they both are discovered in research , they have to be developed to a certain degree before comto serveion , and finally they have to be turned into products and so on .
(Rogers , 2003) In conclusion , there are two main differe ,al discovery and serendipitous discovery , one is the purpose andThere is even the possibility that nobody will notice it .ss to turn the discoveries into utoBesides , there are also similarities between them .
Anyhow , both of them have made a great contribution to the human society and hope there will be more discoveries being made , no matter which type they are .
Singapore currently has a land space 683 square kilometers , a couisely visible on the map .
A strategy adopted by the government to solve this problem is land reclamation , which currently accounts for about 10% of its land space .
To further maximize lanincreaseSingapore's structures are mainly skyscrapers with strong and often costly foundations .
This issue particularly affects innovations that are on the larger scale , as large cost will be incurred in the construction oats foundations .
This increase in cost will hence hinder the market value and affect the economic analysis stage of the design process .
Take for example the housing in Singapore , which comprises mainly of Housing Development Board [HDB] flats .
In view of the collapse of Nicoll highway back in April 2004 , HDB has put up very strict requirements on the piling process and the materials used , like grade 30 concrete should be used in piling .
Similarly , the steel structure that forms the backbone of the buildings , require a minimum of 3mm steel gauge at least .
All these may drive up cost and hence affect the design process .
Aside from the problem of the lack of land space , there is also the consideration of its extremely dense population .
Contradictory to its limited land area as discussed earlier , it houses more than 4 million people .
During the peak hours , crowded trains and bus stations will be hard to miss .
New innovations thus have to consider its design rather seriously given the circumstances .
All these will seriously afat the functionality analcosts stage of the design process , as more timtheirnd consideration will have to be channeled into this portion .
One example of a properly located and well-designed amenity would be the Mass Rail transit [MRT] stations .
Some stations are made connect to shopping malls while others to bus interchanges , thereby making transport in Singapore relatively convenient .
In addition to that , some offorhese stations like City Hall and Dhoby Ghaut station , not only play the role of an important hub in Singapore's transport system , but also an internal shopping centr within itself .
City- link , which is d to city hall station , is an underground network of shops that link itself to other larger shopping facilities .
Such an example shows how proper planning of the amenities lead to the success of the application .
is linkedTransitIn conclusion , being a small country , Singapore has several issues that may affect the design process of future innovContrarycularly its limited land space and its extremely dense population .
Certain examples like the MRT and the HDB flats are evidence that even with limited resources , Sapore can still flourish .
With proper design and careful planning , perhaps these limitations would be a thing of the past .
In most people's opinion technology can oexplosivesoped or created via research .
Such as the invention of new explosive , in order to find new explosive Nobel spent nearly all his time doing experiments in his library .
But there are still some technology is invented from a serendipitous discovery .
Such as guncotton , it is invented by Schoenbein by chance .
Difference between these two inventions is the ideas about how to invent them coConsidering .
As explosivesow Nobel is a very hardexplosivesn ,Nobelve man .

His father dead right after his younger brother (Nils .
R , N .d) .
But he never gave up and risked his life to go on his invention and his ideas came from his effort .
The story about how Schoenbein invented guncotton was quite an interesting story .
According to Yang(2007) , " when Schoenbein is doing experiments he overthrew a bottle of chemical solution , and the solution flowed on the table Schoenbein found nothing but his wife's apron to clean the table .
After he finished cleaning he thought that his wife will blame him after she saw what he had done .
So he wanted to use the stove to dry the apron .
When he walked near the stove the apron burned without any smoke and ashes left .
Then he felt very happy because he realized that he had found a new kind of explosive ."
Nobel can invent the explosive successfully because of his diligence and the attitude towards science which made him never give up .
Schoenbein came up with his idea accidentally and finally made an great invention for the word .

First of all they are both invented by prsts .

From the story of how Schoenbein came up with the idea abodiedhe guncotton we can tell that he is really a lucky scientist .
But without the prudential attitude towards science he may miss his good luck and did not go on finding how can this phenomenon occur .

The 'Made in China' phenomenon has signaled China's endeavor to catch up with the advanced western countries .
However , the unprecedentedly rapid economic growth , driven by manufacturing and export industry , probably prevents people from discovering the problems that may impede engineering design process for innovation .
Two of these problems involve the special political environment and the Chinese people's mindset , which already have negative influence on several stages of engineering design process for innovation in China .
First of all , the special political environment many account for the stalling of some stages of the whole process , such as the stage of recognizing a need or problem and the stage of innovation-development .
On one hand , many old-style leaders have long been so satisfied with the annual double-digit economic growth that they tend to refuse to seek innovative factors to boost the economy .
In fact , if we date back to the earliest related term in the party's document , as it turns out , "it is not until October 2000 and the Fifth Session of the Fifteenth Party Congress that the 'cultural industries' were formally proposed as part of the recommendations document for the national Tenth Five-Year Plan" (Zhang Xiaoming , Hu Hulin and Zhang Jiangang , 2004 , as cited in Keane , 2007 , p .81) .
On the other hand , for a system so guided by the central planning , having such decision makers means that it probably will have difficulty recognizing a need or a problem .
Consequently , research and development (R&D) activities are not likely to be stimulated instantaneously .
Even though R&D activities are somehow initiated successfully , the nature of central planning which calls for "information to be moved up and down the hierarchy" (Chan , 2009) may throw obstacles in the information-exchange process , which is significant to the innovation-development process .
Additionally , as Keane (2007) cited in his book 'Created in China' , "socialism overplayed the role of productive forces and failed to develop the innovative potential of human capital" .
For instance , Gage (2006) showed that in a case study published by the Washington Policy Centre , a non-partisan think tank , health facilities were required to get permission from the State Health Agency to build and extend their health care facilities .
As  unveiled in the research report , it somehow took longer for the health facilities to obtain approval from the State Health Agency than to actually build or extend the needed facilities .
In truth , the hospital would not be allowed to renovate unless it discarded ten beds  As a result , the central planning actually created monopolies in this case , and the communication between manufacturing and supplier broke down due to such central planning interference .
Thus , the demands of consumers and the free market could not be met .
Another problem refers to Chinese people's mindset .
As Michael Keane (2007) has noted , the common assumption existing long among the Chinese was that productivity directly equals  material production .
"In other word , a focus on production and performance indicators in China had impacted negatively on innovation" .
Therefore , even today in China , it is still reasonable to argue that the process for innovation may not be well understood , which means , in the respective of knowledge degree of technology transfer , the innovation-development does not seem capable to function well .
Moreover , according to what E . M . Rogers (2003) stated in 'The Generation of Innovation' , in the face of high degree of uncertainty , these social factors in innovation-development process determine what technology is actually available to the consumers .
To sum up , we are all witnessing the state's transformation from 'Made in China' to 'Created in China' .
In the current stage , political environment and people's mindset are two of the problems that may hamper engineering design process for innovation .
Furthermore , these problems already have impact on several stages of the process .
While can be classified as a kind of special glue , the history of post-it notes and super glue seems rather different .
post-it notes  resulted from a serendipitous discovery , while the super glue was developed gradually via standard research process . 
Rogers' first stage is needs or problems , which indicates the initial target or request of the whole research and development process .
It is quite interesting that the initial researching target of the two products is the same: to create a more powerful and adhesive glue .
However , it turned out later that the serendipitous discovery actually had no real target in this stage , because the real use of post-it note seems totally different from what  was expected at the beginning .
The next stage of researchwas to use the scientific method to fulfill the previous target .
So we can find that the super glue's inventor successfully found what he needed while the post-it notes' inventor created a strange glue that is low adhesive but re-adherable .
In this stage , the difference between the two kinds of discoveries turned to be that the serendipitous discovery's inventor could not meet his initial needs like the normal inventor but accidently create a totally different product instead .
The third and fourth stages , development and commercialization , are to meet the needs of the consumers and try to improve the products .
from the third stage onward , the post-it notes and the super glue finally shared the similarity .
One was low adhesive but re-adherable so itwas used to make notes that can be attached to documents and other surfaces freely .
The other one was high adhesive and functioned quickly so itcould be used to glue many materials quickly with great strength .
The inventors both found their usages and successfully made them more practical  So it is not  surprising that the two products both become very popular among the consumers as soon as they come out .
What is technology ?
According to Roger (2003) , technology is a design for instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome .
In the context of innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view .
Technological determinism means the belief of a technology causes changes in society (Rogers , 2003) , while social determinism argues that technology is constructed by social factors .
One important technology which was shaped by a specific group of users is electric vehicles , which have been shaped by four different factors that  technical , economic  , social , and political 
Technical factor is one of the four elements that have determined the development of the electric vehicle .
Compared to the structure of a conventional automobile , the electric vehicle has a similar structure but different components .
The electric vehicle has a lighter weight as most of its parts are made  of aluminium .
In addition , the electric vehicle is safe to drive  as it is uses solely electricity , while most conventional vehicles require gasoline , which is inflammable .
On the other hand , the electric vehicle utilizes electrical energy from  batteries , so the engine is relatively clean , emission-free and quiet .
However , there are less charging stations and the electric vehicle requires a long recharge time .
Therefore , it has limited usage and driving range .
Economically , technology for electric vehicles have not widely met the need because less promotion was held and there was a mass production of gasoline type automobiles .
Fewer promotions on electric vehicles were organized and auto shows were not often organized , resulting in relatively discouraging sales .
Furthermore , electric vehicles were not advertised in a precise manner .
Besides , declining cost in oil in the past encouraged people to buy gasoline cars .
At that point , there was a mass production of gasoline cars .
Insurance and financing were included in purchasing these vehicles .
In the end , gasoline vehicles controlled the monopoly on automobiles in the market .
From these examples , we can see that various economic factors had a great influence on electric vehicles .
Compared to conventional vehicles that are available now , electric vehicles are socially determined by several reasons: limited range of electric vehicles , beliefs and values of the society today .
Because of limited choices of electric cars , people choose conventional automobiles which offer greater variety of choices .
Despite several advantages , their interest in electric cars is fading .
Additionally , some have negative beliefs and values towards electric cars .
They believe that their status may be lowered by purchasing the cars .
They also feel that these cars are less attractive compared to conventional cars 
In addition , political factors can affect how the sales of vehicles go , which include the government's adherence to this technology .
People lose interest as the government is not supportive .
The government not only provides subsidies and incentives to users , who use gasoline cars , but also constructs and designs roads for conventional vehicles .
All in all , we can easily see from these examples that , many factors that specified by other group of users have led electric vehicles to a decline .
According to Sovacool (2009) , acceptance of a new technology depends not only on technical factors but also economic , political , and social ones .
These specific factors need to be analyzed to work out a better solution algorithmically and tackle the existing problems .
Nowadays , with the ever-accelerating technology , many inventions have come into being , and many new words have come with them as well .
Have you ever heard about warfarin ?
Yes !
It is the most widely used rat poison in the world !
But do you know the original usage of warfarin ?
At first , a certain chemical in warfarin was used to counteract the acid in the soil and to minimize soil erosion .
It was found in some sweet clover hay .
However , farmers who used these plants found that when they fed their cattle with them , they all died of hemorrhage .
Professor K .P .
Link then did  research and found coumarin inside the sweet clover hay , which resulted in punctured cattle's stomachs and  internal bleeding .
This  chemical enlightened Professor Link on applying them to killing rats .
Thus , the famous warfarin came into use !
It is a typical serendipity example , which in fact shares some common points with  conventional research .
The first similarity is that at the first step , they both require scientists to make every effort to get the expected results .
Therefore , both of these kinds of inventions require scientists to have a proper method to do the experiment at first .
Thus we cannot infer that serendipity occurs when scientists use wrong methods to achieve the result .
After all , their purposes before doing experiments are the same .
They will not work out the problem in an opposite way at the first step .
The second similarity that I consider is  luck .
As long as it is an experiment , it requires luck to some extent , regardless of whether it is serendipity or  conventional research .
Take Nobel's invention of dynamics for example .
Without luck , he may have died during the explosion of the dynamics and  Thus , luck is required in every successful experiment , let alone serendipity , which requires more luck to achieve another result to just meet a certain kind of people's need coincidentally .
Although there are similarities  , they differ from each other in several respects .
The first obvious difference is that serendipitous technologies are not invented on purpose .
Do you know something about the invention of the microwave oven ?
It was invented by an American engineer called Percy Spencer .
At first , Spencer cooperated with the British to study microwaves in military use .
By accident , he found that the chocolate bars in his pocket  melted when exposed to microwaves .
This phenomenon interested him to use an egg for experiment .
What made him surprised was that the egg blew up !
Then the microwave oven came into use !
However , it was not invented on purpose at first !
Another difference is that serendipity  sometimes caused by additional observations of one research , while there is no further discovery as a "bonus" in a conventional research .
To conclude , both serendipity and a conventional research require luck and they are similar in their own first step , but the difference is that a serendipity finding is not on purpose and it is sometimes results from an additional discovery through a research .
However , both of them are needed to make the scientific world a more magical and wonderful world !

All modern jet aircraft are powered by engines based on the first jet engine .
This was first developed by Frank Whittle in 1937 and installed in military aircrafts during  World War II .
After the war , this technology was transferred to commercial use and enabled faster and safer air travel .
In the context of the social construction of technology , I will discuss how various social factors have shaped this technological innovation .
Military priority during  World War II was an important factor in propelling the design and use of the engine .
Frank Whittle , the inventor of jet propulsion , was a pilot in the Royal Air Force in the early 1920s .
When he first proposed the idea of turbo jet propulsion , it was met with skepticism by the Air Ministry and was denied assistance and funding from the country ("Biography: Sir Frank Whittle ," n .d .) .
Frank Whittle then continued to work on his engine but due to lack of funding , he made little progress .
Finally just a few months before the invasion of Poland by Germany and in the wake of possible threats , the Air ministry finally took Frank's work seriously and promised funding for Frank's research (Younossi et al . ,2003) .
As we can see , if there was no threat of war , the British Government may not have provided any funding at all .
The jet engine might not have been invented at all as people then did not see the need for planes to travel so fast .
The social setting of the invention also plays an interesting role in shaping the history of the jet engine .
When Frank Whittle carried out his research for the British , a German physicist by the name of Hans Von Ohain had already successfully invented the jet engine and the first test flight was a whole two years earlier than Frank Whittle's (McTavish , 1993) .
However Frank's model was more recognized than Han's due to two reasons .
First , the first jet flight was unknown to the world due to military secrecy under the Nazi regime (Crandall , 2007) .
Second , the war ended with the Allies emerging victorious .
Therefore , Hans's engine was not developed while the U .K continued to improve on Frank Whittle's design , which would later be evolved to commercial uses .
In this case , the engine used was socially determined by the winning party of the war .
Two feasible engines had meet up with different fates due to the different social settings .
Last by not least , the increase in the trends of international tourism is the one factor that allows jet engines to be converted to civilian usage today .
After the war , peace returned and economies prospered due to reconstruction efforts .
People became more affluent and demand for foreign travel increased exponentially (Lyth , 1975) .
Planes in use then were slow; around 250 miles per hour  , and the airlines industry needed a better alternative .
This was when the jet engines were developed to fit into the commercial planes we travel on today .
As we can see , a change in society's trend can completely revolutionize the usage of a technology .
This is a striking example of how social factors shaped the way people use a technology .
The plagiarism problem in both researching process and manufacturing process of engineering design iseconomyious in China .
In Chinese universities and capitalsearch organizations , plagiarism is rampant .
A Chinese study shows that "60 percent of PhD candidates admitted to plagiarism , bribery" (Marquand , 2006) .
University professors are also exposed of plagiarism .
For instance , Wang Mingming , a sociology professor in Peking University plagiarized 100 .000 words from an American anthropologist's work in the year 2002(Academic Circles , 2002) .
Plagiarism also exists in manufactories .
A notable number ofhampersse factories make piratical products by copying foreign products .
For example , Meizu , a Chinese electrical manufactory famous for its pseudo "Apple inspired design" music players recently comes up with a new product M8 .
This new product is actually another copycat of Apple iphone (Ricker , 2007) .
Another example is the popular Chinese website " Xiaonei" .
It is exactly a fake "Facebook" .
Plagiarism can have strong negative effects on the innovation of engineering design .
By plagiarizing , engineers are not inclined to generate and analyze multiple solutions (Khandani , 2005) .
They tend to copy other engineers' work and become less creative , which in turn , significantly hamper the engineering design innovation of the whole nation .
hampersThe other important factor is the traditional conservative consumption concept of Chinese people .
Chinese culture used to appreciate consistency and changelessness .
In modern society , many Chinese people are still traditional and conservative in their consumption concepts .
They tend to reject engineering innovation and be slow in accepting new technoltoical products .
Consequently , the conservative consumption concept can lead to low evaluation estimation of innovative products .
For the famous Russian Anti-Virus software , Kaspersky , many Chinese people would prefer to get a free registration key than pay certain amount of mopiratedhermore , the commercializing process of engineering design innovation can also be strongly affected by the conservative consumption concepts .
Take "Xianjian (thecamend of Sword and Fairy)" , a fantastic Chinese video game for example .
It is a very popular video game in china .
However , the game company is lack of capitals for research and development since most players are using cracked version of Xianjian .
With few responses from local consumers , it is really tough for the innovation of engineering design in China .
versionscapitallacksThe world is becoming more competitive .
Only creative countries with innovative engineers can lead the technology of the world .
Therefore , innovation in engineering design is of extreme importance .
China has to be aware of its problems in engineering design in order to be a leading nation in the 21st century .
By reducing the plagiarism rate of Chinese institutes and gradually converting the conservative consumption concept of Chinese people , China can really make a big difference .

Infrastructure is the foundation of agriculture .

At present , the lack of investment makes several projects in Vietnam progress tardily or incompletely .
The standard of living has become higher and higher .
As a result , the needs of energy , effective machine , modern communication service . . . ask for an innovation in engineering design processes that " often begins with recognition of a problem or need" (Rogers , 2003 , p . 136) .
Vietnamese engineers have knowledge and enthusiasm to start research and development .
However , at this stage , they must face a serious question: "Where do the investments come from ?"
Without money , engineers cannot continue and improve their ideas .
In fact , most of that research only existed  on paper and in laboratories .
For instance , despite the assessment of substantial potential energy , wind energy in Vietnam is not developed and is only applied in researching phase .
According to Do (2008) , around 28 ,000 square kilometers of the country's land has an average wind speed of over seven meters per second (para .
2) .
The wind energy project requires a great investment that is too high for provinces; so , they are trying to attract foreign and private investors .
But there are still difficulties for foreigners and organizations seeking to invest in Vietnam .
One of these involves the form of pricing .
Do showed "State- owned monopoly power distributor Vietnam Electricity ( EVN) only pays 4 .5 cents for a kilowatt hour (kWh) of wind energy though the cost of generating it is not less than six cents ."
Thus , the Vietnamese laws would better be changed to reflect the needs of investors .
In addition to the investment , the force of skilled workers is also a difficult problem for Vietnam .
The  shortage of skilled workers has appeared for a long time , but recently , in speeding up production process , this condition becomes urgent .
In Binh Duong , a province of Vietnam , the real situation is "roughly 50 ,000 laborers were needed to fill positions each year" ("Firms grapple with shortage" , 2009) .
So the engineering design process is short of efficient workers joining in the commercialization of an innovation .
However , in many training schools , there is still lack of facilities and equipment , which  cannot help workers improve their practical skill .
Therefore , from now on , the Vietnamese government  should find a solution to link factories and companies with schools in training workers .
With the investment from them , the school has abilities to modernize facilities so that the training condition  will be better .
The shortage of investment and skilled workers is a problem needing rapid and lasting solutions  .
Undergoing this challenge , Vietnam will gain more power to catch up with the developed world .
Although the scale of the raw materials manufacture for the plastic conduit is einending and the quality of the materials is increasing , there areirst , there is little variety of the raw materials and there are almost no special materials .
To meet the different needs of the market , many kinds of materials are needed .
But , China does not have enough kinds of special raw materials at pconduits As a consconduits have need to import thehaving a lighter weightther countries .
The import increases the price of plastic conduit which people do conduits save sources , cost less and are aterials are not steady .
This is maiconduits are  our productiowithstem is not advanced .
We do not have the advanced equipwhich hampernd do not use stabilizing agent and additive properly .
This problem is because of our short comings in the technology .
The last , the price of the raw materials fluctuate greatly .
The price of the ordinary materials are suitable and almost the same as other countries .
However , the special raw materials are very expensive , especially some accessories and some assistants .
As a result , we need to import the special materials from other countries .
Therefore , there are some problems about the raw materials of the plastic conduit that hamper the engineering design .
the same as that in other countriesisfluctuatesPlastic cnd the repair skill .
However , the criterions about these techniques are still under constituting .
The study about plastic conduit is poor and there is no ripe method to construct .
These problems lead to a result that although there are good products , plastic conduit cannot exert its special functions because the workers do not have the necessary knowledge and still follows the outdated methods .
As a result , the laggard utilization of the quality of the materials is ocess of engineering mainly due to the fact that our production system is not advanced
followPlastic conduit is really an advanced design for industry .
However , just like plastic conduit , there are many engineering designs which have not developed into perfect icriteria in China because of the problems up , China has a long way to go to meet the needs of engineering designs processes for innovations .
In the board sweep of scientific history , scientists have made a lot of discoveries via research .
At the same time , a lot of serendipitous discoveries were made .
As a serendipitous discovery , the discovery of penicillin is very different from the discovery of the DNA's structure , because Alexander Fleming started to study penicillin by an accidental finding , but Watson and Crick started the research on the DNA's structure based on Franklin's previous study .
Furthermore , Fleming did not experience failure during the study on penicillin , but the discovery of DNA's structure did not seem to be that smooth .
The discovery of penicillin was started accidentally , but Watson and Crick started their research on the structure of DNA based on the previous research done by Franklin .
Douglas Allchin (n .d .) once put in his article saying that "Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin is one of the most celebrated cases of chance , or accident , in science (Allchin , n .d .) ."
Although Louis Pasteur once said that "chance favors only the prepared mind" , it was fortune that has  done the most job to make Fleming the person who found penicillin .
Well , for Watson and Crick , it was another story .
"These two brash young scientists" ("The discovery of" , n .d .) spent more than one year discussing the result of Franklin's research and their assumptions before they really embarked on their own research .
Maybe it was just because  Fleming discovered  penicillin by chance , he did not experience any failure during the discovering process , while the discovery of the DNA's structure did not seem to be that easy and the process did not seem to be smooth , either .
After "Fleming noticed a halo of inhibition of bacterial growth around a contaminant blue-green mould on a Staphylococcus plate culture" ("Discovery of penicillin" , 2009) , he started his research and discovered penicillin .
Everything seemed to progress normally .
When it comes to the DNA's structure , the situation was quite different .
In the 1950s , not only Watson and Crick , but also two other groups were working on the research wanting to determine the structure of DNA , but in the end , only Watson and Crick were able to produce good quality diffraction patterns and thus produce sufficient quantitative data about the structure ("History of molecular" , 2009) .
In conclusion , scientists made new discoveries by using different methods .
The discovering processes of penicillin and the structure of DNA were totally different , but the scientists have made significant contribution to human beings by making both discoveries .
Furthermore , both of them are still playing an important role in the medical field in 21st century .
Over the years , man has come up with many marvelous ideas and technologies which have helped to simplify our lives by a huge leap .
These great ideas were thanks to the hardwork and effort that researchers put in to make them happen .
However , some of the unthinkable ideas were not created through research .
These creations are called serendipitous discoveries .
More often than not , they are chanced upon when the researchers are researching on something else instead .
Let us take a closer look at two examples , the electric car as technology that was developed via research and warfarin which was a result of a serendipitous discovery , and find out what are some of their similarities and differences in terms of their popularity , usefulness , production cost , and  usage .
Both the electric car and warfarin gained in popularity from the moment they were developed .
The electric cars were heavily marketed when the prototype became available .
Advertisements were put up in each local newspaper , inviting interested individuals to apply for an opportunity to test-drive the new vehicle .
The response turned out to be overwhelming .
According to Rogers E .M .(2003) , in Sacramento , with a population of close to half a million , seven thousand applied .
And though they were given thrity minutes after the test-drive to ask questions , they found that it was not enough to ask all the questions that they had in mind .
Also , when asked to hand out wallet-sized cards containing information on the electric cars , the test-drivers did it with passion .
They even asked for more cards when they finished giving out what they had  .
As for warfarin , it was a big hit too as it was a very effective antidote against pests like rats and mice .
However , to this date , it has been overtaken by another stronger poison called brodifacoum .
This is because many rat populations have developed resistance to warfarin .
Therefore , a poison of greater potency is needed .
Another similarity between the two different innovations is that they are both useful in their own way .
The electric car is created as it does not pollute the air unlike gasoline vehicles .
The electric car is also lightweight and very quiet , which does not produce noise pollution as well .
Therefore , the electric car serves its purpose of being a clean and pollution-free car .
warfarin is useful as rats cause a lot of problems especially to farmers , and warfarin is very effective against them .
Besides , it is not dangerous to humans who might happen to consume it .
Thus , both creations are very useful in the role they play in making our life a better one .
One difference between the two innovations is the production cost of each product .
The electric car is a large scale project where a large amount  of money is pumped into doing research in order to improve the car .
Besides that , each individual part that makes up the car is also expensive .
As compared to the electric car , warfarin is a cheap product which is easily available in the market .
Right from the first Industrial Revolution , human's daily life has been enriched by an exploding number  of inventions .
Currently human beings require more variety and amount of inventions .
Some of the inventions are developed from the conventional generated technology while others may come from innovations which are created in a skunkworks environment .
Both of the two methods require demanding jobs and their researchers must overcome the impacts of unpredictable market during the process .
On the surface , conventionally generated technology and innovation created in a skunkworks environment do not differ .
One similarity the two technologies share is that the process is tedious .
Because of market demands , researchers have to work overloaded so as to come out the technology faster .
Besides , researchers have to repeat the same experiment hundreds of times until they succeed .
For example , Edison decided to invent electric light after Ferrari invented electric motor .
After concluding previous experiences , Edison tried about 1600 different materials as filament with noting down each of their performances .
Besides , Edison also tried to vacuumize the lamp .
And finally all the efforts resulted in success that the first light in the world appeared in 1879 .
In addition , the two technology processes have another feature in common , that is researchers have to take all the uncertain consequences including a total failure during the process .
In other words , no matter the technology derives from a convention or it is definitely a new innovation , they have to be prepared for the worst outcome .
Sometimes the final product cannot reach what people have expected , or the new innovation cannot be accepted by public temporarily , then negative impacts may influence the continuing research .
Therefore , the two types of technologies are alike since demanding jobs are required and researchers must be ready for any consequence given  the unpredictable market .
However , they also differ .
First of all , the length of the research process may differ .
conventionally generated technology is always upgraded from a previous technology; in contrast , innovation is to come up with a total new technology which has fewer references .
Hence , developing a conventionally generated technology is always faster than coming up with an innovation .
Moreover , conventionally generated technology and innovation receive different attitudes from other people , as  conventionally generated technology  .
In addition , the previous technology it is based on may have already gained reputations , hence the majority of people will support the R&D process and the process is always under observation .
But when it comes to innovation , the conditions are quite different .
The researchers of the innovation may receive poor feedback in the prior market research , or someone may even regard the researchers as idiots .
Thus normally the innovation has to be developed in a skunkworks environment .
Take the birth of the first Toshiba laptop as an example .
Initially  the idea of the laptop could not be accepted by the organizational hierarchy of Toshiba .
However , the engineer  Mizoguchi persisted to research the laptop in a skunkworks environment , and finally he got the triumph and nowadays the laptop is becoming essential in our daily life .
The exam-orientated education system has existed in China for a long time .
It does have some advantages; however , it has more side effect on people's innovation and creation .
In the process of basic education , spoon-feeding the living standard e mathe peopleching method in this system and it focuses on memorization .
Students are required to remember whatever books read and teaches teach without thinking about whether it is true or not .
Besides , high marks in exams are their goal of study .
They do a lot of exercise so as to be proficient at solving problems in the exam papers .
They gradually ignore thinking and doubting and lose the awareness and ability of creation and innovation .
In the phase of tertiary education in China , although students have more chance of self-study , most of them still focus on various kinds of exams in order to get certificates .
They pursue further study in purpose of getting a better job rather than do research .
Still , they achieve a master degree or PhD through exams .
In general , the exam-orientated education system has affected engineering design process of innovations .
doingthe purposeforIn addition , the undesirable climate in the academic circle is hampering innovations even more seriously .
There are few engineers aeffectsd in creation and innovation .
Many are more concerned about self benefits , such as social status , reputation and money .
This phenomenon is partially a result of the social prejudice that the society respects those with power more teacherstelligentsias .
Academic demoralization and corruption are common nowadays .
Money for research is wasted on some vanity projects; cheating and plagiarism are carried out in order to win a reputation .
Paper , as the major measurement of one's achievement in academic circles , causes the situation to be even worse .
In order to issue more papers in some magazines , some engineers even use money to buy the opportunities of issuing their articles .
These problems in academic circle are impeding engineering design .
forintelligenceHaving recognized the factors which are hampering the engineering design process of innovations , we must take action to change the serious situation .
Improving the education system and developing right academic atmosphere are essential and urgent .
Only removing the obstacles can engineers develop science and technology and design new things of innovations .
but are similar One obvious difference is the organizational structure .
People who do the project in a conventional way should receive an approval from the corporate executives before these people start the project .
These people have to submit a proposal of the project and wait for the executives' decision , which is based on the company situation .
In some cases , although the idea of the project was brilliant , the executives rejected the proposal due to the economic situation of the company .
For instance , Toshiba's corporate leaders denied Tetsuya Mizoguchi's request on the laptop project (Rogers , 2003) .
In contrast , a project which is done in a skunkworks environment does not undergo the company's bureaucracy .
In other words , the start of skunkworks does not depend on the executives' decision .
As a result of the difference in organizational structure , a conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment also diftheyconsumption .
The project which is done in a conventional way needs more time due to the approval of the corporate executives .
Consequently , the project which is done in a skunkworks environment consumes less time than the conventional one .
This is why in 1943 , the Air Tactical Service Command (ATSC) of the Army Air Force gave Lockheed Aircraft Corporation a command to build a jet fighter due to the rapidly growing German jet ("Skunk Works ," n .d .) .
Despite these differences , a conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks enviisment have two similarities .
Firstly , both of them are handled by professionals .
Due to the complexity of the projectisn unskilled person would not be able to do the project .
For instance , Ron Avitzur and Greg Robbins needed professional quality assurance people to test the project and professional writing software people to write the software in the graphing calculator project (Avitzur , 2004) .
Secondly , both innovations have the same purpose in general .
The purpose is to improve the welfare of society by increasing the ability to adapt to the environment .
For instance , hand phone is made in order to communicate with another person in the different place in an esoftware writing
A conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment are different but alike .
Though they are different in organizational structurethe hand phone consumption , but both still have similarities in the doeaand the purpose .
Since a company still have to consider a number of factors when making a decision , bureaucracy in the company will not be gone .
However , by looking at the efficiency of the skunkworks , it is possible for a company to reduce the bureaucracy in order to come out with more innovations .
An energy crisis may break out because people cry for energy but the resources are limited now .
The step of industrialization becomes faster and faster , so numerous energies are needed .
As resources consumption increases raresourcesd they are limited , there are fewer resthey ares for people toHence , .
And the crisisurfacestage of enhumanss has come oresourcesme extent .
Graham Smith humansazel RudgeTherefore ,ckard(n .d .) reported that , "The UK currently has around sixty million people .
Without oil it could support maybe twenty million but probably less because there will be no oil to power farm machines , no fertilizer to grow strong crops and no herbicides or pesticides to keep the weeds and insects at bay .
We will be sent back to a pre-industrial revolution world with no hope of it ending ."
from this report , we can realize the significance of solving this crisis .
FromInnovation of new machines which consume less energy is a good way to solve the problem .
Since there is less energy , we shouldhas become consumption first .
We can save energy by improving new technology .
Engineers can design new kinds of machines and find new material which can be used to manufacture instruments so that less energy can be consumed .
In addition , finding some new energy is also a feasible solution to prevent the crisis .
There will be a day when we use up all the resources .
So for solving this problem , we should also look for new kinds of energy , such as bio energy , i .e .
eco energy , solar energy and so on .
Take the bio energy as an example .
The bio-energy is that energy obtained from bio-fuel (eco-fuel) .
Today , the well known bio-fuel (the biological one) are ethanol and biodiesel .
They are obtained from plants and used mostly in transportation .
(Emilian M . Dobrescu and Ciolacu C . B .C .
,2009) Since the fuel generates from plants , it means that new energy is renewable .
It can be produced and never limited .
We can implement sustainable development regardless of shortage of resources .
So engineers should do more research on new energy and take more fearless experiments to see if there are some plants can be used to produce energy .
In fact , the new energy is the key to prevent the crisis .
some plants that can thisis generatedHuman has faced a very serious problem , the crisis of shortage of energy .
Because the speed of industrial development increases so fast , more energy is needed .
This leads to the shortage of fuel or resources .
So what engineers should do is to invent new machines which can consume less energy and find new sorts of resources to replace the old non renewable one .
The crisis will almost be solved if bio-fuelsthese two solutioonesinto action .
Furthermore , Engineers should take responsibility to make contribution to the solution , to produce products which can make human live better .
In recent years , Singapore has placed more and more emphasis on research and development , establishing her status of being home to innovations .
Annually , millions in funds are being pumped into the R&D sector to encourage innovations to offer solutions to the pressing challenges Singapore faces .
Indeed , great success has been achieved , for instance Singapore's clean water technology is widely recognized by the world .
The large scale research and development effort has placed Singapore as the leader in new water technologies especially in membrane applications .
Despite her huge success in many areas , Singapore does face problems which hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
One problem faced by engineering design in Singapore is the various restrictions due to the socio-political system  of the country .
Innovations are restricted by the many rules and regulations the country imposed , and sometimes the over emphasis of specific policies which causes development of ideas in an irrelevant area to be neglected .
Singapore is renowned for her strict implementation of rules , and at times it may be seen as too inflexible .
As such , innovations in the contentious areas are often restricted .
The ideas eventually accepted are shaped primarily by commercial interests and governmental policies .
In recent years , the core objectives of the country's research and development projects have been directed in the area of clean energy and water technology .
Various programmes have been initiated to establish Singapore as the Global Clean Energy Hub , for instance the Clean Energy Research Programme , which is a competitive funding scheme to encourage innovations in this area .
However , the over exertion of her efforts may simply cause innovations in the other areas to be neglected .
As a result , the innovation process is interrupted at the stage of research and development with the absence of support and attention .
Aside from this , innovations that are radically different face even greater problems in being accepted .
This can be attributed to the inflexibility of the system causing rejection of innovations that are less relevant to the corporate or country's interest .
Another problem faced by engineers in Singapore is the limitations in resources .
Despite having the most advance infrastructure , the best institute for research , Singapore still lacks the resources for certain development .
Due to her limitations , innovations in some areas are restricted since the accessibility to resources would be too difficult and pose potential problems .
High cost may be incurred for certain research when scarce  or  imported resources are involved .
Foreign experts may also be engaged to facilitate research .
Hence the lack of resources adds hindrance to the process of innovation .
Aside from the lack of resources for the research and development stage , difficulties may be faced in finding a suitable target group  for the innovation result within the country .
The low population of the country disables experimentation on a large scale  which may eventually cause inaccuracy in the result .
Indeed just earlier this year , a team of National University of Singapore researchers found themselves facing this problem .
The team came up with a chair that turns sound into vibrations , which can potentially help the deaf to experience sound better .
However , a problem was faced when they attempted to test out the chair .
They could not get access to enough deaf children locally for the test and thus had to travel to Sri Lanka for the test  .
In the engineering of the eco-car , it is also evident that the lack of resources poses a  great deal of challenges  to the team of NUS students , having to import the materials outside of Singapore .
Hence the process of engineering design is hampered by the lack of resource not only at stages of research and development , but also in the diffusion of the innovation .
In conclusion , despite Singapore's efforts in establishing herself as the Home for Innovations , engineers are compelled by several restrictions such as lack of resources and the inflexibility of the social system .
However , it does not mean engineering design in Singapore is not favorable .
In fact , great success has been achieved in some areas where it faces less restrictions .
In the 21st century , everything develops in a very fast pace .
The needs of human beings have increased .
In order to meet  people's needs ,  engineers or scientists have started to do research and design new things for the them .
They keep on trying and repeating repeating experiments experiments , and eventually succeed to generate new technology new technology .
The serendipitous discovery of new ideas misplaced link word , sometimes comes out during the trials .
Regardless of the fact that the technology has resulted from a long period of research or a serendipitous discovery , this technology must have been done by a group or an individual who has already acquired certain knowledge .
Unclear pronoun reference are believed to have undergone many research and discussions .
According to Rogers (2003) , six main stages are involved in the way to come out the technology , They are . . .ecognizing a problem , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and consequences .
This is not an easy works and it  requires time and effort to deal with it .
Moreover , although the serendipitous idea may not result in desirable outcome , it benefits the world .
The notable example that I want to discuss here is penicillin .
It was accidentally discovered by Alexander Fleming during his investigation about the properties of staphylococci .
This antibiotic was the first drug that is effective against the syphilis and staphylococcus infections .
It successfully has successfully saved the people people who suffered from the diseases and given  them happiness to have the chance to live again .
Similarly , the discovery of the laptop has benefited the individual , the society and the world .
It has saved the people whose surrounding space is small and compact , has brought a lot of convenience to society .
Nowadays laptops have combined  many functions such as camera , microphone , wi-fi receiver and so on .
We don't need to buy the devices and this will actually save a lot of space .
Every time Every time we we want to discuss assignments with friends , we can't bring along the conventional desktop desktop . . With the invention of portable personal computer , we can now bring it along to wherever we like !
In spite of the benefits that both serendipitous discovery and research discovery have given us . , there actually exist differences between the two technologies .
The laptop is a product that resulted  somebody generated the idea and planned the procedures to make it out .
It is a product after the consideration of the safety and functions .
Therefore , it is a  safe design for us to use .
However , we actually take a higher risk of the side-effect when consuming the penicillin .
Penicillin is a serendipitous discovery .
We only know that the penicillin can cure syphilis , but we will never know what diseases might be caused by consuming penicillin as there exist a lot of uncertainties .
In brief , the two products , the laptop and penicillin , are either generated through a long period of research or a serendipitous and they  have both been made to meet people's needs people's requirements .
Although they may not be the best outcome to fulfil the people's needs , they still lead the world to a technological innovation .
Topic: How an  electronic dictionary is shaped by students' needs and the specific factors that have shaped its innovation .
I have witnessed the development of the electronic dictronary .
From the huge one with the simplest function to today's lovely and multi-functional one , electronic dictionaries have been refined again and again .
By saying electronic dictronary , I refer to the small handheld computer which people commonly use to look up words .
The development of electronic dictronary is shaped by the needs of students , who are the majority of their customers .
In the latter paragraphs , I will talk about how students' needs determine the development of electronic dictronary .
The most obvious change is that the functions of electronic dictronary have greatly improved due to the change in students' demand .
At the very beginning , the electronic dictionary could  do nothing but look up words .
In comparision , nowadays electronic dictionaries are much more multi-functional .
For example , they can not only look up words in Chinese and English as the old ones did , but also many other languageslanguages like like Japanese and French as well .
It is intellectualized , which enables the users to enrich their electronic dictronary as they like .
And what they need to do is simply download programms and install them in the electronic dictronary .
Moreover , as students are not content with a boring study tool , an electronic  today can act as good company during leisure time because it possesses the functions  of an MP3/ MP4 player and even a PSP !
Another significant improvement is the appearance of the the electronic dictronary .
Instead of the hand-hand-sized one , it is only lemon-size big now and and much lighter much lighter .
As a direct result , it is convenient to carry and wins students' regards .
As English is a complusary course to learn in China , electronic dictronary has almost become a necessity to students .
And nearly everyone has one .
Thus it is not simply a tool , but a personal belonging to represent their appetite to  modernise modernise .
The electronic dictronary with an outstanding look allows students to show off around their fellows .
So the surface becomes bright-colored and beautifully decorated .
All these changes are aimed to cater for students taste and finally attract their attention .
Last but not least , the price of electronic dictionaries is also influenced by students .
As students do not have jobs , they have to ask their parents for money .
Hence they can not spend too much on an electronic dictronary .
In addition , the limitations of electronic dictionaries , such as no access to the the Internet , also determine that the price of electronic dictronary which cannot be too high .
It can not be as expensive as a computer .
In conclusion , the the electronic dictronary plays an important role in students' study , and students in turn shape and decide the development of electronic dictronary in many aspects  like price , appearance and function .
It can be seen that as technology develops , electronic dictronary will be more and more helpful to students .
Before a technology innovation is developed and patented , scientists have to go through a tedious research process most of the time .
However , there are also occasional chances that R&D workers fortuitously discover an invention when they are  actually pursuing something else .
Whichever way an invention is created , it helps satisfy human needs and solve existing problems .
However , there are still differences between a technology developed developed via research via research such as the electric car and one serendipitously discovered like penicillin .
All technological innovations , regardless of their developing process , help solve world problems .
In view of the increasing emphasis of eco friendliness , the US General Motor R&D unit developed the electric car IMPACT during the early 1990s .
This development received great responses from people throughout the US as it signifies one big step towards solving existing environmental problems such as such as global warming global warming .
Similarly , Alexander Fleming's discovery of Penicillin made many deadly diseases such as Tuberculosis curable .
This groundbreaking discovery also won Fleming a Nobel Prize .
Therefore , the common factor of all technological developments is that they address existing social problems , in one way or another .
The conventional innovation process requires requires engineers engineers to first identify a human need before the research officially begins .
This ensures that the research has a proper target .
Take the development of electric cars as an example , engineers recognized the increasing emphasis on eco friendliness , and therefore developed the vehicle without a fuel-powered engine to ease global warming .
On the other hand , a serendipitously discovered product is not the preset goal that that researchers  researchers want to achieve .
Its application is realized after the product has already been created .
Alexander Fleming did not expect to discover penicillin mould when he left the petri dish containing Staphylococcus plate culture open .
Therefore , an innovation involving continuous research and development differs from an accidental discovery as the former is a rational problem solving process while the latter is more of a lucky surprise .
Technological innovations have shaped modern lifestyle modern lifestyle .
We use electricity , watch television , surf surf billions of websites billions of websites every day .
Some of those inventions have become an essential part of our life and we cannot live without these inventions .
However , it is clear that these inventions have not been  not produced overnight and human beings have put  in a lot of time and effort to develop and generate them .
Generally , innovations can be generated in two ways -- conventional research or skunkwork .
There are some differences and similarities between the technologies created in the two different backgrounds .
One of the main differences between a conventionally  generated technology and skunkwork product is the speed of generating the product .
According to Rogers (2003) , skunkwork refers to a small group of highly selected people designated to do research for an innovation without carrying  out tedious organization procedures .
While conventional research requires the researchers to do large amount of reports , discussions and management procedures , skunkwork provides a pathway to develop an invention quickly without being constrained by bureaucratic processes .
Therefore , innovations that are  created in a skunkwork environment are usually created faster than those inventions created by conventional research .
For example , Roger (2003) states that the skunkwork of producing laptop , lead by Mizoguchi , involves 10 engineers from military projects and takes only 24 months to complete .
In contrast , a conventionally generated technology may not move that fast .
Conventional research involves a lot of management procedures .
The research must be approved by the corporate leaders before it can be carried out .
Therefore , conventionally generated technology usually moves slower than that of skunkwork production .
The second difference is the flexibility in making changes to generate a new technology .
Conventional research  must undergo step-by-step management to maintain the continuity and stability of a company .
However , it does not favour the technological development .
A good illustration was the failure of Xerox PARC in bringing their outstanding technologies into the marketplace According to Roger (2003) , Xerox PARC employed numerous talented researchers and developed outstanding personal computing technology .
However , the corporation restricted itself to develop only in office copier business , not in microcomputer business .
In contrast , skunkwork provides an alternative which is beneficial to technological inventions as well as organizational procedure .
The specified team is given resources and freedom to develop and make changes as they see any problem in the invention .
As a result , skunkwork innovations are more flexible and more able to adapt to changes than the conventionally generated technology .
However , there are some similarities between conventionally generated technologies and the skunkwork innovations .
Generally , both ways serve to provide better life to to society society and gives profit to the company .
For instance , a conventionally generated invention , electric refrigerator was produced to meet the needs of humans .
At the same time , the company earned a lot of money from this invention .
On the other hand , skunkwork innovation , such as the production of Toshiba laptop enables users to bring the laptop with them wherever they go This invention also makes a lot of profit to the company .
To sum up , conventionally generated technology and skunkwork invention bear some differences and share some common points .
Although they differ in the procedure throughout the development of a technology , the 2 ways are heading towards a common goalto produce a better environment for human beings .

First of all , Chinese education system largely destroyed students' creativeimplementation skills .
Inovative thinking contains natural curiosity and bold imagination whereas analytical thinking is comprised of experiences .
The schools in China usually aim at cultivating students' analytical skills by teaching them knowledge and testing them on the knowledge been taught .
But the education system doesn't encourage students to think out of the box to give their own answers or to explore the mysterious world .
This "educatiothe Chinesexamination" strategy have two negative impact on engineering design .
Firinnovationevents students from detecting real problems by themselves which is essential in the fcomprisesgineering design .
As the experiences filling up students' minds , their curiosity is fading day by day until they don't even bother to take notice the wthat has been taught surrounding them .
In addition , it limits the possible solutions students could come up with , therefore hampers the third step .
Examination often denies imagination .
Hence students gradually lose the ability to conceive fresh ideas .
However , the best way to solve a problem may not be taught by lecturers and books .
Sometimes , we need to use our own brain to find it out .
Secondly , Chinese society destracted engineers from devoting into innovative work .
In scientific world , most of the greatest contributers are from western countires; the only two Chinese scientist who won Nobel Prize developed their theories in America .
Similarly , in technological area , Chinese engineers seldom have breakthroughs .
These phenotice of can be largely subscribed to the impulsive atmosphere of Chinese society .
As a result of the impulsive atmosphere , Chinese government focused too much on economic development but input too little on technological research .
Compared with the developed countries ,scientistsressed mothe Nobel prizement rather than generation of engineering design .
Besides the indifference from government , engineers also didn't attach much importance to engineering design .
Engineering design is a meaningful work but requires lots of sacrifice and devotion since it couldn't generate benefits promplty and directly .
Hence , this impulsive atmosphere seriously impacts the whole engineering design .
can'tdesignsThe lack of innovative thinking skills anthe Chinesendifference to the creative work have already hampered Ch engineering design .
To promote creative-centered research and design , China have to transform greatlimplementatione two dimensions .
With concise understanding of the problem and important information , the design will move to the next stage of creating solutions .
A single solution alone will not be able to suffice in making the design a roaring success .
A good engineer will have to contemplate on various solutions and from various angles .
After gathering various solutions to the problem at hand , Khandhani suggested narrowing down to one solution after considering the pros and cons of each solution .
Making surgery less invasive could mean inventing other instruments but the reason a robot was chosen signifies the importance of surgery .
The lives of patients cannot be placed in jeopardy and inventing a design that comprises  safety of the patient was an absolute no .
In the case of the Da Vinci surgical system , it will not be able to function unless it detects the presence of the surgeon's head in the viewer .
This was indication that the surgery was still in safe hands and was the best solution to making surgery less invasive .
Therefore the solution was specified and the design process was nearing completion .
The examination-oriented education , as the name implies , is the education whose purpose is getting high grades in the exam .
Teachers teach for the exam .
Sthas been developingudy for the exam .
has this been happeningat students have high scores but low abilities .
In the first stage of the engineering design process--define the problem , people need an active mind to design problem , but many students under the examination-oriented education system only know how to use their knowledge to answer the question on the examination paper , thexistingot know how to use knowledge to solve the real problems .
In the third step of the design processgenerate multiple solutions , this needs divergent thinking and analytical skills , whereas the examinationoriented education do not emphasis the importance of thinking and skills .
Its only purpose is high score in the exam .
The skills which needed in the design process cannot be gain from such an education system .
Chinese educationalists have noticed this problem .
They have implemented another education system , education for allrounded development , which emphasis that developing students' abilities is the most important thing .
gainedare neededscoresIn China , the worship of authorities is blind .
Authorities aanaeducation systemht and cannot be qfor students to get This is also not good for people to desitofor innovation .
To generate multiple solutions , it neto try new ways audaciously .
However , people always cannot break the shackle of the authorities .
They do not dare to challenge the authorities .
This may owe to the class concept in China .
Under shackles , no good ideas will be gotten .
The blind worship of authorities also will hamper the academic exchange between the authorities and students .
Rogers have said in the generation of innovation , "the innovationdevelopment pr , generating , most of all , drivenchange of technical information in are neededce of high degree of uncertainty" .
That is tdoessay that the exchange of information is very important for innovation .
Technologies have changed and advanced over the years , leading to the birth of many innovations we are using today .
In the midst of using these technologies today , we can view them from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist perspective .
To look from the former point of view , it means that the technology has played a part in shaping the society today , while viewing from the latter would suggest that it is due to the societal factors that has shaped the technology today (Rogers , 2003) .
The electric car is an example of a socially determined technology , which came about due to factors from the different sectors of the society , such as the economy , government and the environment .
Social construction of technology is also what is called as the social determinist technology .
The electric car is clearly an example of such technology because as early as 1990s , the environmental issues were already present such that the government had to take action to mitigate the situation .
It was only due to economic reasons recently that the production of electric cars is stepped up .
There is a legend that has been fascinating people from some one thousand years  ago: God was going to send a deluge to destroy the earth and almost all the living things on earth which had become corrupt .
However , taking pity on what he had created , he instructed Noah to build a big vessel to save some species of the creatures .
Ultimately , the great flood wiped out all the beings except those Noah have conserved on the ark .
This Bible version of saving the dying out creatures inspired scientists to work on a new "Noah Ark" , or a "doomsday" conservancy , to store genetic materials in case of future use for both scientific purpose and biological diversity .
However , this time , the one who destroys the earth is no more God G but human beings themselves .
As a matter of fact , the Earth's population is currently increasing , coupled with pollution , urban sprawl , deforestation , and climate warming which caused serious damages to the habitats of the plants and animals .
These series of human activities with their negative effects on the environment directly leads to an inevitable consequence: species extinction .
Dr . Donald A . Levin , Professor of Biology , University of Texas , Austin once claimed in the January-February issue of American Scientist magazine , "Although the extinction of various species is a natural phenomenon , the rate of extinction occurring in today's world is exceptional -- as many as 100 to1 ,000 times greater than normal ."
The alarm-bells have been rung , which draws worldwide attention .
Both scientists and environmentalists are endeavoring to change the situation , and fortunately there is good news for those who really care about the endangered creatures .
Besides the set up biological laboratories , various kinds of DNA repositories have been built while more plans are under way .
So far , there are already more than 1 ,400 seed banks in the world , in addition to those  intended for both plants and animal DNA storage .
However , can the problem of species extinction really be solved by this technology ?
Since this particular technology came into being under the influence of human activities , it will definitely continue changing .
In other words , when the technology becomes more mature and more profitable in the future (which is very possible) , it is very hard to guarantee that it will only be put into good use .
What if the issue involves crime , disease or simply moral controversy like cloning ?
The outcome remains to be seen .
Anyway , social requirement created it and it is meeting the allowable needs for the time being .
Technologies have the capabilities of solving problems and improving  our daily life .
In order to come out with useful technologies , Rogers (2003) states that the process involves research for more in depth understanding of scientific knowledge , followed by research to solve specific problems and finally , development of the technologies .
However , in the mist of researching  a particular technology , the discovery of new technologies may appear unexpectedly .
There are both similarities and differences between technologies developed via research and technologies resulting from a serendipitous discovery .
For example , the invention of laptops and the discovery of 3M Post-it pads respectively .
Laptops and Post-it pads are both favorable to us in one way or another .
In the case where space constraint is of concern , laptops will be the solution .
This is due to the fact that  laptops are much smaller than desktop computers as the latter consist of monitors as well as central processing units (CPU) .
According to Rogers (2003) , "the laptop made particular sense in Japan , due to crowded offices and small homes" .
Similarly , the 3M Post-it pads are useful to us in our daily life .
With Post-its , any notes , instructions or reminders can be written on it and attached to "a letter or other document" (Rogers , 2003) .
Hence , both inventions are beneficial to us .
However , between these two technologies , one of their differences is how the idea came about .
For invention of laptops , idea came about when there was a problem to be solved , which is , "due to crowded offices and small homes" (Rogers , 2003) in Japan .
On the other hand , for the 3M Post-it pads , the unexpected discovery came about when 3M researchers were investigating  a new adhesive (Rogers , 2003) .
Therefore , the creation of Post-it pads was unintentional while creation of laptop was with intended purposes .
Another difference between the two technologies is  the room for further development .
For laptops , advancements are constantly introduced to attract the market .
For example , there are faster processors and more internal memory space being incorporated .
In addition to that , shrinking of laptops sizes and the variations of designs makes them even more attractive than before .
There will surely be more enhancements to come in the near future .
However , for Post-it pads , the developments are probably limited to colors , shapes , size and the extent of how sticky it is .
Hence , in terms of future developments , laptops may have a better prospect  compared to Post- it pads .
The 3-D printer currently available has the ability to produce complex models of differing shapes and sizes in a short duration .
In addition , it can print on various materials ranging from rubber to plastic .
These properties of the 3-D printer are consequences of psychological and economic factors .
Present technology is insufficient to convince investors to finance proposals , especially in the manufacturing or construction sector .
While computer-aided designing software is available to produce 3-D simulation , it lacks realism .
Since such a project involves huge amount of money , investors must be ascertained that their commitments will bring them profit .
One way of convincing them is to produce physical prototypes  that can be felt and scrutinized .
Secondly , creating models with traditional means is time consumingand does not make economical sense to businesses .
Companies are often engaged in a race to unveil their product ahead of their competitors so as to seize a major share in the marketplace .
In such a situation , time is of essence .
In consideration of these factors , designers have conceived the 3-D printer , which is capable of speeding up designing processes .
Based on a report in The Economist (2009) , it now takes Timberland merely ninety minutes to turn a design of a new sole into a model using the 3-D printer--- a significant decrease of a week that the process requires in the past .
The factors that shaped the technological innovation of the 3-D printer discussed thus far are coming from the end-user perspective .
However , factors from the manufacture's viewpoint are also considered to ensure the commercial success of the 3-D printer .
These factors have also influenced the design of the 3-D printer .
The designing of the 3-D printer is also influenced by the potential profitability of it .
The development of the technical aspects of a technology involves the devotion of large amount of resources , which will result in increased cost .
As with all business operators , corporate manufacturers must ensure that their product is profitable , or at the basic able to recuperate the financial resources poured into research and development .
The designers of the 3-D printer have ensured that their product appeal to a large consumer group by boosting its functionality .
As mentioned in The Economist (2009) , the "machine can not only produce things out-of plastic , but also complex ones with moving parts ."
In conclusion , the technological innovation of the 3-D printer is shaped by the demand for a realistic model that can be produced in a short time .
Besides , it is also influenced by its potential profitability for the corporate manufacturer .
The engineering design processes as described by Khandani(2005) provide a well-rounded methodology thatcomes up with solutions fora needs .
The process starts with identifying the underlying cause of the need to effectively solve the problem at hand , and  by research on the topic for better understanding .
Brainstorming for solutions comes next and the engineer lists out all the possible solutions for self-critique later .
Armed with more information on the problem , the engineer would be able to make better decisions on the final solution to optimise and adapt the product as a prototype .
The focus of this essay is; however , on the ways the engineering design processes help to fulfil a particular need .
Therefore the final step of implementing the solution will not be discussed .
In 1997 , a group of countries agreed to commit to the Kyoto Protocol , which aims at a reduction of greenhouse gases emitted  , in view of the potential climatic changes to come should the situation be left unattended to .
Today , even as many other countries have taken small steps towards the control of greenhouse emissions , the fact remains that a large portion of the energy we generate for human consumption still comes from the burning of fossil fuels .
There is therefore a need for a more environmentally friendly way to generate  energy for our use .
The development of a problem statement gives the engineer a chance to look into the elements which the need is comprised of .
In this case , reducing the undesirable emissions of mainly carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide and the oxides of nitrogen will provide environmentally friendlier energy .
With the aid of a clear problem statement , the engineer is able to tackle the problem at its core by following  an objective-specific statement .
The act of gathering information pertaining to the problem enables the engineer to look into possible past solutions to examine their effectiveness in dealing with the situation .
As mentioned previously , the Kyoto Protocol binds the countries in agreement to achieve approximately 5 to 10 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions . 
Next , with the design process aims to brainstorm for solutions and list all of them  for comparisons later . . 
Lastly , the analysis and  selection of a single solution for adaptation fall back heavily on previous research .
The engineer must be mindful of the various factors and make a choice towards one solution which balances the criterion he deems necessary for his product  .
I define the more important requirements of the final solution to be its ease of being accepted by users , the extent of it being able to reduce undesirable emissions and the amount of time it takes to be implemented .
While comparing the two solutions , it is found that alternate sources of energy like wind energy , hydroelectric energy or nuclear energy significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas produced .
However , it is not likely that they will be able to replace the current infrastructures of fossil fuel generators at a quick rate due to their high start-up costs , and in some cases , their geographical constraints .
Hence , despite being an ideal solution in the long run , alternate energy sources are unable to curb the problem now .
On the other hand , increasing the efficiency of current generators will allow  optimisation tune-ups , which are less costly and more likely to be welcomed and readily adopted by the energy business .
Furthermore , there is much room for improvements in fuel to energy efficiency; with innovation towards developing upgrades for conventional generators to better utilizing the usual energy lost as heat , the amount of fuel needed and therefore greenhouse gas emissions could see a decrease of upwards of 20 percent .
The solution to the need of a more environmentally friendly way to generate energy based on my particular set of factors is therefore to innovate for an add-on to existing power generators to provide greater efficiency in fuel to energy conversion .
This will reduce the greenhouse emissions as smaller amounts of fuel would be needed to generate the same amount of energy , thus meeting our need .
The ubiquitous gasoline cars we have around the world nowadays are being slowly replaced by the electric-powered cars .
In fact , U .S President Barack Obama is aiming to put a million electric vehicles on the roads by 2015 (Peter , 2009) and with the world's number one superpower taking the lead , it is almost as sure that the rest of the world will jump on the bandwagon .
These battery-powered cars were previously a costly mode of transport limited to a niche market , but they have since been reborn and are creating a new wave in the automobile market .
The rebirth of the electric vehicle technology can be attributed to the revived interest of the automobile giants , government regulations on greenhouse gas emission and also the improvement in the technicalities previously assosciated with electric cars .
This year , the US Department of Energy , after a highly competitive application process , handed out US$400 million in grants to the 'Big Three' - Chrysler , Ford and General Motors to develop the next-generation technologies for electric vehicles (Elie , 2009) .
The vote of trust as shown by the Big Three's initiative in developing this technology has provided a huge boost to the viability of electric cars replacing gasoline vehicles as the main mode of transport on the roads .
Together with the strong backing of the government , it is exactly the type of stimulus that the electric vehicles require in order to make a strong and sustained headway into the automobile industry .
US President Obama is expected to sign an order next month for federal agencies to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 (Tim , 2009) .
This is also reflected on a global scale , with major economies such as Russia , United Kingdom and China pledging to reduce their greenhouse gas emission within a similar time frame through carbon emission regulations and guidelines .
Switching from gasoline vehicles to the 'zero-emission' electric vehicles will significantly reduce the carbon emission of these countries , hence the resurgence of electric vehicles and their technologies .
Previously , electric vehicles were plagued with numerous technical problems and simply did not appeal to car owners .
Major problems included long charging time of up to hours and the lack of charging facilities .
However , improvement in the charging technology promises to reduce charging time to between 10 and 45 minutes .
In addition , studies say that as much as $320 million will be spent on charging infrastructure over the next 20 years (Peter , 2009) .
Certainly , with more than one million electric cars on the road , charging infrastructure has to be developed and proliferated to meet the surge in demand for charging points .
The global push towards the adoption of the electric vehicle technology is increasing in tempo .
However , for it to replace the gasoline vehicles will be an uphill task that requires a concerted effort from both the industry and the governments .
Hybrid vehicles available on the roads nowadays are a good start , and hopefully in years to come , gasoline cars will be a thing of the past .
According to Rogers , E . M . (2003) , the development of an engineering design process consists of a total six main stages:  , needs/problems , research (basic and applied) , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and consequences  .1 The whole design process of creating new products is tedious and will take a very  long time to complete; especially the stages on research and development . . Due to the limited resources in Singapore , the commercialization stage may not be able to execute .
In this manner , most of the development of engineering design processes are carried out in Singapore end of the development stage .
Examples of  such projects are "NUS Eco-car''2 and "NUS Haptic Chair'' .3
In Singapore , moving on to the commercialization stage of the design process is not easily achieved without going through tough brainstorming .
There are many factors to consider in order for decisions to be made .
Thus , problems may arise and hinder the commercialization stage of the design process .
First of all , for the NUS eco-car innovation process , it is true that the development of eco-car is indeed environmentally friendly .
It does save the Earth with its advanced technology of bringing upon "green" effects , which will be welcomed by everyone .
However , if the eco-car is to proceed  to the commercialization stage in the engineering design process , the problem encountered by my home country is  capital cost .
This is because most of the parts contributed to the assembly of the eco car are bought from overseas and these better grade materials can be rare  and hard to acquire .
Furthermore , hiring skilled workers and buying machines to assemble the car are costly as well .
Hence , for the eco-car to be launched in Singapore during the commercialization stage of its design process , the production of car will  significantly increase the retail price because of the high prices of raw materials in constructing of car .
The high retail price of car will significantly affect the decision of the committee to commercialize the product as consumer would not pay much for it .
On the other hand , for the NUS Haptic Chair innovation process , the researchers had successfully developed the chair for the convenience of  deaf people in Singapore .
The problem that hampers the design process is the shortage of testers to test  the product , for which according to the article3  there were not enough deaf children in Singapore to test this product .
Therefore , there will be no guarantee to the effectiveness of the design to see how the product can be utilized and the researcher will not be able to do modification and optimization to the chair for better performance .
In conclusion , capital cost and the shortage of human resources are two  problems which will significantly hamper engineering design process innovation .
This may result  in  the commercialization stage being unable to realise .
Based on E .M . Roger's paper on "Generation of innovation"  , a typical engineering design process for innovations can be broken down into 6 main stages  .
They are: identifying the needs of the market , designing the research process , developing the product , commercialising , diffusing and adopting and finally , examining the consequences .
Out of the 6 stages , I will elaborateon problems in the research and development stage with reference to examples  in Singapore .
Research is no doubt one of the key factors that contribute to the success of an innovation .
In Singapore , the research sector is one of the best funded fields , besides education and defense .
With a population of only about 4 million , coupled with lack of natural resources , Singapore has no choice but to make the most of what resources that are available .
Hence , it is significant to develop the research sector in Singapore .
Some of common problems in the research sector are lack of skilled labour , time constraint and limited .
One example is the NUS eco-car project which was still at its research stage .
It is not fully developed and commercialized yet because of its low market value .
To build an effective eco-car , a pool of skilled labour is needed .
However , in NUS , the project is at student level only .
With additional guidance from experienced engineers , the eco- car could have been better designed at probably would stand a better chance of being marketed .
The lack of skilled labour in the project caused it to be  at the research stage of the innovation process .
Hence , the development of the eco-car was not consumer friendly and it was unable to move on to the commercialization stage .
Maybe it would be take a few more years before the eco-car has a potential to be marketed .
Sometimes , problems may also occur during the development stage of the innovation process . . One example is the NUS FSAE race car . . After all the research that have been done , through software rendering and such , the problems starts when one is trying to develop it .
After all , the simulation done on computers cannot be compared to what the students have experienced .
In real life , the theories and graphical models formulated on computers cannot be fully achieved and this is a common problem in most engineering innovations .
For this NUS FSAE race car , the innovation stops at the development stage as this is a NUS student project .
It will not be taken to the market level .
The success of the design will be based on the yearly race competition held at  international level .
To sum up , the lack of skilled labour and the inability to re-create computer simulation in real life are not the only 2 problems commonly faced in the engineering design process in Singapore .
However , these 2 problems are enough to cause the downfall and failure of the product when it is placed in the market .
Engineering design processes consists of five different stages starting with defining the problem ,  gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and finally testing and implementing the solutions .
When solving a design problem , one may encounter problems that will hamper the design process .
In engineering design processes , two of the problems that will hamper the design process would be the lack of funds and resources .
Fund is an important factor that determines whether the design process can be carried on  .
To begin with the design process , there is a need to have a team of experts and researchers to sphere head the project which requires hiring cost .
Therefore , the lack of fund will result in the inability to hire professionals to accomplish the task .
Fund also plays an important role in the purchase of  materials to manufacture the product .
Most of the time , products are made over and over again to improve its weaknesses and strengthen its strengths .
Therefore , the purchase of materials can be quite costly as plenty of them will go to waste .
As a result , the lack of fund will hamper the progress of the design process because there will be  no material to manufacture a physical product to test its usefulness .
The design process does not stop after the development of a final product a final product .
This is because the product may not be perfect , and minor yet important changes may need to be done to improve the product .
Therefore , further research needs to be done and money will be involved .
Without sufficient funds , research to further improve the product cannot be done and this may hamper the design process .
Another main problem that will hamper the engineering design process will be the lack of resources in terms of knowledge , raw material and technology .
Knowledge is very important in engineering design processes .
Without knowledge , one will not be able to make wise decisions during the design process .
For example in the aeroplane design process , one needs to determine the material to be used as the body of the aircraft .
Without the knowledge of the characteristics of different materials , one will not be able to choose the best material , which must be strong yet light in weight , to be used .
Knowledge from past experiences will also help in ensuring a smoother design process .
In NUS , a team of students from the engineering faculty took part in Formula SAE Race Car Project in 2001 .
That was the first time engineering students from NUS took part in it .
Due to the fact that it was their first attempt , they realized that the lack of race car knowledge had hampered their design process , and this in turn had also led them to perform badly in the competition . .
However , the engineering faculty has since built up the race car knowledge after taking part in several annual competitions , and in the recent competition it came in 19th place .
Therefore , knowledge plays a crucial role in the design process and the lack of it will hamper the design process .
In summary , the flow of the design process can be hampered by the lack of funds and knowledge .
In the case of lacking of funds , companies need to find sponsorships to fund the cost of their design processes .
However , knowledge is something that cannot be achieved overnight .
Having past experiences and studies will be the key to gain greater knowledge .
and this will subsequently help to serve the public better .will be made to its practicalityIt is known that we all live inre every social activity or industry production activity we do is closely relevant to energy utilization .
Sometimes when the electricity powerthiss cut off temporarily , or the price of petrol is raised rapidly , we will find that our lives are sevthe engineeringted .
Hence , demand for effective technological approache major need of modern people .
A successful engineering design processes should start with the correct iindustrial activity .
The main energy source nowadays is fossil fuel energy which has limited storage in the earth .
In 10 years time , the supply of oil and gas will fail to meet people's need .
(World's oil will run out in ten yearsthe demandavoid the predicted energy crisiaappening , engineers are expected to find a new energy source which is sustainable .
The following step is to consider all possible new energy supply source and selecting the best one .
AccNowadays , the main energy sourcee new energy supinclude nuca limited storagergy , solar energy , and geothyears' energy (Wikipedia) .
Their advantage mainly embodies in respect that they are all renewable energy source .
Among them , solar energy is thcrisesfrom happeningcause it is safer than nuclear energy and easier to be obtained than geothermal energy .
Hence , solar energy comes into our sights as an ideal energy source .
After that , engineering design process applies the engineering thsourcesand latest technology to practice , which amounts to effectively use solar energy .
For example , solar energy can be used to heat the bath water .
The whole procTheir main advantage a solar penal containing many tubes on the roof of the sourceswhere the penal can be maximally exposes to the sunlight .
Then let the bath water flows theasier to obtainbas compared tos the heat collected by the tubes .
Through heat transfer from tube to the water , bath water is heated .
Another application of solar energy is relevant to the energy generation .
Wind and falling water are actually different forms of solar energy (Harnessing direct solar energy a progress report , 2006) .
By releasing the energy stored in them , large amount of electricity is generated which can solve the electricity shortage in some regions of the world and give great support to the normal living and production activities .
the bath waterto absorbLast but not least , the engineering design process still needs gradual improvements to truly meet people'sand this is equivalent to using solar energy effectively .
higher than that of fossil fuel energy , which therefore impedes its popularization .
Hence , how to cut the copanel what engineering designer should consider about in the fupanel in ordeexposed maximallyergy utilized mThen the bath water may be let to flow
In sum , the demand for energy supply is a current need that is closely relevant to people's lives , as it is the basis for maintaining the high living standard .
Engineering design process shows that solar energy would be popularityergy sourengineering designer should consider how to cut cost in future ,duction cost .
In this way , engineering design process of utilization of solar energy can meet people's needs .
Nowadays , people are more health conscious  .
This can be seen when they are willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars on medical bills .
Doctors , drug researchers and biomedical engineers face the challenges to collaborate in this matter in order to come out with the best solution to address current health problems .
Engineers play an important role  .
People often neglect engineers when they think of health issue .
Engineers assist medical professionals such as doctors by designing medical devices such as the pace maker , defibrillator and ventilatorwhichare often used in life threatening situations  .
Their roles include handling technical difficulty of medical devices , giving advices to doctors and nurses , collaborating with clinical research personnel , liaising with hospital administrator and regulations agencies as well as ensuring a safe hospital environment .
Maintaining a safe hospital environment would  include tasks like the power cabling , performing maintenance and safety inspection .
One can see that engineers play the crucial role of delivering professional health service needed for a patient .
Many health problems cannot be addressed without the help of medical devices  Engineers are faced  with various challenges to design medical devices which are safe , efficient , accurate , serviceable , user friendly , manageable , durable and environmental compatible .
An example  is the latest medical device called the IVDD machine (Intervetebral Disc Decompression Therapy) .
It is a device that addresses the problem of lower back pain .
This idea is discovered when researchers realized that space travelers were relieved of lower back pain and their disc height were actually increased .
This valuable information were used by engineers to develop IVDD to reproduce the same effects on earth .
A design idea can spark out elsewhere .
Another  challenge faced by design engineers is the availability of technology .
Technology is often the limiting factor when it comes to designing a sophisticated medical device .
An example of this is the electrosurgical device .
The Electrosurgical device was not invented until it was realized that very high frequency of current can actually burn a tissue when the contact point is relatively small .
This idea and discovery have led to the invention of the CUSA Excel System--- a device that performs bloodless tissue cutting which is used now in every hospital in Singapore .
The design can also come from the need and request of people .
A social need often has to be addressed by engineers  .
To show an example , in this advanced and fast changing society , many working adults  , especially women have  found it extremely difficult to achieve a balance between their family and work .
Engineers have addressed this problem with an effective solution by designing the milk pump .
The milk pump allows milk storage and feeding without the presence of the mother ; and this allows them  to go to work without having to worry about breast-feeding their babies .
It is very interesting to see  how engineering ideas can come about .
There arehundreds of ways that an idea can originate  .
A design can come out  to improve  older designs  , ; or to address psychological problem in patients , such as their fear of going through surgical operation ; or  to assist medical personnel such as doctors to deliver better health service .
Other challenges faced by engineers include patenting their designs , devices testing , performance benchmarking , training of medical personnel , custom modification of devices , law's requirements , safety concerns , compatibility with other medical devices  ,durability and usability  .
The challenges faced are never ending for an engineer in order to come out with  state-of-the-art medical devices to be used currently and also in the future .
In the first place , the lead user of refrigerator is the first and most important factor that drives the dalopment of refrigerator .
Lead user can be defined as a group of people that have the greatest need towards a potential invention .
According to Hippel (cited by Rogers , 2003) , lead user plays an important role inthe refrigerator innovation-designing process , because they usually have the needs of innovations that are "well ahead of the general market" .
In the case of refrigethe refrigeratoruser can be regarded as the food businessmen in 20th century , mainly because most food would perish very fast under normal temperature .
In addition , long distance transportation of food also requires low temperature to preserve the food .
Since the lead user has such a great need on a product that could help them keep the food cool easily , refrigerator was first commercially introduced to long distance food transportation in 1900s (Bowden & Offer , 1994) .
Lead user therefore started the application of refrigerator on business .
Beside the factor of lead user , whichthe refrigeratorider as people's demand , the economic factor is also an important part that shapes thLead usersrator .
One of the evidence of this is that the use of refrigeratofornly being widespread after its price drops toyear , citedin that could be alead usersyplaynorms .
The refrigerator is influenced by the values of the norms here .
Another evidence of this among the development of refrigerator is the domination of electric refrigeratothe refrigeratore lead usersf refrigerator into the large potential market of common household , there is an ideal substitute for electric refrigerator gas refrigerator , which has a quieter operation and longer use duration (Cowan , cited by Roger , 2003) .
The reason why all of us now are using the "humingofelectric refrigerator instead of the gas one is that the cothe refrigeratorecided the electric refrigerator would bring them larger profit , and therefore they went all out to promoLead usersectric refrigerator .
So the refrigeratthe refrigerator by the potential profitability of its producer in this way .

If you want to do more in-depth research on it , please go through the related journals and websites .
As the global economy continues its search for growth , its insatiable appetite for energy has greatly diminished our non-renewable resources .
Scientists have estimated that given the current global energy consumption , we will only have sufficient oil reserves to last us for another 50 years .
Furthermore , greenhouse emissions produced from the burning of fossil fuels have led to global warming , with its impact visible from the shrinkage of polar ice caps at the Arctic region as well as the rise in global temperature .
This could eventually cause flooding of low lying areas , as well as food shortages; and it paints a bleak picture for our future generation .
Therefore , the world is turning its head towards 'green' technology as a solution to the above crisis .
Research on the field of 'green' technology has started way back in early 1950s; however , it has only started to gain momentum recently as its economic and social benefits become more recognised .
With oil prices steadily climbing towards US$100 per barrel , business cost also rises with rising energy cost .
This would lead to price inflation and could cause an economic slowdown as affordability would be a concern .
Furthermore , if no other alternative energy sources are discovered , we could face severe economic problems when we eventually run out of oil , since we need energy to run our economy .
Investing in 'green' technology would not only ensure that we will have a steady supply of energy to develop our economy but it could also be another source of revenue for countries developing such technologies; and some analysts have estimated that this industry could potentially be worth up to US$4 trillion .
Therefore , governments are pouring funds into research in this field to benefit from its economic advantages .
Next , there is a general consensus that global warming has been greatly attributed by the rise of greenhouse emissions from the burning of fossil fuels , which could have devastating and irreversible impacts .
Recently , rising temperature has caused frequent heat waves that killed a number of people across Europe .
The rising temperature also gives rise to an increase in the number of heat stroke cases and could cause a potential health issue .
Furthermore , rising temperature also results in frequent droughts which caused food shortages and aggravated the world 'hunger' problem .
More significantly , the melting of the polar ice caps and glaciers could endanger low lying areas and the rise in temperature could also cause severe imbalances in our delicate ecosystem .
This will impact all walks of life , including ours .
The world environmental system is now balanced on a crucial tipping point beyond which costly , devastating and irreversible impacts will be inevitable .
Therefore , the future of our planet lies in our hands and we must be socially responsible for our future generations .
Thus , many environmental groups have been pressuring businesses and governments for 'green' energy solutions as we  .
On top of that , governments have also been pushing for the 'green' agenda .
This is evident from the carbon tax law that is imposed by the European Union on businesses , which imposes tax businesses for the amount of carbon they produced .
Furthermore , government are also awarding incentives for companies to go 'green' and more research funds have been allocated to this new field to develop 'green' products .
This is evident from President Obama's economic plan , which includes a US$ 1 trillion package invested into the 'green' industry so that 'greener' products can be developed to ensure economic sustainability .
'Green' technology may be the main focus in this century; however , it must be noted that investing in this technology is costly and not many businesses are willing to venture into it on their own .
Therefore , scientists , businessmen and governments must work together to find a feasible solution in balancing economic growth with sustainability .
In the age of information technology and globalization , the world we live today has progressed beyond our imagination by the aid of constant improvement in technology by research and development (R&D) as well as innovation .
In one of the  article in 'Diffusion of Innovations' (2003) , he has mentioned about the introduction of battery technology in the electric vehicle by General Motors (GM) in the early 1990s .
Iinterestingly , this significant technology was initially determined by the California and Arizona state governments inadvertently so as to tackle the issue of smog levels in Los Angeles and Phoenix at that period of time .
(Rogers , 2003) 'IMPACT' , which was renamed as EV , was the pioneer name of the electric car produced by GM (Rogers , 2003) .
With the development of the electric car , the technological innovation has been continuously influenced by several factors primarily in the aspect of environmental and human factor .
Issues pertaining to environmental degradation have already begun to dominate discussions among the world leaders as well as the general population since the early 1990s .
As mentioned by Rogers (2003) , environmental factor is one of the primary issues that led to the production of the electric cars .
Electric cars were created to eradicate the ramifications caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and the smog level in the world .
According to Tyler (2009) , the Ontario Medical Association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9 ,500 premature deaths in the province each year .
Hence , it will be beneficial for the creation of the electric cars in the hope of reducing the number of deaths caused by smog .
Furthermore , leaded petrol has been commonly used by the  consumers in the past .
Depending on the methods used for generating  electricity in electric cars , they have the capability of producing very low emission of carbon dioxide .
It will be possible when more nature energy such as wind and water is used to generate electricity by the turbines compared to the burning of fossil fuels by the power plants .
Thus , with the creation of battery technology generated by electricity , mankind can place greater confidence in new technology to combat environmental issues .
Furthermore , we can not deny the fact that human factor has played a major role in changing the technological innovation of electric car .
Rogers (2003) has pointed out the power in buying interest of test drivers of the electric cars and marketing strategy by GM to create a greater attention on their electric vehicles .
In the article 'Electric cars: On the road to greener transport ?'
() , it discussed about the growing appreciation of the impact that city and regional authorities can have in making practical preparations for an electrified road transport system .
Clearly , the need of the consumers and the government actions are factors that will influence the success and improvement for those technological companies in terms of capital and avenues as well as confidence and morale of the products they sold .
, technology will not be moving in such a fast pace and may be hampered by the lack of innovation from a lower demand in researchers and engineers .
Singapore is the smallest nation in Southeast Asia , covering just over 270 square miles and with a population of roughly 4 .7million .
As compared with other innovation powerhouses , for example Japan; which has about 128 million people , Singapore has a very small population .
This leads to factors such as , a limited pool of local talents , a small local market and a lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations; all of which will affect the engineering design process .
Researching and developing a new product requires a dedicated team of talented researchers with different expertise .
Therefore , in Singapore , it is often difficult to gather such a team due to our small population , which means a smaller group of local talents .
As a result , smaller teams are formed and it inevitably increases the time spent on the whole process .
Furthermore , there could also be a lack of design ideas .
The Singapore government is well aware of this problem and has been trying to attract foreign talents to fill the void .
The final effect of having a small population in Singapore is the lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations .
This is further pointed out in the case of the Haptic Chair (Chua 2009) developed by Suranga Nanayakkara , a PhD student from the National University of Singapore .
Mr Nanayakkara had to bring the Haptic Chair back to Sri Lanka for testing because he could not get access to enough deaf children in Singapore .
The lack of testers in Singapore will hamper the fifth step of the engineering design process stated by Khandani , which is the testing and implementation of the solution .
Because of hydrogen's designs solvesthree main problems need to work out .
First , it takes up too much morprocesses for its lightweight .
Second , it escapes too fast .
Third , it is too dangerous for it's inflammably and explosively .
explosiveinflammableAs to handle these storage problems , the related areas came out of two solutioinsert 'that'Oto 'be' workedo use full-scale high-pressure hydn tanks for vehicles .
Another is to use special materials for solid-state hydrogen storait is 
the one hand , to storage hydrogen under pressure is a rather well-known technique .
However , the use of hydrogen tanks in vehicles , and in particular the challenge of using very high pressures , require advanced technology .
It needs to overcome permeation problem and pass cycling tests .
On the other hand , for solid-state hydrogen storage , it requires materials that can absorb hydrogen quickly and massively .
Furthermore , there are also certain requirements for their reaction .
Overall , these two solutions have their own advantages in different aspects; at the same time , they also have difficulties respectively .
So as to make these storerogen storage schemes feasible , a lot of experiments and tests have been done .
For the compressed hydrogen storage , many numerical modeling has been done through computational fluid dynamics tools .
It helps to better under the safproblemslications of potential accident situations .
And the experiment results came out as well .
For the cycling tests , the filling time is less than 3 minutes and the maximum pressure is 350 bar (will be increased to 700 bar in the near future) .
For the permeation tests , tanks are filled up to 700 bar and the temperatled up to at least 85c .
For the solid-state hydrogen storage , many testing and performance assessment of potential hydrogen storage materials have been done in laboratory .
Big progress has been made in this field , some new materials have been found and more waiting to be found .
Certain laboratory in European also offers services for research centers and university groups , so as to training and aspiring young .

Technological innovations created from scientific researching are created to satisfy  needs to solve  problems affecting people .
Serendipitously created innovations are actually spin-offs from the original plan of research .
Thus it is an innovation that does not solve the initial target problem but instead solves an unintended problem or need .
Although they had very different outcomes they were triggered by the same motivation to make a better world .
The birth of these two types of innovations had very similar causes , such as pressure from the society or government to cater to certain needs .
Two pieces of technology , for instance , eco-cars and warfarin were produced by scientifc research and serendipitous invention respectively .
Similarly , the creation of warfarin , the most widely used rat poison in the world , was initially motivated by the pressure from the society to find out what caused the mysterious deaths of cattle .
In the 1930s , farmers fed their cattle with sweet clover hay but these cattle were dying from internal bleeding caused by it .
Through further research , Professor K .P .Link found that the sweet clover hay contained a harmful chemical called coumarin which turned out to be a very effective rat killer , thus warfarin was bornfull stop should come after in text citation (E .M .Rogers , 2003) This type of unexpected innovation is called serendipity .
Innovations ,  , have a common motivation which is to solve surfacing problems in the world .
Electric cars and warfarin alike ,  need to be marketed and diffused for potential users to adapt .
Electric cars were marketed extensively through a word-of-mouth process (E .M .Rogers , 2003) arousing a great interest in electric cars .
warfarin was liscenced by Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) to commercial manufacturers  .
Both these innovations need to be well marketed and diffused before it can actually solve any problems .
However , the fate of dedicated research innovations and serendipitous innovations can differ greatly .
One can be almost certain that a serendipitous product will be put into use without much delay as this product is often discovered by another needy party to solve their problems in the process of the initial research .
On the other hand , products through dedicated researching were monitored by a parent organization .
For example , further development of electric cars was dismissed due to the shift of taste of the market towards the "hybrid" gas- and-electric-powered vehicles .
If this product does not provide a satisfactory amount of benefits to the parent organization , it may be dismissed despite its potential usefulness .
In conclusion , innovations are made to improve the life of the user .
No matter how these innovations come about , they have a common sense of motivation .
Through investigation of needs and problems , innovations are made accordingly but unexpected discovery of ideas will lead to innovations of a different kind .
These different kinds of innovations will face different circumstances thus a different fate .
Innovations however profitable should not be dismissed but sold to a higher platform where it could spark other ideas or satisfy needs that are not foreseen by the parent organization .
One of the top priorities of every country on this planet is to ensure the stability of their economy .
For that matter , the use of green technology is not feasible in every country .
Take for example , a country like Singapore , where there are no natural resources available and land-space constraints are always a problem .
Imagine using solar panels to provide electricity for every household ?
Given the fact that most households in Singapore share a common block , if the solar panels are fixed on the top of the buildings , will there be enough to provide sufficient electricity for the whole block , which may consist of up to eighty household users .
Given the land constraints , it is definitely a costly as well as non-feasible innovation and only time will tell if this technology can be upgraded into something that can be fitted into a society like Singapore .
Economic factors and government regulations are closely related .
Based on the Madrid article , (incorrect in-text citation) John Houghton joked with the leader of Saudi Arabia's delegate party that what he was proposing was against his country's interest , and that he should not be raising it instead .
As we all know , Saudi Arabia's source of income is mainly from the oil industry .
If households all over the world started converting to green technology , there will be a decrease in demand for fuel(since it runs the electricity needed for each household) and this will affect the country's economy .
This is a case where a country is willing to put aside government priorities for the greater issue on hand , by supporting the use of green technology .
Let us now take a look at the military demands which plays a part in shaping this technological innovation as well .
Tanks are built with the intent to destroy and provide artillery support during a war .
One way to reduce fuel consumption is to modify tanks such that they all have built-in solar panels 
In a bid to counter the issue of global warming , solutions that are socially determined such as solar panels , windmills and dams were created .
Yet the use of it has been restricted by economic factors , military demands as well as government regulations .
when innovations are clear of such plural , only then will the full benefits will  be felt .
In the recent few decades , adverse climate changes and increase numbers of natural disasters have finally made humans realize the impact of human activities on earth .
This ignited a chain of campaigns , activist groups and policies in support of reducing pollution and waste to save our planet .
This current situation may seem favorable theoretically for innovations such as the electric car industries to flourish .
However , in reality , the development process of environmental friendly electric cars depends mainly on government policies , social acceptance and cooperation with other related industries .
Decisions made by any industries or citizens in a country is heavily influenced by the policies made by the government .
In the early 1990s , the support given by the California and Arizona state governments for electric cars managed to boost sales of electric cars made by General Motors (Rogers , 2003) .
Besides giving financial aid to R&D departments which helps to initiate the start of the project on electric cars , subsides and iincentives may also be given to citizens who use electric cars which would increase the demand for more electric cars .
Such increase in demand would result in companies to increase the supply of electric cars and probably trigger new companies to enter the electric car market .
Thus this increases the rate of development in electric cars .
In conjunction with incentives for electric cars , taxes on pollution inducing cars can also be increased which will motivate people to choose electric cars over petrol cars .
These factors induced by governments decisions truly showed the instigation it has on industries and consumers alike .
Besides government influence , the survival of a new technology also depends on social acceptance of the new product .
In the case of the IMPACT electric cars , the opinion leaders  stimulated the sales and awareness of these cars (Rogers , 2003) .
Many scientific articles also state that social acceptance is increasingly being recognized as a constraining factor in innovations based on renewable energy sources (Rolf , 2006) .
Without the accession from the society , it would be difficult for the emergence of any new innovations .
This is one of the reasons why marketing strategies such as the use of promotions and advertisements is extremely important in raising the awareness and creating a need for new technologies , thus allowing a new technology to survive .
Ultimately , it is clearly shown to us that there are many factors that can deduce the rate of development of the electric car .
It is thus important for innovators to gain their government's support , get socially accepted and collaborate well with different industries .
In order for electric cars to substitute the current petrol cars , much more have to be done in the mentioned three aspects .
If these factors are not fulfilled , electric cars would  probably end up as a failed dream .
Engineering design process is the process of coming out with a system to fulfill requirements .
It is a decision-making process , in which the basic sciences , (mathematics , give other examples)}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Mathematics] , and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective .
Such engineering designs  to meet human needs .
One of the many human needs is the security aspect .
Being secure would generally mean the condition of how one feels protected against harm of any sort .
Some examples will be the physical , financial and emotional damage from an event .
The design process comprises the process of defining problems , generating solutions and selecting analyzed solutions , which helps in meeting the need of safety in technology .
In the initial stage , the process allows an engineer to identify the needs and subsequently , define the problems involved .
Thereafter , a clear definition of the problem will be reached through the many experiments and data collection done .
For example , in the development of the automobile airbag , potential safety factors contributing to the failure for the inflation of the bags were considered and re-examined throughout the design process .
Also , this is the stage whereby the criteria for the success of the products are considered .
Further emphasis is now placed in meeting the needs initially decided upon , and in this case , the security aspects .
Finally , it comes down to the decision process of selecting the analyzed solutions .
selection of solutions to any of the problems will probably be the most difficult stage in the design process .
It starts off with the analysis of every solution generated .
Product safety and liability is one of the analysis factors in determining if the solution is feasible .
This factor is to confirm that using of the design will not cause harm to the users .
For example , one of the questions you will ask yourself frequently is "What are the chances of getting injured during normal use and during the failure of the design ?"
Also , warning labels are introduced to describe the safety guidelines of the design .
Although having warning labels will not keep consumers away from getting injured from the design , it helps in informing them of the potential dangers .
However , there are limitations in the design process in meeting the needs of safety .
Firstly , the safety issues discovered were done over the period of century , in the work of thousand of practitioners .
Most of the time , an individual cannot think of all of the safety aspects of a design over few years .
Secondly , generating good solutions for safety issues require creativity and , often , risking safety in the first place to better understand it .
An instance will be the use of animals in the car crash testing before crash dummies were introduced .
Lastly , determining which safety solution is feasible comes with eexperience instead of being able to learn it from a book .
Moreover , different teams of engineers may have different points of approach regarding safety issues .
The design process has been the core behind how engineers go about handling new and upcoming problems humanity will face .
It met  many challenges once faced by people and safety was one of the challenges faced .
With better technology and science in the near future , we can definitely expect more from this process in meeting our needs in time to come .
After we entering the 21st century , our society has come into a new stage with higher productivity and efficiency , which also means that we have more energy requirement at the same time .
For centuries , our major energy came from burning the fossil fuel s;ch as coal , oil and gas .
They have higher quantityfastmbustion , but they arelowreproanducible and thesource is limited .
Wood is another energy resource which is reproducible , however , it cannot generate as much heat as fossil fuel , and we destroy the nature also .
Besides , nature is destroyed in the process . .can be reproducedreplace with 'In'Engineering design written by Khandani in 2005 , we can separathighdesign process into 5 steps .
The first step is to define the problem .
Our problem is very simple----we need more efficient resource to generate enough pr for usfuels last for long time .
At the same time , it must be easy to get and clean , we cacannot be reproducedore .
;a longpluralThe second step is to gather the related information .
In a recent research , it shows that traditional resource cannot provide energy for more than 100 years , green house phenomena
becomes more serious .
The new technology gives us manyin text citation not givenurce-is shownve energy , wind enresourceslar energy and nuclear energy .
However , in ter .sThe greenll these sources , they can only provide less than 4% of our power .
That requires engineers to find ways to maximize the efficiency of power generation .
We come to the third step , coming up with multi-solution to the problems .
As we mentioned , they are kinds of new resources to use , solar , wave and nuclear .
We must think about which one is beyond our control and which is better .
We need to follow the step two , analyze all the factors and decide which one we want to choose .
Use nature energy it really good , it is free , it can be found everywhere , such as solar and wind , the bad thing is we don't have the ability to control them .
On sunny day , we have the sun-light , how about rainy or cloudy day ?
on a Thehas becomesult , scientists choose another generation of resource----nuclearsources-wavepowerful and it can be under our control to produce energy continuouslyenergy .
The final step is to test whether the solution is executable .
After few years test , nuclear power plants work quite well .

It supports the society to move faster .
Over the years , we have seen many new technological innovations and inventions .
Some are deemed beneficial to mankind , while others are just created for the sake of businessmen to reap in business profits .
However , this technological innovation which I am describing has brought about a large change in human life .
It has also brought about much convenience and is now considered an asset to most people .
The technological innovation which I am referring to is the introduction of 3G mobile phones .
In the early 1990s ,mobile phones were first introduced to replace pagers .
Back then , mobile phones could only serve 1 basic function  , and that was just to make basic phone calls .
There was no other functions in a mobile phone .
Apart from being a device with minimal functions , the design and shape of the mobile phone back then was also very ugly .
It was because at that time , the technology was not advanced enough for manufacturers to come up with cool and sleek designs like the mobile phones nowadays .
It was also very costly to own one .
Hence , not many people were able to afford a mobile phone in the past .
However , take a look at today's society .
Mobile phones are a necessity .
Almost everyone owns a mobile phone , including a certain percentage of primary school students .
The phones which people nowadays possess also differs from the past , in terms of functions , designs and sizes .
All these transformation have been brought about due to several factors .
Firstly , the manufacturers of the modern day mobile phones recognized and acknowledged the problem of phones in the past .
As quoted by incorrect in-text citation : "The innovation-development process often begins with recognition of a problem or need ."
Manufacturers of mobile phones  found out the disadvantages and hassles of the mobile phones in the past .
As stated earlier , mobile phones back then had no other functions except for making phone calls .
Hence , if people back then required the services of surfing the internet or sending  plural , they had to rely on other device such as the computer to do it .
Unlike the 3G mobile phones which is able to perform all these functions within it , mobile phones back then were really considered unproductive and inefficient .
Time is money .
Every second wasted is equivalent to every cent lost .
Hence , in order to work in a more productive manner which saves time and bring about convenience for users , manufacturers today  have come up with 3G phones which are equipped with internet , video-capturing device and an in-bulit music player which aims to provide entertainment to the users .
Secondly , this technological innovation was brought about by technical improvements in technology .
Over the years , we can see that technology is improving and more people are able to take advantage of it .
Hence , phone manufacturers decided to take a risk by adding a few new features into the mobile phone to see whether it is acceptable in the market .
A typical example is the production of NOKIA 8310  in 2002 .
This phone was the first phone in the industry to be equipped with radio function , apart from the basic functions of a phone .
After this production , many other rival brands followed suit .
This thus proves that the society is open and adaptable to new features in the phone .
This was further echoed by the good sales results of this model .
Hence , this  sent a signal to phone manufacturersthatthe public is more than willing to accept a phone with more functions and will not even mind to replace their previous models for newer ones with added features or functions .
As a result , it gave manufacturers an incentive to keep up with the times and to  constantly upgrade their mobile phones  .
This is why we are able to see the presence/existence of the 3G mobile phones .
Economic factors also play an important role in this technological innovation .
Over the years , the production of parts for mobile phones has become cheaper .
This could be achieved as manufacturers are able to reap economics of scale as their production size increases .
Hence , as the cost is now lower , manufacturers are  more willing to produce and come up with more features to be added to the mobile phone to attract consumers to purchase it .
This is exactly the case for the production of 3G phones .
People find the 3G phone to be a useful device as it is able to perform many functions , which inevitably saves time and brings about a lot of convenience .
As it has so many functions , it will definitely attract consumers to purchase it .
Since the demand for it is so high , manufacturers will then find it profitable to increase the supply .
This thus leads to the vast production of 3G phones , bringing technology to the next level .
In conclusion , the transformation of mobile phones from a black-grey screen to one that is so highly sophiscated is indeed  remarkable .
This technological innovation cannot be achieved without the factors listed above .
I believe in the near future to come , we are able to expect more innovations and creativity  in the production of mobile phones .
factors such as economic factors , political decisions ,  technological  , advertising and even military demands can affect the development of technological innovation .
One very important technology that has been shaped by the society is the development of electric vehicle .
One of the factors that determines and shapes  technological innovation the most is the country's economic status .
When people are richer , they will want to own something such as a car to show their social status .
Electric car in the past was very expensive and only  very wealthy people could afford it .
It was a display of social standing when one is seen in an electric car .
Therefore it was more common to see people in cars in  rich countries than  poor countries .
Political factors such as government decisions and military demands could also shape technological innovation .
Before World War one , the use of automobiles were limited as there were very few roads .
During the war , there was mass construction of roads leading to suburbanization of the world making it more ideal to own an automobile .
However there was shortage of coal during the war thus making electric vehicle impractical to operate .
Therefore gasoline vehicles became more popular as governments subsidized the building of gasoline vehicles to support their war .
After the war , gasoline vehicles became the preferred choice as   .
Gasoline vehicles also seemed more durable and electric plural were considered fragile .
After people attained a certain level of standard of living they became more concerned with the environment .
They began to worry about the problem of pollution caused by gasoline plural .
Therefore governments stepped in to ensure that for the total sales of plural followed by  , 10 percent must be nonpolluting , which meant that it has to be electric car or electric/gasoline cars .
Therefore people who were more environmentally friendly began to use electric vehicles again .
The technological advancement of a country also affects the development of the electric vehicle .
A very important component of the electric vehicle is the battery .
A very powerful battery is needed to power and run the vehicle for a long time and it is only possible with advanced battery technology .
It is only natural that nobody would want an electric car that needs recharging for every few miles it travels .
According to EM Roger (2003) , in the early 1990s , the battery technology can only support the vehicle to travel for 100miles .
For every 100 miles of travelling the vehicle requires 4 hours of recharging to a 220-volt outlet .
Before  , the use of electric vehicle was very limited as the battery technology was not available or was .
There are many factors that may shape the technological innovation of the technology .
The factors may leave a positive or negative impact on the technological innovation depending on the market and how socially acceptable the technology is at that point of time .
Once such example of a technology that has been shaped by it users would be the electric vehicle .
Therefore the society also plays an important role in technological innovation .
engineering design recently has been implemented in many of Asia-Pacific countries , including Indonesiaas well As a big country with a huge amount of population , implementing a new aspect will not be done easily .
There are two main problems hampering engineering design; consequently they  affect some stages of this process .
One of the educational problem occurs in every level of academic institution in Indonesia .
The system is not designed to educate students to explore their creativity .
Students are  fed by materials given by the teacher and they are most likely not allowed to learn things in their own way .
For instance , elementary students must follow the steps of solving mathematical problems given by the teacher; otherwise they will not get the full score or the problem will be marked as wrong . .
This problem affects the solutions generating process in engineering design .
Since they only have one way to solve an obstacle , they will be fearful of problems .
They will not take any risks to find another possibility for the solution of given obstacles .
Khandani (2005) stated that creative people are needed in this stage as they can observe details and at the same time , see the whole picture of the problem .
The second problem is the limited amount of qualified human resources and funds .
In fact , there are a  as a result , Indonesia is running out of qualified human resources .
Moreover , this country's state is not in a proper condition .
Indeeda global crisis makes it even worse .
Thus , the condition of resources in Indonesia affects the  stages of engineering design .
The small amount of human resource (HR) affects not only  technical stages , but also the economic and market analysis stages .
As skilled engineers can hardly  be found , the technical problems  will certainly In addition , communities will not easily accept any new technology .
Their conservative thoughts will hamper the sale of plural .
Many good inventions never get produced because the manufacturing costs exceed what people will pay for the product itselfcomes after in-text citation (Khandani , 2005) Therefore , this problem will put the economic and market analysis stages in difficulties .
incorrect in-text reference) , product safety is an important stage of engineering design , which assures that usage of the design , will not cause any injury to humans .
Khandani (2005) specified that the safety issue can extend to include property and environmental damage .
As we know , recently ,  are a lot of fatal accidents have occurred in Indonesia; for example , plane crash and collapsed railway .
Further plural showed  that they were caused by lack of safety and liability tests .
They minimize these tests because they do not have sufficient funds to support the tests .
In brief , as Indonesia implements engineering design , it also faces two main problems .
They are educational and resource problems Consequently , these problems also impact the stages of engineering design , such as generate solutions , product safety and liability , technical and economic analysis .
Generating multiple solutions stimulates engineers' creativity and provides ifaced withon to originate aresultingogical breakthrough .
As Khandani(20ioned in the article "stable developmentrforess" , it igenerationto investigate the existiions , utilize creativity to propose new methods and synthesise all the fresh aits optimumpotential .eas to come uthat there isith a unique and valuion .
Such anach enables engineers to think oureducinghe bounder and challenge the old conventions , and subsequently forges innovative breakthroughs in fields , like transportation system constructitowardshave hardly experienced any remarkabtestingdvancement for decades .
Following the solution generation step , analyzing and selecting a design ensimpetus the ultimate solution suits best for implementation .
This crucial procedure places all related circumstances into consideration and evaluates the newly-born solutions using a systematic technique (Khandani , 2005) .
Being a project that is closely related to social economy and other critical issues , establishing an efficient energy transportation system urges engineers to identify the overall effectiveness of a certain forgeon based on the assessment in diffeesuch as ,ields .
The systesystemseand constructionproach applied in the engineering design process then facilitates engineers to generate a reliable judgement of the solutions to a large extent .
Lastly , the testing state places the final solution into a real-world practice for further improvement althobest suitsctions exist .
This step allows the solution to be exposed to the real-world variation and yields an even more trustworthy appraisal .
It is also a moment for engineers to investigate the underlying problems in their design and then implement corresponding modification and improvement .
Nevertheless , simulating the real-world variation in accomplishing a huge project like constructing an efficient energy transportation system cannot be fully comprehensive and creating a full-scale prototype of the system is even more unrealistic .
As a result , the effectiveness and some concealed weakness of thable to be fully traced during the test .
will not weaknessesto createTo sum up , although imperfection in the accuracy of testi practice in the real worldsolution geneimprovement .lAlthoughd testing stepexists ,nthisering design processes play key roles in forging innovative breakthroughs , verifying the feasibility of the design and upgrading the final solution while designing an effective energy transportation system .
Hopefully , the engineering design processes can be further polished in a short term so as to return engineering designs with higher quality .
Early Unitetates government policy and cold war situation shaped the invention of GPS .
In 1960 , GPS was introducethe innovationpartment of Defense to track down its marine .
Towards its development to today's technology , the policy maker played an important part in it .
In 1973 , when the army , air force , and navy each had its navigandtion system , the department of defense once again came in and unified the technoly .
Furcaseore ,The Global94 , as the cold war had ended , the US government then decided to fully open the GPS for public use .

It raised marinesfopolicy makers have played an important role in developing the GPS technology to be what it is today .
reed to partially open the GPS for public use .
Soon after this , when the surveying market boomed in 1980s , the demand for GPS and the money generated also contributes to the development of GPS for civilian use .
Towards its development , GPS technology has few setbinks .
The most notable setback is at 1979 , when the economic situation in US was bad .
The US Department of Defenthe needt the development budget of GPS by 30% .
As a result , the initial 24 satellites constellaThe United Statesas reduced to 18 .
Furthermore , the phase II (Block II) project was cancelled .
The development of advancThe 1980'sechnology mainly was carried out by generated from ittfurthercontributed , when the economic situation was bad , the government agencies would be affected .
The example also shows how economy and politics are interrelated in determining an innovation .

The GPS would not bThe United Statespossible to be commercialized had the situation was different .

Plagiarism means usinfast developingethhumaning sources (Oshima 2006) .
The problem of plagiarism is fairly serious that becomesarge n university stukindss do not do the academic work such as research reports and scientific essaywithout creativity and innovation the tasks are never easy for engineers .it their "work" perfunctorily , never to mention about the copyrights of the original researchers or writers .
Plagiarism is not only harmful for the original reseThe engineeringwriters , but also an impediment for univThe engineeringents to gain creativity and innovative skills .
Plagiarism makes university  ,dents or even graduated researchers lazy:t their own ideas .
After they search out the information for their academic use , they simply follow the original train of thought and give up thinking about a different solution on th;ir own .
Since doing as the experts do will receive a high mark while working on their own ideas may not ,problemstudents "smartly" choose to plagiarize .
However , such choice becomes harmful in the long run as the innovative skills of university students or researchers deteriorated .
Plagiarism significantly hinders the process of steps after gathering pertinent information in the engineering design process , which is about generating , analyzing , selecting , testing and implementing solutions .
For example , an engineering student who is doing a designing project do not have to analyze or select solutions , which is the fourth step in the engineering design process , if he wants to plagiarize from other articles .
Therefore , it cuts away all the experience of encountering problems during the solution analyzing and selecting and all the innovative skills he can gain from the process .
Instead , plagiarism directly gives the final and the best solution for the student , which seems good for him but quite harmful for the entire academic community .
If everyone plagiarizes to do their academic work and only tries his luck to get higher marks , the problem of plagiarism may result in a more serious situation , that is , very few students graduated from universities can manage to develop innovative products as engineers .
graduatingthe final studentsPlagiarismselecting phaseremovesdoes notoffive step processwill deterioratechoicesAnother serious problem that hampers the engineering design process for innovations is the insufficiency of scientific fund support .

If the university cannot afford engineering students to do furthchooseeto searchor create an entire product , all the efforts that have been made in thmentioning steps problem has significant impacts on the step of testing and implementitosolutions in the design process , during whis alsoan engineer may encounter different problems and choices .
Without the process of testing and implementing , students cannot gaigraduateractical skills or develop their innovative ideas for impobtainre , the insufficiency of scientific fund support also significantly hinders the engineering design process for innovations .
implementationstep inimpacthas aAlthough the academic community in my home country is facing many problems hampering innovations , the development of the science and technology has never been pulled down .
I believe that one day all the problems are solved and we get strong enough in academic field .
Technology is the application of scientific knowledge in industry and aims to improve our standard of living .
Its effects can be felt in almost every corner of the world and in our daily lives .
Technological innovations can range from household appliances to industrial equipment , they can be classified into two categories - research-based inventions such as the laptop computer like  Toshiba and serendipitous inventions such as the "Post-it" notes developed by 3M .
Although these innovations are different in nature , they are common in many ways .
The main difference between a technology which was developed via research and a technology which resulted from a serendipitous discovery is the extent of the presence of luck .
It is a common knowledge that chance often is a factor in making a discovery (Miller , 1998) .
A serendipitous discovery of technology by its name , suggests that it is an unexpected outcome of a search for solutions to another problem .
It is accidental by nature .
For instance , Dr . Spence Silver , a 3M scientist , intended to produce a super strength adhesive , produced a weak adhesive instead (Connell , 2001) .
This failure was converted into a successful product when a 3M researcher , Art Fry used the bonding agent to create "Post-it" pads (Rogers , 2003) .
On the other hand , a research-based technology is built upon the problem that the inventor has intended to solve .
There is no de-railing of the initial plan .
For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi saw a need for a portable personal computer in Japan ad invented the first Toshiba laptop computer after several years (Rogers , 2003) .
when comparing the two technologies , it is clear that that an element of luck is more present in the former invention than in the latter one .
Nonetheless , luck is not the only determining factor for the birth of a technology , whether it is developed via research or resulting from a serendipitous discovery .
There are other contributing factors such as the efforts of the inventors and their determination to succeed that leads to the discovery of the technology .
The smallpoxlarity of smallpox vaccine and penicillin is that they are life-saving discoveries in medicine .
In the eighteen century before Jenner discovered smallpox vaccine , smallpox have been a widespread killer disease .
Many infants and young children were killed by smallpox at that time .
(Scott , 1996) After Jenner discothe smallpoxe smallpox vaccine , the death rate of smallpox was closehave savedzero .
Jenner's signihave beenimilestonesas praised by the ledd United States Present Thomas Jefferson in hi letter ;Letter to Dr . Edward Jenner On is Discovery of the Small Pox Vaccine' .
(Jefferson , 1806) Due to Jenner's discovery , the World Health Assembly officially announced that smallpox was eradicated in 1980 .
(Scott , 1996) Penicillin is an antibiotic that prevent the growth of bacteria and cure infections .
It is the first and most widespread antibiotic to date .
Before penicillin was discovered , many people died of infections .
After penicillin was discovered , the death rate of infection was largely decreased .
During World War II , hundreds of thousands injured people were saved by penicillin .
bycuresAnother similarityThe smallpoxse two discoveries is that they are landmark in medicine .
Smallpox vaccine is the first vaccine that people used to improve immuThe smallpox a certain disease .
After that , people started to develop vaccines to protect people from diseases such as hepatitis B vaccine , BCG and pertussis vaccine .
Similarly , penicillin is the first antibiotic people used to cure infections .
After the discovery of penicillin , people realize that there is a Presidentcies of medicine , antibiotic , which can kill bacteria and researhis are conducted to develop more antibiotics .
More and more antibiotics are discovered and put on production like aureomycin , erycin and chloromycetin .
Both of the two discoveries are milestones that people began to epreventsnew areas to fight diseases .
Although smallwasx vaccine and penicillin have those similaritlandmarks prothe field of medicinendThe smallpoxpment of twasse two discoveries are different .
Based on the observation that cowpox prevents smallpox , Jenner began to research into using cowpox to build immunity against smallpox .
After teis theory , he succesiscovered smallpox vaccwase .

In contrast , penicillin ithis resulted in research being conductedovery .
Fleming found penicillin almost by accident .
Retuwered from his holidproducedory in 1928 , Fleming found some penicillium notanum in some lab dishes .
The penicillium notanum can prevent the growth of bacteria .
He named this anti-bacteria chemical penicillin .
(RSC , 2009) However , this discovery was not put on production directly .
Until 1940s , more than ten years after Fleming's discovery , penicillin went into mass production .

However , the procedure and development of these two discoveeresearchingfferent .
from theuviewpointted in the article "The Generation of Innovation" (Rogers , 2003) , the process of how the refrigerator got its hum is a typical instance of social construction of technology .
During this process , gas refrigerators wth no noise were gradually r electric refrigerators under the influence of social factors .
These factors mainly include the investment of companies , need of customers as well as purpose of saving energy .
First of all , the main reason for this innovation is that the major corporations such as General Electric , General Motors , Kelvinator , and Westinghouse consider that investing in electric refrigerators instead of gas refrigerators would be able to produce more profit (Rogers , 2003) .
Although it was once expected that gas refrigerators would dominate the market , the investment of maineedsrporations has determined the dominant role of electric refrigerators .
In this case , the technological innovation has been driven by the interest of its investors and developed for greater profit for companies .
Furthermore , the evolution of refrigerators is alswasshaped the demand of customers .
Refrigerators with better mechanism as well asworking capacity aconsideredded byto investet .
The need of customers affected the interests and decisions of investing companies , hence influence the development of refrigerators as well .
In fact , some of the interests of corporations like General Electric are driven by the demand of customers .
What the customers are willing to buy gave rise to the preference of companies .
Production decisions are made to meet the market demand and maximize the profit , and the root of the decisions lies in customers' expectation .
Last but not the least , the consideration of saving energy also accounts for the development of this innova better Using electricity in refrigerators instead of gas has changed the mechneedsm inside the product , which is a significant technological progress .
And the drivinfluencing beyond this is the purpose of saving energy and protecting limited resources on our planet .
The limited resource is a social customers demandsncern of both customewereand producers who facilitate the invention significantly .
Government policies also interfere to advocate energy saving .
This is instance of social factors that have largely influenced and shaped the technological innovation .
whereonewho ,toofresourcesLimitedIn conclusion , the new generation of refrigerators with no noise is a typical technological innovation which is shaped by social factors .
The decisions by investing corporations , the demand of customers , consideration of energy saving as well as government policies have played behindant rolesfor the this revolution and the social construction of technology is well reflect
Many products in the world did not appear from nowhere but , they were made based on the creativity of engineers in  response to human needs .
For instance , the invention of the telephone was to help people with long distance communication; airplanes were made for shortening travel time; wheel chairs enables the handicapped to travel about .
Creativity will not stop in one place; it will move on from time to time to improve  appliances or devices .
Therefore , it would be more appropriate now if the engineer design process moves toward human health , in terms of biomedical invention such as artificial heart devices .
Based on Khandani (2005) , there are five phases of design process which will be elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs .
The first step of defining the problem is very important in order that an engineer would not lose his or her way when finding a solution .
Therefore , it is necessary to identify the need from this design activity and make a problem statement to  ease the gathering of information choosing a solution and conducting an experiment .
In the case of artificial heart devices , materials used and size may be defined as the problems .
The next step will be gathering information .
A survey related to the existence of similar products should be done to prevent issues of plagiarism .
Finding out the latest product is also required as room for improvement could be done .
Material being used for an artificial heart device is very important as human blood  carries nutrients to body cells  hence; , it should not be toxic as toxins could enter the bloodstream .
Size is also one of the factors to be considered 
After collecting useful information , multiple solutions can be generated and this is the third phase of the design process .
These solutions could be a combination of  strengths from existing products or new ideas to counter the weaknesses of existing products The latest artificial heart device is made of polyether-based polyurethane plastic and able to withstand 100 ,000 beats a day (Ditlea , 2002) .
Few solutions could be listed based on this detail such as finding new material with better quality and improving the design such that beating time per day is increased .
After listing different solutions that can be tried out , it proceeds to the forth step: analyzing and selecting a solution .
Every solution made is analyzed in terms of availability , possibility functions of product , biocompatibility , and mechanical strength .
Most  engineer design products would factore cost into consideration . 
The final step is implementation including testing , building and producing the solution based on the design problem .
Prototyping is important to  provide a clearer picture of the real product .
It allows engineers to observe and point out the weaknesses to be improvedin order that , it could be re- designed until a reasonable solution is reached .
Documentation is also necessary for checking process and patent application .
Finally it reaches testing and verification stage .
This may be the most difficult part for bioengineering design product as nobody would be eager to risk his/her life .
Hence , the testing result will take some time to have conclusion .
In conclusion , the five steps of the engineer design process mentioned above has been organized in such a way to express  creativity in the product designed for human need .
Although some products may take a longer time such as the artificial heart device .
An engineer should not be afraid of taking risk and time  .
It would bring great contentment if the product is fully used and is able to save human life .
Technological determinism is the belief that technology causes changes in society (Rogers , 2003) .
However , this belief is fast losing credibility in the more educated and affluent world now .
As people get more educated , they are able to shape the technology at their disposal to adapt it to themselves .
Hence the reverse happens and technology is shaped socially to a much larger extent than it was in the past .
How technology is shaped socially is dependant on the following factors , namely , economic , military and consumer demands .
The first commercial laptop that was ever created , IBM PC Convertible , weighed at a hefty 5 .4 kg !
It was sold for $3 ,500 .
From the weight of the machine we could see that it was not exactly as portable as it claimed to be .
Hence the sales were poor in the initial years .
The same went for the other first laptops from other companies such as Toshiba and Apple computers .
Since then , the companies that manufacture laptops started doing intensive research and development to improve their products so as to create a product that people would be willing to buy .
Hence from this we can see  how technological development was shaped by economic factors .
The low demand for the first laptop caused the companies to suffer losses in the business and thereby forced them to work harder to develop it to be more commercially viable  ,to boost their sales to survive as there are many competitors in this field of portable computing technology .
Today the laptops weigh only a small fraction of their predecessors but with greater computing power .
Hence the sales of the laptops increased substantially and the companies made profits .
But they are constantly driven to improve their products so that they can gain an edge over their competitors to increase their profits .
Given the rapidly changing world , modern militaries are also adopting new technologies that are commercially available such as the laptop in order to execute their missions with higher efficiency and effectiveness .
But not all commercially available products can withstand the rigorous demands of the military which requires the laptops to be tough , water- resistant and have a long battery life .
For example , the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are currently undergoing transition to a 3rd Generation (3G) Army , they are equipping their frontline soldiers with laptops so as to communicate more effectively their position , situational awareness as well as to provide important battle information to the command centre which will be able to oversee the battle field and execute decisions at greater speed and efficiency .
This is vital as the speed at which information is communicated can determine if the mission will succeed .
Hence they adopted the Panasonic toughbooks that provides rugged reliability suitable for the most demanding missions .
The demands by not just the SAF but also other big militaries around the world also shaped at how the laptop was able to adapt to be just as reliable in the extreme conditions .
Moreover , the technology that resulted from developing the toughbooks can be applied and used to some extent in the commercial world .
Hence this shows how technology is shaped militarily .
With the increasingly globalised world and widespread travelling by people , there is greater mobility .
People can now be travelling to other countries to work .
Hence people also will want greater mobility in their computers , which is why the laptop was invented in the first place .
With the laptop , people can now be working anywhere and anytime , not be chained to their work desks as their desktop computers are not portable at all .
So the companies are competing to develop laptops that are lighter , smaller and pack in more functions and computing power so as to meet consumer demands .
People can now work on the move and be more efficient by multitasking .
But people have unlimited wants , they are not content with just the laptop with is considered quite bulky at times , thus they demanded laptops that are smallerand lighter .
Just recently , a new class of computing devices emerged .
They are the netbooks .
They are much smaller , lighter than the laptops and can be fitted into small bags comfortably .
They cater to the increasingly mobile workforce with can work anyway on the go as they are able to surf the internet and work on documents .
This functionality comes only at a fraction of the cost and weight of the laptops .
Hence there are people willing to buy the netbooks .
Hence this shows that the consumer factor also influenced the development of laptops to a great extend .
The laptop is indeed an important technology that is shaped by economic  , military factors , and consumer demands .
These are the main reasons behind the social forces that shape development of this technology .
Companies will want to create a product that is demanded by the world so as to make profits to survive .
And people's wants and desires are unlimited so as to fuel this continuing development of this technology .
Perhaps the future laptops will shrink to the size of palmtops but with greater computing power as people demanded laptops that can be fitted into their pockets .
the technicalElectric cars have a very obvious shortage in their technique design .
The electric cars invented in 1990 did not have a powerful battery .
Due to the limitation of its weigh , sipopular battery technology , the battery used in the electric cars at that time was limited to a range of 100 miles (Rogers ,2003) .
As a result , they are not convenient enough .
Instead , Hydrogen fuel cell was brought up to substitute the electric battery .
Economically , the consumers , the car companies and stechnicalompanies were not very satisfied about electric cars .
In order to improve the air condition , consumers hadweightpend more and compromised on limited range of electric cars .
And since the electric cars did not have engines and some other complements , the car companieswereuld no longer benefit from the maintenances of those cars .
As for the oil companies , apparently , they could not make money from oil , if all the engine cars were substituted by electric cars .
Moreover , the main stream of the government did not approve of this inventor .
Although the California and Arizona state government came up with the mandating that "at least 10 percent of the total salea limitedtomobile companies would have to be nonpolluting"(Rogers ,2003) , they had to cancel the command since the electric vehicles failed to act in the public interest .
Moreover , the federal stepped in this case to oppose the California and Arizona state government .
Federal GovernmentFurthermore , other social factors contribute to the non-adoption of invention cars .
The consumers had many ambivalence and unwillingness at that a mandatemple , some consumers still had doubts about this new technology .
Since electric vehicles are very light , they may be quite fragile when they are hit by heavy vehicles .
In conclusion , technology , economicontributedal and social factors result in the non-adoption of electric cconcerns and were unwilling at that timee failure of the electric cars that we should not only focus on the one part of factors to developwerenew technology .
Oncould by satisfying all ifneeds weredifferent aspects can a new technology survive and be accepted .
In the article "The Generations of Innovations" written by E .M . Rogers , social construction of technology is defined as technology that is shaped by social factors .
In this essay , I will use the invention of internet as an example to show how this important technology was determined initially by a specific group of users , mainly government and military personnel , and later commercialized into what it is today .
Unlike the development of some inventions like Post-its which was resulted from serendipity , the internet was a strategic innovation that was initiated by the government and developed by their researchers .
In order to understand the reasons for the need of Internet by The U .S . Government , we will need to understand the historical background during the middle of the twentieth century .
During the Cold War period ,  world politics was divided between democracy and communism .
In the 1950s , the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb resulting in the world having two nuclear super powers that were conflicting with each other over world political dominance and military superiority .
This inevitably sparked off the arms race .
Meanwhile , the growing dominance of The Soviet Union over Eastern Europe also threatened the position of the U .S . as the world's most powerful nation .
A series of policies containing containment and deterrence of the rising influence of communism were implemented .
The Cold War and the arms  race stimulated the research and development of all technological fields in the U .S . including improving communication infrastructure between the government and military planners .
One very important strategic issue that the government of U .S . had to ponder was maintaining command and control between the political and military leaders in the event of an attack by The Soviet Union .
The communication infrastructure that was vulnerable to any attacks via the use Inter Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) on the U .S .
The cities phone lines were dependent on a centralized system of above ground lines .
The Department of Defense needed a more secure and indestructible communication system to survive a nuclear war and so it funded the development of a network that would be indestructible and have technological capabilities to launch a counter-offensive against enemies of the United States .
In 1961 , Paul Baran , who is a member of RAND Corporation , was commissioned by the Department of Defense to do research on networking .
Baran and his colleagues developed an entirely different method of communication called packet switching .
The principle behind packet switching was that data would be broken down into datagrams or packets that were labeled to indicate the origin and the destination of the information .
The packets would then be forwarded from one computer to another computer until the information arrived at its final destination computer .
The packets would be encoded as electrical signals , light , or radio waves and transmitted via copper cables , fiber-optic strands and the ether; which consists of microwave , satellite , or radio transmissions .
This was an important part of a computer network .
In situations where packets were lost at any given point , the message could be resent by the original user .
As a result of decentralization , packet switching , unlike the telephone system , will not break down when one part of the network system is faulty since the packets can be rerouted until it arrives at its intended destination .
In order to destroy this decentralize communication system , all the channels of transmission will have to be destroyed .
Three years later , J .C .R .
Licklider , a researcher under Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) proposed that computers were the keys to network communication .
With the inclusion of computers as a link to network communications , a system of protocol had to be created to standardize network communication .
The interface message processor (IMP) became part of the actual language that linked computers to the network; it defined how they would connect , route and verify the messages received .
Thus the IMPs , together with the telephone lines , and data sets would constitute a 'message-switching network .'
The protocols would define the communications formats between the IMP's and became the format through which all the computers in a network were connected to .
The following two decades witnessed the improvisation and spread of networking .
Network Control Protocol (NCP) was developed by VInt Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1973 to allow network communication between people using different hardware .
Consequently , networks were able to connect to different parts of the world .
For instance in 1973 , the U .S .  connected its network to both the United Kingdom and Norway .
In the mid 1970's , networks began to spread to research universities across America and internationally .
The governments of France , Japan , Germany and other European nations also developed research networks .
In the early 1980s , there was a growing demand for network usage by researchers and students .
However , it was costly to be part of the ARPANET because ARPANET had a tight control on the usage of network .
The frustrated Duke students Tom Trusscott and James Ellis , and Steve Bellovin , a student  , created Usenet .
Within a few years , there were more postings and news groups than the system could handle .
By 1982 , there were hundreds of postings a day to as many different news groups .
Usenet was much more popular than ARPANET .
Although there were over 230 ARPANET sites in 1982 , Usenet took less than two years to reach that number .
The popularity of Usenet was due to the fact that it was inexpensive and provided semi-anonymous communication through which people could share their ideas .
This resulted in hundreds of discussion groups , each discussing different subjects  , which range from politics to daily life experiences .
The explosive growth of network usage resulted in all of the networks switching from NCP to TCP/IP in 1983 .
The new TCP/IP protocol was able to deal with the increased electronic traffic of the developing Internet .
In 1987 , the National Science Foundation , which had funded a program earlier in 1984 to create national infrastructure to provide a variety of academic institutions access to a larger national academic network , backed away from funding the Internet and allowed giant corporation such as IBM , MCI and Merit Corp to manage and support the infrastructure it had funded .
It was not until 1993 when the Internet was transformed from government-funding to commercialization by private sectors .
With the creation of World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN , the European Nuclear Research Centre , the World Wide Web opened up a new era of individualism and creativity that would change the information age once and for all .
In conclusion , it was the historical background during the era of the Cold War that prompted the US government to consider new ways of creating indestructible communication to enable the political and military leaders to communicate with each other during a nuclear attack .
Through the works of brilliant researchers , the Internet , which was limited to a few users at first , was improvised to accommodate increase electronic traffic and finally commercialized to be available to each and individual  .
Technology is an act of designing and inventing of a tool that will either solve a problem recognized or fulfill a particular human need , in other words it is a product of society .
According to Rogers (2003) , the success of the invention is full of uncertainties as the responses from other parties involved , such as the society or government , are not predictable .
If the product is not accepted by consumers or widely used , the product has failed socially .
There are many factors that contribute to the failure of a product socially and one of them is the economic factor which monopolizes the consumer market .
The case study on Cowan (1985) is a representative example of a failure of a product due to economic factors , in which an aggressively advertised product was preferred over the other that could be more advantageous .
Cowan (1985) discussed  the two types of refrigerators developed , the electric refrigerator and the gas refrigerator .
The gas refrigerator should have been the preferred product  since it brings along overwhelming advantage but it turned out to be otherwise .
The extensive promotion of the electric refrigerator , whose research and development was funded by corporations , influenced the choice of consumers since the gas refrigerator was not widely promoted and made known to consumers .
Such cases are typical examples of how a technological invention is shaped by economic factors , in which the technology made available to the consumer was directed by earned profits of corporations instead of offering the one that benefits the consumer most .
One of the reasons behind such situations is probably due to corporations' fear of losing their share of the market and thus suppressing new technology to minimize chances of it happening .
This , however , affects consumer's acceptance of inventions directly , in which the choice made will then be economically driven rather than based on the usefulness of inventions .
Another contributing factor of the success of invention will be the buying power of the consumer , which very much depends on the economic situation then .
In times of economic recession , there is a lower tendency for consumers to purchase the more expensive refrigerator when both have the same primary functions that is to store up food at low temperature .
For that , the competition among corporations and the extent of price slashing they are willing to offer , such that they still earn   considerable profit may help improve consumer's acceptance of their product .
Therefore , it can be concluded that functionality may not be the only determining factor to the success of technology since it may not be the priority of consumer's concern , but rather how the technology is commercialized and diffused to the public or society .
As such , technology nowadays needs not only to prove its functionality but also spend efforts in creating  awareness since it is up to the consumers , who come in contact with many advertisements in their life and is eventually conditioned , to make  decisions .
Due to the flourishing of construction industries over the years ,  construction industries worldwide consume resources equivalent to more than what  nature is able to produce on Earth .
at this rate of consumption , our environment will not be able to supply us with sufficient resources years down the road .
In order to compensate and preserve the e , there is a need to implement a system whereby waste construction materials can be treated and re-used .
This implementation will help: protect the environment by controlling the amount of resources consumed; reduce the cost of manufacturing and importing  raw materials; reduce the cost of construction ;andven maximise economic advantages .
Therefore ,  introducing  the and reusing of construction waste materials is wise construction practice and ais beneficial to  contractors , owners and  communities .
Most of the discarded materials are actually valuable commodities; such as concrete , wood , asphalt , metal and cardboard , and can be recycled into new products .
These materials make ?
up to 80 percent of discarded materials .
In fact ,  recycling and reusing these materials can benefit the environment , the construction business and the economy
The process of recycling  construction waste involves separating and reusing recoverable and useable waster construction materials during demolition .
The advantage of this treatment system is that it only produces low-cost recycled materials , it  also produces new composite  materials with better characteristics .
However , a considerations should be taken into account during the design process .
During the remodelling of buildings , most construction waste goes into landfillsl , hence theincreasing burden on  landfill loading .
This waste may be high in chemical content which results in water and soil pollution .
Whereas some can be recycled and re-used as similar material  , others are reconstituted to other forms of usable materials .
Moreover , recycling which needs reprocessing may not be economically feasible because it requires a facility using recycled resources to be located near the source .
Thus , site separation is an important step for recycling  construction waste .
Although initially it requires extra effort and training , once separation habits are set up , it can be done at very low cost .
Khandani (2005) described engineers as creators as well as problem solvers who invent and design .
He also stated that engineering design is a process of creative thinking , of turning ideas to physical products .
IT it is also a system which is created by human effort and does not suddenly appear from nowhere .
to fulfil the needs of humans and to help humans ?
governments ?
people ?
solve the planet's environmental problems . .
In fact , re-cycling waste construction materials is just the same , it is a technology used to support human needs for living by building infrastructures and helping to solve difficulties by cutting down the consumption of natural resources to save the Earth .
The world today is changing continuously causing  it to face many global challenges and problems .
As a result , technologies are constantly being constantly developed in order to response to human needs .
Once the needs are identified , ideas have to be developed through research .
an example of such a technology is the development of tomato- harvesting machines as an agricultural scientist at the University of California at Daris predicted that there will be a serious shortage of the labour in California (Rogers , 2003) .
However , technologies can also be created through serendipitous discovery .
As the name implies , it is a new discovery of a valuable idea by accident .
One example is the discovery of  Penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming when he realized the presence of an antibacterial agent while researching on influenza .
This lead to the birth of the Penicillin which is widely used as an antibiotic (Mary Bellis , About .com) .
Although the two technologies were created from a very different approach , both underwent the innovation-development process where the final product could be marketed .
According to Rogers (2003) , the innovative development process consists of all the decisions , activities , and their impacts that occur from recognition of a need or a problem through research , development , and commercialization of an innovation , up until the diffusion and adoption of the innovation by users  .
Therefore it is extremely time-consuming to develop a new technology .
For a technology that is deliberately invented , it generally requires a much longer time frame as compared to  fortuitous discoveries .
This is because inventors have to generate multiple solutions to solve  the problem identified .
Much research has to be prepared so that the best solution can be found .
In the case of the tomato harvesting machine , there are plenty of factors that need to be considered .
If the tomatoes have to be harvested by a machine , they have to breed hard tomato varieties so that they will not be crushed .
However in the case of the serendipitous discoveries , identifying a problem or need as well as selecting the best solutions are eliminated .
Hence the total time consumed is much shorter compared to the technology developed through research .
However , no matter whether it is created intentionally or unintentionally , both require the ability to think creativity and innovatively as well as some coincidence and luck .
In the case of a deliberate technology , inventors must not restrict themselves to only one solution but expose themselves to the various possible solutions .
These solutions have to be analyzed and researched further until the best solution is found .
If luck is present with coincidence , the best solution will be generated in a shorter time .
similarly the person must have the ability to view things from a different perspective , have sufficient background knowledge about the serendipitous discoveries , and have some luck for serendipitous discoveries to take place .
Since fortuitous discovery often occurs while research is carried out in a totally unrelated field , scientists must be able to identify the technology that was come by accidentally .
In conclusion , the  of inventing a new technology is to meet the needs of humans .
Regardless of how technologies are developed , they will definitely benefit people .
Developing a new technology usually requires plenty of time , therefore creative thinking and innovation is required .
In addition , luck and coincidence must be present for the discovery to happen at the right time , right place and to the right person .
With all these factors , the time taken to develop a new technology will be shortened .
the marketbusinessSocial factors include economic factors , military demands , government regulations and so on .
Usually , a new technology will be tested by more than one factortaskthe results will directly affect the future of the nnewspapers everyday
refrigeratorsThe example of refrigerator competition iconsumer needsthat whether to adopt a new technology depends on other social factors other than consumers' needs .
To continue the previous example , the reason why gas type lost in the competition is due to the high research and development cost , several dominant cooperation thought electrical refrigerators would make more profit , then they invested large amounts of money in producing electrical refrigerator and developing market .
The aggressive occupancy of market compelled smaller companies which prefer producing gas refrigerator give up .
In this way , gas refrigerators were washed out of the market .
to give uprefrigeratorsthe marketthe marketWhether a new technology will be popularshowsly depends on more than one factor .
Moor nottly , they wive reverse responses after consumerg in different angles , but people can still make decisionthe gasased on the more crucial factor or the for they concerned the most .
Apacostsroing cost , other factors like environmental problems , militsodemands and government regulations alsintoaffect the adoption ofrefrigeratorsology .
To sum up , in the generation of innovation , the development of technology is not just technologically decisive , but more socially decisive .
When ientists or enterprisers decide to adopt a new technology , the social factors will directly affect their deare concernedA good technology withconsumer needs not productionmcostsnce , we can conclude that social factors can determine the fortune of a new technology .
The earth is experiencing water deficit .
Unlike burning forests or volcanic eruptions , the falling of water tables throughout scores of countries cannot be readily photographed , it is largely invisible .
However , in recent years , this has been observed by an increasing number of droughts , dried-out wells , and unavoidably , a change in climate pattern across the globe .
We are now consuming water that belongs to the future generations .
The high demands and the misuse of water are increasing .
Man has since been working , vastly through engineering efforts , to manage water resources .
According to Khandani (2005) , engineering is the creative process of turning abstract ideas into physical representations (products or systems) .
In the last few years , engineers have indeed innovatively managed and minimized water deficit in many countries by conveying solution ideas into engineering designed products and systems .
Throughout centuries , one of the most remarkable engineeringstructures or products to manage water has been the design of a large water storage tank , otherwise known as a dam .
Man built dams to solve flooding problems and to keep water for other uses .
As science and technology advanced , brilliant engineers began designing dams that were not only for flooding control and storing of water , but were  to generate energy .
Some of the latest dams of our time can store water like a reservoir , prevent flooding occurrence , generate energy by means of water pressure ,  These are  evident through Singapore's 'Marina Barrage' .
It is not just simply a dam , but also a reservoir , and it serves as a tourist's attraction for leisure and sports .
Water treatment has largely been classified being engineering process which turns used-water into clean , acceptable water for end use , and sometime even drinkable water .
Dirty water is usually collected through piping systems from lakes , drains and household , and transported to a treatment plant .
In the treatment plant , the dirty water is separated from solid particles by settling and filtration .
After which they will be treated and purified by various sub-processes such as reverse osmosis , distillation , chemical disinfection and some others .
All of these engineered processes will produce a cleaner effluent .
Further treatment can even turn dirty wastewater into drinkable water .
The 'Newater' treatment plant in Singapore is a global example of water treatment .
Water can be stored , treated and finally even transported .
Water transportation is made possible through engineered piping systems .
Large water pipes are constructed to constantly transport water from a storage dam to dried-up lands .
This allows for a good system of irrigation by providing transported water to the dried soil continuously .
This process and system assist in the growing of crops in dry areas especially during periods of inadequate rainfall .
With such engineering designs , deserts can be turned into green pastures with rich crops .
It is amazing how science and technology through man's engineering efforts have benefited the world .
We are now facing a crisis of water shortage which could lead to many water related problems .
Engineers in recent years have been working creatively and innovatively to properly treat and manage water .
With  advancements in technology , these are all made possible and there is even purified drinkable water treated from wastewater .
In certain countries , dried-out lands are even brought alive through water irrigation , where water is stored up somewhere and constantly transported through pipes to these lands .
Engineering products and system designs are not simply a design for aesthetical purposes , but also technologically meet some of the greatest human needs , water deficit .
Inventions are made to benefit mankind .
However , some inventions were made accidentally while others look into the problem directly to develop a new product .
From five aspects - discovery , creativeness , time taken , acceptance of the project by  a and also from problem solving - we can see that there are similarities and differences in these two approaches .
The examples I am using for this essay for serendipitous discovery and development via research is 3M Post-it pads and Toshiba laptops respectively .
One obvious difference is the way it is invented .
One of the well-known accidental inventions , according to E .M . Rogers (1950) , happened several decades ago , whena 3M researcher found a new bonding agent , but decided it was worthless because it did not stick paper very tightly to a surface .
This failure was converted into a successful product when a 3M researcher used the new bonding agent to create "Post-it" .
As for laptopswhich were via research , Mizoguchi foresaw that a portable personal computer could be invented when he visited the United States with an R&D team form Toshiba .
He was certain to make it came true .
Creativeness is always one of the important factors in inventing things .
An accidental discovery requires a member of the team to think of the product related during another process of making another products .
This person must be able to think out of the box .
But for Mizoguchi , he set his target on developing a laptop .
However , both inventions required creative thinking in order to produce excellent product .
Another major difference is the length of time used on the research .
For serendipitous discovery , the time taken is considered short .
As it happens ,producing a new bonding agent that did not stick paper tightly to a surface , which is not originally what the 3M researcherswanted , but was what one of the researchers used  to create "Post-it" .
This then became one of the most profitable products in 3M company .
Whereas , most developed technology via research took a long time because theyneeded to keep researching and try , if they failed , they would try again until it became an invention .
Nevertheless , both of the inventions required time and effort to create miracles in the world .
fourthly the difference between accidental invention and research to develop products is the problem (that) researchers are solving . 
Last but not least , one of the major problems with serendipitous discovery isthat it requires an extra step to get approval from a company in order to mass produce or even continue to do the project . 
We can see from the above , inventing things is not an easy task .
Each of the findings has it difficulties .
Be it serendipity or developed through research or inventions developed through research it benefits  human lives .
In the world today , most humans are leading convenient and comfortable lives .
This is made possible due to the innovations engineers have produced to improve  the lives of mankind .
What is the engineering design process that produced so many useful innovations like ?
According to khandani , Khandani (2005) , engineering design consists of five steps: defining the problem , gathering information , brainstorming for solutions , selecting the best solution and finally the implementation of the solution .
These are the general steps to the formulation of an innovation .
This process requires certain skills from the engineer , such as creativity , the and to learn from failure .
In Singaporengapore , the local society and education system produces problems that hinder the usage of the engineering design process .
The first problem will be the focus of the Singapore education system .
It has evolved over the years , from textbook learning to the introduction of hands-on learning to equip students with skills such as creativity .
However , the implementation of hands-on Learning is only carried out to a small extent .
learning is still heavily dependent on textbooks today .
In addition , education in singapore is fast paced and result orientated .
From primary schools to junior colleges , lecturers are always rushing through lessons in order to be able to finish the syllabus on time .
Whether students learn or not depends on the outcome of major examinations such as GCE 'O' and 'A' levels .
These exams do not concentrate on the learning process .
Instead , it focuses on the answers .
With such an education system in place , what students learn are confined to what the textbook offers , with minimal development of critical skills such as creativity and analysis .
This trend will impede the engineering design process at the brainstorming and selection of solution stages .
In the brainstorming stage , the innovator must be able to think of solutions that are non-existant in reality .
This requires alot of creativity .
Next , the selection of the best solution requires the innovator to possess strong analytical skills .
These skills are critical to the two stages of the design process , but are lacking in locals due to the effect of the education system .
Another problem faced by Sngapore is society's mindset .
Life in ingapore is highly competitive and fast paced , hence parents believe that their children must possess outstanding paper qualifications to survive .
As a result , they enroll their children in tuition classes to enhance their academic performance , depriving them of the chance to develop their critical skills .
Moreover , the majority of the locals are apathetic to their surroundings .
Everyone minds their own business , and do not bother themselves with what happens around them , unless it concerns them .
In the current state of society  , people are not adept at analysing information and observing problems , and even if they did , they will deny its presence .
This behaviour will jeopardise the steps where the problem is defined and the selection of the best solution .
To be able to define a problem , the innovator must be observant enough to see the problem , and be bothered to do something to improve it , hence creating an innovation .
These skills are vital to the two stages of the process , therefore society's mindset poses a problem to the design process .
In conclusion , for Singapore to have outstanding innovators , the problems in the education system and the mindset of society must be addressed .
People must be more creative , able to think analytically and change their mindsets .
However , two problems are not the only problems that will impact the design processes negatively .
There are other problems that require attention .
With these problems are rectified , then Singapore will have more innovators , and hopefully more useful innovations to improve people's lives .
One factor that has shaped  electric vehicle is the economics of owning an electric vehicle .
Cost is a major consideration in a consumer's decision-making process .
The maintenance cost when the electric vehicle was first introduced was high .
This made the electric cars more expensive than petrol-run cars .
For instance , the battery pack in typical electric cars did not last long .
According to Gruening (1995) , the battery pack had to be replaced every 20 ,000 to 30 ,000 miles .
Consequently , this made the electric vehicles more expensive than petrol vehicles and hence less affordable to most families on a budget .
Besides the low lifespan of the batteries , the time required to recharge an electric vehicle was much longer than the time required to refuel a fuel tank .
For many , time wasted waiting would translate to high opportunity cost .
Thus , these economic factors could be reasons why electric vehicles were poorly adopted .
Besides economic factors , government regulations and laws also played a part in shaping  electric vehicles .
The California and Arizona state governments , in the 1990s , mandated that at least 10 percent of the total sales of automobile companies would have to be non-polluting .
Rogers(2003) notes that these laws prompted General Motors to invest in the designing , manufacturing and marketing of the electric vehicle .
As a result , the concept of the electric car was widely promoted in the United States of America .
In addition , tax rebates and incentives added to the attractiveness of buying an electric vehicle .
For example , the Climate Change Bill in the United States included incentives to set up charging stations and subsidies for people buying the cars .
These offers made by the government made these vehicles competitive to  petroleum cars in price .
Therefore , it can be seen that the government's involvement in promoting environmentally-friendly vehicles has affected how marketable electric vehicles are .
Moreover , psychological factors of owning an electric vehicle have affected the outcome of  electric vehicles in the market .
A technical limitation of  electric vehicle is range of travel it can offer .
An electric vehicle with a fully-charged battery is not able to travel as far as a petroleum vehicle with a fully-filled fuel tank .
Although families who needed a car as a mode of transport did not usually require traveling for long distances , there is a psychological perception of having their freedom being restricted .
Hence , they will prefer a petroleum car which has the potential in allowing them to travel farther .
Thus , the strong desire for freedom might have affected the popularity of  electric car .
In short , there are several factors that could have shaped the electric vehicles .
Economic and psychological factors might have dissuaded many from supporting them while the government plays a prominent role in encouraging the growth of the electric vehicle industry .
However , there is a close relationship between the social factors and the technical challenges that the electric vehicles face .
Hence , the recognition of electric vehicles by society could be affected by both social factors and challenges faced by the present technology of the electric vehicle .
In ancient time , heat and humidity tortured people a lot .
In hot days , people felt physically uncomfortable and mentallyforrritable .
Thworking efficacy was low and diseases transmitted easily .
People began to think of ways to solve the problem .
Some great minds , probably the engineers in those days , livested fans .
Fans were generally made by lrefreshing aironlm leaves sewed together .
The fan basically combined the theory of flowing air and wind , but it was a great success and everybody uses fans to generate breeze and keep cool in summer .
It relieves the discomfort in summer .
Gradually , timese were not satisfied by fans , since they had to keep shaking fans to keep cool .
It was disturbing to shaking a fan at work or in sleep .
At the same time , electricity was invented and people began to appreciate the convenience brought by it .
In 1886 , Schulyer Wheeler (Inventors , 2009) devised a new type of machine using elecfromileathersend breeze .
After careful design and hard process of trials and fails , the first electric fan was created .
The advent of electric fan was a great success and it was implemented around the world .
Peopleneed was met by the air vortex flow formed automatically .
The electric fan was the standard at that time .
livesintoNow elecwent fans and air conditioners are bettunsatisfactoryoriginal ones .
People feel more comfortable does hot days .
Productivity is increased and industries flourish .
The design was initiated by people's needs , and they ultimately met people's needs .
It is believed that the design will not (Bookrags , 2005) .more advanced products will appear .
More developed and enhanced functions will be added and improve people's life better and better .

Look around and you will most probably notice people driving in their cars , talking on their phones or busy typing away on their personal computers .
These occurrences may seem common now , but they were definitely not in the early 1900s .
The advancement of technology over the last century was so breathtaking that one often wonders how the technologies were invented .
Were they created conventionally , which means that the general public knows about their development , or were they secretly developed in a skunkworks environment ?
Regardless of their distinctions , both technologies share similarities that make each of them unique and useful in their own ways .
The most significant contrast between the skunkworks technology and that of the conventional method is the vastly different confidential levels and aims which each technology works on .
In the case of skunkworks , the product being developed is known only to the researchers and the relevant organizations .
This ensures that the probability of information leakage regarding the product is kept to a minimum , so that the main objective of creating the product can be realized .
For example , Lockheed's P-80 Shooting Star fighter jet , which was designed and built under the knowledge of only the researchers and the United States military , helped the US overcome the technology gap which Germany had over it during World War 2 .
On the other hand , corporations using conventionally generated technologies usually announce to the public their latest updates pertaining to their most recent creations .
The release of information is usually done by companies which want to flaunt their superiority over other similar companies competing in the same market .
The rivalry between Sony and Microsoft over the gaming console industry leads to both companies constantly improving their products and announcing it to the world so as to apply pressure on the other .
Thus , it can be seen that differing degrees of secrecy for disparate technologies stems from dissimilar aims .
Another difference between the two technologies is the impact that they create when both are in operation .
New innovations contrived in skunkworks environments usually revolutionize the world and propel the company which invented it to new heights while that is not the case for conventional technology .
The invention of personal computers in IBM's skunkworks completely changed the way in which the world operates , and made IBM the forerunner in computers , but the upgrading of the computers with ordinary technical knowledge did not really lead people onto a new path , instead it only resulted in the proliferation of many small computer-based companies .
As a result , the market is now full of computers with different brands .
This maybe the unexpected positive side effect of using conventional technology , but compared to the skunkworks , it is relatively insignificant .
Despite of the differences , both technologies share some common traits .
First , both require a high level of accuracy .
There is not much room for error in both cases , as a slight mistake may result in devastating effects .
The skunkworks-produced P-80 fighter jet experienced numerous crashes , which resulted in many deaths , due to problems which were not analyzed accurately .
Similarly , the HIV vaccine was not researched adequately , causing many volunteers to contract the virus unwillingly .
Secondly products that emerge from both technologies can be used for a long time .
It is important as this means that resources can be channeled to other areas of research .
Using the previous examples , the P-80 jet was used for close to 30 years before being replaced completely , while the HIV vaccine may be in use forever if the vaccine undergoes successful research .
It is through these similarities that people can compare and advance on the current technology .
Having a home is one of the most fundamental human needs .
Be it a shelter or a big house , everyone has to have a place they can call home .
Despite being a fundamental need , there are many people in the world who are unable to have a proper home .
According to the UN Human Settlements Programme , there are around a billion people out there who live in overcrowded housing with poor water quality , lack of sanitation , and no garbage collection .
With rapid urbanization and the world population increasing into the future , housing may prove to be a challenging issue .
A proper housing system has to be set up to deal with these housing issues and the best way to develop such a system would be using an engineering design process .
The main steps to consider in a good and proper housing system are  affordability , durability and safe living conditions .
Hence the main solution to the problem of improper housing would be the reduction of housing costs without compromising on quality .
Homeless people suffering from housing issues are mainly attributed to problems of affordability .
Building proper houses or flats usually requires a lot of finance .
The construction cost bundled with the raw materials for building many homes is something , which the poor cannot afford .
Furthermore , developers have no incentive to carry out projects in these less developed countries , as there is just no market to earn profit from .
The problem of cost clearly creates more homeless people .
On being unable to obtain a proper home , shanty houses are the next and only alternative that the homeless can approach  .
These make-do houses are built cheaply and improperly on wastelands .
Being made from waste metal and wood , the durability and safety of the inhabitant are usually compromised .
These shabby houses have a danger of collapsing with the constant battering of the weather .
Moreover , health dangers are prevalent when certain waste materials are used in the shelter construction according to the article ,  'Give Me Shelter: The Global Housing Crisis ,' by Environmental Health Perspectives .
Furthermore , squatters in  slums do not have proper sewer systems and a clean water sources .
Such living conditions are detrimental to society but they are not unavoidable as measures can be taken to rectify these problems .
Being aware of the rising problem the solutions needed for a better housing system can be identified .
Cost and labor friendly procedures for house and flat construction could be adapted for cheaper production .
Research and analysis for the use of machinery and better building processes can be done to curb the cost .
With further research and development , less costly materials could also be introduced or invented for construction without compromising on quality and strength .
Building designs can also be engineered and tweaked to maximize availability and space for overcrowded areas .
After consolidating these solutions , their feasibility can then be measured by testing them  within a real society .
Upon successful implementation , The necessary adjustments or assessments based on the effectiveness of the solutions .
can be made .
There are many other processes that can be applied to solve this issue , but  an engineering design process is probably the best approach .
Despite being a big stepping-stone to solving the urgent housing crisis , the gaining of support and acceptance from the government of the countries affected will be vital for carrying out this process .
Ultimately , the success of the entire process is one that requires a holistic approach that involves more than the designing of a feasible process , but extends to the community and its government support .
Since entering the 21st century , mankind has been with a growing number of challenges and threats .
Global warming , the War in Iraq and even the threat of China's rise are all inextricably linked with the need for energy .
Global warming is partly caused by the overuse of fossil fuels and the War in Iraq is mainly a result of the need for petroleum by the USA while the threat of China actually refers to China's huge demands of resources including energy resources to satisfy the high-speed development of China .
Therefore , among all the current human needs , the need for energy , i should be given priority .
In meeting this need , engineering design processes takes an important role .
First of all , engineering design processes help to make good use of new energy resources like hydrogen energy and solar energy .
As we know , the storage and transportation of hydrogen have been two major factors that restrict the wide use of hydrogen .
Engineers need to find the right materials and design a suitable container for hydrogen so that it can be safely transported and stored .
In terms of solar energy , to improve the utilization and to reduce the cost of use is a problem left for engineers .
In China , millions of families have already used solar water heater for years , which saved amounts of electricity .
However , when trying to convert solar energy into electricity so that it can be easily transmitted , engineers should consider the cost and utilization of solar panels .
Otherwise , it would be an embarrassing situation that the saved energy cannot pay the cost of solar panels , which would make solar energy  .
Next , traditional fossil fuels can be better used with the help of engineering design processes .
In the process of exploiting  fossil fuels , engineering design helps to find scientific methods to improve resource recovery and reduce resource wasting .
In addition , deep processing of fossil fuels also needs engineering design to improve the utilization of fossil fuels .
By doing so , the pollution caused by using fossil fuels can be reduced .
For example , during the process of exploiting oil , the byproducts like natural gas are often burned since it is hard to collect and store .
Japan has developed the Heat Recovery Steam Generator to generate power by using the waste heat .
Engineering design has played an important role in developing HRSG .
Lastly , , engineering design processes can help to reduce energy waste .
When transmitting electricity , some energy is consumed by the wire .
Engineers are trying to find a superconducting material that can work at room temperature to take place of traditional conducting materials .
In this way , the energy consumed by the wire will be saved .
Furthermore ,  energy- saving appliances designed by engineers have saved inestimable energy for the world .
Engineering design processes have made a great contribution to the world .
In the coming years , human demand for energy will be increasing whereas renewable energy sources are decreasing .
Engineers have  obligation to solve this problem .
With  breakthroughs  different domains in science , engineers should shoulder up the responsibility of making these breakthroughs available for people and therefore benefit humankind .
The survival of humanity in this century is heavily dependent on the role of Engineers and they should be prepared for potential threats and challenges .
Like many other gadgets created in the 21st century , surveillance technology such as RFID has also made its way into our ever changing lives .
Apart from its many other applications in the business and medical sectors , RFID can be used to track individuals .
Some may argue that it is beneficial to us as it renders us a sense of protection if our locations are known .
In fact , usage of RFID on individuals causes more harm than good as it not only intrudes our privacy (Channel 3000 , n .d .) , but our security would also be compromised instead of being enhanced .
As such , usage of RFID to track individuals should be banned .
Invasion of privacy has been a major concern in the use of RFID .
Some may argue that tracking ex-convicts with the use of RFID could be used to prevent criminal behavior (BBC News , 2006) .
However , we must not overlook the fact that they are still humans and basic human rights such as privacy should not be disregarded .
Similarly , an individual's privacy such as 'habits and movements' should also be kept unknown to the government (Channel 3000 , n .d .) .
To sum it up , no party or organization should have the rights to such profiling/tracking with or without any purpose as it is clearly an intrusion of privacy .
Usage of RFID is useless from the security standpoint (Ou , 2007) .
As such data is being transmitted by radio waves (Bhaskar , n .d .) , it can be easily picked up by a third party who could use it for their own purpose .
This would in turn lead to invasion of privacy as the victim's location is now known .
In worse cases , such information could be used for unlawful activities , such as house breaking .
Arguments have been put forth that the RFID tags on individuals could be programmed in such a way to minimize information leakage .
However , the cost inflicted would be very high (Ou , 2007) .
Data generated from RFID tags of individuals could also be abused by the intended receivers such as surveillance officers (BBC News , 2006) , adding on a whole new level of security blight .
Although a complete ban on RFID is impossible , its usage on individual tracking should be banned as it intrudes upon our privacy and compromises our security .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing ."
Genetic testing is a medical test which can determine if an individual is potentially at risk of inheriting certain genetic diseases or if a child would be born with genetic condition .
[i] The controversy was brought up when deciding if individuals have the final say to reveal such testing as genetic discrimination might surface when the results of such testing are made known to a third party .
Moreover , the reliability and accuracy of the tests remain ambiguous .
Hence , the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
First and foremost , genetic discrimination arises when employers lower the chance of promoting genetically-ill individuals or when these individuals are denied a job .
Likewise , these individuals may be required to pay more when they apply for a health insurance .
Since genetic testing is beneficial , some governments have come up with legal procedures that would protect sufferers from genetic discrimination .
However , these laws are usually limited[ii] .
"Discrimination is probably going to increase because current laws are ineffective ."
(Gruber J , 2000) .
[iii] In addition , the accountability of such results is questionable considering that the result is often interpreted or analyzed .
According to Kathy L . Hudson (2006) "nothing has happened for the past 6 years , leaving a system in place that still does not routinely evaluate the competence of genetic testing labs" .
Similarly , since the disease might not manifest itself even if one is tested positive , no one should have the right to reveal the results as it is difficult to verify the exactitude of the results .
In recent years , surveillance technology is getting more and more popular ,especially Radio-Frequency Identification(RFID) .
RFID is a kind of surveillance technology which uses tags and readers to gather information about items attached with the tags .
While surveillance technology has contributed a lot to the society , it has also caused troubles such as privacy and security issues(Anonymous 2007) .
Thus proper rules and regulations are needed for surveillance technology; in other words , the use of surveillance technology should be banned in a certain degree .
Privacy issue is the one that most people are concerned about .
RFID tags can simply be used as "spy chips" since the information in the tags can be read off in a distance and then people may "watch "on you without your permission or even awareness .
(Anonymous 2007)Moreover , it is very difficult to get rid of RFID tags as these chips are too thin and tiny to be found and disabled(Surinder MB 2008) .
Thus  , formal regulations about surveillance technology should be carried out and when privacy is affected , the use of such technology should be banned in such cases .
Another problem caused by surveillance technology is the security issue .
Whenever data is collected , the idea of data ownership would go along with it(Surinder MB 2008) .
The problem about surveillance technology is that it is very difficult to control who owns the information .
For example , the unique RFID tag number on an purchased item can be linked to the credit card number used to pay for it(Surinder MB 2008) .
Salesmen may make use of the information to sieve out potential customers and robbers may find out targets from it .
Hence , if the information is open to everyone , our safety in daily lives will not be ensured anymore .
However , people may argue that surveillance technology is introduced to help ensure security , and it indeed works very well in preventing crimes to occur and in providing information for investigation .
We cannot deny that surveillance technology is effective and convenient , but if data ownership is not controlled , surveillance technology may become a threat to our safety .
Thus , the usage of surveillance technology should be banned when it is used in an abusive way .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned for certain degree to ensure that privacy is protected and the security issue is solved also .
As an emerging technology , genetic testing is getting more and more related to people's life as it is  being applied to predictions and diagnoses of diseases .
Since it could indicate the onset of diseases in the future , the results of genetic testing may tag a person with "having inherited defects" (Buchanan , n .d .) .Therefore , it aroused a controversy over  whether the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results .
In my opinion , the right of an individual to decide whether to reveal the results should be protected .
Moreover , once the results are forced to be revealed , consequences may be significant .
The first one is about emotional impacts .
Genetic testing creates tension within a family because it conveys people the information of getting ill and it also implies that other family members have the possibility of having the same defect genes(Kahn ,2000) .
People may feel anxious , depressed , and even guilty of revealing the results .
Gradually , people's life may be destroyed by psychological and mental problems .
The second consequence is about the genetic discrimination , especially in employment and insurance (Norrgard , 2008) .Insurance may not be provided to an individual with results showing the possibility of getting ill .
Besides , it is disadvantageous for getting a job with results showing that an individual is genetically inferior .
In that sense , revealing genetic results may put much more stress on people .
In conclusion , the results of genetic testing do have big impacts upon people's life in terms of emotional impacts and genetic discrimination .
However , all the anxiety and pressure may be unnecessary because of the unreliability of such technology .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results  , and this is also in agreement with protecting human rights .
Genetic testing is a kind of  test which determines the vulnerabilities of an individual to inherit genetic disorders (U .S National Library of Medicine , 2009 , para .
1) .
The results obtained from a genetic test can exclude an alleged genetic condition or help verify if a person is a carrier of a genetic disease or have a chance to develop a genetic disorder in future (U .S National Library of Medicine , 2009 , para .
1) .
Upon testing , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing (Norrgard , 2008 , Reproductive and Other Familial Concerns , para .
2) .
Family members of the individual requesting genetic testing should also have the rights to know about the results of such testing .
This is because that they might have a higher risk for developing this genetic disease or are already a carrier of this mutation .
Only by recognizing this possibility earlier , they can then make informed choices about their family planning decisions , career and other life choices (Norrgard , 2008 , Genetic Testing is a Matter of Individual Choice , para .
1) .
The use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) method can be used for family planning .
By using this method , only embryos which are free from any genetic disorders are transferred back to women's uterus and allowed to develop to full birth (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .
2) .
Alternatively , they can choose chorionic villus sampling (CVS) , a form of genetic prenatal testing (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .
2) .
If the foetus is diagnosed with the mutation , the couple can then choose to terminate the pregnancy (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .
2) .
Furthermore , it is also unfair to the insurance companies if the individual with a genetic disease decides to buy life insurance policies without revealing that they have such genetic disorder .
The insurance companies need to be cost effective too .
They should therefore have the rights to request for a medical record (Hsien , 2007 , The question: Should genetic information be disclosed to insurers ? , para .
2) .
Surveillance technology has indeed come a long way since its humble beginnings , evolving from security cameras to sophisticated methods such as Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and the Global Position System (GPS) .
Advances in this field have allowed us to monitor the activities of people more thoroughly .
This technology allows for more effective tracing of an individual through an instant identification approach .
Detractors of such systems lament that such act comes at the cost of intrusion into one's privacy .
However , using surveillance technology to track people plays a vital role in addressing criminal issues and can benefit the healthcare sector .
The colossal impact it has on the society is as such a reasonable trade off and thus it should not be banned .
Surveillance technology also plays an important role in the healthcare industry .
They serve as an essential support in patient care through the monitoring of their well-being .
Hospitals have capitalized on the potential of RFID and have since reaped the benefits .
The patients are issued wrist tags which can be traced to the hand-held communication device of the staff .
This ensures that their movement and behaviour can be consistently monitored .
The tracking of patients is particularly useful in the protection of infant babies , alzcheimer's patients and others with special vulnerabilities (Dr . Counse , n .d .) It alerts the staff should the patient encounter a mishap or wander away .
The RFID wrist tags also code for information regarding the patient .
Important data such as the appropriate medication and meal requirements can be easily retrieved , thereby facilitating the job of the nurses .
This method of monitoring minimizes any potential error and enhances efficiency .
It caters increased attention and care for the welfare of the patients .
RFID may revolutionize our society in future but at the very moment , it is still in its infant stage where its benefits have yet to warrant a widespread implementation while its disadvantages are surmountable .
Henceforth , the use of RFID should be limited as of now .
Secondly , RFID infringes on one's privacy in the process of tracking the various information associated with that person (Ahson , 2007a) .
For instance , a salesperson can know the preferences of one's shopping habits by scanning the person's purchase records .
In doing so , he can provide better recommendations .
However , be it for enhancement of sales or not , strangers should not be allowed to harness such private information as one's privacy is of paramount importance .
Lastly , it is not effective to introduce RFID to the goods market (Ahson , 2007b) .
A typical RFID tag cost approximately 20 cents while a scanner will cost about a $1000 .
When these devices are used on items that have prices ranging a few dollars , it makes one wonder whether one is paying for the item or for the delivery process .
Furthermore , the lack of standardization of RFID means that different RFID systems require different RFID devices (Ahson , 2007b) .
Store owners importing different goods would thus need different devices and this situation is unwanted .
Some may argue that at-risk relatives should be informed about their susceptibility to genetic diseases , so that they can take early precaution or appropriate treatment to the diseases .
However , most genetic diseases have no means of prevention or treatment (Norrgard 2008) .
Hence , in most cases , disclosing the results of genetic testing to relatives will only bring psychological and mental stress upon them .
Surveillance technology has brought us many applications  in many areas of our life .
First of all , RFID has played an important role in preventing crimes .
From security view , RFID can provide more precise and complete information on suspects or criminals , which results in the reduction in time and manpower for an investigation .
In other words , when combined with the "intelligent video security system using image process" technology which can "detect unexpected movement or unusual behavior that can pose a threat to people , property and infrastructure" , RFID will prevent many potential risks from criminals or dire threat like terrorism (Focus Group Meeting on Technology Convergence , 2008) .
RFID can also protect the Homeland security of a country from many threats when it functions  .
When travelers cross a border of a country , if they have "an RFID-enabled border crossing document" , the Border Protection Office or Immigration Office can collect identification and citizenship information of travelers and then rapidly determine if they are threats to the country or not , based on the world-wide security information system between many Governments (Use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology for Border Crossings , 2008) .
Another key application of RFID is that RFID helps to improve the healthcare sector .
The wristband with embedded transponder which can be seen in many hospitals all over the world is designed basically based on RFID technology .
The wristband allows specific computers or devices to track and identify the holder which can be patients or doctors of the hospital .
Thus , it can warn the management system of the hospital if an unauthorized person tries to break into a restricted area or a patient tries to leave the medical centre (RFID in hospitals , retrieved from the Internet) .
For instance , it is more safe now for patients who have  mental diseases if they are lost , because they are being tracked all the time in the hospital under the surveillance system like RFID .
It is obvious that RFID technology plays a crucial role in improving the healthcare system .
However , others argue that RFID technology has infringed upon privacy rights of human beings .
They claim that information from RFID devices can be approached by a third party and RFID can be used to track individuals illegally if the technology is well-known (Postnote from Parliamentary Office of Science and technology , 2004) .
All such concerns have been already discussed and solved by prudent policies .
Restricted uses and laws have been applied to RFID technology; hence , the information of individuals can only be seen by authorized people legally with a positive purpose .
And the fact is that most  people will choose safety and security between security and privacy .
"Ross Anderson , a professor at Cambridge University in Britain , has compared the present situation to a "boiled frog" -- which fails to jump out of the saucepan as the water gradually heats .
If liberty is progressively eroded slowly , people will get used to it" (Focus Group Meeting on Technology Convergence , 2008) .
To conclude , it is indisputable that the advantages of surveillance technology outweigh the negative effects .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned because it not only improves security system for people and country but also enhances the healthcare sector .
There are two main reasons behind this stand .
The first reason concerns with the patient's family who may share the risk of inheriting the genetic defects if one of the family's members is diagnosed with a dominant genetic disease (Norrgard , 2008) .
It is very unfair for his or her family if the result is not disclosed to them .
Moreover , if the disease can  begin to show any symptom only when it is in the final stage , then the life of the person may be at danger .
Secondly , the genetic test's result can help the individual to make a better decision in future (Norrgard , 2008) .
For instance , a couple diagnosed with SMA* may think of alternative ways of having children for example by IVF** .
Some argue that the result is confidential since everyone's genetic information is different (Glenn , 2008) .
However , as argued before , everybody's genes may be linked to their relatives' genes , so it is possible for the relatives particularly their siblings to inherit the same defective gene .
Once the disease is confirmed , then their siblings should probably take a genetic test too .
Others reason for instance in the medical insurance case that it is unfair to charge an individual with genetic defects at a higher rate since the defects are not what they want (Norrgard , 2008) .
But again , if they are charged at the same rate with normal people then they are being unfair to others and the insurance company since the treatment fee for genetic diseases is high .
To conclude , the individual requesting for genetic testing should not have the final say as it is unfair to the medical insurance company and the person's relatives who may also be at risk of inheriting the same genetic defects .
Since the attack on the London Underground on July 2005 , surveillance technology has generated a lot of attention after it was used to track the movements of the terrorists responsible for the attack .
Reports and articles have shown that the use of surveillance technology to track people can be beneficial to us , particularly in the healthcare and crime prevention sectors and in the enhancement of security .
Therefore , I fully agree that surveillance technology should not be banned .
Firstly , surveillance technology such as radio identification technology (RFID) can be used to track patients in the hospital where it will notify the nurse or hospital staffs if a patient begins to collapse .
({http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html]) This way , the chances of reviving and saving a patient is greater .
If a patient suddenly collapses in her room and there is no one to alert the nurse , it will probably take one or more hours for her to be saved when the nurse goes around to check on the patients .
By that time , the patient's life would be in danger and this would most probably bring about dire consequences such as death .
Not only that , RFID strap can also be used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's disease .
({http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html])
Secondly , the implementation of radio identification technology in prison can also help to track prisoners and reduce violence in the prisons .
({http://www .rfidjournal .com/article/view/1601/1/1}[HYPERLINK: http://www .rfidjournal .com/article/view/1601/1/1]) .
Prison officers will be able to monitor the movement and exact locations of the inmates and thus this will deter them from committing crimes in the prison .
Not only that , if indeed  a crime happens , the prison guards will be able to investigate and know who the culprit is .
Furthermore , it can also ensure that the inmates do not escape by sending alerts when an inmate approaches the jail perimeter .
Thirdly , surveillance technology can also be used to keep track of our children and prevent kidnapping .
( HYPERLINK "http://technu .nst .com .my/Current_News/techNu/Monday/Notebook/20080211123356/Article/index_html" http://technu .nst .com .my/Current_News/techNu/Monday/Notebook/20080211123356/Article/index_html) .
Parents can strap radio identification technology on the wrist of their children in order to monitor the location of their children .
For example , when the child is missing or kidnapped , the parents will be able to know the exact location of their kids .
This can also help the police in their investigative work .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned to track people as it can not only save life but also improve the healthcare sector while enhancing the security of our society .
The controversy over whether or not the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the result of such testing has been present for a long period of time .
Genetic testing refers to the reading of the human genome to identify if one is subjected to genetically linked diseases , such as Alzheimer's disease .
The main issue pertaining to this is that when an individual chooses not to disclose the result of the genetic testing , it is actually unfair to and has adverse impacts on both his family and his employer .
The result of the genetic testing concerns parties other than the individual alone , and therefore , the individual requesting  genetic testing should not have the final say on whether the results should be revealed to others .
Firstly ,  when an individual is tested to be positive for genetic disorder , he would often be reluctant to share the result with others , even his closest kin .
This is unjust to the family members as  they have also the possibility of suffering from the genetic disorder .
They should thus be notified so that they would be able to do the necessary family planning , especially  if the individual carries a mutation that may result in a fatal genetic disorder ({http://www .nature .com}[HYPERLINK: http://www .nature .com] , 2008) .
The importance of sharing the information with family members is recognized , as even during the pretest genetic counseling session , an individual would be advised to share the result with them ({www .ons .org}[HYPERLINK: http://www .ons .org] , 2009) .
Due to the negative consequences of allowing individuals to make the about whether or not to reveal their genetic test results , they should therefore not be given the right to have the final say in the matter .
Secondly , given the choice of not revealing one's genetic testing result , an individual will  most of the time choose not to do so to his related company .
This action would have an adverse impact on the company .
If , during the course of employment , the individual's welfare and safety was being threatened by the work that he was doing , the company would be held liable , despite being ignorant about the dangers that  he was vulnerable to ({http://www .law .duke .edu}[HYPERLINK: http://www .law .duke .edu] , 2002) .
Furthermore , when the individual develops  the genetically linked disease , efficiency of work will be reduced , and yet the company would incur additional expenses to cover the issues that arise from having a sick worker ({http://www .law .duke .edu}[HYPERLINK: http://www .law .duke .edu] , 2002) .
This furthermore supports the stand that the individual requesting for genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the result of such testing .
In conclusion , due to the negative consequences for both his family and his related company , individual should not have the power to decide  whether or not to reveal the result of his genetic testing .
Genetic testing is used to test for genetic disorders , such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease .
With the test , people are able to understand the conditions of the diseases caused by mutated genes inherited from their parents .
This helps to improve their lives .
However , there is also an ethical dilemma and various social issues that arose with it .
Facing these problems , people who have done the test should have the right to keep their genetic test result from others .
One reason for revealing the result to  family members is that the result is not only applicable to the individual but also to his family members , as they may also have inherited the disease .
However , even though the individual may have the responsibility to inform the others about the possibility of them inheriting the genes , he should have the right to decide whether to tell .
This is because the result will give   psychological distress and harm , which  affect or worsen one's health (U .S . National Institutes of Health) .
When people find out about the testand the possibility of them having the genes , their stress level wouldincrease and their health would be affected .
Moreover , the test result may be faulty and some people carrying the gene  never develop the disease .
Thus , revealing the result would only cause a burden to them .
Individuals who have done the test may face discrimination (Karen Norrgard , 2008) .
The result may be used against the person .
For instance , insurance companies may use the information to raise rates or to deny the person insurance .
Employers may not hire or promote them .
Family and friends may treat them differently or even abandon them .
One has to face these consequences even if the possibility of developing the disease is low .
Furthermore , the testing only gives the percentage and not the definitive results .
In making the test result known to others , one may have to face others' judgements throughout one's life .
In conclusion , people should have the right to restrict others from knowing the result of their genetic test as psychological and social issues impose great impacts on people's lives .
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an example of a surveillance technology used commonly for identification and tracking purposes .
The market for such a device is growing very quickly due to its affordable price and widespread use (Sieberg D , 2006) .
However , there are also several problems attributed from the use of RFID .
Most concerns revolve around the fact that RFID invades one's privacy and violates human rights when it is used for tracking people .
Thus , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
RFID can be used to track individuals as information can be easily retrieved from the RFID tags without their consent .
It becomes impossible to know or detect the presence of an RFID tag since it can be read  a distance away from the individual (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
Furthermore , it is hard to decide who should have the access to such information (Sieberg D , 2006) .
Companies which specialise in RFID tags may pass the information obtained from the RFID tags to any buyer if the government does not intervene or control such access .
In some cases , people are forced to have RFID tags implanted in their body for tracking purposes .
This may lead to even more implications on the welfare of the victims and therefore we should not use such technology to track people .
It is argued that RFID can be beneficial for patients in medical monitoring such as daily temperature taking (Paddock C , 2007) .
However , the use of RFID can have undesirable effects on our body because radio waves from RFID are mutagenic and they are harmful when patients are exposed to them in large quantities .
Such radio waves can also cause cancer (Paddock C , 2007) .
Therefore , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be banned .
In conclusion , we should prohibit the use of RFID tags on individuals without consent as it violates location privacy and affects their health .
Therefore , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned as it threatens the welfare of individuals .
A lot of surveillance technologies have been invented and developed .
One of them is RFID(Radio Frequency Identification) which has been used widely thorough the world , even  to track people .
Yet there are many debates on this tracking concerning  ethical and moral issues .
Some argue that RFID tracking has bad effects on human life but in reality the tracking gives many advantages to humans .
Therefore , due to the advantages , the use of RFID in tracking people should not be banned .
There are two significant benefits of RFID in tracking people .
Firstly , RFID gives  accuracy in medical aspects (Roberti , 2007) .
Many hospitals implant RFID in patients to track their health condition timely by nurses .
This tracking also gives access to the patient's medical information more accurately such as the temperature of patientsand whether the patient is allergic to some medicines .
Secondly , RFID increases the security of workers in working area (Mehdizadeh , 2007) .
By implanting an RFID in a device worn by a worker , a company can monitor the safety of its workers especially those working in more risky areas like oil exploration sites and mines .
Some phases of work must be done by experts .
tracking the location of workers , it to confirm that "the right worker is at the right place" (Mehdizadeh , 2007) .
Opponents of people tracking using RFID say that the tracking  the important privacy of the people tracked and abuses personal information by  unauthorised man (Tan & Li , 2008) .
However , the using of RFID to track would only be implemented according to the agreement of the patients and workers affected .
In addition , the RFID technology nowadays come with high security to ensure that theconfidentiality of the tracked person (Tan & Li , 2008) .
It has also been said that the implanting of RFID in the human body may cause electromagnetic disturbance in the body (Roberti , 2007) .
However , this effect has not been proved and so far there has not been any issue regarding this disturbance .
In conclusion , RFID tracking should not be banned as it does not inflict the privacy of people and gives advantages in many aspects in human life .
Genetic testing is a development in science that allows early detection of genetic diseases (Anonymous , 2005) .
There is often a concern whether an individual should reveal his genetic test result as it may bring about several impacts on the individual and on third parties .
Therefore , the individual should bear in mind the consequences of revealing his genetic test results and decide whether to reveal the results .
Revealing of an individual's genetic test results may  impact  the individual as well as his family members .
Firstly , revealing of genetic test may cause the individual to be  discriminated against (Norrgard , 2008) .
This is due to the fact that genetic testing can reveal possible high-risk diseases the individual may develop .
As such , it has been known that many insurance companies tend to deny individuals essential health care based on their genetic disposition (Anonymous , 2005) .
Secondly , it may create psychological distress in family members if the genetic test results were to be revealed .
As genetic diseases can be inherited among family members , anxiety and fear of inheriting the genetic diseases that the individual has been diagnosed will be created .
Therefore , the individual should have the final say in disclosing his genetic results as doing so may bring about several negative impacts .
However , some may argue that revealing of the genetic test results of an individual would  protect other family members .
Indeed , early knowledge of the risk to genetic diseases might help family members to take preventive measures to reduce the onset of such diseases .
However , one should not forget that once the genetic result of the individual is disclosed , it might be difficult for the individual to integrate into the society as he may be discriminated against .
There will be benefits to other parties but adverse implications for the individual .
Therefore , the individual requesting  a genetic test should have the final say on whether or not to reveal his test results .
In conclusion , revealing of test results may bring about several impacts on the individual as well as on third parties .
Hence , the individual should bear in mind the impacts that may arise and decide if he should reveal such results .
Genetic testing is a method that diagnoses an individual's diseases based on their genes through biochemical measurements .
Since it  , it has received as much criticism as compliments because of the risk of infringing on the tested individual's privacy .
There are many controversies about whether  individuals have the right to decide whether or not to disclose their results .
I am inclined toward recognising the right of individuals to decide whether or not to reveal their genetic test outcome outcome .
Publicizing an individual's result can bring about big impacts on them , such as having to face discrimination by their families ,  .
Therefore , the tested individual should have the right to decide whether to disclose his results to others .
Genetic testing predicts an individual's inherent risks developing a genetic disease .
Depending on the seriousness of the disease , the individual decides whether to reveal his diagnosis .
Sometimes , if his family and relatives know about his result , they may start to change their behaviour towards the individual .
This may worsen the situation .
Since moral support is indispensable for  , it will evidently cause depression in the individual and exacerbate the individual's chance of developing the disease .
There is also another noticeable problem , which is that the individual might not even want to worry his whole family .
Insurance companies will utilize the results to overcharge people .
For example , some African American workers , in the early 1970s ,  who had the genetic mutation associated with sickle-cell anemia were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums (Andrews , 1987) .
Similarly , in 2002 , the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company had to pay up to $2 .2 million to employees who were secretly tested for a genetic variation for a disorder (Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company , 2002) .
(Karen Norrgard , 2008) .
Moreover , forcing the individual to publicize his result could bring about a new caste system where people are grouped according to their genome .
This group of people may have their rights denied  them as they belong to the lower class  .
Would this not be simply a more sophisticated kind of discrimination ?
In conclusion , due to the serious impact on one's life , we should let the individual  decide whether or not to reveal genetic results .
Genetic testing has been widely used in the society of modern times .
It allows a person to know if he has a genetic disorder  .
This seems like a good idea but whether to reveal the testing result is a controversy .
Some may feel that revealing the results may be viewed as invading the tested individual's privacy , while in fact not revealing the results can be seen as being irresponsible .
There are family members , friends and employers  .
Thus , due to the implications of a positive genetic test result for many other people , the tested individual should not have the final say on whether to reveal his genetic test result or nor .
An individual who wishes to start a family with his spouse should reveal his testing result .
Marriage and having children are not just between the couple; it also involves the two families of the couple .
Some people are carriers of genetic disorders they have the genes even if they do not show the disease themselves (Genetic Testing n .d .) .
Thus , the unborn child may have the chance to get the disorder from his parents .
It is hence the responsibility of  individuals who are carriers of a genetic risk to tell their family members the likely outcome of the unborn child .
Therefore , individuals intending to have children need to reveal their testing result .
Some  argue that revealing the test result will attract discrimination such as being viewed as an outcast of the society .
For instance , they may be denied insurance due to their disorder .
However , revealing the result can be seen  .
They can make sure that their workers with genetic disorders are not exposed to any environment that may agitate their illnesses (Andre , C . , & Velasquez , M . n .d .) .
Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their workers (Andre , C . , & Velasquez , M . n .d .) .
However , this can only be done if individuals reveal their testing result .
In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say on whether to reveal their genetic test results as any disorder that they may be found out will affect their family and  revealing the result will allow their employer to provide them a safe working environment .
Advances in genetic testing allow one to detect the presence of abnormal genes which could cause genetic disorders .
This has brought about many debates on whether the individual who undergoes genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results .
While some proponents suggest that this is the privacy of the individual who undergoes the genetic testing ,  the test results might also have adverse effects on those who are closely related to that person .
Hence , the individual undergoing the genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the results .
Firstly ,  an individual with positive genetic test results has no right to keep the test results to himself .
He needs to inform his wife in order for them both make wise decisions if they were to start a family (When Do Doctors Recommend Genetic Testing ? , n .d .) .
For instance , they need to discuss  whether  the disorder can be prevented from being passed on to the next by them not having children .
Alternatively , they can test and abort the fetus affected with the genetic disease .
Hence ,  affects not only the person with the genetic disease , but also his life partner .
Many critics claim that individuals with positive genetic test results should have the right not to reveal their test results to potential employers .
They argue that the job applicants should not be discriminated against just because of the positive genetic test result (Andre and Velasquez , n .d .) .
However , with the knowledge of employees' genetic disorders , employers can better reduce the occurrence of work-related diseases .
Employers can use the information acquired from genetic testing to ensure that their employees are not exposed to environmental agents that might cause them to have an increased risk for genetic disorders .
This can ultimately lead to the reduction of work-days lost .
In conclusion , the individual requesting for genetic test should not have the final say in disclosing his test result as it affects not only him alone but also his family and employer .
Nowadays , the development of technology has been going on rapidly .
An instance of such development is genetic testing .
On one hand , it is very useful to diagnose many kinds of genetic disease .
IOn the other hand , it is a dilemma  .
I strongly claimed that he should not have the final sayand they shouldn't have the right not to disclose it .
First and foremost , a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his prospective spouse or fiancee about his genetic testing result because some people who have abnormal genes inherited from their parents won't have observable symptoms of  the disease but will have a 50:50 chance of inheriting the disease to their children (Genetic Testing , 2007) .
By telling to their spouse priorly , they can take  before planning to have children .
The second reason is an obligation to tell his employer about his genetic condition .
Some people may argue that it is unfair to use  genetic tests in the recruitment of employees  because it is treating people discriminatively based on a fixed characteristic (Andre , Velasquez , n .d .) .
However , the main purpose of employment genetic screening  is to make sure that the  job is safe and does not cause complications or any bad effects for potential employees prone to havingthis kind of diseases .
Hence , genetic testing for job screening purpose isn't violating employees' right .
The last reason is regarding the sake of  people around him .
Carriers of genetic risks perceive a strong sense of responsibility to share information about their genetic condition with others (Loescher , Crist , Siaki , 2009) .
To sum up , anyone who is suffering from a genetic diseaseor is a carrierr of thedisease should not have the final say in whether to reveal or to hide information about his disease .
Instead , it should be a must for him to disclose his disease to his spouse to save their baby from inheriting the disease , to his employer to make sure that his job is for him and to all people around him to fulfil his sense of responsibility .
Revealing his genetic testing result will be beneficial to himself , his employer , his family and all the people around him .
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an automatic identification system that is used to identify people and items by the transmission of radio waves (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
The use of RFID to track people has invaded privacy and caused a breach to security .
In addition , human implantation of RFID may bring about health and medical problems .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it would bring about negative impacts on the society .
There are two main reasons why using RFID to track people should be banned .
Firstly , it will cause impingement on privacy and security .
The use of RFID to track people enables law enforcement agencies to know our every move: our location , what we have bought and other information about our lives .
These private information may also be accessed by other parties as the RFID can be decoded and may be subjected to viral threats (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
Criminals may have access to these information and this may put our life in danger as these criminals can easily harm us once they know our exact location .
Secondly , human implantation of RFID to track people may pose health problems .
Animal studies on these RFID microchips suggest that RFID implantation in humans may result in cancer (Paddock , 2007) .
In addition , the implanted chip in the skin may move to other parts of the body .
This will cause difficulty in removing the chip and this may lead to other more serious health problems .
Proponents of using RFID to track people argue that such usage of RFID is important in the medical field as it helps to monitor patients' health and enables the immediate retrieval of patients' information (Paddock , 2007) .
However , there is no guarantee that the RFID tag would be protected from security breaches .
As such , patients' medical information may leak out , which in turn may result in social discrimination against and loss of health care coverage forfor these patients .
Medical information stored in the RFID may also be altered by hackers and this would lead to error in diagnoses (Sieberg , 2006) .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it will cause invasion of privacy , security breaches as well as health problems when RFID chips are implanted into individuals .
In recent years , the advancements of 'Radio Frequency Identification' (RFID) have led to its increased use in many major organisations .
One of the uses of RFID has been to track people .
However , critics have been quick to point out that it is an intrusion of privacy and are calling for it to be banned .
However , I believe that the benefits of RFID used in tracking people far outweigh the 'uncertain' disadvantages and thus it should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID has been seen as a solution to track medical patients .
As mentioned by the "American Medical Association" (Roberti 2007) , RFID allows quick and accurate identification and access to patients' data in times of emergency .
This is to ensure "improved continuity and coordination of care" (Roberti 2007) and to reduce the probabilities of "adverse drug events and other medical errors" (Roberti 2007) .
Secondly , the use of RFID has been adopted in oil companies such as "Stratos" (Mehdizadeh 2007) to track and ensure workers' safety .
the integration of both RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS)  is used to locate workers during emergencies .
RFID can also authenticate if the worker has the right to access certain areas and use certain machineries .
However , critics have been quick to identify  the "unauthorised reading and changing of RFID data" (Tan and Li 2008) as an encroachment of privacy .
However , there have been measures  put in place such as the usage of "Authentication" (Tan and Li 2008) to identify  .
This prevents "counterfeiting behaviours" and helps to "control access to label contents" (Tan and Li 2008) .
Detractors have also argued that "RFID may cause electromagnetic interference" (Roberti 2007) , exposing the user to the dangers of magnetic interference .
Nevertheless , , there has not been a formal report confirming that worry .
In conclusion , I believe that the usage of RFID in tracking humans should not be banned as the advantages of its usage outweigh its disadvantages .
And I have absolute trust in scientists to iron out the flaws to make RFID truly the "perfect" solution to the limitations of many existing technologies .
Genetic testing is used to examine the genes of a patient or a latent patient , in order to analysis the causes of some diseases .
It is now widespread and ranging from testing the congenital defect of a foetus to finding the existence of the oncogene .
However , with the application of genetic testing , some problems are revealed gradually , such as whether  patients should tell his or her families about their testing results .
In fact , everyone has to be responsible for the health of their family and himself or herself , hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the testing results; these results should be made known to their relatives .
Firstly , it is immoral for a person to conceal his genetic testing results .
These results will not only affect this person but also affect his families .
It means that when a person tests positive for a gene mutation , his relatives may also have this mutation since they all have similar genes .
If the person does not tell his family about the test results , his family members would not know their health deficiencies and would not tell their doctors .
In this case , the person's family members  likely suffer from such diseases and will miss  early diagnosis  .
Secondly , such concealment will become a source of dispute in marriage .
For example , if a man's genetic testing results indicated some pathogenic genes but he got married with a woman without telling her about these results , the woman might feel that she has been cheated after she knew the truth because she did not want to marry  a man with gene deficiency .
In addition , if they already have children and their children also have such pathogenic genes through heredity , who should be responsible for these children's health problems ?
A genetic test is a test which uses laboratory techniques to determine whether an individual has a genetic disease or is possible to get the disease (Genetic Testing , n .d .) .
The result of genetic testing can affect the lives of individuals , their families and also the society .
Thus , the individual who requests   genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of the test for the sake of himself and also his family members .
There are two main arguments to support my stand .
Firstly , a couple who is planning to get married and one of them or a close relative  has an inherited disease , is advised to take up genetic testing .
The result of such a genetic test affects not only an individual but also affects his family and his fiance .
Both sides of family members should have the right to know the result and to be able to take preventive and treatment measures .
Furthermore , if the couple is planning to give birth but one of them has a positive result from such testing , they can discuss with their close family members whether to have a baby or not .
Thus , it is not right for the individual taking such a test to keep the result as a secret .
Furthermore , in my opinion , employers have the right to know such a result to ensure that their prospective or current employees are not placed in environments that might be hazardous to them and also can react immediately if something happens (Claire Andre and Manuel Velasquez , n .d .) .
If the individual has the final say to decide whether to reveal the result , it is unfair for his close family and also people who are related to him if the individual decides to keep the result to him .
Others argue that it is unfair for the individual as the result is a kind of confidential information .
However , by not disclosing  such a result , the consequences are serious .
The risk of giving birth to a child with an inherited genetic disease is high and also endangers the individual by exposing himself to a work environment that may be hazardous to his health .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing for the sake of himself , his closed family and also his employer .
A genetic test is defined as an assessment of a person's genes to determine the probablitity of inheriting abnormalities or diseases  which he may pass down the generations .
Thus , many will say the results must also be made known to his relatives even without his consent .
However , one should has the right to decide for himself whether he should tell his results to a third party e .g .
relatives or corporations .
It is obvious that everyone have the right to ensure his or her privacy , as these are what make us different from animals .
Thus , as fellow Homo Sapiens , each and every one has the right to decide for himself .
Proponents may argue that  doctors should also release  genetic testing results to  relatives as these may also involve them .
However , it would be ridiculous that the relatives  to know that they might also face this particular genetic disease in the future from the individual's results since everyone has a unique genome unless they are twins .
And also even if two individuals are somehow blood related , the probability of them inheriting the same particular genetic disorder is different .
When one is denied of the right to his or her own privacy , the consequences are definitely undesirable .
Some of the implications may be in the case of an insurance where some are  overcharged according to the results .
For instance , "during the early 1970s , a number of African Americans who were known to be carriers for the mutation associated with sickle-cell anemia were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums" (Andrews , 1987) .
This clearly shows what had happened when the privacy of the results is not ensured .
This situation could have been avoided if the individual could decide for himself , as he would be able to weigh the pros and cons better since it concerns his  life .
In conclusion , there could be some laws passed down to settle all these ethical issues .
Ultimately , it still does not solve the root of these problems and  unforeseen situations in the future .
Therefore , rights should be given to the individual to decide for himself , as the decisions made will be impactful and irreversible  .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
The development and advances in surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) have made it possible to track anyone , anything , any place , anytime .
This has brought about many debates on the ethics , human rights , privacy and even health concerns surrounding the use of RFID .
Although some argue that the use of RFID to track people brings benefits , it  exposes one's privacy to criminals , which is against  human rights and perhaps , threatens one's health .
Thus , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
The use of RFID to track people is against human rights and violates one's privacy .
By using RFID technology , one's personal information , purchased goods and whereabouts can be tracked easily by private corporations or governments (DiLorenzo 2008) .
Worse , hackers and analysts can remotely read the information from RFID which stores private information such as your credit card passwords , medical history and location (Sieberg 2006) .
Although some argue that RFID technology that stores one's information in RFID such as credit card or identity card provides great convenience , it creates chances for criminals as well  .
Furthermore , tracking one's private information is against human rights .
Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation .
Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks .
Health concerns are also related to the use of RFID to track people .
Some companies have implanted RFID microchips in their staff to track their locations and information .
However , some studies showed that lab mice and rats sometimes developed sarcomas , or malignant tumors , after being implanted with microchips (Paddock 2007) .
Although humans are different from lab mice , there is a risk that what happened on the mice might happen on humans as well .
Furthermore , if the microchips react with a strong electrical or magnetic field , the implant could be destroyed and cause serious burns .
The result of the test is the property of these people .
Thus , others should never be allowed to reveal or look into it without the permission of the owner .
This is to prevent others from using the information to discriminate against them .
For example , an employer might choose not to hire or to fire someone if he is to find out that the person has a certain disease such as cancer or Huntington disease (Maxwell & Mehlman , 1999) .
This might cause greater problems to the person involved especially if he is the breadwinner of the family .
Another social consequence would be when individuals are discriminated against in health coverage based on their genetic make-up .
For example , insurance companies might increase the premiums of customers who are at risk for a certain disorder or even cancel their policy .
This discrimination would be very unfair to the individuals involved (Norrgard , 2008) .
Therefore , these individuals should always have the final say .
While it may be difficult even for the individual to accept the results of the test , sharing the news with his or her relatives and friends may be the larger concern .
While some may feel that it is the moral obligation of the individual to inform his immediate family members of positive results of inheritable diseases such as cancer or HD , since they too may inherit the disease , I feel that there is no need for such an action as the result is after all private and confidential .
Also , certain genetic tests such as the test for disorders of sexual development are a very private matter .
If an individual is to be tested positive for this disorder , such that she has the genotype for males but has phenotype for females , she might be ostracised and suffer self-esteem problems (Borenstein , 2009) .
If these individuals have the final say on whether to share the result , they would be less stressed as they do not have to be concerned with the views of others whom they do not want to share the result with .
This would give them more time to adjust to their personal emotion .
In conclusion , the final say on whether to reveal the results of such testing should always lie on the individual who has requested  the test .
With the advances in medical technology , it is now possible to identify one's genetic susceptibilities to certain diseases and disorders .
Despite the fact that genetic testing can bring about more opportunities for early discoveries of treatable disorders , there are still many controversies revolving around ethical issues on genetic testing .
Many argue that revelation of testing results may invade personal privacy and bring about discrimination .
Besides ethical implications , medical implications such as accuracy of test results are also concerns the general public hold about the issue .
Therefore , with these concerns , it is important that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The two main ethical concerns regarding genetic testing are privacy and discrimination .
Firstly , privacy is one of the worries one will have while considering whether or not to carry out genetic testing .
The fear for disclosure of results to third parties might discourage people from participating in the testing although the test might be favourable to them .
Furthermore , health care providers might also reveal the person's genetic status to concerned family members which in turn might weaken our confidence in the providers (Holtzman , 1996) .
Secondly , information from genetic testing of individuals with genetic susceptibilities is used by employers and insurance companies to deny them employment as well as to grant lower insurance coverage .
This is generally known as discrimination (Holtzman , 1996) .
With reference to a survey conducted by Georgetown University , out of 332 families with genetic susceptibilities , "22% reported they had been refused health insurance , and 13% had been fired from their jobs based on their perceived genetic risks" (Of Genes and Pink Slips: Genetic Testing Goes to Work , 2005) .
Up to date , not many laws have been passed down to protect the rights of people with higher genetic risks .
However , some would argue that such discrimination against employees is fair as an employee with genetic susceptibility to a known disease might bring about deleterious effects to the company's operations and other employees .
Alternatively , companies should allocate another job which is more suitable and does not put the employee at risk (Holtzman , 1996) .
This way , both parties benefit and there is no unfair discrimination .
In conclusion , individuals requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing so as to protect oneself from discrimination and invasion of privacy .
Nowadays , genetic testing has caused ethical and moral issues .
One of them is about the privacy and confidentiality of the individual who undergoes genetic testing , whether he or she should reveal testing results of the testing to third parties or not .
While it is true that people's individual rights should be respected ,  if others can be saved through revelation of the results  , then it should be done .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The reason why most people want to protect their privacy of genetic information is because they fear discrimination .
In 2008 , a survey regarding genetic testing of more than 4000 people conducted in America found that 93 percent of respondents said it was important that it be illegal for insurers or employers to get their information (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act Passes U .S . Senate , 2008) .
People are afraid that the revelation of their genetic testing results would be misused by third parties such as employers and health insurers .
They fear that they would denied insurance or that their policies are canceled (Mehmaln ,1999) .
In fact , this fear is groundless because in truth several laws at the federal and state levels help protect people against genetic discrimination .
With the approval of GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act) in May 2008 , they do not have to worry anymore .
There are several advantages in revealing the results of genetic testing to third parties .
It is also commonly known that if a person has genetic disease , there is a chance that his or her relatives would have the same disease too .
If  genetic testing is revealed to  relatives and they end up having the same disease , they could be saved by preventing the disease to develop further  .
Another thing is people's life is obviously more important than privacy , especially if it is one's loved ones .
Therefore , it is encouraged to reveal the results of genetic testing , especially to  relatives .
In conclusion , the individual undergoing genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing as he or she is protected by the laws against discrimination and also because other people's life could be saved .
Surveillance technology on the public have been an issue for a long time .
Privacy has been commonly used to outweigh the aspects for safety and security .
Surveillance technology should not be banned .
By allowing proper usage of surveillance technology , one could increase the level of security and safekeeping in a country as well as improve work efficiency at the workplace .
The use of surveillance technology could increase the level of security and safekeeping of a country .
By using video surveillance technology specifically at appropriate places , it could help the government protect the public more efficiently such as preventing the crimes before it happened (Gray , 2009 , p .1) .
As reported in the news last year , West Virginia decided to use video surveillance technology on its highways to help  find missing children (Stump , 2008 , p .1) which resulted in one hundred percent recovery of these children (Stump , 2008 , p .2) .
Moreover , it can also help improve  work efficiency at the workplace , more commonly in office work settings .
In an office set-up , the atmosphere is created by separating employees into cubicles .
The cubicles allow employees to do things unrelated to work and employers are unable to push  employees to get the work done when the latter spend more than half the time using the facilities available for their own indulgence .
Thus , by setting up  electronic surveillance to keep track of  employees' usage of facilities , the employees will become more 'aware' of their situation and start taking their jobs more seriously , improving work efficiency (Heathfield , n .d . , p .1) .
Genetic testing is a medical test used to diagnose the disorder in the genome of a person and determine if this mutation can cause a specific disease .
With the development of ability to test for genetic disorder , an arising problem that has been "the subject of significant debate within the bioethics community" (Mehlman , 1999 , para .5) is the privacy of genetic information .
Generally , the  problem is that genetic information should not be disclosed against people's privacy .
The choice to undergo genetic testing of an individual is personal .
However , before deciding to undergo the test , the patient has to face the fear that his testing result may be disclosed and used against his welfare .
The  patients' concerns are their employment and insurance because it is usually difficult for them to obtain these if their genetic information is revealed .
To be concrete , an employer may not want to retain a person with a disease caused by genetic disorder .
An insurance company may reject a customer , without prevention , for his disorder in genome because his medical bills may be costly .
Another case  is in sports , where there are situations of  birth defect "disorders of sexual development" (Borenstein , 2009 , para .1) .
Some athletes only found out their defects when they were given genetic testing before a competition; they were banned from the competition and this information then would be all public .
All these are called genetic discrimination .
However , one person cannot either control his genetic structure or prevent the disorder himself , therefore , it is unfair to refuse his interest .
To protect the welfare of patients with genetic problems , their genetic information should not be disclosed over their objection or even without their permission .
But in fact , some argue that revealing this information can protect some third parties from harm , for example , enable the avoidance of inherited disorder .
Thus , there should be strict laws to ensure patients' right to decide on revealing their testing results , which means it definitely needs their permission to do so .
In conclusion , until these laws are enacted , not revealing such information without patients' consent and using other method like alias testing are  better choices .
To elaborate , the benefiworkplacesveillance might be classified into two categories .
Firstly , the monitoring system at wortwoace indeed effectively drives employees to perform better .
Meanwhile , surveillance on lax supervisorsbenefitsidently verify their incompetence (Heathfield , n .d) .
Namely , mutual surveillance guarantees active working environments , as well as bringing high productivity and huge profits to the employers .
Secondly , as Mr . Gray , Mayor of Lancaster , states , the use of surveillance technologies plays a utilitarian role in public security and criminals detecting (Gray , 2009) .
For instance , video cameras in supermarkets can detect anyone suspicious of stealing or record the process of a burglary .
Sometimes criminals will be deterred if they are aware of the hidden surveillance .
Furthermore , the tracking of criminals using hi-tech sensors or video cameras largely shortens the chasing time of the police (Stump , 2008) .
Concerns of privacy issues might be crucial to constructing regulations on the implementation , however , the solutions the workplaceant thus the banning of surveillance technology is utterly unnecessary .
To illustrate , companies shall not be allowed to monitor phone calls expect for busi ,efor example ,ated ones (Heathfield , n .d .) .
Simultaneously , the safeguards should be briefeds their integrity so as not to reveal annformation obtained through surveillance; strict penalties should be enforced on those who fail to preserve privacy (Gray , 2009) .
The monitoring sysdetection of criminalsarly assessed to prevent privacy invasion .
To sum upwithsurveillachnology should not be banned as its usefulness iorkplace and en , However ,blic safety makes it an indispensable tool in today's world .
Surveillance in context is the close observation of a person or a group .
In the past , surveillance was conducted through human to human tracking .
With advances in technology , surveillance nowadays is aided by equipment such as closed-circuit TV (CCTV) , camera , voice recorder and RFID (radio frequency identification) .
This has brought about debates on ethical and moral issues with regards to the usage of surveillance technology especially RFID .
There may be arguments that surveillance technology is beneficial to humans in this modern era .
While not compromising the benefits it brings , the ethical and moral issues regarding surveillance technology far outweigh the benefits it brings .
Thus , it should be banned .
Surveillance technology can be classified into three groups .
They are visual , audio and data surveillance (Bogonikolos , 1999) .
Visual surveillance refers to CCTV and camera .
While it may have its advantages of being able to record down the scene of the location it is allocated ,  the issue on privacy and effectiveness sets in .
CCTV is installed at homes and offices for employers to check on their employees namely the maids at home and the workers in the office .
This causes employees to have low morale during work , and thus reduces work efficiency when the aim of the CCTV is otherwise .
The privacy of the employees has also been infringed .
Audio surveillance refers to telephone bugging and premises bugging using a tube mike .
This is also a human rights issue as it has invaded a person's privacy (Bogonikolos , 1999) .
Data surveillance refers to RFID; it is used in everyday context .
It can be used to track down humans , pets and equipment (Getz , 2009) .
In health care industries , patients are being tagged and tracked (Getz , 2009) .
It has raised privacy issues as not everyone is willing to let others know of his or her whereabouts .
There could be abuse of the system as it could lead to information falling into the wrong hands .
In conclusion , the disadvantages of surveillance technology outweigh the advantages .
The effectiveness is in doubt , human rights are invaded and there could be abuse of this technology .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say on whether to reveal the results of such testing .
With current technological advancements in genetics , there are many genetic tests available for the public , from testing for inheritance diseases and terminal illnesses .
I believe that an individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The individual should be given the choice , as the emotional hurt from the media release of these ividual .
However , professional assistance should be available for the individual to seek advice .
Firstly , the emotional hurt from the world wide release of the individual's genetic information be .
With the outreach of the mass media , reports of genetic disorder of an individual could be known to the world in minutes .
(Seth , 2009) This will cause humiliation , especially when he/she is a professional , like an athlete .
However , many of these genetic disorders are until , inherited and incurable .
(Seth , 2009) The Olympics have tested their female athletes over five games and found 27 out of 11373 women tested positive for hermaphrodite (Seth , 2009) .
Genetic testing is the analysis of genes , chromosomes , RNA and proteins .
It is used to predict the risk of disease , identify carriers of disease , diagnose disease (Genetic Testing , 2006 , para 1) , and can also be used to determine parents of the child .
Genetic testing includes scientific methods in biology , chemistry , and sometimes even biochemical tests .
Nowadays , as the technology develops , individuals have more approaches to such tests .
However , such people requesting genetic tests should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of the tests .
Firstly , if someone discovers that he or she has a particular mutation , the existence of that knowledge has immediate implications for the person's blood relatives (Skene , 2003) .
When they are informed of the potential risk of the mutation that could lead to a genetic disease that is also hereditary , they can undergo their own genetic tests in order to determine the extent of the mutation risk as soon as possible .
If they are positive , they can undertake a further diagnostic procedure for whether any physical symptom will developg .
If necessary , they can receive the proper medical treatment in time , for instance , prophylactic surgery .
When the first genetic tester does not want to reveal the results , blood relatives will not be alerted to the existence of the risk , and then it will be too late for them to get effective intervention . 
Secondly , when the result of a particular genetic test is beneficial to the whole society , researchers have the  right to disclose the outcome outcome .
As we know , scientists all over the world are working together to make people's lives better by studying the genome of human and other organisms .
In doing such a significant project , they need numerous different genes to work on .
Sometimes discovering an insignificant phenomenon or test results and  it can really make a breakthrough .
Hence , when an individual requesting genetic testing comes up with an interesting exploration , it may change the perspective in looking into the subject , for instance , treating cancer , AIDS or some hereditary diseases .
As a result , these individuals should not have the final say in hiding their results .
In contrary , the results should be shared among scientists and researchers for the whole world's sake .
In conclusion , individuals who request genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the results  for two major reasons: protecting their blood relatives from genetic disorders and helping the whole society for genetic researchs .
Advances in technology have made surveillance technology so common nowadays .
Surveillance technology is the electronic equipment used to monitor the behavior and activities , usually of people without their permission .
Arguments on  banning  the use of surveillance technology has been going on for years .
The use of surveillance technology should not be banned because it is useful in ensuring  public safety and monitoring workplace in a company .
The use of surveillance technology should not be banned because it can bring important benefits to us .
Firstly , in companies , surveillance technology is used to monitor employees at work (Heathfield , n .d . , p .1) .
Employees might seem to be surfing the web for business purposes at all times , but what they are actually doing is personal business such as online banking , shopping and chatting .
If the behavior of employees at work is monitored , they will work more efficiently and contribute to the company .
Secondly , surveillance technology helps in enhancing and ensuring public security (Gray , 2009 , para .1) .
Tracking of missing or kidnapped children (Stump , 2008 , para .1) , movement of dangerous criminals and terrorists can be done using video and satellite surveillance .
The cameras have the function of identifying , detecting and recording vehicles' number , suspects' actions and  illegal organizations'  .
These help the police to solve cases , especially criminal and traffic cases , in the shortest time .
Arguments put forth in support of banning the use of surveillance technology are faulty .
It has been argued that one's privacy might be invaded (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , monitoring can take place under suitable circumstances and to an appropriate extent .
It has also been said that surveillance of employees can affect the relationship between employer and employees (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , this only applies to those minority groups spending most of the time online doing personal things and not meeting the company's goals .
Usage of surveillance technology has no impact on those focusing on work and doing the right thing (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned as it benefits  us in public security and also business efficiency .
Development and advancement in the field of genetic research has challenged the scientists and the public on a wide range of issues especially issues relating ethical concerns .
Although it seems that confidentiality of the test result is a personal matter , disclosure of such result would eventually benefit the community as a whole in the long run .
Therefore , the result of genetic testing should be revealed without the consent of the person who requested it .
Firstly , result of genetic testing should be fully disclosed as it enables a third party to get treatment or prevention before the condition worsens (Maxwell & Mehlman , 1999) .
By and large , genetic disorders can be inherited within family members as the defective gene might be passed on from one generation to another .
The decision to reveal a genetic test result such as that for breast cancer would help early detection and treatment .
Some may argue that disclosure of such results would cause discrimination towards the patients .
However , Science Daily (2008) notes that Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) has been approved to forbid an insurance company from discriminating through reduced coverage or pricing and prohibits employers from making adverse employment decisions in order to encourage more people to undergo genetic tests  , which could save lives in the long run .
Secondly , revealing the result of genetic testing would help in making important life decisions .
In the case of Huntington's disease , a lethal genetic disorder , the result is also desired by family members and potential mates as it would help them to make important decisions , such as whether or not to have children or abort an affected fetus .
Under this circumstance , the final say of revealing the result should lie with the physician , who has a better understanding on the patient's condition .
Although the general agreement seems that disclosure of testing result should not override the patient's objection , this would be an exception if it is to protect a third party to avoid other serious consequences (Mehlman & Maxwell , 1999) .
In conclusion , the result of genetic testing should be revealed without the consent of the person who requested it as this would not only enable a third party to get early prevention or treatment but also help others to make life decisions .
Genetic testing is able to analyze whether a subject is confirm to develop or inherit a particular genetic disease .
It assures the patient whether they are a carrier or will develop the disease .
Although the results are beneficial , it has implicated family members who are genetically common .
But are they able to inform the family members to safeguard their personal health and yet not breach the issues of confidentiality and privacy ?
My stand is as long disclosure has no serious social/ethical consequences , the subject will have the final say .
In an increasing debate on genetic testing , there are three issues which have caused concerns in the society .
Firstly , the ethical aspect of privacy and confidentiality need to be preserved .
If privacy and confidentiality are breached , family members and third parties'  may acquire test results of no welfare to the subject (Mehlmanm , 1999 , The Privacy of Genetic Information , para .
2) .
Secondly , social aspects of genetic discrimination have made subjects reconsider genetic testingtesting as the information might be used  against them .
(Norrgard , 2008 , Genetic Testing and Privacy Concerns , para 1) .
Third parties like employers may sack their employees , or insurers may reject an insurance application if they came to be aware of the results .
Genetic discrimination have placed privacy and confidentiality in jeopardy , because subjects have no control over their genetic makeup .
Last , but not least are family issues as people may have to change their life-style , reproductive decisions , seek medical prevention or treatment .
But are they allowed to inform their own condition to family members who are also at exposure risk ?
According to an article (Mehlmanm , 1999 , The Privacy of Genetic Information) , using Alias testing , particular information can  remaining anonymous .
Anonymity allows subjects to have the final decision to reveal the test results to their family or even third partiesparties , so privacy and confidentiality are not violated .
In conclusion , genetic testing is bound to bring ethical or social consequences if privacy and confidentiality are not met .
A regulatory framework such as Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act has ensured genetic discrimination is legislated .
By imposing a law , people feel safer to undergo genetic testing; being the deciding factor to disclose their genetic results to family members or third party under their obligations .
Advances in technology and reduced costs in chip production have led to the proliferation of surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) to track people .
While the use of this seemingly intrusive technology is shrouded in concerns over privacy , morality and health issues , its benefits benefits , both current and latent latent , should not be overlooked .
With those concerns mitigable by proper regulation in the usage of the technology , it is further illustrated that the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
One pivoting reason  why RFID should not be banned is its application to augment public and national security .
Repeated offenders and past sexual criminals can be tracked via RFID to allow for preventive measures if they are detected near places where they usually commit their crimes in .
(Brady , 2008 , para .
6) Similarly , monitoring of terrorist suspects for any suspicious movements and contact to insurgent groups can be aided by a RFID implant .
Furthermore , these suspects could then benefit from the freedom unobtainable inside of detention centres , while simultaneously alleviating the problems faced by overcrowded prisons (McKay , 2008) .
Without RFID , these would be nearly impossible due to limited security manpower .
With proper regulation and use , RFID tagging may , on the contrary to many arguments , ensure greater freedom and privacy given to the person implanted with RFID .
For example , as an alternative to incarceration , criminal suspects could opt to be electronically monitored in the outside world (How fair , n .d . , para .
7) .
While some may argue that such technology may be misused , laws such as imposing a mandatory need of consent from the people involved and a restriction to the ownership of RFID readers can be instituted instead of a total ban .
Rapid advances in genetic research and technology led to important advances in the detection of genetic conditions and diseases (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
Genetic testing has , however , raised ethical concerns like whether the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say on whether to reveal the results of such testing (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
There are severe consequences if the results are not handled and communicated properly by third parties .
Therefore , individuals should have the final say .
Individuals are to be treated equally as required by law unless there are relevant reasons like differences in skill , knowledge or experience (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
However , it is very likely that employers will use the results to discriminate employees based on unfounded perceptions of health risks and possible future disabilities (Chris and Bryn 2002) (Neil and Ronald 2006) .
Likewise ,  insurance companies may make use of the results to charge a higher premium or not provide insurance because of possible chances of high medical bills in the future (Chris and Bryn 2002) (Neil and Ronald 2006) .
Doctors have to adhere to medical ethics , in which they are required to respect the confidentiality of the patients (Thirumoorthy 2009) .
Both the Hippocratic Oath and International Code of Ethics states that without the prior consent from the patientdoctors are not allowed to disclose any information which he has obtained (Thirumoorthy 2009) .
Hence , by revealing the genetic testing result without permission from the individual , it constitutes a breach of medical confidentiality .
Even to family members , individuals should have the final say .
Like the phrase , "Ignorance is bliss" , if the results are not related to the family members or they have lower risk of getting the genetic disorder , telling them may cause unnecessary worries (Agatha , Denise and Kathleen 2009) (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
There are also considerations like age and maturity  (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
If the family member is old and no longer under high risk or a child who is too young to be at risk , there is no need to reveal disturbing results that may cause potential psychological harm to them (Agatha , Denise and Kathleen 2009) (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
Some individuals may also be waiting for the "right time" , such as avoiding the need to disrupt or jeopardize major life events like graduation , marriage , pregnancy , childbirth (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
In addition , the individual might not even be close to their family members .
In fact , there may even be bad blood between them .
The family members may instead use the results against the individual .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say on whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
In this 21st century , modern technology has advanced to a stage where radio frequency identification (RFID) is implanted into people to locate and identify them .
RFID is a chip that has a small antenna to transmit a vast amount of information from a human's body to a computer using a scanner (Sade , 2007 , p . 1) .
RFID enhances productivity in the healthcare system , helps to monitor ex-offenders and also helps to locate missing personnel .
Thus , due to the benefits brought about by RFID , it should not be banned .
Firstly , the use of RFID to identify patients enhances productivity in the healthcare system (Sade , 2007 , p .2) .
The use of RFID can minimize the long registration time for patients so that they are able to seek treatment in the shortest possible time .
When a patient goes to the hospital , his medical records which are already stored in a RFID tag can be immediately traced  using the RFID scanner .
In doing so , waiting time could be greatly minimized and many more innocent lives will be saved .
Hence , the use of RFID is greatly beneficial in the medical field .
Secondly , implanting RFID tags into ex-offenders facilitates the authorities in monitoring their activities .
Police will be alerted in the shortest possible time when these ex-offenders are in a position that may harm victims (Rfid based proximity sensor and alert system for fugitives , sex offenders , missing soldiers and the like description/claims , 2008) .
This helps to save innocent lives and reduce crime  in the country .
It also allows ex-offenders to have their freedom and at the same time , the police will be alerted when they commit a crime .
This gives the public a sense of security and hence , the use of RFID to monitor ex-offenders is beneficial to the society .
Technological advances have brought along pros and cons ever since it sets in to our daily lives .
One of the many technologies innovated is the surveillance technology , mainly RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) .
'Tracking' , in this context , is defined as both monitoring and identifying the location , behavior , activities and changing information such as medical information .
Admittedly , personal privacy will be intruded .
Nevertheless , it has the ability to track criminals , improve the efficiency of our healthcare system , as well as to expedite the cracking of criminal cases .
Therefore , owing to the significant advantages of RFID , it should not be banned .
Tracking activities plays a crucial role in identifying terrorists and monitoring ex-criminals .
By implanting the RFID tags in both groups , their location will remain known to the police force and relevant authorities , thus allowing consistent monitoring of activities .
It has always been a common objective between countries to wipe out terrorism (Rhea Wessel , 2006) so that world peace could be maintained .
Furthermore monitoring ex- criminals will not only forbid them from committing crimes again , but more importantly , allow the public to have a peace of mind employing them , subsequently making them feel accepted by the society .
Therefore , given the advantages of surveillance technology , it should not be banned .
Surveillance technology such as RFID can improve two components of our healthcare system .
Firstly , it cuts down on the waiting time to be attended to .
A scan on the tags allows healthcare personnel to instantly identify the medical information of patients .
Secondly , wasted time on retrieving essential information of patients during an emergency could be put into treating the patients (http://www .verichipcorp .com) .
Crucial moments could determine life and death .
Therefore , the RFID technology can better our healthcare system's efficiency .
Expediting the cracking of criminal cases is another point  why surveillance technology should not be banned .
Tracking locations could never be more important in cases such as kidnapping (http://www .verichipcorp .com) .
Crimes like this should be attended to in the shortest possible time as it may result in injuries or even death of victims .
Furthermore , it could lower the crime rate , thus benefiting all people .
Hence , surveillance technology can assist in cracking criminal cases .
Surveillance technology in the form of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) has brought about many improvements in the efficiency and procedure of our systems .
RFID is an electronic method of exchanging data over radio frequency waves .
My article will focus on the uses and advantages of RFID to track people .
Tracking is defined to be locating the whereabouts of a person and the identification of personal information .
I strongly believe that the proper handling of such technology will bring countless advantages and thus , the use of RFID to track people should not be banned .
The use of RFID to track criminals will improve the safety and security within a prison and ultimately , improve the overall national security .
Tracking criminals will allow the prison security to know the exact location of every inmate .
This will minimise the risk of violence and prisoners escaping .
This is  supported by statistics done by correctional institutions which show that cases of violence decreased by 65 percent when the RFID system was introduced (Casciato 2008) .
Even when such events occur , the investigation and the recapturing of those involved would be more easily dealt with the use of RFID .
Incorporating the use of RFID in the healthcare industry will improve the efficiency and current practice of the sector .
The storage of key medical records and information in a radio-transmitting chip will cut down time spent on rregistration , thus , allowing patients to receive prompt treatment .
In times of emergency  key information such as blood type and allergy could be retrieved in an instant by scanning the chip , and the most appropriate treatment can be decided in the shortest possible time .
This can prove to be vital in saving a person's life .
Lastly , the use of RFID to locate the whereabouts of children can help to reduce incidents of human trafficking .
In less developed countries like Cambodia , there is a large volume of children being trafficked and forced into labour and prostitution .
With the use of RFID to locate a victim , it will allow the authorities to capture the people behind such activities and provide a solution to the problem of human trafficking .
Technology is improving exponentially , especially for RFID .
RFID is widely used nowadays and it can be injected anywhere with its petite size of a grain of rice .
RFID has always been a double-edged sword .
It may bring us some benefits .
However , it has broughtt us even more disadvantages such as invasion of  privacy and abuse of technology .
Therefore , the use of surveillance technology for tracking people should be banned .
RFID can be easily exploited by third parties .
RFID tags can be easily put on one's clothing which information could be easily available to marketers , government agencies and criminals .
Therefore , all our information is at the trackers' fingertip which may include all our particulars-name , gender , photograph etc .
For example the Bush administration announced that all passports in US will be embedded with RFID (McCullagh & Broache , 2005) .
Although privacy issues are addressed by some security measures , it was criticized by computer engineers that their security levels are in poor condition .
Furthermore , technology would surpass the security measures in due course .
Thus , our information will be leaked to hackers then .
Critics may argue that RFID can be used to deter terrorism .
However , terrorists are normally trained to hide and conceal their feelings .
Furthermore , technically speaking RFID would track everyone before detecting a minority group of terrorists , hence efficiency of RFID is low .
Therefore , RFID should be banned for tracking people .
In all , RFID should be banned as it not only invades our privacy but may impose serious risk to our  body .
With the advancement  science and technology , potential diseases become predictable nowadays .
For instance , a ten year-old child could undergo  genetic testing and predict the risk of getting Huntingdon's disease in middle age .
This achievement , however , raises a controversy of whether an individual who requests genetic testing should have the final say to reveal or not reveal the results of such testing .
Since the disclosure might bring negative effects to the individual's family and induce discrimination in employment as well as the purchase of insurance , I would like to agree with the statement of having the right to decide the revealing of genetic test result .
When an individual is tested positive for hereditary disease , disclosure of the result might impact his family negatively .
Family tension would be created if the revealing of the result happens at inappropriate moment .
Agatha M . Gallo and her colleagues (2001) note that the decision of disclosing genetic testing result should be made by considering some major life events such as graduation and marriage (Am J Nurs . , 2001 , To disclose or not to disclose ?
section , 3) .
This is obvious and could be imagined that when the individual discloses the information to his brother who is doing preparation for the A-level final examination , for example , the latter would be overwhelmed withstresss whereby affecting his performance during the examination .
Technological advancements in the medical field today have offered us a variety of genetic tests .
Although this technology is beneficial to mankind , there is an ongoing controversy pertaining to the question on who should have the final say in revealing the test result to a third party .
While some may argue that doctors should reveal the result as it may directly affect a third party , we should still look into the concerns individuals have , such as the loss of employment and insurance after the results are made known , their rights to privacy and medical confidentiality and family considerations .
Firstly , all individuals should have the right to make decisions that will affect their future .
In recent years , the Council for Responsible Genetics (CRG) had found that employers and insurance companies are increasingly biased against people who tested positive in a genetic test .
This practice is currently known as 'Genetic Discrimination' (CRG 2001) .
With this practice in place , individuals will never be treated fairly and their prospects will not be bright , especially in this economic downturn .
Besides employment , individuals may also be denied the much needed insurance to protect themselves against any future mishaps (CRG 2001) .
Nowadays , with advanced medical technology , people can apply genetic testing to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins(Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
This kind of technique provides convincing results of the gene information that the individual carries .
While as it is more and more widely used in medical test , how to deal with the results appropriately brings fierce debates on ethic and other issues .
Some claim that the results of genetic testing belong to the  the person , therefore whether to reveal them should depend on the individual himself .
However , if the final decision just depends on the individual , it will not only curb the genetic research development but also delay the precaution of potential risk that some genes convey .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say on whether to reveal the results of such thing .
There are two consequences that the individual should not have the final say on whether to reveal the results .
Firstly , it leads to a difficult situation for the experts to explore and apply further study on genetic research .
Since for most people who take genetic testing , they do not acquire adequate knowledge of results in medical sense .
In this case , they would rather decide whether to reveal the results in their favor .
As genetic results are precious resources for gene technology development , the decision can only be made by the person .
This puts genetic researchers in an awkward position for they cannot use the information without his or her consent .
Secondly , keeping the results as a secret will delay the precaution of the potential genetic risk , especially those who have blood relationship .
According to the research , for a person tests positive for a gene mutation (a change in a person's genes) , their children , siblings , and parents automatically have a 50% chance of having the same mutation (Cancer .Net , 2009) .
In other words , genetic testing results are crucial evidence to identify potential genetic risk .
Therefore , the result should at least be shared with his or her relatives .
Otherwise , it will delay the precaution , especially the relatives , of the risk that genetic disease brings .
Firstly , surveillance technology performed on large population implies violation of privacy and civil rights .
Government agencies conduct mass surveillance on social networking sites , phone calls and broadband internet traffic hence covertly record civilian's private or confidential data .
In addition , corporate companies and central banks embedded RFID chips into products and paper notes with original purposes of tracking purchased products and cash passage between individuals .
(Yoshida , 2001; Eden 2005) However , an individual's anonymity and privacy will be gone simply when RFID scanners reveal one's personal interests , purchase records , money transaction and current location .
Likewise , modern corporate companies profaned employee's privacy by monitoring their performance at workplace , checking their email and phone log and tracking their movement at working hourshours (Moore , 2000) .
Hence , disclosure and storage of personal information of those under mass surveillance lead to invasion of privacy and confidentiality .
In addition , lump sum government expenditure on surveillance implementation and maintenance is considered resources wastage .
For instance , estimations suggest that installation of nationwide surveillance network around China will account for $33 billion by year 2010 , which is "around the same amount Congress has allocated for reconstructing Iraq" .
(Klein , 2008 , p . 6) Moreover , scientific research showed that majority public surveillance camera reduces crime merely to a slight degree which failed to overweigh annual equivalent cost .
(Gill & Spriggs , 2005) Nevertheless , poor image quality of surveillance camera video footage caused by excessive compression and minimized storage (Morton , 2005) space is considered worthless evidence to prosecute suspected offenders .
In fact , large amounts of government grants on surveillance technology implementation can be alternatively invested on issues of greater importance namely eradication of poverty , famine and diseases control .
Some data indicates that RFID technology can really help us a lot in saving the patients' lives , preventing errors caused by doctors and providing a more safe operation environment .
Firstly , it can give the patients more freedom by getting rid of those long and boring procedures CITATION Rap06 \l 2052 (Rapid adoption of RFID in healthcare , 2006) .
Usually these procedures require the patients to healthcare  efforts from the attendants .
much effortwhich requireSecondly , it can reduce the possibility of errors which may happen in the process .
One basic theory is using an electronic handshake spectrum to prevent the wrong procedures from happening .
It was reported that during the September 11 terrorist attacks , fire fighters wrote their names on their arms for fear that they would be unidentified by their family members if they were disfigured .
(Kanellos , 2004 , There's not a lot of middle ground on the subject of implanting electronic identification chips in humans , para 4) This news offers us food for thought if the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be permitted .
Admittedly , the use of surveillance technology may invade one's privacy .
Nonetheless , it is more persuasive to believe that surveillance technology helps in the tracking of properties and improvements in medical care .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned .
First and foremost , with the RFID surveillance technology , personal safety in public places can be enhanced .
By having RFID attached to a person , especially children , their whereabouts can be constantly watched by their parents and increases the safeguarding of their children .
However , there are issues concerning the dependence of technology instead of parents giving full attention towards their children by their own effort , and thus decreasing their sense of respostarted ity as a caretaker .
propagateFID tags , their ccausedn can remain safe and sound by lowering the case of being injured or luses the devices can detect straightaway if such situations happen .
Therefore , RFID tags are efficaciobenefiteitoring the situation of children .
Surveillance technology such as RFID also plays a pivotal role in health field .
Currently , a number of hospitals have begun to implement the attachment of RFID tags on patients in order to monitor and observe the patients from time to time .
It was also stated by Information Week (2005) , that RFID tags can be used to prevent newborn infants from being abducted by outsiders .
The tagging system is also a measure to deter the problems of having Alzheimer patients lost wandering at other places or patients collapsing outside of hospital area .
Signals will be transmitted caseshe hinjuryert lossnofof their which candbe detected Hence , with such surveillance technology , the risk of patients getting injured while getting lost outside can be reduced to a minimal percentage .
All in all , it cannot be denied that surveillance technology is important in securing a safe environment .
The impact of surveillance technology towards human lives is huge and can be frightening at times .
Moreover , the public has generated concern over the right of keeping their personal information in private .
Even though there are doubts and concerns towards the usage of surveillance technology for tracking purposes , it is still a central piece of the puzzle of human livesinIn a nutshell , surveillance technology such as RFID tags used to track people should not be banned .
Surveillance is no longer unfamiliar in the era of technology-based society .
Surveillance , according to Bogonikolos (1999) , is the systematic investigation or monitoring of behaviour or intercourse of one person or a group .
It is professionally used by the executive authorities and the governments , especially the Ministry of Defence .
Nonetheless , the generalization of certain simple surveillance technologies causes their existence  everywhere .
Although surveillance can be utilized widely in the aspects of health and medical , protection against terrorist attack and security purposes , abuse usage of such technology will bring us negative impacts .
Thus , in my opinion , surveillance should be banned under certain circumstances .
There is much controversy raised on the disadvantages of surveillance technology nowadays , particularly in term of privacy .
Privacy can be defined as "the condition of not having undocumented personal knowledge about one possessed by others" .
(D . Moore , 2000 , p .698) Recently , home surveillance becomes more well-liked among nuclear families .
Since most couples in this competitive era have their own business or enterprise , home surveillance is is installed installed in order to guard their residence .
However , this might cause severe effect in which home and individual privacies are invaded once the mechanism is hacked with a little technical skill .
Besides that , even though camera surveillance used in educational institutions is purposely to secure the safety of students , "the majority of the schemes evaluated did not reduce crime and even where there was a reduction this was mostly not due to CCTV; nor did CCTV schemes make people feel safer , much less change their behaviour ."
(Gill & Spriggs , 2005 , p .115) As a result , the setup of CCTV not only dissipates the expenditure , but also reduces the freedom space of students .
In conclusion , the effects of surveillance technology surrounding us is  based on both major and minor premises , which are privacy and right of freedom of individuals , as well as the psychological condition .
Hence , these have strengthened our standpoint that surveillance technology should be banned .
The use of surveillance technology is beneficial to people , particularly in terms of enhancing security and improving personnel safety .
Firstly , tracking people either through implants or wearable tags improves identification and hence , tightens access to restricted information or physical areas ((Kanellos , 2004: page no ?)) .
This type of technology also aid police in investigations and identification of offenders .
This will lower the likelihood of crime .
Criminals may think twice before committing a crime as they know they might be caught by the surveillance equipment (Kanellos , 2004 , para .

Secondly , surveillance technology can be used in healthcare and independent living for safeguarding purposes .
Besides allowing working adults to check on children and single-living elderly , this wireless interconnectivity technology are deployed in hospital to prevent abduction , enable health care professionals to get hold of patients' medical history , track individuals' whereabouts and send warning signals when patient collapses (Srivastava , 2007 , para .
12 ,13 , and 19; Kanellos , 2004 , para .
23) .
Hence , such use of surveillance technology should not be prohibited .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology would be constructive in  many aspects of our daily life as the benefits far outweigh the societal concerns .
As a result , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .

For decades , people have  been debating whether the use of surveillance technology should be bbanned .
They . . . privacy (Stanley . . .2003) .
However , imagine what would happen if we shut down all the surveillance technology in thcountry .
Banks will . . .
The purpose of using surveillance technology is to maintain social stability and to protect us and our assets .
Hence ,  . . . should not be banned .
RFID , security cameras , Global Positioning Systems (GPS) on mobile phone and some eavesdropping device are some of the common surveillance gadget used by the FBI and police .
In the 20th century , the best weapons against terrorism are  no longer bullets and bombsbecause the focus is to prevent criminal activities before it happenhappens .
Hence ,  . . .nformation is the key
In the U .S . , FBI and police used surveillance technology to track suspect and to fight terrorism .
"Calls made from a mobile phone led Italian police to one of the suspects in the failed suicide bombings in London on 21 July In this incident , the police caught the criminal by tapping his mobile phone , listening to his conversation and use his mobile phone signal to determine his location .
This is a classic example of how surveillance technology can be used to fight crime .
Surveillance technology can also be used in the medical fields .
Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte , North Carolina came out with a RFID infant protection system where a RFID chips was tagged onto the infant .
(Two Stories Highlight the RFID Debate , July19 2005) The security system will sound off if the infant was being illegally removed from the nursery .
This system successfully recovered a kidnapped infant by using RFID signal on the tagged baby to track its location .
GPS chip was also placed on Alzheimer's patient shoes to track their whereabouts .
A patient with this disease can be easily disoriented , hence , causing them to lose their way .
(Wong , Jun10 2009) The use of surveillance technology can help the patient's family members to locate him/ her and bring him/ her home safely .
Although the use of surveillance technology will raise ethical concerns , to obtain important information that might save thousands of lives , there is no choice but to do it .
By tracking a suspect's whereabouts or eavesdropping his or her conversation , we might be invading on his or her privaprivacy .
However ,  . . . if we can prevent another September 11 incident from re- occurring , I believe everyone would agree to it .
From just the above example , we can see that the advantages of using surveillance technology overweigh its disadvantages .
In conclusion , we can impose a law and limit the use of surveillance technology but we cannot ban it .
Genetic testing has evolved and is now more prevalent in our modern society .
In light of this ubiquitous and accessible availability of genetic testing , many have started to question the problems that are associated with the results .
The question now is whether an individual should decide whether to release the results to others or that the results   be revealed regardless of his approval .
There is evidence  that the latter proved more beneficial to both the patient and others around him .
Many have argued that by revealing genetic results , companies will be able to gain access to them and thus deny those affected from being hired due to their disabilities .
However , it is important for many companies to know these disabilities because these may pose problems for certain operations .
For example , people with sickle cell trait are not able to be pilots because they may face problems at high altitude Furthermore , industries that handle certain chemicals or carcinogens should have stringent employability criteria .
This does not only protect the companies' interest but also protect hopeful employees from aggravating their conditions .
(Why might genetic information be relevant to employment ? , n .d . , para .2) .
In sum , revealing genetic results will be beneficial to the patients as well as companies involved in the recruitment process .
Accessible genetic results are also important to patients and their families .
Patients with positive test results will be susceptible to physical and emotional stress and thus will need support from theiroved ones .
(Sharing Genetic Test Results With Your Family , 2009 , para .

Moreover , the results may also shed some light to certain predominant problems that the entire family may be susceptible to in the near future .
This will allow relatives to start early treatment before the disease develops .
(Sharing Genetic Test Results With Your Family , 2009 , para .

Therefore , availability of genetic information will help ease the pressure on the patient and also allow many to go through early treatment or take preventive measures .
Albeit many believe in human rights as well as the protection of one's interest , there are many other prevailing factors that tip the balance toward releasing results and making it readily available for the good of the patient and his surrounding people .
Genetic testing is the examination of the fundamental human genetic information , so as to access an individual's risk of contracting diseases .
Although this advance in technology proves to be a significant breakthrough in the medical field , social problems in the form of genetic discrimination could be the likely consequences .
Thus , individuals undergoing genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results as they are the ones who will likely face discrimination .
Employment is one area of discrimination .
Individuals tested to have risks of suffering from diseases that could affect their working abilities would very unlikely be employed by profit-driven companies .
From the employers' point of view , these individuals would likely take medical leave often to consult treatment , and could be lower in productivity .
One example of such discrimination was experienced by Eddy Curry , a former Chicago Bulls player .
In 2005 , Curry was forced to leave for the New York Knicks after his refusal to a genetic test aimed to determine if players were susceptible to a heart ailment (Harmon , 2008) .
Hence , employers would likely use genetic testing to gauge a potential employee's productivity and worth .
To eliminate discrimination in the workforce , individuals undergoing the test should be given the final say .
Technological advances have eased the carrying out of surveillance activities .
Some suggest application of surveillance technology is advantageous in the safeguard of credentials , protection of national security and enhancement of business and commerce sectors .
However , the same technology can also be used to track people and intrude private information .
Concerns are raised on the moral and ethical issues surrounding the latter usage of such technology .
In fact , the intrusion of people's privacy has become more serious when surveillance technology is abused that such technology used in tracking people should be banned .
Two issues are discussed .
Both support the fact that surveillance technology create risks to privacy that far outweigh the technology's heralded benefits .
Firstly , it is said that it actually enables identity thieves , stalkers and other criminals to commit "contactless" crimes against victims who will not immediately know they've been violated (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) .
In February 2005 , when the State Department (US) asked for public comment on the implementation of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) in passport booklets , of the 2 ,335 comments received , 98 .5 percent were negative , with 86 percent expressing security or privacy concerns , the department reported in an October 2005 notice in the Federal Register (Lewan , 2009) .
Indeed , the fear of losing privacy is a distressing concern among the society .
Secondly , tracking devices such as online behavioural tracking systems can be used to target vulnerable consumers for high-price loans , bogus health cures and other potentially harmful products and services ," said Susan Grant , director of Consumer Protection at Consumer Federation of America (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) .
Nowadays electronic information from consumers is "collected , compiled and sold" (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) without reasonable safeguards and therefore posing a threat to the exposure of private matters of consumers that may lead to abuse of such information for certain benefits or intentions .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it not only intrudes privacy but also poses a risk to personal security .
While surveillance has been a part of society since the widespread Cabinet Noir splinter (Encyclopedia Britannica , 1911) of the postal organisation during Louis XIII reign , only recent development in technology has made it possible for the intrusion into the private lives of individuals on such a grandiose scale specifically with regards to the wide scale tracking of movement .
The application of tracking technology has spurned heated debates from both public and private sectors .
The acceptance of RFID (Radio frequency identification) and commercial data mining to serve behavioural advertising has raised concerns with privacy groups and computer experts due to potential of abuse being present .
While RFID has proven itself as a worthy tool in combating terrorism on an international scale , it has also opened a window of opportunity for criminals who do not require contact such as identity thieves and stalkers to prey on countless unknowing victims exploiting the fundamental flaw of each RFID chip; as Neville Pattinson (2007) stated: "'each chip is built to faithfully transmit its unique identifier'" (Lewan , 2009) which it does with no consensual oversight .
Another contentious issue is the potential quasi-legal practice of collecting the information of political dissidents gathered at legitimate rallies by the government .
Behavioural advertising , on the other hand ,  has invaded the individual's right to safeguard their personal information and browsing habits .
The web users who have been targeted by the advertorial companies have lost all meaningful control (Report on Consumer Watchdog; Consumer and Privacy Groups Urge Congress to Enact Consumer Privacy Guarantees , 2009) over the use of their personal data which is often shared with third parties for financial gain oblivious to the victim's lack of consent .
Surveillance technology , even when well intentioned ,  has been proven to have too many potential pitfalls to be ignored .
The rise in the infringement of individual privacy by malicious people and oppressive government shows no sign of slowing down due to continual evolution in both legitimate technology and the resourcefulness of criminals to exploit it .
In conclusion , the relative gains in accessibility and efficiency does not give carte blanche for private organisations or governmental agencies to push forth dubious surveillance technology regardless of how well intentioned it may be .
In recent years , development in technologies of genetic testing has increased the ease of access for individuals to genetic tests .
Genetic tests are laboratory techniques used to determine whether a person has or probability of getting a genetic disorder .
Some examples of genetic testing are diagnostic testing and pre-natal testing (Mehlman , 1999 , para 1) .
These individuals should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such tests .
Individuals should maintain their rights in whether to reveal the results of such testing  so that they can protect themselves from genetic discrimination .
Such discrimination could appear in the area of employment , where companies use the the results of genetic tests to influence the employment prospects of an individual .
For example in 2005 , a Chicago Bulls basketball player named Eddy Curry was sold to the New York Knicks because he refused to take a genetic test to check if he was predisposed to a heart ailment (Harmon , 2008 , Caught in a Bind , para 8) .
So what if the he had taken the test and was diagnosed with having a higher possibility of developing heart problem ?
He would probably be sold to another team even though he could be a good player .
This would be unfair for the individual .
Thus , to protect themselves from genetic discrimination , individuals should maintain their rights in having the final say whether to reveal results of genetic testing .
Another reason for individuals to maintain their rights in revelation of genetic testing result is so as to allow individuals to enjoy the benefits that genetic testing can bring .
Because of the potential discrimination that individuals could face due to their results of genetic testing , many choose not to take the test .
Even with the improvement of the technologies related to genetic diseases , these individuals are denied  the opportunities to prevent , or even treat the genetic disease that could be present .
If the results of genetic testing are to be forcefully revealed , less people will be willing to even go for the test .
Hence , to allow individuals to have the chance to know more of the preventive measures or possible treatment , they should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
In conclusion ,  .
If they are forced to reveal , they could be subjected to unfair treatment and be void of the benefits of genetic test .
Thus , individuals should maintain their right to decide whether they want to reveal the result of their genetic test .
