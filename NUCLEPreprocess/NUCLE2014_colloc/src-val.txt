However , revealing the results may have some positive effects to both individuals and their family psychologically and physically (Chang & Haber , 2007) .
In addition , families can also help in reducing the risk for the next generation .
Therefore , I agree that carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their family .
Firstly , revealing the results to their family can have a positive psychological effect on the individual .
Upon receiving the bad news from the test , individuals may feel discouraged and have a negative view of life .
This is for those who have a family history of relatives who did not survive the disorder , for example , ovarian cancer (Haidle , 2005) .
This will further worsen and hasten their condition (Chang & Haber , 2007) .
By talking to their relatives about their genetic risk , they will gain support and encouragement .
Studies have shown that by sharing the results , individuals will actually feel better as compared to those who keep mum (Mallet , 2009) .
It is further substantiated with cases of mothers sharing their ovarian and breast cancer positive results with their children .
According to Scientific Blogging , statistics show that only nine percent of the mothers received negative responses while most of them received very encouraging responses ( 2009) .
Scientific Blogging is a reliable website where news articles about scientific facts can be found .
Opponents may argue that it may not be necessary for individuals to tell their relatives their results since it's their choice and there is no legal law that says that those who took the test must inform their family the results (Norrgard , 2008) .
However , if individuals do not choose to reveal , the potential side-effects and psychological burden may cause severe consequences , such as worsening the condition (Chang & Haber , 2007) .
Therefore , it is essential to share their results with their family for their own psychological benefits .
Secondly , by telling their family their results , their family will tend to be more health conscious since they will understand that they are potentially at risk too .
In some cases , maintaining a balanced lifestyle can reduce the risk of getting the disorder as well (Rahman , 2009) .
If the results are not told , families that have a higher risk may not alter their lifestyle to prevent the genetic disorder that might be prevented .
In addition , if only one parent has a genetic disorder , the offspring will have a fifty percent chance of getting it (Mehlman , 1999) .
This means that there's a fair chance to prevent the potential disorder .
By not telling this important information about the family having a risk of getting the same disorder , it's like denying the right to life .
According to the United Nations' "Right to life" , Article 10 , "States Parties reaffirm that every human being has the inherent right to life and shall take all necessary measures to ensure its effective enjoyment ."
( , 1948) .
Denying that piece of information about the well being of the family may become a violation to the right to life .
Opponents may argue that individuals should not be obliged to tell their family as this will save them a lot of pressure and stress .
Indeed , knowing that one has a higher risk of a genetic disorder is stressful and painful , however , through appropriate counseling and leading a healthy lifestyle , the chance of not getting the disorder is relatively high (Haidle , 2005) .
Therefore , for the physical well being of the whole family , it is best to let the family know the condition .
Lastly , by telling the results , families can reduce the chances of the next generation from getting the genetic disorder .
Methods like assisted reproductive technology (ART) can be used to ensure that only unaffected embryos are allowed to develop to term (Norrgard , 2008) .
In this way , the chances of the next generation of getting the same genetic disorder will be significantly reduced .
Without revealing the results , the family may not be aware of the potential genetic condition .
Despite this benefit , opponents may argue that some disorder might not affect the rest of the family , so it is not necessary to inform the relatives (Mehlman , 1999) .
However , if carriers of genetic disorder , such as HIV , do not tell their family ,  the spouse spouse may have a potential risk of infection unknowingly .
Thus , carriers should at least tell their spouse their condition , so that the family as well as the next generation can be protected .
To conclude , revealing of the positive results is essential to help not only the carriers , but also their family psychologically and physically .
In addition , they can prevent the next generation from getting the same disorder as well .
Though the decision is made ultimately by the individuals , I think  it is necessary for them to inform their family .
In recent years of the 21st century , a vast majority of people have arrived at a similar cognitional conjunction of the general idea of genetic testing , which is extensively portrayed as an effective technique to identify crime suspects or catastrophe victims in various popular "crime scene investigation" television programmes .
However , the varieties and significance of genetic testing are well understated .
Genetic testing has become an increasingly adopted form of medical checkup through means of diagnosing an individual's vulnerabilities to inherited diseases upon detection of genes and chromosomes mutation (Guttmacher , 2009) .
If confirmed as the carrier of a particular genetic mutation or having increased risk of developing an inherited disease , those unfortunate subjects are not only instantaneously overwhelmed by negative emotions but also subjected to distress and burdens in considering the consequences of their health conditions on their family members .
Various ethical and social complications arise from the different options for the  inflicted subjectssuch as  to tell or not tell their families or relatives about the positive results of the genetic diagnosis .
Considering the genetically affected individual's need of additional care and companionship as well as the early detection of similar inherited disorder amongst their blood relatives , an individual of known genetic risk ought to disclose the results of genetic testing to his close relatives .
As accepting the occurrence or increased risk of developing genetic disorders is rather emotionally burdensome , affected patients should reveal the truth to their family members who are able to provide additional care and companionship .
Emotional outcomes after predictive genetic testing such as increased measures of anxiety , anger , depression , guilt and redemptive adjustments are psychologically destructive (Davies , Donnai , MacLeod , McAllister , Nicholls & Payne , 2007) .
Moreover , scientific researches provide substantial evidence showing that the frequency of catastrophic outcomes such as suicide , attempted suicide and psychiatric hospitalization are significantly higher amongst those receiving Huntington's disease predictive-testing results (Almqvist , Bloch , Brinkman , Craufurd & Hayden , 1999) .
The devastative psychological effects on risk-prone individuals can be reduced if family members show moral support and intensive care .
In fact , the risk and severity of certain adult onset genetic disorders can be alleviated by preventative measures and treatments .
With the company and cooperation of family members , constructive lifestyle modification such as adopting healthy diet , exercising as well as reducing alcohol and cigarette consumption can be easily implemented .
Thus , revealing one's genetic condition to family members are proven to be beneficial and alleviate psychological pressure as compared to concealing the truth .
In addition , to inform family and relatives of one  unfavourable genetic conditions is an act of responsibility and care by which similar genetic testing can be executed for early detection and treatments .
As the terminology implies , genetically inherited diseases are caused by gene or chromosomes abnormality received from antecedents and passed on to following generations .
The possibilities of other family members and blood relatives carrying similar gene mutation are relatively higher when a family history of the particular genetic disorder is detected .
The likelihood of the family members and relatives to definitively develop similar genetic disease is hard to estimate due to the influences of different inheritance conditions such as autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive (Joaquina , 2009) .
Moreover , a healthy person not showing any corresponding symptoms of the genetic disease might be the carrier of gene mutation , which might bring about equivalent harmfulness to successive offspring .
Hence , alerting these potential disease carriers is essential such that similar genetic testing can be done , either to rule out any possibilities of carrying that particular DNA mutation or to detect the chances of developing the genetic disorder and apply treatments or preventative measures as early as possible .
All in all , carriers have to consider beyond personal concerns and fulfil obligations to inform family members and relatives about their genetic disorders for early detection , prevention and cure .
Knowledge is power , but how true the saying is when applied to the context of genetic testing is debatable .
Genetic testing is the process of direct examination of a person's DNA molecule .
Even though it does not guarantee a 100 percent accuracy () , it is still used in fields like forensic investigations whereby a person's identity could be determined through the test .
It is also utilized in medical diagnosis to reveal any genetic disorders () by basing one's genes against a healthy standard of gene pool to spot for any forms of mutations .
However , the choice of revealing the result to only the patient or to third parties is an issue that is arguable .
Ultimately though , I believe that the patient should have the final say as to whether the results should be made known .
First and foremost , genetic testing is by no means cheap .
Its cost range from hundreds to thousands of dollars in accordance to the number and size of genes tested () .
As such , the person has to fork out huge amounts of money to procure this knowledge and it would thus only be ethical that he or she be allowed to make the choice of broadcasting the results .
As much as some may argue that money does not buy everything , such tests results are akin to a paid product and it would not make sense if it were to be shared with others without the buyer's consent .
In recent years , there has been an increasing trend of individuals coming forward to request for genetic testing .
Genetic testing is a form of medical examination that determines whether an individual is at risk or diagnosed to have any inherited genetic disorders or has the potential to pass it on to the next generation ( , 2009) .
Genetic testing includes gene tests , chromosomal tests and biochemical tests that identify result abnormalities or alterations .
If the individual does not have the final say in revealing the test results of a positive genetic disorder , there will be a breach of patient confidentiality when the individual had  requested not to reveal the results and may cause even further distraught and strain within the family , even if the individual reveals to the loved ones at  later  .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing , since the individual will be the one answerable and holds the sole responsibility in the repercussion of informing or withholding the results  .
Firstly , an individual will face genetic discrimination if he does not have the final say in revealing a positive result of genetic disorder test .
Genetic discrimination occurs when an external party gains access to an individual's health records or when one is honest in declaring one's health condition .
For instance , an insurance company will refuse to provide any insurance coverage for an individual who may have had  tested positive of a genetic disorder or has a high probability of acquiring a genetic disorder , since the insurance company finds it a loss to make a payout to an 'already or potentially-sick' individual .
Furthermore , employers will be judgmental in hiring or firing a 'sick' employee .
In America , a new federal law referred to as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008 , to prevent discrimination from insurance companies and employers ( , 2009) .
Genetic discrimination will not take place if the individual had the final say in revealing the result of such testing , as the individual had withheld the information and life would go on as per normal until the disease presents its signs and symptoms .
When the individual is discovered for having a genetic disorder and does declare the status beforehand , the individual will bear all the consequences , which includes genetic discrimination since the individual had the choice to weigh  the pros and cons of the matter before the individual made a decision on keeping the condition to himself .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing .
Secondly , if the individual requesting genetic testing does not have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing , the individual will have problems with his loved ones , such as stress within the family and strained family relationships ( , 2005) .
For example , if the family of the individual finds out through the family physician instead of the individual's  , the family will be upset since the individual chose to hide the information .
Even if the individual chooses to tell the family at a later timing for the benefit of not wanting to upset his loved ones , the family will on the other hand feel that it was irresponsible of the individual not to share his/her burden with the family , since the family had to find out the truth from another party .
This could be prevented if the individual concerned broke the news to his family members so that they can discuss as a family .
As such , it is up to the individual's discretion in revealing the genetic test results .
Arguments that individuals should not be the one having the final say in revealing the genetic test result are weak .
Some have said the individuals who request for the genetic testing are deceiving others if they do not reveal the positive genetic test result .
However , even if the genetic test result was positive , it does not infer that the individual has defective genes but it is just that the individual is at a higher risk of acquiring the disease ( , 2009) .
Furthermore , there will be an infringement of privacy and confidentiality if the individual requests not to reveal the result but yet divulged , since it is one's own choice that ought to be respected .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
In recent years , genetic testing has emerged as a new and sophisticated medical technique to "gather information on an individual's genetic predisposition to a particular health condition ."
( 2009 .
However once a test result has been conducted , the individual faces a dilemma of whether he should inform his relatives about his results of his genetic test .
, obligated is defined as "something that one must do because of a rule or law .
"( , 2003 .
It is to be noted that it is not against the law if the carrier keeps the results of the genetic test private , as everybody has his own rights in deciding on what should be revealed to the ones around him .
Therefore , I believe that the carrier is not obligated to tell his relatives about his condition but it will still be morally responsible of the carrier to inform his relatives .
Firstly , as mentioned above , it is not against the law to withhold genetic results from third parties .
In a democratic world , it is the individual's rights to choose if he wants to reveal the testing results .
Domestically , our very own constitution has stated very clearly that "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law ."
() .
Even the most powerful democratic nation in the world , the United States of America has also stated very clearly in her constitution that "all men are created equal" and "with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life , liberty and happiness ."( .
Most notably , the word 'liberty' appeared in both Constitutions .
One of the definitions for liberty is the "freedom from obligation ," which clearly means that it is perfectly legal for the individual to withhold his genetic tests' results from third parties , and thus is under no obligation to disclose his results .
Secondly , it is within the personal rights of the individual to withhold the information .
All people under the state laws are entitled to  freedom of speech , and most importantly the freedom to decide and choose for himself .
It is an "inalienable right" of all citizens of democratic countries .
Therefore , it is within the individual's empowerment to decide if he wants to reveal the results of his genetic test to his relatives , which clearly implies that he is under no obligation to reveal his genetic test results to his relatives .
However , even if it is within the individual's legal and personal rights not to reveal the tests' results , it is still a moral responsibility to do so .
The individual has the responsibility to inform the closest around him of this genetic problem .
As genetic problems , such as Parkinson's disease is hereditary , it will be good to prepare the carrier's family psychologically .
This can allow or prompt the rest of the family to go for similar tests to determine if they have developed the same genetic disorders .
Early detection allows the carrier to undergo treatment earlier when the genetic problem is still at its infant stage , and thus the problem will be easier to control as compared to its later stage .
Furthermore , direct relatives of the individual can also plan for their own future , with the knowledge that whatever future plans that they might have , they have to keep in mind the genetic disorder .
For example , if a couple wants to have a baby , and either the father or the mother is a carrier of certain genetic problems , they would consider the probabilities of the unborn child being born with the same deficiency .
Thus it is absolutely and morally vital  for the affected individual to inform his relatives of his genetic disorder , so as to prepare his relatives psychologically , medically and financially .
Thus the carrier is not only being responsible to himself , but also to his relatives and even future generations .
However , critics might want to argue that his relatives will alienate him , and thus make the individual feel isolated and uncared for .
I believe that despite risking alienation , the moral responsibility in telling his relatives of the problem is more important than the former as it will give his relatives adequate warning about the potential risk that might affect them too .
In conclusion , I believe that the individual is not obligated to inform his or her relatives about his genetic problems , either legally or personally .
However , he  must have the moral responsibility to inform his relatives about his genetic disorders so as to prepare the latter psychologically , medically and financially .
According to the US national institute of health , genetic testing is the examination of a person's DNA taken from cells in his or her blood , tissues or other body fluids that exhibit a disease or disorder ( .) .
Is is often used to detect certain suspected inherited disease in an individual or family .
However , when a person is confirmed with certain genetic risk , a question  .
Is it an obligation for the person to tell his or her relatives about the risk ?
In my opinion , the right of his or her relatives to know the risk and possibility to save lives should not be denied by the person .
Hence , a carrier of known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives  because of their right to know .
They should know that they are vulnerable to the risk of family disease which can be inherited .
This allows them to have mental preparation about what will possibly happen and to react to the risk .
In addition , knowing of their genetic risk will help them in making some important decisions and plans such as whether to have children or not .
The right of relatives or families to know the genetic test results can be seen in a WHO report on medical genetic issues (http://www .who .int) , which address that family members have a moral obligation to share genetic information with each another , and thus they can choose whether to be tested themselves .
Secondly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives  to save their lives .
If the relatives know  the  possible risk in genetic disease , they can request forthe genetic test for themselves .
In case the test results are positive , they will be able to receive medical treatment to reduce risk .
In some circumstances , it is possible to cure a genetic disease in early stage .
This allows the relatives of a genetic disease patient , or even the patient himself , to recover fully from the disease .
For instance , according to the US national institute of health ( when tumors of colon cancer are discovered early , the chances for survival are the greatest and this prevents thousands of cancer deaths a year .
Some people may argue that if a carrier of a known genetic risk tells his or her relatives about the risk , he or she will be abandoned by families .
Nevertheless , this is not true as relatives or family members do help each another when one is in difficulty .
In contrast to abandon , they will give support and pay more attention to the patient .
These encouragement always makespatients to be more confident and brave , thus increasing their chances for survival in some cases .
Other than that , some people claim that a genetic disease patient will be discriminated from employment once his or her genetic information is spread by family members .
However , this is  .
There are countries where laws have been implemented to address such discrimination and to protect these genetic disease patients .
For example , according to the American Society of Human Genetics () ,  the Disabilities Act (ADA) is implemented to deal with  genetic discrimination .
Some of the states also have legislation to limit employers to collect , use and disclose genetic information .
In conclusion , a carrier of known genetic risk is obligated to tell their relatives due to their right to know about the risk and possibility to save their lives .
With effective implementation of laws to protect genetic disease patients , they should always be encouraged and prompted to reveal the genetic test results to his or her relatives so that they can benefit from the testing equally .
Firstly , they are obligated to tell their relatives as it is a matter of personal responsibility .
Having undergone genetic testing , the individuals involved should be well aware of the implications it might have on them and their families' lives .
It is very irresponsible not to reveal the results to their family members as their lives are also implicated greatly .
For instance , if the individual has a dominant gene for Huntington's disease , his family members including the next generation might be carriers of this disease and may suffer physically and emotionally in the later age of their lives (Norrgard , 2008) .
Furthermore , the result from genetic testing might also cause family members to be discriminated by the society (Henry , 2005) .
Thus , it would be not fair if the individual just kept the information and not share it so that the family members could be prepared of the implications .
Secondly , when family members are informed , they would benefit from this information .
Being aware that they are at high-risk , they might  find out the possible problems and solutions .
Thus , they would be able to make a sound decision with this new knowledge .
For instance , if the family member is informed that she is at high risk of a genetic disease like cystic fibrosis that may cause suffering to her child , she might soon discover that this disease is treatable as soon as the child is born .
When she gives birth to a child , she would immediately send her child for diagnosis and treatment (Patrick , 1993) .
Thus her child might not suffer as much as children who undergo treatment only when the symptoms arise .
Similarly , if the disease is untreatable , the family member could make a decision to abort the child so that the disease will not affect the next generation .
When the results of genetic testing are revealed , family members might suffer emotionally and psychologically .
For example , family members might feel burdened that they might suffer from a disease that is untreatable .
Thus , they might become despondent in life .
However , this result of family members being informed should not be a reason to stop the individual from informing the family members .
There are counsellors and specialists who will aid the individual and family members to recover (Patrick , 1993) .
These professionals will also share the information with the family members and allow them to be more prepared for the future .
In conclusion , the individuals carrying genetic risk should be obligated to inform their family members as they should be responsible and fair to their family members and not deprive the members from taking early measures against the disease .
Furthermore , they should not be concerned about the negative effects about revealing the results as there are professionals in the fields who are available to aid in the problem .
With advanced technology , genetic testing is developed to identify and detect changes in proteins , chromosomes or genes that are associated with a specific disease or inherited disorders .
The results of a genetic test has both pros and cons as it aids to predict the likelihood of individuals of developing or passing a genetic disorder onto their children (Procter 2002) .
However , genetic testing has brought  ethical and social issues , not only to the individuals but to the family members as well .
(Norrgard 2008) .
Norrgard (2008) also mentions that the decision to undergo genetic testing is a very personal matter .
Therefore , it is the responsibility of individuals to inform their family members upon deciding the benefits and limitations of the genetic results .
Firstly , the advantage of genetic testing  to predict the individuals' chance of developing or passing an inherited the disorders to their offspring has raised a concern whether the carriers  tell his relatives (Procter 2002) .
Jacobs and Deatrick (1999) reported , "the view of an entire-family can be affected by the identification of a family specific mutation ."
Norrgard (2008 .
An individual who is to have Huntington's disease has an ethical obligation to reveal the truth of genetic result to their relatives .
Furthermore , Procter (2002) also points out that the concern of withholding the genetic information is the age of the individual .
Procter (2002) supported his view that the adults will have  better decision making skills to undergo genetic testing that helps to reduce the chance of developing an inherited disorder or passing disorder onto their offspring .
However , individuals' decisions can be influenced by the fear of developing an inherited genetic disorder and the  result of avoiding close relationships with their family members (Procter 2002) .
Therefore , individuals should have an ethical obligation to reveal the truth  to their relatives so that they can be treated effectively  .
Secondly , the limitation of genetic tests such as the social issue has been taken into account as to  whether to reveal the genetic results to their relatives .
Norrgard (2008) argues that the concern of the family members  .
Furthermore , Norrgard (2008) also points out that the revealtion of genetic information will cause the family members to be discriminated by the insurance company and employers and families who have the risk of developing an inherited disease or disorder .
However , the Federal law has implemented the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to prevent individuals from being discriminated by the insurance company and employer (Norrgard 2008) .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives since they are being protected by law and deterred the risk of developing disease with preventive measures .
In conclusion , it is the responsibility  of the individuals to inform their family members upon deciding the benefits and limitations of the genetic result .
Advancement in science , especially in the field of genetic and biomedical research , has made genetic testing possible for people to test for diseases which relate to hereditary links .
Genetic testing , a testing that looks at a person's genetic make up , is able to confirm diagnosis of individuals who are at risk of certain genetic disorders like the Huntington's disease , cystic fibrosis , Tay-Sachs disease , breast cancer and so forth[HYPERLINK: http://www .nature .com/scitable/topicpage/Diagnosing-Down-Syndrome-Cystic-Fibrosis-Tay-Sachs-646]  .
Despite the fact that genetic testing helps to improve one's life , it is always surrounded by moral and ethical issues that include family-related ethical dilemma when a potential carrier of a genetic disorder is tested to be a positive result .
However , since family history always serves as a guide for genetic testing as passing the mutated genes within the family is of high possibility , results of genetic testing would have implications in the individual who tested it ,  as well as the family members .
Hence , a  carrier  of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives once the genetic test has been conducted and the results are known .
An important reason why a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the testing result to relevant third party is that it would help early detection of genetic diseases within the family members .
This would then lead to necessary treatment to save lives .
In the case of breast cancer , recent studies show that women who suffer from breast cancer would have an increased likelihood of a sister to get the same disease (EverythingAboutBreastCancer , 2009) .
American Cancer Society (2005) also reveals that 5%-10% of the breast cancer patients inherit the mutated genes of BRCA1 and BRCA2 from their first degree relatives .
Since there is no symptom of such disease in the early and most treatable stage , revealing of testing result by the carrier would alert the relevant third party to undergo similar testing and receive necessary treatment if it is a positive result .
Some may argue that the  third party  should have done regular check up to monitor personal health condition instead of starting to do so when there is a carrier in the family .
However , self-examination has low accuracy in detection of breast cancer while other methods like mammography is only meant for women  aged 40 years old and above (georgiahealthinfo .gov , n .d .) .
This might be relatively inefficient in terms of early detection of the disease as females at a young age  would also be exposed to the risk of getting breast cancer .
Another relevant point is that obligation to reveal the testing result to the relatives does play a part in helping them to make important life decisions .
Genetic result is also desired by the relatives and potential mate if the carrier is carrying mutated gene that can cause death .
For instance , Huntington's disease is a fatal autosomal dominant disease , which is caused by the death of neurons in certain regions of the brain .
Carriers of such disease should reveal the testing results to the relatives so that the latter can do proper family planning to avoid passing the defective genes to the next generation .
The fact that  "Families saw the disease destroy their loved ones' ability to feel , think , and move" (MedicineNet .com , n .d . , p .3) indicates the consequence of this incurable genetic disorder that is passed on within the family , if the carrier is not obligated to reveal the testing results .
Admittedly , confidentiality of the genetic testing results is a personal matter .
However , Burton (2009) may be accurate in saying that patient's confidentiality should come second to the prevention of disease in others .
It is also worth noting that revealing a genetic testing result to the relevant third party would eventually help the carrier to seek more advice to choose the best medical decisions .
Georgetown University Hospital (n .d) provides an example of a successful patient , Evan , who fought against cancer via chemotherapy , with the moral support and empathy from his family members .
In fact , carriers of certain genetic diseases do not necessarily exhibit the characteristics controlled by defective genes .
For example , if the genetic disease is related to X-linked genes , only males are affected while females remain as carriers of the disease , unless it concerns the autosomal recessive genes (wrongdiagnosis .com , n .d .) .
Being a carrier of a genetic disease is quite common as Guggino and Stanton (2006) note that one in 20 Caucasians carries the gene for cystic fibrosis .
Hence , there might be carriers of the same genetic disorder within the same family who can share experiences to help the carrier to understand his or her condition better if the carrier is obligated to reveal the testing result .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the results to the relevant third party as it benefits both the carrier and his or her family members .
Obligation to reveal the results would help the family members in early detection of the genetic disorder which is followed by treatment , making important life decisions and facilitate the carriers to choose the best medical decisions .
With the advent of advancements in medicine and technology over the recent years , the power of medicine in influencing human procreation has strengthened especially in the area of genetic testing .
Genetic testing is a technique to examine genes or markers near the genes , chromosomes and proteins to test the signs of a disease or disorder in DNA .
Test samples are usually taken from a person's blood , body fluids or tissues .
Genetic testing provides us with information that if someone has a symptom; shows whether a person is a carrier for a genetic disease; helps expectant parents know whether an unborn child will have a genetic disease etc (Access Excellence @ National Health Museum) .
The definition of a genetic carrier is a person that has inherited a genetic trait or mutation but does not show the symptoms of the disease (Wikipedia) .
There are many types of genetic diseases such as  Down Syndrome , Huntington's disease , cystic fibrosis , hemophilia A , and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer .
However , genetic testing has raises numerous ethical issues , one  of them concerning consent and confidentiality of the tested individual identified to be a carrier of a known genetic risk .
Although it is the individual's right to choose not to disclose their genetic information to his or her relatives , in my opinion , he or she is obligated and responsible to disclose the said genetic information for several reasons .
Firstly , it is important for a carrier of a known genetic risk to disclose his or her genetic information to family members as the latter may be at risk of having the same genetic disorder .
Whether an individual with the genetic disease chooses to disclose the genetic information to the family members depends on how they gauge the risks and benefits of revealing the truth , their sense of responsibility towards them and most importantly how it affects them (Agatha & Angst , 2009) .
It is understood that individuals who carry the disease do not wish to reveal their genetic results due to privacy issues or fear that their family members are not ready to accept it .
However , by not sharing the information , they are posing a danger to their family members potentially at risk of carrying the disease .
For example , strenuous exercise can cause sudden death in people with genetic diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Agatha & Angst , 2009) .
It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; therefore  it is high possibility that if an individual tested positive , his or her siblings would have one in two chance of carrying the same genetic mutation .
Thus , it is obligatory to notify relatives so that early recognition and treatment of the disease , if present , can be done .
To share one's genetic results with relatives also in a way protects their own safety at work or any other situations .
This is so as in some workplaces , such as factories or laboratories that deal with chemical substances , will increase the susceptibility to the toxic or carcinogenic effects of environmental agents of a person having genetic disorders (Andre & Velasquez , 2008 ) .
For example , individuals who carry the sickle cell trait may increase the risk of sickle cell anaemia if exposed to carbon monoxide or cyanide .
Also , when those people who are carriers of thalassemia are exposed to lead or benzene , it is hazardous to their health and causes adverse effects .
By revealing their genetic testing results to their relatives , their family members will be able to help them take note of what they should avoid and assess the occupational risks at their workplace .
Thus , an individual with known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives to protect themselves from potentially dangerous environments and ensure their personal safety .
However , some argue that individual right to consent , privacy and confidentiality are important and it is the individual's decision whether to disclose personal genetic results to relatives or otherwise .
There is also a legal requirement , the privacy rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 that the health care providers have to respect and protect patients' privacy of health information (Agatha & Angst , 2009) .
However , this legal requirement is decided on a case-to- case basis as there are situations when a clinician may consider necessary intervention , that is , notifying their family members for some life- threatening cases .
For example , individuals with mutations that predispose them to malignant hyperthermia may die if they were under the use of certain surgical anaesthesia (Agatha & Angst , 2009) .
Hence , it is important to notify relatives to let them know the risk and they could seek early treatment to prevent the risk and danger .
In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives to protect his or her family's health as well as protect his or her own safety .
Nowadays ,  , our understanding of genes and how they affect our health and cause diseases has deepened .
A diagnostic test capable of identifying diseases causing genes known as genetic testing was developed along with our knowledge on genes .
Just like property rights , the result of genetic testing should belong to the owner .
Individuals who undergo the test should therefore have the rights to decide whether the result should be disclosed to a third party since public access to the result can yield undesirable consequences .
The disclosure of a  genetic test result , particularly a result that shows a person has a risk of getting a certain diseases or disorder will lead to social discrimination during employment and during purchase of insurance .
Therefore , an individual should not be obliged to notify a third party , even his relatives , about his test result .
Furthermore , according to the Universal declaration of Human Rights , an individual holds the rights to decide what he wants to do with the result .
In addition , there are three vulnerable groups of people in our society that require protection if they were to undergo genetic testing .
They are the children , adolescents and mentally impaired .
Firstly , the discovery of a policy holder's test result , which showed that he might have a risk for certain disease , may prompt the insurance company to increase the price of the premium the policy holder has to pay in order to be fair to other policy holders .
Although in this way , it seems fair to the rest of the society , the individual having the risk is being discriminated against .
Furthermore , allowing access to the test result can cause  problems in the workplace .
Employers have the tendency to employ the people with little or possibly no health problems .
A genetic result could place a potential employee at a disadvantage by suggesting risk of getting a disease or disorder .
In 2005 , Eddy Curry from the Chicago Bulls refused a genetic test to find out whether he was susceptible to heart ailment .
By doing so , he was traded by the team to the New York Knicks .
(Harmon , 2008) Secondly , the society has to accept the fact that all humans have basic human rights .
According to the Universal Declaration of Human rights , "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , or to attacks upon his honour and reputation ."
If the carrier of a genetic risk should decide not to tell his relatives or a third party about the outcome , he should not be compelled further to as this violates his  .
Moreover , Professor Lim Pin recommends that the results from the test should only be used to advantage an individual or his family in prevention and management of disease .
He agreed that informed consent from the owner of the test result should be sought before disclosure is allowed .
Thirdly , there are three special categories of people in our society that need consideration .
The children , adolescents and mentally impaired that undergo genetic testing will not know how to handle their results .
As they are young and handicapped , they might be immature to know the consequences after they reveal their results of genetic testing .
In this case , should they be obliged to tell their relatives or the public ?
The possible undue stress and social stigmatism that they could face might prove difficult for them to handle at such tender age .
In the United States , even though there is Americans with Disabilities Act protecting them from social discrimination , no one can guarantee that all employers will follow the law .
Even if an employee with known risk for disease is allowed to continue working , he will come under stress and possible discrimination by his colleagues .
Initially , he only has the risk of getting a health problem but now with psychological stress , he could get depression instead .
Either way , letting the employer know the test result is not benefitting the individual .
Critics might argue that since genetic test result only shows the risk of getting a particular disease or disorder , it does not necessarily imply the individual has them and therefore , they should share the test result with their relatives to allow them to seek early prevention .
However , they fail to consider his relatives' reactions towards him just like how people react to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients .
In conclusion , individuals should not feel obligated to disclose their genetic test result .
In fact , they should have all the rights to decide what to do with it because the repercussions that arise from the act of revealing it are very serious .
Thus , the individual should decide what is best for him .
Medical related technology has improved to a stage in which genetic disorders can be predicted via genetic testing .
It is a technique to examine the DNA molecule (building blocks of genes) for several purposes such as predicting or diagnosing inheritable genetic disorders , prenatal or newborn screening and to aid in forensic science .
For an inheritable genetic disease , the carrier refers to the person who has the gene related to the disease , but the disease may not necessarily be expressed in him or her but it may be manifested in their offsprings .
Although genetic testing is made possible , the after effect of knowing and dealing with the disease is another issue .
Thus , a dilemma arises in whether the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier should be obligated to do so as this will aid in family planning , garnering support from family and also to prompt other relatives to test whether they are at risk too .
Firstly , family planning is imperative to a carrier as he or she may pass down the undesirable gene to the children .
This means that the child has to bear with the possibility of the onset of the disease and subsequent repercussion if the genetic disease is confirmed .
Therefore , a carrier should inform the spouse of the genetic disorder so that they can discuss and plan whether or not to take the risk of having a child .
Some may argue that it is not necessary for the carrier to inform the spouse as even if the child is tested positive for the genetic disease while still in the womb , measures such as abortion can be taken .
However , from the ethical point of view , it is inhuman to terminate a life , and this event can be prevented if there is proper family planning .
Thus , a carrier should be obligated to tell his or her spouse so as to prevent subsequent tension and ordeal in the family .
Secondly , a well-informed relative of the carrier's genetic disease is crucial as they can provide support towards the carrier .
If carriers of the genetic disease who are not mentally strong decided to keep mum about their genetic disease , they may lead an anxious and depressed life (Gilbar , 2007) .The situation is aggravated if they have children as they may feel guilty of the possibility of passing down the disease .
Hence , by letting the relatives know about the genetic risk , they can offer moral support such as giving words of encouragement , paying more attention to the carriers and assuring them that it is not their fault that they have the undesirable gene .
Hence , the support garnered from family members may boost the carriers' self-esteem and motivational level , knowing that they do not have to walk this journey alone .
Thus , it is crucial for the carrier to inform his or her relatives about their genetic risk so as to get the required support to help them through .
One argument for the obligation is that family members have their rights to information about themselves and their loved ones .
With the information one gains from testing , one can make constructive life changes .
Many genetic disorders worsen over time and have long-term health consequences; thus  the disclosure of the results for an inherited disease is beneficial for early treatment and prevention of the disorder to save lives .
In the case of incurable diseases , knowing one's condition could influence many family planning decisions and other life choices .
One can decide whether to have children of his own and risk passing the gene on to his children or consider using technology to assist selective reproduction .
Also , decisions like the retirement age and the amount of savings for the future can be made when they are better informed .
When family members are aware of the truth , at risk family members can be notified early and others can provide support for the carrier to overcome the difficulties he will be facing in the fight against his disorder .
The disclosure is thus not only beneficial to the third parties but also the carrier himself .
However , individuals may choose not to reveal the results due to fear of the negative social consequences associated with the disorder .
The results of genetic testing may open doors for potential discrimination in terms of job opportunities and insurances .
An employer might not want to keep an employee who is likely to be diagnosed with some disorder .
Similarly , a person who is known to have a high risk for a genetic condition may have difficulty obtaining insurance because he or she is likely to run up medical bills that would be costly to the insurance company .
The obligation to make known the results of genetic testing will thus be a disincentive for people to even undergo genetic testing to help themselves .
As we cannot control our genes , it is unfair to discriminate against a person's genetic predispositions .
A federal measure , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) , was signed into law in the United States , to provide protection against genetic discrimination (Norrgard 2008) .
Insurance companies were prevented from charging higher rates to customers based on genetic information and from collecting genetic data or requiring applicants to undergo genetic testing .
With the legislation being law , the carriers should feel safer to share the test results .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should be obligated to make known the results to relevant third parties for the benefits of both the carrier and the people around him .
Hopefully , with the recent passage of GINA in the U .S . , discrimination of inheritable carriers can be removed and people will feel comfortable working with genetic counselors who can provide information about the advantages and disadvantages of the genetic test and discuss the social and emotional aspects of testing to undergo genetic tests and disclose the results that contribute to better management of health care and life choices .
With medical technology advances today , genetic testing has been commonly used to detect any disorders or diseases that are present in our genes .
It is a method where the person's DNA is taken and isolated to test for the presence of any defects or  specific genes that could cause any future onset of disorders or diseases (Genetic testing , n .d .) .
Since the test involves genes and in general ,  , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , genetic testing helps to prevent further spread of diseases in the family lineage .
In family lineage , family members and relatives are related .
If the carrier is known to have a genetic risk , there may be a chance that other family members or relatives get that disorder or disease which may be found in their genes .
When they go for the testing , they are able to know if they are positive or negative for the presence of the specific defective gene .
This will then help other family members or relatives to plan ahead of their future generation .
For example , they are able to plan whether to start a family , the location and type of house to buy (in an area with family , an abundance of nursing homes , close to a specialized medical center , easily modifiable for a person with disabilities) , health , life and disability insurance , financial arrangements (wills and trusts , paying off debts) and et cetera (Drellishak R . , May 25 , 2003) .
Hence , the carrier should tell his or her relatives in order for them to make future plans and have a good family life .
Secondly , genetic testing allows oneself to be prepared upon knowing that a relative of theirs has a genetic risk .
This will allow them to take precautions and preventive measures about their health condition .
Some diseases that can be detected by genetic testing like Marfan syndrome - a connective tissue disorder causing long limbs and heart defects (Haldeman- Englert , C . , May 15 , 2008) can be controlled and treated .
When the other family members or relatives have an early detection of such diseases like Marfan syndrome , they are able to take preventive measures early like consulting a doctor , taking medications that could slow down the heart rate in order to prevent stress on the aorta and avoiding having sports to prevent of injuring the heart (Haldeman-Englert , C . , May 15 , 2008) .
Lastly ,  .
This is where a positive carrier of a specific genetic risk knows that they are not alone and  referrals for respite care , medical and hospice services , tips for care-giving and et cetera (Drellishak R . , May 25 , 2003) .
So , when other family members or relatives are tested positive for the disorder or disease , at least they know that they are not alone and they could rely on the support group for any advice or any moral or emotional support from them .
In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives so that to prevent further spread of the genetic disorder , to take early preventive measures and to give moral support to those who have the same genetic risk .
The results of a genetic test can determine an individual's possibility of developing a genetic disorder or confirm a suspected genetic disease .
This has brought about many controversial issues on ethical , social and legal concerns surrounding the use of genetic testing .
While some argue that under certain circumstances , the non-disclosure of relevant genetic information brings harm to the individual and a third party , it in fact helps to protect an individual's right to confidentiality , safeguard against discrimination and reduce psychological stress .
Hence , the individual undergoing genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results of such genetic testing .
There are three implications of genetic testing .
Firstly , genetic testing protects an individual's right to confidentiality .
An individual has the right of keeping his or her genetic test result confidential , and without granting consent of the individual , the test result should not be disclosed .
Admittedly , genetic testing raises legal issues; however , an individual who tested positive for a genetic disease has to decide whether to make known the results of genetic testing to relevant third parties such as family members or relatives who have the possibility of passing on the similar disease .
Regardless of the individual's right to confidentiality , the test results are disclosed under certain circumstances such as when the non- disclosure of relevant genetic test results brings harm to the individual and also the third parties (Lee , 2005) .
Thus , the risks of non-disclosure override the risks of breaching confidentiality .
Secondly , genetic testing safeguards against discrimination .
In the United States , federal law Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) was passed  to protect the individuals at risk for genetic diseases from facing discrimination by insurance companies and employers based on the results obtained from genetic testing (Public Law , 2008) .
Under this act , employers are prohibited  from making unfavourable employment decisions and  insurance companies are prohibited from reducing insurance coverage .
Although some argue that genetic testing raises social issues , these individuals may face discrimination from employers , insurance providers and society .
It is more difficult for these individuals in applying for employment and life and health insurance coverage .
As a result , they feel socially stigmatised .
Thirdly , genetic testing reduces the amount of psychological stress .
Although some argue that genetic testing raises ethical issues , the individual facesmuch psychological stress such as anxiety , fear and guilt when undergoing the process of genetic testing .
The individual is in ethical dilemma of whether to share the genetic test results within the families .
However , family members who are unaffected by the genetic disease may feel guilty and this condition is known as survivor guilt .
To reduce the amount of psychological stress , physicians should arrange post-test genetic counselling for patients .
Increasing medical cases of genetic disorders are in pace with the development of technology nowadays .
Daily exposure to strong UV radiations by sunlight and chemical substances or carcinogens will definitely have a great impact on human health .
Genetic disorder is considered as one of the severe medicinal consequences due to either those environmental factors or genetic factors by preceding generations .
According to the National Cancer Institute (n .d .) in the United States , genetic testing is a DNA analysis done to disclose the increased risk of development of a certain disease or disorder caused by genetic mutation .
Although genetic testing has remarkably improved our life , it still gives rise to many controversial issues , especially  ethical concerns .
If one has unfortunately been verified positive  in their genetic test , this would more or less place them in an ethical dilemma , whether they should reveal the results to their family members .
Anyhow , as a member of the family , one is obligated to tell the genetic test results to one' own relatives .
First of all , sharing information and test results with the family can reduce potential disease and even cancer risk among the relatives .
Most hereditary diseases are inherited in autosomal dominant genes which imply that close kin like parents , siblings and children will have 50 percent chances suffering from those diseases ("Sharing Genetic Test Results" , 2009) .
For instance , women from families with hereditary breast cancer should undergo genetic testing or counselling to estimate the expectancy of getting it .
This would rather reduce the chance of getting the cancer if preventative measures have been taken earlier .
Moreover , early detection can lead to a lower risk of disease .
Some carriers of genetic diseases object to telling their genetic test results as they think that such disclosure would not help in curing those disorders .
Nonetheless , carriers of genetic diseases are perfectly healthy and their children may only inherit the diseases ("Genetic Disorders" , 2009) .
Thus , revealing genetic test results to relatives is critical to draw their attention on the hereditary diseases .
Subsequently , they might choose to go for genetic tests .
As a result , the chances of suffering from those inherited disorders can be lowered .
At the same time , different curable and controlled treatments can also be carried out for certain diseases , for example , Adenosine deaminase deficiency and asthma .
In addition , positive genetic test results will lead to emotional distress to patients or carriers .
They will undoubtedly fall into the state of severe depression and anxiety .
There is no denying that family is the most intimate and important spiritual pillar to everyone .
Therefore , sharing test results with family might relieve those emotional effects and keep them away from gloomy thoughts .
Some patients and carriers oppose to disclosing the test results as they worry that they will be discriminated at home and experience self-abasement .
However , this might not be true .
In contrast to the problems of discrimination and self-abasement , some people think that disclosing genetic test results can allay grief and obtain more attentive care from close kin during their illness .
Furthermore , grief will only aggravate a patients condition .
Stewart ( stated that the suicide rate after genetic testing for Huntington's disease was estimated "about 10 times higher than the average population rate" , but it did not tend to be "higher than the overall rate among symptomatic HD carriers" .
Consequently , consolation , support and solace from relatives are very important once the individuals are tested positive for genetic diseases .
All in all , individuals have the right to conceal their genetic test results in order to protect their own privacy .
Federal Privacy Commissioner , Crompton (2002 , para .
3) pointed out that "the right balance" between willingness of patients and concerns of their relatives has to be taken into consideration as disclosure of health information is rather thorny .
In addition to the importance of sharing genetic test results to reduce disease risk and practise family planning , support but not discrimination by family is the foremost form of assistance to those who are tested positive for genetic diseases during their illness .
Hence , individuals who carry genetic diseases are obligated to disclose their test results among their relatives .
Genetic testing is whereby an individual's gene is tested for abnormalities , susceptibility for diseases or any genetic disorder that can lead to either physical or mental problems , or both .
It is beneficial as it points out the underlying genetic condition of an individual who is prone to a particular genetic disorder , giving the individual the opportunity to seek treatment before the genetic disease comes into effect (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
Since the affected individual shares similar genes within the family , he or she is obligated to let his or relatives know about the genetic condition .
Although it can affect the rest of the family and relatives , as having to know one's genetic condition can bring about genetic discrimination such as denied insurance coverage , loss of employment , it basically prepares them psychologically for the future and there are certain regulations implemented to help those who are genetically discriminated .
Firstly , it may help prevent the individual from encountering a situation where he is denied of insurance coverage when the health insurer finds out the affected individual could be prone to a one or more genetic diseases due to family history .
Such cases happen due to the health insurer being bent on making money , with no care towards  the person  in ill health(Townsend , 1997) .
There are policies such as in Britain , which insurance companies should adhere to , where any genetic screening is not a prerequisite in the application and obtaining insurance .
Even if it is to be declared , there will not be a change in premium charges as compared to those who declared that they have a family history but have not gone for genetic tests .
Thereby , it can help ensure that the affected person is able to be under insurance coverage , providing some security especially financial security  for the family members .
Secondly , having one genetic condition assessed , it gives the affected individual the freedom to make an informed choice concerning the type of job or employment that he or she can undertake , with the inclusion of one's safety and health .
This helps the individual to avoid certain occupations that might increase the risk of having to be ill health or end up in a life threatening situation during one's course of work (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
An example would be the Huntington's disease , a neurological disorder where loss of motor control is one of the symptoms , if a particular employee in a construction yard has such a disease , not only does it pose high risk to himself but also to the other employees (Mclean , 2008) .
However , although having the knowledge of one's susceptibility to a particular disorder may cost the employee's his or her job employment , so as to reduce costs and improve efficiency for the employer , there are regulations to help such employees .
In the United Kingdom , there is the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 which helps to ensure fairness to the employee's part after a genetic screening .
Thirdly ,by letting the family members and relatives  know of an individual genetic risk to a particular disorder such as Huntington's Disease , it makes them aware that such a genetic disease runs within the family .
Although it can affect the family drastically , it is better to be prepared rather than be caught on by surprise .
This is because when one is aware of it especially the parents , they can seek treatment even before the genetic disorder comes into effect , thus leading to little or no drastic change in one's lifestyle .
An example would be neonatal screening for sickle cell disease , when an affected child is diagnosed with this disease at an early stage , it can reduce childhood mortality and morbidity (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
Although the knowledge that there is a chance that the relatives themselves or their future children can have the same genetic disorder can cost them higher insurance premiums or even deny them of insurance coverage , there are regulations which can help them from being discriminated .
In America , there is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) which helps provide protection for those who have undergone genetic testing and are at risk for certain genetic disorder (Norrgard , 2008) .
In short , when the relatives of the individual who is tested positive for a certain genetic disease , may have raised fears such as unable to obtain insurance or loss of job , it does not necessarily mean that it will happen as there are policies and regulations implemented to help those who are genetically discriminated .
However , most of all , it helps create more awareness which can play a major role such as making a more informed family planning or how much money to be put aside for a better retirement (Norrgard , 2008) .
In this twenty-first century , health care has improved more drastically than ever , with the help of advanced technology that made diagnosis and treatment of diseases feasible and convenient .
Nowadays , genetic testing is becoming more and more prevalent to those who can afford and the diagnostic result can determine any possible genetic illness that an individual might suffer or carry .
Genetic testing basically uses laboratorial techniques to examine the genes of an individual and identify any inheritable disease like Huntington's disease  .
Thus , individuals with such genetic diseases but do not suffer from it are called carriers as they can pass it on to their future generations .
However , there are some ethical and social issues regarding to whether the family of the carrier should inform his or her relatives .
Although these issues are inevitable , the carrier should ultimately be obligated to reveal the genetic test results to the family members as the benefits of it would outweigh any other problems .
Firstly , disclosure of genetic test results to family members can reduce the risk of danger of the genetic disorder by treating it early and before any effects of the illness starts to kick in .
Treatable genetic diseases like hemophilia which causes excessive bleeding in damaged tissues and occurs usually in the beginning of adulthood .
This could be treated via injection of recombinant factor VIII concentrate into the veins within an hour when excessive bleeding starts .
(Gene Reviews) Hence , this is crucial to save a hemophiliac from over bleeding especially if he or she is unaware of such a condition .
In other words , knowing the risks of the genetic disorder can allow preventive medical treatment to reduce the risks of danger to the affected individual .
Furthermore , a change in lifestyle can also reduce possible effects of genetic disease like homocytinuria which is the genetic disorder of collagen through a therapeutic diet .
(Connective Tissue Disorder Site) Thus , it has become a personal responsibility of the carrier to inform the family members of such risk in order for early medical intervention to save the lives of his or her loved ones .
Next , it is important to inform siblings and children of the genetic disease they might contract and also the possibility of passing those harmful genes to their children if they plan to have any .
Possible heriditary genes can be attributed to a child's mental retardation and this eventually leads to social discrimination and also the sufferings the parents and the affected child have to bear .
Not only , can the notified family members know of the consequence they might face .
Some can be treated during the fetal stage of the pregnancy .
Such genetic disorders like Gaucher disease can be identified early and treated in time via biweekly with enzyme infusion .
(EmaxHealth) Therefore , with the genetic test result at hand , family members can decide whether to bear children with possible genetic disorders which would affect their lives drastically and also set preventive medical treatments  .
However , opponents of this position may argue that genetic testing does not provide a definite prediction on the individual's health .
This is because this method only gives the probability of contracting the disorder and many might not even suffer any effect of the gene disorder .
(Human Genome Project Information) Therefore , disclosing genetic test results to family members would only cause unnecessary anxiety to them , which can greatly affect their quality of life .
On the other hand , proponents can argue that life should not be gambled with and especially when it involves with the loved ones .
Hence , it is not ethically wrong to inform relatives of the carrier about the possible risk and the decision of whether they should undergo similar genetic testing would then be up to them .
In conclusion , the disclosure of genetic disorders of the carrier to the relatives can be very beneficial to their welfare as they can take preventive medical intervention and also decide whether to bear a child who might suffer the similar effects .
Although genetic testing is not always definite in predicting illnesses , no one would ever know if the genetic disease might occur and early prevention can ultimately save the individual's life .
Therefore , genetic counseling is very crucial for mediating such dilemma that a carrier might face as the experts can give professional advice on the advantages and disadvantages .
More importantly , the consequences of a genetic test on an individual should be made known to him or her before making such decision .
Genetic research and testing have advanced tremendously in recent years with tools such as the Genome Project (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
As such , genetic testing is becoming more readily accessible for people to have their genes tested for any indication of greater risk of developing any diseases (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
If an individual discovers after a genetic test that he has a high risk of developing certain diseases , it would mean that their family member who share similar genes may be at risk as well (Forrest K , 2003) .
Not only is it his responsibility to share his genetic testing results with his family (Forrest K , 2003) , informing his family members will give them a chance for early detection of the disease as well as to make necessary family planning (Agatha M , Denise B and Kathleen A , 2009) .
Hence , carriers of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his family members his genetic test result .
Firstly , it is the responsibility of the carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his family member of their increased likelihood of having the same genetic risk (Forrest K , 2003) .
Since all the family members share similar genes and DNA , the discovery of any members with a genetic risk of certain disease means that the rest of the family members are likely to have the same risk too (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
Being in the same family , it is one's responsibility to take care of each other's well-being (Forrest K , 2003) .
Critics of this point claim that there is a need to protect family members from the troubling information and that some of the family members may not be able to cope emotionally if revealed that they may be at high risk of a genetic disease (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
However , these concerns can be addressed by counseling as well as moral support from family members and the medical benefits that the family members can get from the information justifies the need to reveal the information to them (Forrest K , 2003) .
Hence , to fulfill the responsibility as a member of the family , the carrier of genetic risk should tell his relatives his genetic test result .
Secondly , sharing of the fact that one has a greater risk of genetic disease will encourage his relatives to go for genetic testing (Forrest K , 2003) .
The relatives can make an informed decision as to whether they want to have  genetic testing done themselves .
If they are tested with the same increased genetic risk , it will allow them to have early preventive medical treatment (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
The family members can also then consider family planning based on the severity of the disease and the likelihood of passing the disease to the next generation (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
Opponents of this position argue that the family members may hastily undergo a genetic test on receiving the negative news without careful consideration of the possible discrimination that they may face after the genetic test (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
Admittedly , it is true that one may face discrimination at work and from insurance companies after a genetic test (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
However , with the setting up of legislative law by governments , such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in the United States , the risk of discrimination at work or from insurance companies will be kept to a minimum (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
Thus , the genetic risk carrier should not hesitate to tell his relatives so that they can benefit from the information medically .
Genetic Testing grants us the ability to determine an individual's paternity and his chances of getting a genetic disorder such as Downs syndrome .
There are three forms of genetic testing - Gene tests , chromosomal test and biochemical test .
Since Genetic testing is voluntary , the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results .
This is because there are many social and emotional aspects with regards to genetic testing .
Revealing an individual's genetic makeup and results without their consent can also lead to an infringement of human rights and privacy .
Also , these individuals may face discriminations from family members and also from the society , such as their employers and insurance companies .
Therefore , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives to prevent such genetic testing results from being passed on to other third parties without consent .
An individual is not obligated to reveal the results of genetic testing to third parties due to the infringement of privacy and human rights .
Like medical records , results of genetic testing should be kept confidential and they should not be disclosed without permission (Mehlman1999) .
Since genetic testing requested by an individual involves the use of own genetic makeup , it is therefore against their human right to reveal the genetic testing results without their contest .
Every individual should be given the right to decide whether to disclose the genetic testing results to their relatives by weighing the advantages and disadvantages on their own .
This is based on the fact that everyone is unique and they have different background and personal constraints to take into considerations when deciding whether to reveal their genetic testing results .
Thus , the carrier of a known genetic risk is not obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Another reason such why genetic testing results should not be revealed to relatives is because other third parties may have the chance to get hold of these results and use them against the individuals .
There are many controversies on the fairness in the use of genetic information by other third parties such as insurers , employers , adoption agencies , schools , military and the courts .
It is not fair for insurers to deny insurance or raise premiums base for individuals that have positive results from genetic testing (Mehlman1999) .
Andre and Velasquez mentioned that being a carrier for a genetic disorder does not mean that the individuals will get the disorder for sure .
Therefore , it is justified for the carriers to buy insurance so that they can get a sufficient amount of coverage as compensation for any mishap that may or may not happen .
Raising premium for such individuals is seen as taking advantage of them .
Also , employers may stereotype these individuals as non-productive and inefficient workers and choose not to hire them (Weiss 1999) .
Therefore , the carriers of genetic disorder should not be obligated to reveal the results to anyone to prevent from having to face discriminations at societal level .
Proponents in favour for the revealing of results argue that revealing the results to third parties such as relatives can aid in emotional support .
Relatives can provide necessary help to the carriers by providing more care and concern .
This is necessary because carriers of genetic disorders undergo tremendous stress and it would be great if there is someone close to be there with them to face all kinds of problems .
Furthermore , revealing the results to the relatives can encourage them to be more health conscious and also to remind that to  go for frequent checkups since they might run the risk of having the same disorder too (Weiss 1999) .
However , this does not apply to all individuals and there is a possibility that they may even face discriminations from their own family members and relatives .
Some may feel that the individuals are likely to be a burden to them and may start to shun or keep away from them , causing them to feel even more upset or depressed .
Therefore , the final decision on whether to reveal the genetic testing results should lie in the hands of the carriers themselves .
In conclusion , the revealing of genetic test results may bring more problems than solutions to the individual and therefore they should be given the final say in whether to reveal the results .
Many problems such as discrimination and psychological stigmatisation attributed from the release of genetic testing should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to reveal the genetic testing results as they can worsen an individual's health condition .
Genetic testing is a medical test which looks at the DNA makeup of an individual .
The advantages of genetic testing include diagnosis of current or future diseases , prevention or early treatment and reducing disease risk in future generations (; Riper , 2005) .
Some possible disadvantages include anxiety , stress and strained family relationships ( Riper , 2005) .
After an individual has undergone genetic testing , is it necessary for him to share his test results with 3rd parties (someone other than his doctor) ?
While sharing can improve workplace safety and family health , it may also lead to genetic discrimination or unnecessary stress for both the patient and his family ( Sobel and Bursztajn , 2000) .
However , there are antidiscrimination laws where stressed individuals can seek genetic counseling ( .
Hence , an individual should be obligated to tell third parties his or her genetic test results .
Firstly , sharing of genetic test results benefits the individual with regards to the working environment .
Some work environments may increase disease risk in individuals with a particular genetic makeup .
For example , individuals with the genetic disorder , alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency have higher risk of getting related diseases when exposed to smoky environments (NCB , 1993) .
Thus , employers can have alternative work arrangements for these at-risk employees .
Opponents of this position argue that revelation of genetic test results to third parties will cause individuals to face genetic discrimination .
Sobel & Bursztajn (2000) reported that the American Management Associated did a survey on this and results showed that 7% of employers use employee's genetic information for employing and job advancement decisions .
For instance , an employer fired an office worker with a genetic disease due to not wanting to cover her high treatment costs under the company's health care benefits for workers (Sobel & Bursztajn , 2000) .
However , there are antidiscrimination laws (Sobel & Bursztajn , 2000) .
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was signed into law by President George W . Bush on May 2008 (HGMIS , 2008) .
GINA forbids genetic discrimination by employers and health insurers (HGMIS , 2008) .
Therefore , revelation of genetic test results to others , benefits the individual .
Secondly , sharing of genetic test results can improve family health .
When an individual is identified as having a gene mutation associated with a disease , his family and relatives may also have that gene mutation .
His direct family has a fifty percent chance of having the same mutation while his extended family has 25 percent chance of having the same mutation (Norrgard , 2008) .
Hence , that individual should inform his family and relatives so as to advise them to take genetic testing .
If his family or relatives are found to have the same gene mutation , early treatment or preventive measures can be taken .
Critics argue that genetic information may cause negative emotional and psychological effects on family and relatives (AACC , 2009) .
However , genetic counseling is available , to help them cope with their psychological problems (AACC , 2009) .
Thus , the revelation of one's genetic test results to family and relatives , benefits them .
In conclusion , an individual should reveal his genetic test results to 3rd parties as it improves workplace safety and family health .
Sharing of genetic results not only benefits himself , but also his family and relatives .
If one loves his family , one should let them know his genetic test results .
Firstly , it is their responsibility to tell the relatives the result oftechnologiesic test .
According to the article Genetic testing is all in the family by Jeffery P . Kahn , Director of Centre for Bioethics , University of Minnesota , the family has the right to know the result of the genetic test of any member in the family .
Since the whole family shares the same set of genes , the information the individual provides through the genetic testing may have just as much meaning for the family as for him or herself (Kahn , 2000) .
Therefore , these results should be told , no matter they are good or bad .
However , some may claim that the individuals have the right to protect their privacy (Kahn , 2000) , and like other private information , genetic information should be protected properly , and people have the final say whether to reveal it to others .
However , here there is something more important than privacy .
Genetic disorder only can be treated if those carriers of a known genetic risk decide to reveal their genetic result .
Moreover , we can only protect our children from inherited disease if we know whether there is a genetic risk .
As a result , the carriers of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives .
Secondly , it ensures that those carriers of genetic risk get the best care from family and society if they are willing to tell the test results .
As we all know , genetic disorder is not contagious and there is no risk for those people who want to offer help .
However , sometimes when there is high pressure , like knowing they are having genetic disorder , the individuals cannot make decisions properly , while their family and professional can take good care of them and make the best decision for them (Forrest et al . , 2007) .
Someone may claim that other people's decision may leif it istial dangers for the person concerned (Forrest et al . , 2007) , since we are not them and cannot know exactly what they need .
However , as known to all , a group with several professionals will have more knowledge and experience than the individual , and the family members of the carriers will selflessly take care of them .
Therefore it is better for the carriers to tell their relatives the test results .
to potentiala geneticTo draw a conclusion , for the carriers of genetic risk , it is better to tell the genetic test results to their relatives because it is an action not only showing their rdisordersiarety to the family and society , but also ensuring that they can get the best care .
An important reason why individual should have the in whether to reveal the results of genetic tdisorderss because people have the right to protect their privacy .
The decision of informing family members the results should be a personal choice .
Because the results of genetic testing not only affect the person who takes the test but also relate to his family members , sometimes people may encounter dilemmas .
Indivian individualske different decision dethe invasionon their situations .
For example , after undergoing genetic testing , people may find out that their siblings also have the same genetic disorder with themselves .
However , informing them may result in huge changes in their life decisions .
Thus , whether to tell them the results or not is a cautious decision that should be made by individuals (Norrgard 2008) .
Some may suggest that it is an ethical responsibility for people who are found to have genetic disorder to inform the results to their family members .
However , since currently there is no legislation forcing people to do so , the results should be treated as privacy and should be protected (Norrgard 2008) .
Another reason is that tan individual of genetic testing results may cause social discrimination .
If the results of individual genetic testing are revealed to employers and insurance companies , employers may not hire people who are diagnosed by with certain disease .
Likewise , insurance companies may also refuse to serve people who have high risk of relatesisease (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
Opponents may argue that law can be used as a mean to protect adecisionsenetic discrimination .
They cited that a number of laws have been enacted to prohibit insurance companies from collecting information of genetic testing anasithem discriminate against people (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
However , this approach is not effective .
Firstly , most laws only restrict types of genetic information , but they do not ensure that people will be fairly charged if they reveal genetic testing results (Norrgard 2008) .
Secondly , laws still disordersitation of prohibiting employers from refusing people who have genetic disorder (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
Hence , using legal power to limit discrimination privatemplete .
meansthe lawdiseasesdiseasesTo conclude , since genetic testing results are people's privacy and revealing them may cause social discrimination , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The Oxford Dictionary defines genetic testing as the sequencing of human DNA in order to discover genetic differences , anomalies , or mutations that may prove pathological .
One of the many ethical issues associated with genetic testing involves the question of whether a known carrier of a genetic condition is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
While the individual has no legal or professional obligation to inform his relatives , he nevertheless has a very strong moral obligation to do so as his relatives who may have inherited the condition can take action to improve the prognosis as well as prepare themselves mentally and socially , not revealing this information can be interpreted as negligence on the part of the carrier , and telling his relatives will allow them to anticipate lifestyle changes to accommodate his condition as well as ready them for possible financial strain that may come about .
First of all , it is a known fact that genetic conditions may be hereditary and thus indirectly involve the relatives of the carrier as well , putting the carrier's relatives at a possible risk of having the condition as well .
The carrier is at least morally obligated to inform his relatives from an altruistic point of view .
In the event that one of the carrier's relatives discover that he is affected by the disorder , preventive measures can be taken in anticipation of the disease and in the event that the disease is incurable , palliative steps can be planned .
An example of prevention would be an individual affected by the BRCA gene undergoing a mastectomy which would reduce the chances of developing breast cancer from 85% to 1% (http://www .medscape .com/viewarticle/573060) .
Beyond telling them , the decision to undergo genetic testing is purely up to the relatives themselves .
While some might say that there is no point in knowing if a disease has no cure , knowing has its benefits as it not only prepares the individual for the physical aspects of the disease but also the psychological aspects .
In the event that a relative tests positive for a genetic condition , it is not only the physical aspects of the diseases that must be considered , but also the psychosocial aspects of the disease .
Having known that he is at risk of a genetic condition , an individual will be able to anticipate the possibility that he might be afflicted with the disease and mentally prepare for that possibility .
He will be able to work towards acceptance of the fact that he might have the condition and be able to adapt easily to it in the event that the condition manifests itselfitself , as opposed to the condition striking suddenly without prior warning .
Furthermore , he will be able to also mentally prepare for any stigma or discrimination that he may face in society as it has been shown that identifying patients in need of psychosocial support will enhance effect on well being (Mind and cancer: does psychosocial intervention improve survival and psychological well- being ?) .
Although some people prefer to be carefree and prefer not to know at all as they cite the fact that knowing will make them anxious and stressed , the onus is on them to go for the genetic testing to determine any abnormalities .
If ignorance is their choice , it is their right to go along with it .
Finally , the financial effect of the disease on the carrier and his relatives must also be considered in the ethical reasoning of this argument as the financial aspects of a disease may be far reaching , especially for families in the low income group .
This especially applies more to certain diseases like diabetes mellitus or cancer in which the cost of treatment puts a severe strain on the finances of a family .
A carrier is thus obliged to tell his family members in order for them to start thinking ahead by starting initiatives like saving plans or taking up more jobs .
The family will also be able to start looking for avenues of financial assistance even before the disease strikes .
To emphasize this point , studies have shown that economic hardship requires households to make difficult decisions between care and basic living expenses , which at times compromises necessary treatments and health care (economic hardship requires households to make difficult decisions between care and basic living expenses , which at times compromises necessary treatments and health care) .
While some might argue that there is little that people in the low income groups can do to prepare for this and it might simply cause unnecessary stress for them; it must be pointed out that it is even more important for this group of people to plan ahead for the future as they will very likely lack sufficient resources to deal with it when the problem surfaces .
The advancement in science and technology has enabled the determination of genetic risk of disease development by means of genetic testing .
Although it is an improvement in the scientific world in view of combating diseases , ethical dilemma is born in the communication of genetic risk in families .
Some have suggested that the issue is related to privacy  and the disclosure of genetic information may cause anxiety , guilt , depression and other disadvantages in both individuals and their relatives (Norrgard , 2008) .
However the importance of the moral obligation individuals have for their family and the consequences for family planning and personal health of at-risk relatives should not be neglected .
In fact the potential for harm to uninformed relatives outweighs the individual's right to confidentiality and therefore the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Forrest and her team stated that "the responsibility of disseminating genetic information to family members lies largely with the individual" (Forrest , Delatycki , Skene , Aitken , 2007 , para .2) .
Individuals may possess duty of care and/or moral obligations to communicate the potential genetic risk to relatives .
According to a documented research done by Clarke , Richards , and Kerzin-Storrar , among the 40 ,000 clients attending genetics clinics over a 1-year period world-wide , only 65 were reported as non- disclosure cases , a frequency of non-disclosure that was shown to be less than 1% of all genetics consults .
(Clarke , Richards , Kerzin-Storrar , 2005) Indeed , the moral obligation of individuals to their family and relatives is a compelling argument supported by "kinship bonds and an assumed desire to protect family members from harm" (Forrest et al , 2007) .
Some have argued that individuals may not disclose genetic information because they prefer not to contact relatives personally (Consent and Confidentiality in Genetic Practice: Guidance on Genetic Testing and Sharing Genetic Information , 2005) , and they are embarrassed about reporting bad news (Wertz , 2003) , or they are unable to communicate directly with family members (Ethical Aspects of Human Genetic Testing: An Information Paper , 2000) .
Nevertheless , one can seek assistance from genetic health professionals to address the above problems by "having the genetic health professionals to communicate the genetic information to family members at the client's request" (Forrest et al , 2007) .
Genetic information is relevant to both the carrier of a known genetic risk and his or her relatives due to "genetic heritage" (Wertz , 2003 , p .50) .
Thus  relatives who are unaware of their risk may experience consequences for personal health and family planning (Forrest et al , 2007) .
In fact many published guidelines for genetic information disclosure have listed  explicit statements such as 'family' , 'family members' or 'relatives' to broadly include some who are at risk of a genetic condition .
More explicit statements can be seen from five organizations by "specifying 'blood relatives' , 'the whole family , ascendants , descendants , collaterals , and possibly spouses' , 'future children' , 'relatives , including offspring' , or 'family , [which] needs to be understood as covering an extended set of relatives linked by blood ties or by marriage or by both'" (Forrest et al , 2007 , p .614) .
Sermijn had done a research involving family relatives who revealed a lack of understanding and awareness that a genetic risk was present in their family (Sermijn et al , 2004) .
However this may not be a reason for individuals to withhold genetic information from their relatives .
UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics states that "both individuals and family members have responsibilities to be willing to give and receive genetic information" (Forrest et al , 2007 , p614) .
Effective communication strategies can be employed to achieve a positive outcome of communication by assessing the vulnerability and receptivity of family relatives .
This can be achieved through personal understanding or advice given by genetic health professionals (Gaff , 2007) .
In summary , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives because the sense of responsibility to inform the relatives with crucial genetic information outweighs concerns about affecting the individual by imparting "bad" or potentially unwelcome news .
Potential harm to uninformed family relatives has to be considered although the disclosure may not be smooth due to lack of understanding by relatives .
Fortunately the latter can be solved by seeking the help of genetic health professionals who can provide effective communication strategies to help produce a positive outcome of communication .
The gene is the basic heredity unit in all living organisms its properties concerns families and kinship of all humans .
It is the study of how characteristics are passed down through generations .
The ability to identify more genes which are related to specific disorders increases dramatically as the genetic technology develops vigorously  .
It allows new possibilities of genetic testing and more to come (Clarke & Parsons , 1997) .
In the case of diseases that have an onset in adulthood , such as Huntington's disease , people can get themselves tested before symptoms develop to discover the likelihood of getting the disorder .
Some of those who receive a positive testing result , despite the shock and the devastating situation that they face , will consider the interests of other family members and inform their relatives of the existence of this genetic risk in the family .
But not all patients will have the moral obligation to do .
Thus , there is a need for a carrier of a known genetic risk to be legally obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Carriers of known genetic risks should be obligated to tell their relatives because it prevents severe harm such as loss of lives .
If they are being alerted to such a condition , they will be able to seek possible treatments and receive warnings to avoid detrimental environment stimuli .
For example , malignant hyperthermia syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder where life-threatening conditions will be triggered by regular anesthesia .
Prior warning of a carrier can actually prevent unexpected death of blood relatives during their surgeries (Andrews , 1994) .
Moreover , information of genetic risk from a carrier will serve as guidance in his or her relatives' reproductive decision making .
After knowing of a possible genetic condition , one may think twice before deciding to conceive a child .
The rate of abortion upon learning of fetus defection will then decrease , hence preventing meaningless loss of lives .
Likewise , obligation of carrier to tell his or her relatives allows those who indeed will suffer from dormant genetic diseases or are suffering from genetic condition to plan their lives ahead .
They will tend to avoid passing on the undesirable condition to their children , hence they may seek proper guidance through counseling before considering to conceive a child .
For example , Huntington's disease's symptoms normally only appear when one is approaching his or her middle age .
Knowing of this dormant genetic disease earlier certainly allows the patients to make decision whether to build a family  , or for those who already have their own families - whether to conceive children  because there is a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to the offspring for each pregnancy .
In addition , informed relatives who then find out their genetic condition - whether they are a carrier or sufferer of that particular genetic disease  , are given a chance to secure financial schemes for future use .
Furthermore , their family members are granted the time to equip themselves with the knowledge and  to take care of said patients for an extended period of time in future .
Undoubtedly , privacy advocates criticize that such enforced obligation violates an individual's autonomy .
They argue that for family interest to outweigh one's autonomy is unethical because there may be cases where relatives use one's genetic disorder information to their own advantage , rendering material loss and mishap social status to the individual .
For example , a woman can easily claim custody of her children from her formal husband who has Huntington's disease , by asserting he will not have the ability to take care of their children in the near future .
While it is true that the extreme circumstances mentioned do exist in  society , one must agree that relatives have their  rights too , to know about the presence of genetic risk within the family because no one has exclusive rights over his or her genes as they are shared among the family .
Spouses too have the right to know when it comes to making a family just as he or she has equal rights over the children .
Indeed , powerful protection has always been given to autonomy , privacy and confidentiality .
However , these ethics can be breached when the action has an essential purpose , such as safeguarding others from harm , which unquestionably outweighs those said principles (Andrews , 1994) .
The absolute priority that they possess should be balanced by awareness of averting medical harm to fellow humans (Wang , 2001) .
Therefore , a carrier of known genetic risk should be legally obligated to inform relatives , not just morally responsible to do that .
In conclusion , legal obligation of carriers with known genetic risk to tell their relatives should be implemented as it brings about advantages such as preventing loss of lives and reducing uncertainties in potential patients' futures .
As DNA technology advances , our ability to test individuals for genetic disorders is increasing significantly .
This new ability raises both high hopes and grave concerns .
Genetic testing leads to diagnosis , prevention and treatment of a particular disease .
Conversely , the implications of test results raise social and ethical concerns .
The controversial issue on whether one should be obliged to disclose the result of such testing remains a subject of great concern among the society( Mehlman , 1999) .
Individual genetic information should not be revealed to a third party without authorisation of the tested individual because the fundamental right to privacy should be respected .
Also , the predictive nature of genetic testing suggests that there is no need to allow the results to be made public .
In addition , it is feared that the effortless access of such information by the concerned party might be utilised inappropriately and be used adversely on an individual .
Firstly , based on the context of confidentiality and privacy , individuals have a right to maintain confidentiality of the genetic makeup .
If one has no control over who can gain information of the individual , it can lead to potentially serious consequences .
Byravan ,S .
and Matlaw ,J(2005) emphasized that individual genetic information gained from testing should be subjected to confidentiality and protected from harm that might result from improper disclosure or use of the information .
One may perceive privacy as an overrated right .
Secondly , although genetic testing can be useful for assessment of genetic predispositions and diagnosis of medical conditions , it is essential to take note that the testing does not deal with certainties .
It does not identify all of the possible gene mutations that cause a particular condition .
Thus , a positive or a negative outcome does not rule out the possibility for one to contract certain genetic disorders since it only gives a probabilistic indicator of the chances to develop certain diseases based on inherited conditions .
Likewise , while a relative may have tested positive for a cancer marker , it does not mean that other family members of the family will definitely get the disease .
Since the clinical outcomes are not definitive , it should not be regarded as medical advice .
The disclosure of such a result might make the other family members  worry unnecessarily .
This psycho-emotional consequence can trigger more harm than good to the individual as well as the family relationship as people may feel depressed , guilty or confused following the disclosure of the result .
Whilst some insisted that the disclosure of the results is necessary because it leads to early detection of a disease and thus enhances preventability and treatability , for  for most adult-onset conditions , knowing a child's genetic status will not affect the course of the disease or its treatment .
Moreover , the society is already well educated on the ways to prevent cancer .
It is through the maintenance of healthy lifestyle coupled with routine medical checkups .
Those who have a family history of particular genetic disorder should be particularly well aware of the risk of getting the disease and take the necessary precautions with the guidance of their doctor .
Thirdly , upon providing genetic material , individuals lose control over who can access results .
Consequently , when someone shows the predisposition to genetic disorder , it exposes one to the possibility of stigmatisation and discrimination when the genetic information is made accessible to others .
Byravan .S and Matlaw .J (2005) highlighted that the cost-conscious employers might make adverse employment decisions based on a person's predispositions .
They might also be turned down for job promotions .
Due to profit considerations , one's privilege to different schemes of insurance converge might be limited .
One might even be excluded from health insurance coverage when one's gene status shows a flaw As such , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is implemented to prevent health insurers and employers from discriminating against a person's genetic predispositions (Allison , 2008) .
One may argue that following the safeguards established , it should be able to hinder  the needless worries .
However , Norrgard ,K (2008) pointed out that current regulations lack an adequate enforcement mechanism .
Assurances of protection is more difficult to come by .
Afterall , , the decisions made are still largely dependent on the subjective perception of the society .
In conclusion , the decision of examinee to have their results of genetic testing disclosed or to refuse them should be voluntary and should not be interfered with .
The loss of privacy and the potential social discrimination involved are still the main concerns of the public .
Genetic information should be disclosed without the patient's authorization only when necessary to protect third parties from harm or when disclosure is compelled by law . . . . .
There has been an ongoing debate on whether doctors should reveal the results of genetic tests to others besides the individuals who have undergone the tests without their acknowledgement (Lynch , 2008) , (Ostrom , 1997) and (Tanner , 2004) .
Genetic testing can confirm one's ancestry , paternity and the risk of them developing a disease or passing on the genetic disease to their offspring (Lynch , 2008) .
It would benefit others , as relatives of the individual known to be a carrier of the disease might be at-risk of developing the disease as well (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Conversely , some people feel that it is an invasion of privacy (Tanner , 2004) and that others may abuse the information (Ostrom , 1997) .
Discrimination may also occur (The Associated Press , 2008) and insurance premiums for individuals and their relatives might increase if insurance companies know that the have a high risk of developing certain hereditary diseases .
Hence individuals should have the final say on whether to reveal the results of their genetic tests to their relatives .
It is without a doubt beneficial to inform relatives that they might be at risk of developing a hereditary disease when an individual's genetic tests turn out to be positive (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Relatives may choose to go for a genetic test to determine their status by checking for the particular mutation known to increase the risk of developing a particular disease (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Should they test positive for the particular mutation , preventive measures and cost-effective treatments could be carried out to reduce the risk of developing the disease (The Changes in Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO) , 2005) but not every person with the mutation would develop the disease eventually .
On the flipside , some people cannot come to terms with the fact that they might have a higher chance of developing a disease compared to other people .
They might have very negative thoughts like anger , fear that they would develop the disease in the near future or if they have children , they might feel guilty about passing the mutation to their children (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Hence , individuals should have the final decision on whether they want to reveal the results of their genetic test to their relatives , especially if they know that their relatives would be unable to cope with the news .
Another issue now is that individual's privacy is not respected as insurance companies without their consent show their results to relatives .
Insurance companies might have gotten hold of an individual's positive genetic tests without his consent to show his relatives why their insurance premiums were inflated (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) or to explain why their bid to get insured was rejected (Ostrom , 1997) .
Then again , if relatives know that a genetic disease is hereditary and went for a genetic test to prove that they do not have the mutation that would put them at a higher risk of developing the disease , they would be able to get insured earlier (Ostrom , 1997) .
Although there are regulations to prevent insurers from discriminating people with a higher chance of getting certain genetic diseases (The Changes in Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO) , 2005) ,  it might lead to higher insurance premiums for everyone .
Hence , the results of individuals' genetic test should not be revealed to others unless individuals choose to as the information could be abused and their relatives would most likely be affected .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say on whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Genetic testing is a specific medical test to look out for a particular part of the genes .
It is often used to diagnose inherited diseases and to determine a child's genetic parents .
With the main focus on fine tuning its processes to increase its accuracy , ethical issues have not been well addressed .
Ethical issues such as whether an individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results remains shady .
Many argue that they should not have the final say as it benefits the general public  .
In fact ,  knowing the results might create unnecessary fear among people .
Not only that , the society might in turn discriminate the individual with an undesired result .
Furthermore , it is morally wrong to reveal the results without the individual's consent as it intrudes into one's privacy .
Therefore , individuals should have the final say in revealing the results of their genetic test .
Secondly ,  revealing the results without the individual's final say might cause unnecessary stress to others , especially  their relatives .
An individual might chose not to reveal the outcome of the test as it might create anxiety on their loved ones .
This in turn would create unnecessary stress and might affect the way they lead their lives .
Some might argue that this will impose more strain on the individual who is already facing the stress from reality , and therefore , revealing the results might unburden him or her .
However , there are genetic counselors trained in this field to address any concerns , and thus there is no need to reveal the results without the individual's final say .
Thirdly ,  knowing the results of the genetic test on the individuals might cause discriminations against them .
As our genes are not controlled by us , it will be unfair to discriminate individuals based on their genetic makeup (Norrgard , 2008) .
For example , a 30 year old employee who is as competent as any other staff , was recently genetically tested positive for Huntington's disease .
Individuals with Huntington's disease develop their symptoms such as uncontrolled movements and mental declination only at an average age of 35-44 years old .
Knowing that the employee could not remain committed to the company in the next 5-10 years , the employer decides to retrench that employee .
As such , the employee's potential will be hindered as he or she would still be able to work normally until the symptoms set in 5-10 years from now .
This not only hinders one's potential ,  also affects the way the individual walks his or her remaining path of life .
Similarly , a health insurance company might deny an individual  an insurance plan or  charge them  a higher rate if such results are disclosed to it . .
Some might argue that this is necessary to prevent people from benefitting off  those insurance companies .
However , we must not forget the fact that we have no control over our genetic make-up .
As such it is not because  they want to benefit off  these companies , it is more of what they have to do in order to survive financially .
Besides , the very purpose of health insurance companies is to provide healthcare and to ensure the well-being of the people .
As important as it is to increase the accuracy of genetic testing , individuals should have the final say in revealing the results .
By doing so , we can respect each other's privacy , minimize unnecessary stress on others as well as  eliminate discrimination against the already unfortunate individuals .
Genetic testing is a technique used to test for genetic disorders .
In genetic testing , a patient's DNA is  tested for mutation and  DNA is obtained from his/her blood sample .
Some reasons why people should go for genetic testing are to find out genetic diseases in babies and to find out whether a person carries a mutated gene and might t pass it on to his children .
Although some may argue that a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives about it , due to privacy  issues , or different emotional reactions of relatives or parents .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , revealing  genetic testing results raises an issue of privacy  .
This is because there is a possibility that those individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases are being backstabbed by someone they know .
Individuals who found out that their genes were mutated have an increased risk in developing cancer or diseases .
For example , an employer would not want to retain or hire employees that have a likelihood of developing cancer or diseases as employees' health and working ability will be affected once they develop cancer .
Similarly , individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases will have difficulties  obtaining insurance as individuals are likely to have increased medical bills once they develop cancer or diseases .
Insurance costs might  also be very high . .
Furthermore , it is unfair to discriminate against individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases as they themselves cannot control their own genes .
(Norrgard , 2008)
Secondly , revealing  genetic testing results will result in different emotional reactions of relatives or parents .
This is because different people will react differently after knowing an individual's genetic testing results .
For example , if individuals reveal their genetic testing results to their parents , their parents will feel very guilty and blame themselves as individuals had inherited his/her mutated gene(s) .
An individual's parents will not want to go for genetic testing as they feel that if one of them has a positive test result , he/she is the one who passed their mutated genes to the individual On the other hand , an individual's parents may have a positive response to genetic testing results .
They will feel relieved that they have found an explanation on why individuals are suffering from cancer or diseases .
Therefore , emotional reactions of relatives or parents are unpredictable and it depends on the belief and mindset of relatives or parents of individuals .
Thus , to prevent relatives or parents thinking negatively , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives (Varga , 2008) .
There is an argument stating that revealing  individuals' genetic test results will benefit the individuals' relative or parents .
This is because individuals' relative or parents can go for genetic testing and check whether they had inherited any mutated gene(s) or not .
If individuals' relative or parents had inherited any mutated gene(s) , they can undergo preventive health measures .
Although revealing  individuals' genetic test result will benefit individuals' relative or parents , not much preventive measures can be done to delay or lower the risk of individuals' relative or parents from developing cancer or diseases .
Therefore , there is not a need to reveal individuals' genetic test result as individuals can ask their parents or relatives to undergo genetic testing without revealing their result .
(Lee , 2005)
In conclusion , revealing  genetic testing results will affect individuals .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives due to privacy concerns , and negative emotional reactions of relatives or parents .
The human genome project , begun in 1990 , was an ambitious project with the aim of sequencing the 3 billion human DNA and identifying the genes present in these DNA .1 It is no doubt that this project is one of the most successful achievements in the field of biotechnology .
The information gathered enables one to know how the genetic makeup of human correlate to a particular cause of disease .1 However the availability of such tests has brought about other ethical issues , like should the results be announced to the carrier of known genetic risk to his relatives .
I believe this is an issue of personal privacy and rights , the carrier should not have any obligation to inform anyone unless he wishes to do so .
The medical history of an individual is confidential , and prior to revealing the results to anyone , one should seek the permission of the individual and respect his privacy .
One might argue for the fact that the results might affect his immediate family and the carrier has the responsibility of informing them in order for them to take preemptive measures .
Those who took this stand overlook the very fact that genetic testing results only show the presence of the risk .
It does not mean that the linked disease will surely took place .
The immediate family might undergo unnecessary stress only to discover that  that disorder might not have occurred at all .
Once the results are revealed to the immediate family or relatives , there is no doubt the risk of straining the relationship between all the parties involved .
The individual might risk being discriminated against by his own family and thus the weight of revealing the results  should lie solely on the individual .
Many of these genetic tests are for disorder with zero or few known preventive measures .2 In short , it is actually pointless to know the results as there is nothing one could really do about it .
Taking the test and knowing the results might be quite disturbing to the subject involved and might adversely affect his social life .
One may take the stand that if the subject knows that he is a carrier , he should tell his spouse about it and together make a careful decision with regard to family planning .
One may also argue that he has a moral obligation now to weight if he should even have children , fearing  passing the risk to the next generation .
Those who take this stands are actually discriminating against an individual on a groundless basis , and removing his basic human right to even start and live in a normal family .
Many of such tests only reveal the fact that the subject is at a higher risk of developing the disorder with respect to one without that particular genetic makeup .
The results , however , will not predict when nor whether it will really occur . .2 It is ironic that if one were to take a look at the other side of the coin of most of these statistical data data , chances of the particular disorder not occurring  within the carriers is actually very much higher .
In conclusion , the decision of informing the subject's immediate family should lie solely with the subject himself .
He has to assess the pros and cons his of own unique situation and make a choice .
He should not be forced , or under any external influences into revealing the test results .
His privacy has to be respected .
One should recognize the fact that these results from genetic testing only point to the fact that one is only at a higher risk of developing the disorder , it does not mean the disorder will surely occur
Genetic testing  can check for some genetic disorder or disease such as {Hemophilia}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Hemophilia] , Huntington's disease and Marfan Syndrome , which means that this kind of disease has a certain possibility to be inherited by the next generation .
There is controversy whether a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Considering the preparation for the future of his or her relatives , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about the disease or disorder .
Firstly , it is  general knowledge that until present , all kinds of genetic disease have no definite cure .
It seems to be doing no benefit to reveal the existence of the genetic disease to the carrier's relatives .
However , it can raise the awareness of the carrier's relatives when they plan to give birth to the next generation .
If they know that their family tends to have such disease , they can have another genetic testing to verify their own condition .
This can actually prevent an unfortunate baby that would affect  the life to be born .
Somehow , privacy is what people are most concerned with when discussing this topic .
I could not agree more with the fact that the carrier's privacy is sacrificed when he or she revealsl  the testing result .
Nevertheless , family members should have the right to know the genetic information as they are genetically related to each other , which means that they are at the same risk also .
Therefore , the result of the testing should be told to the carrier's relatives .
Secondly , one can reduce the stress of carrying such information alone by telling his or her relatives the truth .
The outcome of bearing a heavy burden alone can be very serious that the person may end up devastated by the psychological disease rather than the genetic disease .
Sharing the result with relatives can indeed relieve the burden and help the person fight against the disease or disorder together .
An additional gain is that family members would be considerate and would save money for the carrier's medical expenses in future .
Some may say that  revealing  the result would cause tension within the family .
It is  true .
However , if he thinks  positively , he can in fact share the tension  with his  family so that he  does not have to carry it alone .
After all , love of family is the greatest thing one can rely on .
In conclusion , the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives the result of genetic testing for their benefit , and of course the carrier's own benefit .
Respond to the question above , supporting your argument with concrete examples .
Genetic testing is a type of medical test that is used to find changes in genes , chromosomes and protein (Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
It has been used for years to identify genetic diseases in humans .
When the result of the test is positive , those who have a genetic risk will receive appropriate treatment .
However , whether a carrier of such disease is obligated to tell his or her relatives has become a great concern since the last few years .
Although it is the right of the individual requesting genetics to decide to reveal the result or not (Scientific American , 2008) , relatives of a carrier also have the right to be warned against any genetic risk and to receive necessary treatment .
Genetic disorders are caused by the mutation of a gene (Letsou , 2009)  .When a normal gene is mutated , its stability will no longer be maintained .
This will lead to some diseases , dependdepending on which gene is mutated .
Since disorders can be passed over from parents to a child , the relatives of a carrier , obviously , have a higher chance to carry the same disorder .
Thus , they should be informed about the risk of having disorders .
Being aware of it , they may choose to go through some genetic tests to check whether the disorder is present (Scientific American , 2008) .
If the result is positive , then they will receive necessary treatment .
Although we have not found how to cure many of such diseases yet , if it is detected soon , the life of the patient can be lengthened .
Some people can claim that knowing that we are having a high risk of having , for example , a type of cancer while we may not have it can make people more anxious (Cancer .net , 2009)  .
In fact , the reactions of people with disorders are different (Cancer .net , 2009) thus we may not have been diagnosed to have  cancer since we were young but it may present when we are  middle age .
Knowing more about a risk of having a disease may help people to be more aware of its phenomenon , as well as more concerned about their health (Cancer .net , 2009) .
They may have medical check-up more frequently and if there is any disorder that can threaten their life , it will be identified soon and it is always better when we can control a disease when it has not become worse yet .
At least the effect of the disorder can be reduced .
This may lengthen the life of the carrier or even more , save it .
Since the relatives of a carrier of disorders , especially his or her family , have a higher risk , they have a right to know about it (Cancer .net , 2009) .
This will protect not only the relatives but also other people .
It is because genetic disorder not only affects the health of carriers but also their life .
For example , a person who is diagnosed to have a serious disorder in a gene , which may lead to a rare disease , will have to think very carefully before getting married since his or her children may also have this disease  .
Moreover , genetic disorders usually have a great influence on the carrier's health .
It may decrease the working capability of the carrier , or some hidden disease can become worse if the carrier works too much or lives in an extremely polluted place .
While children whose parents are diagnosed to have a genetic disease can very possibly  have it (Genetic Home Reference , 2009) , they should be informed so that they can make suitable decisions in choosing job , participating in hard activities and so on .
Many genetic disorders such as cancers will lead to serious consequences if the carrier does not have a healthy lifestyle to protect himself .
Otherwise since the disorder is not serious , then the carrier can live a normal life .
Although there is a concern that a positive test with a particular genetic disease can decrease the chance of the candidate in getting a job (Fisher , 2009) since companies always want employees who can work as hard as they want , laws are passed in order to protect the victims of disorder (Fisher , 2009) .
Furthermore , whenever a person received a positive test on a particular genetic disorder , he will choose the job that cannot destroy his health or make the disorder worse .
Moreover , carriers of disorders can receive support from their relatives , especially from their family if they let them know about the diagnosis .
When a teenager is diagnosed to have a serious genetic disorder , she must tell her parents know , since the doctor needs the permission of her family before giving her any treatment .
It is said that parents may feel guilty because their may pass a dangerous disorder over their children (Cancer , 2009) .
However , when a carrier's family knows well about her health condition , she will receive more care , which is better for her  .
Furthermore , telling relatives the results also help the carriers .
They will receive more encouragement , as well as other help in money , medicine and so on (Croft , 2009) .
This makes carriers feel better even if the disease is serious , thus they have an internal strength to struggle with it .
Hence ,it also help to increase the success rate of the treatment because when the patients really think of overcoming the disease , the process will go easily .
In conclusion , because it is a right of humans to know about the risk they have , the carriers of disorders must tell their relatives about it .
It not only protects their relatives but also helps them in fighting the diseases .
Over the years , genetic testing has been increasingly used in clarifying a diagnosis for more targeted treatments and allowing families to avoid having children with devastating diseases .
However , It may also be a precarious tool capable of invading an individual's privacy and breaching confidentiality , thus having a significantly negative impact on future public health .
In addition , abuse of genetic testing information may result in employment discrimination .
Therefore , individuals should have the final say whether to reveal the results of their own genetic testing .
Firstly , privacy is important in maintaining individuals' autonomy and individuality as individuals define themselves by deciding how much personal information to disclose (Privacilla , 2001) .
Similarly , privacy also relates to the individuals' power over genetic information confidentiality .
Moreover , genetic information is protected in several ways; Common Law Principles , Statutory protection in the Data Protect Act 1984 , Doctor's professional codes of practice and contracts of healthcare providers' employment .
According to these documents , anyone , including all healthcare providers , has no right to disclose individuals' genetic information to a third party without the individual's consent .
However , genetic information of an individual susceptible to a particular genetic disease inevitably concerns family members who usually also share the same set of genes .
Hence , advocates may argue that if an individual holds the final say , yet chooses to withhold the information from their family members , this could have serious implications on the other family members susceptible to a particular disease .
On the other hand , if the individual chooses to freely release such information to family members who may not be susceptible ,  cause undue anxiety .
Admittedly ,  can result in negative consequences , but one can also adopt the view that another responsible person would wish to communicate relevant information to their family members who are interested in that information , and a responsible person is interested in that information , particularly where it may have a significance in future decisions that they might hold .
Supporting this notion , evidence from a government case study suggests that individuals withholding genetic information from people who may need to know is not a common occurrence .
In addition , the desirability of sharing information with family members is also emphasized through counseling and doctor's persuading , but not made a condition as it does not supersede the individual's right to privacy .
Furthermore , it is false that family members are not protected , because the court passes on laws to reveal an individuals' genetic information .
This , however , is judged on a case by case basis , and is only approved if an individual's decision causes potential damage rather than mere inconvenience and if the reason for refusal to give permission has evidence of malice .
Most importantly , confidence and trust can also be shattered if doctors fail to respect confidentiality .
In the long run , public health might be affected as doctors are discredited as a source of education and patients do not come forward .
Therefore , individuals should still have the final say because the interest of the family members does not supersede individuals' privacy and there is an assumed responsibility of individuals to share relevant information , but even without doing so , family members would still be protected by the laws .
Also , breaching patients' confidentiality has significantly negative impact on future public health .
Secondly , the disclosure of individuals' genetic information to employers may result in employment discrimination .
Competition in market forces and drive for economic efficiency can invoke employers to exploit the genetic information as opportunities to reduce cost and improve work efficiency .
Employers would prefer to hire a "healthy worker" because they have a lower frequency of being absent through illness which translates to lower cost in work impairments , hiring temporary replacements and fewer precaution to be taken to deal with health and safety risk .
Moreover , genetic information can also deny a person with late onset of a disease of a particular job , for example a person with Huntington's disease , being healthy most of his or her lifetime .
Though some employers claimed that knowing individuals' genetic information can help them to take specific measures to protect individuals at risk of occupational diseases , it might not be feasible for the financial status of a company if such measures were to incur huge sums of money .
The overriding truth is that employers would inevitably be more concerned about the company's profitability .
In fact , disclosure of genetic information has no benefits to people at risk of non- occupational diseases , but serves to reduce their chances of employment .
Moreover , there is currently no legal protection against genetic discrimination in most parts of the world .
Therefore , individuals should still hold the right and freedom to have the final say because of possible employment discrimination as they have no legal protections .
In conclusion , individuals should have the final say in revealing their own genetic testing result .
It is assumed that individuals should be responsible in sharing relevant information with their family members after counseling .
However , if their actions can result in a direct effect or harm on a third party the court may pass on laws to override such privacy .
Disclosure of genetic information can discredit doctors as a source of education and may deteriorate the public health system .
Also , individuals are susceptible to possible employment discrimination as currently they have no legal protections .
Genetic testing has become a common norm in the 21st century .
People undergo medical tests to determine if they have a certain type of inherited genes associated with an inherited disease and whether they are at risk of getting it (A .M , 2009) .
These tests usually require a sample of blood or skin from a person and the results are only made known to the individual .
However , there is an issue of whether these results should also be made known to  relatives of the individuals .
On one hand ,  relatives of the individual should be given the right to know about it since it concerns them as well .
On the other hand , individuals have a desire to protect their relatives from troubling information .
Telling their relatives may strain family relationships and also , it is an issue of confidentially .
Hence , I disagree that a carrier of a known genetic risk should be bound morally to tell his relatives .
Firstly , individuals might not be ready to disclose their genetic testing results to their family members as they feel that their privacy is invaded (A .M , 2009) .
They are still not mentally prepared to disclose the information as they think that they might get discriminated by his relatives .
For example , a person who has a risk of getting an inherited disease might not be able to inherit his family business for fear that he will not be able to withstand the tough job requirements .
Hence , if he are not mentally and emotionally prepared to disclose such information , he should be given the right of not telling their relatives about it .
However , critics argue that there are counseling sessions set up to help individuals understand their personal risk or the risk for other family members (Adams , 2003) .
Seeking third parties' opinion is not very useful as they might not fully understand the situation that individuals are in and often , they make wrong judgments .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic disease should not be obligated to tell his relatives due to invasion of privacy .
Secondly , individuals have the desire to protect family members from troubling information .
This is because not everyone in the family will get the disease and disclosing such information to family members might cause unnecessary anxiety in the family .
For example , a parent might not want to tell their children that she has a certain inherited disease as she is guilty about passing the mutated genes to her children .
However , critics argue that family members should have the right to know if they are at risk of getting the disease .
Since they are in the same family tree , the relatives should have the right to know the probability of contracting this inherited disease .
This helps them to make informed choices about their health and maybe seek treatment before the disease becomes worse .
Nonetheless , disclosure to family members may not respect their right  not to know .
The carrier's family members might not want to know about the genetic risk and hence , disclosing such information might cause them to be anxious and panicky .
These are unnecessary since the probability of getting the inherited disease given that a family member has the disease is relatively low .
This is because one might not get the mutated genes .
Hence , genetic testing results should not be known to the family members to protect them .
Lastly , letting third parties such as relatives know about the genetic testing results may post strains in family relationships .
Genetic testing creates tension within the family because the results can reveal information about other family members in addition to the person who is tested (What are the risks and limitations of genetic testing , 2009) .
This means that personal health information is known to everyone in the family tree including those relatives that one is not close to .
Hence , one might not feel secure to disclose he or she genetic testing results to his or her family members .
Admittedly , letting family members know about the genetic risk might cause families to be even more united and they will have a better understanding about their inherited genes .
However , this is only the minority .
Majority of the people are still discriminated by their family members as relatives would look at them from a different angle .
Hence , genetic testing results should not be known to the family members to prevent relationships from turning sour .
In conclusion , genetic testing results should not be made known to third parties such as family members .
Although many people may say that these results should be made known to family members to inform them about the chances of contracting the inherited disease , problems like invasion of privacy , protecting family members from troubling information as well as posting strains in family relationships still outweigh the benefits .
Hence , I disagree that a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a scientific process that studies changes in chromosomes , genes or proteins .
Confirming or ruling out a suspected genetic condition or determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder depends on the results of the genetic test .
As there are ethical , legal and social concerns with revealing the results of such testing , the decision lies in the carrier of the known genetic risk .
Thus , the individual should not be obligated to tell his relatives .
Secondly , an implication in revealing the results leads to the threat of eugenics (Devore , 1992) .
Childbearing decisions are based on genetic information , thus adding social or political pressure on people .
Reproduction is encouraged between those presumed to have inheritable desirable traits while those who have genetic defects are discouraged to reproduce .
For example , if you discovered that you had inherited the Huntington's disease mutation , you would decide not to have children of your own so as not to risk passing the gene on to your children .
In addition , relatives may encourage women carrying foetuses with genetic abnormalities to go for abortion .
Thus , these women may develop feelings of guilt and depression and affect their well-being .
Therefore , the carrier should not be obligated to tell our relatives about the genetic risk .
Lastly , it is a violation of basic human rights when the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to inform his relatives (Jones , 2005) .
The individual has the privacy right to decide if he wants others to know of his genetic condition .
For example , if the individual feels that he will be strongly stigmatized and marginalized , or once his relatives know of his genetic condition , they will treat him differently or abandon him as he is "tarnished" by a deadly gene , he may not want his relatives to know of his genetic condition , for fear of information being circulated .
In other words , by making it an obligation to inform his relatives , it is an intrusion of his right to privacy .
On the other hand , critics argue that by revealing results of the carrier of a known genetic risk to his relatives , this will benefit the relatives' health and well-being greatly .
Preventive measures can be taken before symptoms of the inherited disorder develop (Lee , 2005) .
However , this is based on the assumption that people are optimistic and they will undergo treatments upon knowing that the disorder is treatable .
But what about disorders for which no preventive measures or treatments are available ?
Most people will despair and are reluctant to undergo treatments .
Moreover , some people tend to worry too much about their genetic disorder and this may ultimately lead to depression .
After all , revealing the results to his relatives may not be useful .
In addition , some critics argue that revealing results to relatives will help them to make informed choices about their future .
For example , if the carrier of a known genetic risk has borne the burden of having a strong family history of genetic disorder for years may feel relieved when he receives a positive test result .
By revealing the results to his relatives , they no longer have to live with uncertainty about their future and their children's future .
In this way , they can plan for their future , and  couples who want to have children of their own may think twice (Lee , 2005) .
However , I beg to differ .
By revealing results to relatives , those with children may feel a sense of guilt as they are worried that they could have passed the genetic disorder to their children .
Thus , this adds stress to the relatives and is not beneficial by revealing the results .
The individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing
In recent years , genetic tests have grown in number , accuracy and availability .
They have been touted by many as the first step in the dawning of a new age of diagnostic and curative medicine , a step on the road to widespread and effective gene therapy for a large number of conditions (Victorian , 2009) .
It has also brought about some ethical and moral issues surrounding it .
Some people state that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
But actually , they have spoken too highly of  human rationality .
Here , I disagree with these people and want to assert that the individual should not have the right to reveal the result .
And my stand is based on two reasons: 1 .
Genetic testing would bring negative psychological effects to other people who may not want to know the results; 2 .The revealing of the results would cause discrimination and unfairness in the society .
As you can see , for disorders that are preventable or treatable , most people agree that genetic testing makes sense .
But for diseases with no preventative measures , would you want to know if you were affected or not ?
Many adult-onset genetic disorders are progressive and have long-term health consequences .
Thus , when a person is at risk for such a disorder , he or she may consider undergoing genetic testing .
When the consequences of the specific disorder in question are treatable , most people would agree that genetic testing makes sense .
But what about disorders for which no preventative measures or treatments are available ?
Just like the Huntington's Disease , there is currently no treatment for this disease , nor is there anything an affected person can do to prevent the inevitable onset of symptoms (Scitable , 2009) .
Once you receive some negative information about your genes as regards  these kinds of incurable diseases , the only thing you can do is just wait to die .
During the rest of your life , you would really suffer a lot , not only physically , but also mentally .
You tend to be desperate about your life .
And you will be a buffer of both your family and the society .
Furthermore , once you know that you are a carrier of the negative genes , you tend to worry about your descendants .
There is a great chance that they are also carriers of these kinds of negative genes .
Then you would feel guilty about this and fall into a deep depression .
So the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing since it would cause serious psychological effect on people who do not want to know the results .
would be  discrimination in the society .
This kind of discrimination mainly regards to  unfairness on insurance coverage and employment .
For  insurance companies , in order to avoid bankruptcy , they would reduce or just cancel their coverage on  genetic problems .
For  employment institutions , in order to keep high efficiencies on the output , they would reject employees with genetic problems .
And for a normal society , that would be quite unfair .
Arguments proposed by people who stand up to the point that individuals deserve the right to stimulate the genetic info are faulty .
For instance , they might argue that people should have the right or the freedom to control their privacy such as over genetic testing results .
But as we can see , the freedom is not an absolute item .
If there is a great probability that freedom does harm to  society , it should definitely be banned .
Also people might argue that for disorders in genes that are preventable or treatable , it will be good for individuals to have access to their genetic info .
But these people put too much belief on  genetic technology .
In fact , most genetic problems are untreatable .
Once people get this kind of problems , the only thing they can do is wait to die .
Thirdly , people may also argue that , for a society to obtain  optimal benefits , it has to reject people who get genetic problems .
But this will definitely arouse serious moral problems in  society , which would buffer the development of the society .
Genetic testing is a technology which screens and examines the genes of a person to check whether he has  specific genetic disorders or diseases which common medical procedures are not able to detect .
This technology is one of modern technologies and has many effects on human life .
Genetic testing gives people information to know their health conditions but this testing raises ethical and psychological issues concerning whether an individual taking the genetic testing must reveal the result to third parties such as family , employers and friends because the result can be stressful .
However , I agree that one must not disclose the result because it not only concerns the individual's life but also his family .
First , the result affects the future of one family as the genetic disorder can be inherited by the next generation and in event that some members of the family have this genetic disorder too .
One has to reveal the result to one's family and spouse for them to know .
Therefore , the family can discuss and find the best solution for this matter .
After knowing the result , a couple should find ways to treat the disease before they give birth to a child because the child has a big possibility to have the gene which is dangerous for his or her future (Otto 2007) .
Parents can initially prepare the right treatment and provide proper diets for their infants .
Moreover , some of these genetic diseases are contagious and these endanger the whole family and the people around the one who has the disease .
In a worse case , if some members of a family have these genetic diseases , they should find solutions or treatments to cure them or at least prevent the disease to spread .
These cases assure one should reveal the result to his or her family .
Second , the reason someone should not disclose his testing result concerns the psychological impact on the person and his family (Anonymous 1993) .
Some people may become depressed after knowing the result .
Therefore , they need to tell the result to their closest people especially their family , thus , their family can comfort him and help him find ways to cure the disease .
Even though some say that by revealing the result , one's family will also get depressed and this will affect the whole family ,  nevertheless , if one discloses it to himself for a long time , he will get more and more depressed which will then ruin his life .
In addition , his family will finally find out about the disease when it causes his health to become worse and this will make the family feel regret because if it has known it earlier , it could have found treatment for him .
Third , the test result has a great effect on one's career life and one is obliged to tell the employer about the result .
Many employers want to know the health condition of their workers because they do not want to have a disease spread over places in their offices and they want to ensure the safety of their workers .
By knowing that a worker has genetic disorder , the employer may provide the worker another job which has less contact with other workers or which has the most suitable environment condition for the worker .
For example ,  a worker who has genetic disorder on his skin should not work in an area that has radiation .
Otto (2007) notes that many employers have obliged people to take genetic testing first before they are hired .
Some argue that  genetic elimination in choosing worker is discrimination because this is an action of limiting one's right to work (Andre and Velasquez 2009) .
However ,  genetic testing is to ensure the safety of all workers .
The worker who has a genetic disease may not be  hired but this is for the life of people around him .
In conclusion , one who has genetic disorder or disease is obliged to reveal his genetic testing results  because by revealing them , there are several benefits for him , his family and people around him .
His family and he can find ways to cure the disease .
Similarly , a couple can prepare treatment for their child , one can have a right job to do , and he can prevent the disease to cause danger to people around him .
By being able to make decisions to undergo genetic testing , individuals here refer to mature and thinking people .
Since genetic testing is to determine if a person has genetic disorder (Goh , 2003) , people usually undergo such test because they are at risk for a disorder .
Family medical history , onset of symptoms and an increasing number of people in the community  confirmed of it , are the reasons that lead to an individual being deemed at risk .
In considering these three factors , I feel that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to reveal the results to his or her relatives .
Firstly , if the risk is due to family medical history such as haemophilia and Huntington's disease (NIH) , then by revealing it to relatives , more people will know that they could be at risk too .
Being aware of the likelihood of having  such disorder , more people will seek for confirmation through testing as well .
Thus , when a carrier of a known genetic risk discloses the results to his or her relatives , more people will be able to take precautionary measures if tested positive .
Disorders like haemophilia and Huntington's disease are dangerous if attention is not paid to them .
Moreover , relatives will then know what is suitable for the carrier and provide appropriate care and concern .
Although many believe that admitting to a disorder will give rise to discrimination and strained relationship , they failfail to consider that relatives appreciate the trust .
The return care and concern from them will further improve their kinship .
The second type of disorder is the multifactorial and polygenic disorder .
Genes inherited play a role in such a disorder too but lifestyle and the environment are influential factors as well (Richard , 2003) .
Heart diseases and diabetes are categorised under this type of disorder .
Again , disorders of such type puts lives at stake and therefore carriers should be obligated to convey the results of the genetic test to their relatives .
The last type of genetic disorder can be hereditary but ironically , it can also not be .
When the number of people in the community getting a similar disorder is increasing , a person can be at risk too .
The classic example of this kind of disorder is  sickle-cell anaemia .
It is a disorder whereby the red blood cells of the carrier change their shape from round to sickle shape (William , 2006) .
This is especially obvious in places where malaria is prevalent .
Their genes mutate to adapt to the environment better .
It was thought that such disorder is a response by the body to adapt to the environment because the carrier will be immune to malaria .
However , sickle-cell anaemia causes shorter life expectancy and intermittent pain (William , 2006) .
If carriers are responsible and share their testing results , people can come together to weed out the problem by say eradicating malaria .
In this way , less people will suffer .
To conclude , we have seen that disclosure of test results to a carrier's relatives is outright compulsory .
This obligation will save lives and better the living environment and lifestyle of many people .
We should be responsible and with these values and beliefs , there is no dilemma because being subjected to to discrimination and other social problems is insignificant when compared to matters of life and death and health of the general public .
Rapid development in genetic field has made genetic testing a potential method to be used in healthcare improvement .
Genetic testing is carried out mainly for diagnosis confirmation , prediction of heritable-disorder diseases and identification of carrier carrier of disorder without physical symptom (National Human Genome Institute , 2008) .
Sharing of test positive results with relatives is necessary as it is the relatives' right to know about it .
It also alerts them to early detection and treatment .
Indirectly , it could help in medical research development and make treatment for currently untreatable diseases possible .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , genetic information could be extremely personal to an individual (Canadian Cystic Fibrosis foundation , 2000) .
Confidentiality of such information should be protected so that one's privacy could be respected .
However , genetic information comes in two kinds .
The first one is the mutation in a family while the latter is one's own genetic status .
(Skene , n .d .) .
It is alright for not sharing own's genetic status but sharing of mutation in family with blood relatives is essential as it affects the blood relatives as well .
They have the right to know about it .
Moreover , best clinical practice requires family history to assess the usefulness of genetic testing (Parker and Lucassen , n .d .) .
Hence , there is no reason why one could benefit from  family history but omit  relatives' rights to have such benefits as well .
Genetic discrimination by health insurers and employers could be one of the main hindrances that stop people from sharing their genetic information with blood relatives (National Human Genome Institute , 2008) .
This would be protected once President Bush  signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (The White House , 2008) .
Besides that , some types of cancer such as breast and ovarian cancer seem to be running in a family mainly due to an inherited altered gene (National Cancer Institute , n .d .) .
Examples of such genes could be BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Breast Cancer Gene 1 and Breast Cancer Gene 2) which could pass down from father or mother .
Revealing of positive test results to relatives allows them to go for early detection and treatment which can possibly save lives .
Limitations of genetic testing could be the lack of treatment strategies for certain disorders once diagnosed (Genetics Home Reference) .
This may have arguement that since there is no treatment , there is no point of revealing to relatives even though it shows positive result .
But , a genetic test that identifies a carrier of a certain disease could help  couples to decide whether they would like to have the next generation and weigh the risk of passing down an altered gene(Barett)
Lastly , revealing  positive test results might increase the number of people going for genetic testing .
This indirectly increases the possibility of people signing consent to take part in  research for  genetic related diseases .
With such , improved or new treatment is possible for genetic related diseases and could possibly benefit the carrier or even his or her family members .
In conclusion , revealing  genetic information to the relatives does not seem to be of great disadvantage to an individual but could be of great advantage to  blood relatives .
Besides the right to know , most important is the possibility of early detection and treatment for  blood relatives .
Development of new treatment for currently untreatable diseases is also possible .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is not a new term in this modern era .
People can predict the probability of developing some genetic diseases with this technological advancement .
({http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting}[HYPERLINK: http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting])This  undoubtedly contributes to the prevention of treatable diseases .
However , it would appear that patients are not the only people who are interested in the outcome of the testing .
Many third parties also show a great interest in the result especially the patient's family members .
Family members have to know the result so that they can receive early treatment and have early financial and psychological preparation .
Thus , I strongly agree that a carrier of a known disease risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Firstly , the patients are obligated to tell their relatives about the result as it will invariably affect them to some extent .
For example , if the result shows that the patient is a carrier of a genetic disease , there is a great possibility that  family members  also have the same disease .
So it is crucial to let the family members know the results so that they can receive treatment earlier .
Permanent and irreversible damages can be prevented if treatment or therapy is initiated in the early stage of the disease (http://www .ndsu .nodak .edu/instruct/m cclean/plsc431/students98/saha .htm) .
Patients would sometimes choose not to reveal the result to avoid discrimination among family members .
However , saving the family members' lives is more important if compare to self-esteem .
Secondly , patients are responsible to tell their relatives especially  family members about the outcome of a genetic test so that they can have early financial and psychological preparations .
Treatments for diseases are always costly .
Family members have to plan their budget earlier so that they can afford to take on the treatment fee .
Besides that , it is also important for  relatives to have psychological preparation earlier so that they can handle their stresses during the period of treatment (http://www3 .inter {science .wiley .com/journal/112684945/abstract ?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0}[HYPERLINK: http://www3 .interscience .wiley .com/journal/112684945/abstract ?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0]) .
Patients refuse to disclose results as they think they can prevent their relatives from sadness .
It is true that relatives are often in deep grief when knowing one of their relatives is suffering from an illness .
However , early notification can let them have enough time to have psychological preparation so that they would not feel so unprepared or unready when the patients' condition worsens .
In conclusion ,  patients should be obligated to inform their relatives about genetic testing results to enable the latter to receive early treatment and have early financial and psychological preparation .
Genetic testing , by definition , may be done for various reasons , including the diagnosis of a genetic disease in an individual , the identification of future disease risks to individual unborn children or the prediction of drug responses (MedicineNet , 2002) .
Conditions such as cystic fibrosis , heart disease , Down's syndrome and epilepsy are strongly influenced by genes (Hunt & Odle , 2004) .
Due to the possibility that it may occur or recur in various family members and relatives , an ethical dilemma as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk has the obligation to tell his or her relatives arises .
In order to make an informed socially responsible decision , an individual should examine both sides of this controversy according to his or her context by weighing both the positive and negative economic , social and psychological impacts it may bring about .
Ideally , owing to the beneficial impacts , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives when the risk is familial , significantly critical , and when options are available to prevent harm .
A carrier of a known genetic risk has an ethical duty to warn his or her relatives .
According to Alford (1999) , some genetic conditions may go unnoticed while others may be devitalising .
Some genetic diseases are congenital and others may not be manifest until later in life .
Some genetic diseases can be affected by diet and environment .
Advancements in genetic science have resulted in new discoveries in diagnosing , treating or preventing diseases (Shaw , 1995) .
Prevention is always better than cure .
In general , if at risk relatives can anticipate the disease , measures may be taken to prevent it .
For instance , relatives with genetic obesity may choose to undergo lifestyle changes such as opting for calorie restriction diet and regular exercise .
Furthermore , the ability to predict familial diseases such as a certain type of cancer at a young age may allow for possible successful treatment or cure , extension of life expectancy and improvement in quality of life .
In this way , the sharing of information improves the welfare of mankind .
Moreover , having learnt about a personal genetic risk , some theorists , for example , Wilson (2000) , Baker , Schuette and Uhlmann (1998) , believe that the approach to deal with results of genetic testing involves not only medical , surgical and educational intervention , but also provision of social and emotional support; hence , a carrier of known genetic risk should tell his or her close relatives about it .
Some may argue that there should be no obligations to tell a relative about one's condition as a genetic condition is not contagious like some viral or bacterial infections (Hubbard & Wald , 1999) .
Consequently , some may think that informing relatives about their conditions is not necessary and thus are not in favour of the idea .
However , genetic diseases may impact every phase of the human life cycle (Alford , 1999) .
Even though there may be an initial delay in acceptance , and unnecessary worry , eventual acceptance by family , friends and relatives often corresponds to ongoing effective and supportive encouragement and motivation which may have beneficial impacts on their health .
A carrier of a known genetic risk who takes an active approach in informing his or her relatives is in fact showing respect for the relative's autonomy .
Choosing not to inform one's relatives is in fact interfering with the patient's right and opportunity to consider the problem , select diagnostic and management options .
Studies have shown that the primary reason accounting for the unwillingness to communicate genetic test results to a relative is that the relative's opinion , attitude and reaction is unknown (Barsevick , Montgomery , Ruth , Ross , Egleston , Bingler , Malick , Miller , Cescon , & Daly , 2008) .
In addition , the opinion of World Health Organization (2009) is that choosing not to inform is a well-intentioned decision which does not to add extra problems and undue distress to others .
However , these arguments put forth in support of not informing the relatives are faulty .
By not informing about the risks his or her relative may face , the tendency of the carrier to shift from beneficence to paternalism has in fact taken away the ability of the relative to choose for herself (Kultgen , 1995) .
For example , some genetic diseases such as "Al antitrypsin deficiency" undeniably involve the family (Torgny & Wilcke , 1998) .
As Torgny and Wilcke state , information can allow a relative who has considerably increased risk of a disease from smoking to make her own decisions about smoking and take precautions when deciding on a career which is needful to have a positive impact on her future .
Genetic testing has been made possible with the advances of technology in the medical field .
It has increased in numbers , capabilities and preciseness over the recent years (Goh , 2005) .
Potential individuals who are at risk of developing a genetic disorder or disease normally undergo  genetic testing .
Genetic testing may uncover the underlying mutation in genes which causes the genetic disorder .
Thus , genetic testing can be beneficial to affected patients and their relatives .
It helps in early detection of genetic disorders that are inherited in families and family planning .
Genetic testing has also resulted in the rise of privacy , confidentiality and ethical issues in our society despite the benefits gained (Young & Leonard , 1999) .
However , it has been known that genetic testing may detect mutation in genes and hence , genetic counselling can be given to relatives of affected patients .
Therefore , affected individuals should let their relatives know about their genetic testing results .
One of the reasons why affected individuals should let their relatives know about their genetic disorders is for early detection purposes (Goh , 2005) .
An early detection of genetic disorders can be obtained by genetic testing in order for further and early treatments to be conducted .
For example , genetic testing enables patients and their relatives who are at risk of developing genetic disorders but show no symptoms at the beginning , to predict the chances of them inheriting the genetic disorders (Goh , 2005) .
The predisposition of the relatives of affected patients towards the genetic disorders can also be predicted .
When a genetic disorder that runs through a certain family is known , the extent of the genetic disorder can be obtained (Goh , 2005) .
Genetic information is not confined to one person but it could be related to more than one person such as tested patients' relatives .
This enables healthcare professionals to know the extent of the genetic mutation in the genes and hence , provide advice or genetic counselling to patients and their relatives .
However , this has also resulted in a raise of privacy and confidentiality concerns .
The revelation of genetically tested patients' results may lead to discrimination by the society (Mehlman , 1999) .
There is no guarantee that relatives of genetically tested patients will keep the genetic results information to themselves .
This information can be spread verbally , be it accidental or intentional without the consent of the tested patient .
However , there are laws that protect genetically patients from genetic discrimination by the society  (Bombard , 2007) .
These laws have been implemented in the United States and many other countries (Bombard , 2007) .
Genetic discrimination can be reduced with the existing of these laws as legal actions can be taken against those who discriminate .
Hence , genetic testing results should be revealed to family members for early detection purposes .
Besides that , relatives of genetically tested patients should know about their genetic testing results so that a proper family planning can be made (Anonymous , 1999) .
Family planning is essential as it serves as a platform to briefly set up a guideline for future purposes .
This might enable individuals and their families to decide on how they would like their lifestyle to be and set fertility judgements (Anonymous , 1999) .
For example , pregnant women have the option of deciding on whether to go for prenatal examinations or not to see if their new-borns would suffer from any genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease and Down's Syndrome .
This may prevent the future generation from inheriting the mutated genes or become carriers of the genetic disorders .
Ethical issues have been raised despite this advantage .
This is because no one has the rights to give his or her consent regarding the decision on whether to undergo  the prenatal examinations or not (Anonymous , 1999) .
Embryos , foetuses and new-borns do not hold the responsibility in making this decision and they are unable to make it by themselves .
This leaves the decision into their parents' hands .
However , medical advances have made in-vitro fertilisation possible nowadays .
If an embryo has a mutated gene after undergoing in-vitro fertilisation , this embryo can be discarded before being implanted in the uterus (Anonymous , 1999) .
This may prevent the diseases from being passed down to the future generation .
The risk of the future generation in inheriting genetic diseases can also be reduced .
Thus , revelations of genetic testing results to family members are essential in family planning .
In today's medical world , many health concerns raised by people have been taken care of by the perpetual advancement in technology .
One of the innumerable concerns is genetic disorder , which is an illness caused by abnormalities in genes or chromosomes .
This concern has brought about the inauguration of genetic testing as a medical test to determine if a particular disease is stimulated by the abnormality .
An issue raised here is that one's decision to reveal the test results to one's relatives has chained to even more concerns .
Revealing the results could assist one's relatives in preparing for constructive life changes and allow researchers to find a cure for a particular genetic disorder .
Admittedly , it could result in negative social consequences .
Nevertheless , revealing the test results benefits more people than hiding them .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , the revelation of a known genetic risk to one's relatives allows them to prepare for constructive changes in their lives .
One such change would be to make new decisions for family planning .
Due to the lack of treatment strategies of some genetic disorders , a carrier might have a short lifespan .
Therefore , it is both essential to plan for an early retirement or to start a family .
A carrier could devise a financial plan so that one would have sufficient monetary resources to support oneself even after an early retirement .
One main objection to starting a family is that the affected genes or chromosomes might be passed on to the children .
This , however , can be prevented using an expensive technology , Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) such as pre-implantation of genetic diagnosis whereby "only unaffected embryos are allowed to develop to term" (Norrgard , 2008) .
Thus , a carrier could still start a family without passing the genetic disorder to the children .
Furthermore , this could lead to another constructive change for the carrier's relatives .
For relatives who are planning to have children , they must either be financially prepared for ART as well as for the future medical bills , or choose not to have children .
As for those who already have children , they must also be financially prepared .
On top of that , they would have to choose the right time to convey to their children that they might be carriers of a certain genetic disorder .
These changes and preparations cannot be achieved overnight , and therefore , revealing a known genetic risk to one's relatives is necessary .
Secondly , by divulging one's genetic risk to one's relatives , the chances of researchers finding a cure for that risk would be higher .
As genetic disorders only happen to a minority , there would not be many encounters and so the chances of a researcher being able to inquire into these disorders would be considerably low .
This will be further lowered by opponents who are against the revelation of genetic results due to intrusion of privacy .
However , it may not occur to them that the revelation of results could increase the chances of medical researchers finding a remedy to the disorders .
Moreover , there would be a possibility that a known genetic risk could be brought to an end and subsequent generations would not have to suffer .
Therefore , only when one tells a known genetic risk to one's relatives , would there be a chance for medical researchers to find a cure for it ,  eventually saving many lives from genetic disorders .
One main concern about the revelation of genetic risk to one's relatives is the negative social consequences .
When an employee is diagnosed to have certain genetic disorders , the employer may not want to retain the employee .
This is because the carrier would have to follow up on their medical appointments and as a result , the efficiency and productivity of the company would be adversely affected .
Furthermore , due to the need for regular health checkup , the carrier would not be allowed to purchase insurance as the insurance company would be footing the carrier's medical bills .
However , these acts of genetic discrimination could be prevented by a law called the Privacy Rule , which is enforced by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in April 2003 (Norrgard , 2008) .
This rule helps to keep an individual's medical information confidential .
Therefore , whether one has genetic disorders or not , one would not have to face the negative social consequences .
Hence , a carrier can have a peace of mind revealing genetic test results to one's relatives .
Genetic testing has developed enough and it is getting popular nowadays all around the world .
Genetic testing is actually the genetic diagnosis of inheritable diseases which are caused by an abnormality in an individual's genome .
For instance Huntington's disease is caused by X- linked disorder , Cystic fibrosis is caused by autosomal recessive disorder and some common diseases such as coronary heart disease and diabetes are caused by polygenic mutation (Holland ,S , 2003) .
In addition , this testing can also be used to determine a child's biological father or a person's ancestry .
Examples of genetic tests are newborn screening , diagnostic testing , carrier testing , and prenatal testing .
Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems , carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the results to their relatives .
Firstly , it is important to reveal the result if a couple is planning to get married and one of them has certain inheritable diseases .
This is because they have high possibilities of passing on mutated gene to their children .
Even though some are healthy carriers and not affected by the diseases fully because of the single copy of the dominant genotype , they have 50% chance of passing the recessive gene to their younger generation .
If a person did not disclose the result , a child with genetic disabilities may be born , leading to problems in the family .
For example , the partner may feel betrayed and end the relationship for concealing the truth .
Here the family relation will be affected and who is going to share responsibility of taking care of the poor child ?
The child will be left out and will be in an unpleasant atmosphere .
On the other hand , if the partner knows about this person's genetic condition earlier , they will plan well before getting married since they are in love and care about each other .
They may opt to adopt a child rather than giving birth to a genetically impaired child .
Hence , it is advisable to disclose the genetic testing result in order to prevent risks of diseases to the future generation .
The second case is where a couple finding about their genetic condition after their marriage .
It will lead to mental trauma and extreme depression if they hide the genetic testing result from their spouse .
Every day he has to face his spouse with a guilty face and suffer in silence .
When the spouse gets to know about his health condition , it will be too late and will end the relationship since sincerity is a big question .
In even extreme cases , if the child is born , it will be a burden for them to take care of him .
Then the child's life will be greatly affected .
In contrast , they still can be happy with adopted children if the result is known .
Proponents of this claim argue that , disclosure of such results will destroy the dream of having own family .
However , it is not ethical to pass on their defective genes to their offspring in order to fulfill the dream of having own family .
Who will take care of the child when they are not around ?
If they are someone to take care , will they do it sincerely ?
Therefore , the carrier of a known genetic disease should be forced to reveal the result to his spouse since loyalty and sincerity are the basic factors that holding a marriage tightly and the relationship can be maintained .
Finally , the third case is about the couple knowing about the genetic disorder after having children .
They should tell about their health condition to prevent their future offspring to have defective genes .
Since this genetic testing begins with an affected family member , it provides the best opportunity to identify relatives who may be at risk for a life- threatening condition .
Thus they will  undergo testing and treatment for that specific disease as soon as possible .
Critics of this position may argue that disclosure brings with it the potential  loss of privacy .
Is privacy  more important than the health condition and welfare of your spouse and children ?
It is so obvious that , they did not realize that the health condition of the beloved family members is far more important  than  the intrusion of privacy .
Hence , the carrier of genetic disease must be obligated to tell the genetic testing result since the welfare of family members can be improved .
In conclusion , a carrier of genetic disorder must be obligated to reveal the genetic testing results to his relatives .
By doing so , genetic risks to future generation can be prevented , family relation can be maintained and at-risk relatives with abnormalities can begin treatment for their genetic disorders .
If an individual fails to do so , family relation may come to an end and family members may undergo mental trauma and depression .
Humans have always wanted to be the perfect being on top of nature's hierarchy .
We also desire to have the ability to predict our own well-being .
Presently , with advances in medical technology , we are able to predict what is happening to our own body .
The procedure is called genetic testing .
Genetic testing is the testing of the human genes to know whether there are mutations or defects in the genes (Genetic Research and Genetic Testing , 2005) .
With this technology , we can detect the problem within ourselves early and tackle it .
The issue is that after an individual undergoes genetic testing and unfortunately finds out that there are problems within him or herself , is the individual obligated to tell his or her family members ?
With the information that the individual acquires through genetic testing , he or she can share with the family members so that they can tackle the problems head on .
They can prepare themselves for medical problems that they may have and make informed choices on the course of action .
Hence a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , a carrier should inform his or her family as this will prepare the family for the possible outcome of them having the mutated genes .
This is a good move as the family now can prepare themselves to undergo the same genetic testing to know the possibility of them carrying the same mutated or defective genes as the carrier .
The genetic testing is just a means to know whether someone has the disease but it does not mean they will acquire the disease a hundred percent (Goh , L . , M . , D . , 2005) .
This only serves as a predictive means .
On the other hand , the other family members can also know what the other underlying problems are that they may encounter in the future as the genetic testing will not only detect the carrier's risk genes but also other problems that he or she may have in the future .
All such information will help the family members to prepare and face the potential problems in the future .
Secondly , a carrier should inform his or her family as the family members have the ability to make an informed choice for their actions towards the problem .
If the carrier has a possibility of having heart disease , the rest of the family members may take steps to counter that predictive disease (Genetic Research and Genetic Testing , 2005) .
The family members can alter their activities and eating habits in order to combat having heart disease .
However the risk genes carrier may argue that to tell the information to his or her family member is a violation of his or her autonomy .
This is private information that need not be shared with everyone .
This information may cause hysteric reaction in the community  .
Other than that the risk genes carriers may be discriminated (Ostrom , M . , C . , 1997) .
With these concerns in mind , the individual may not agree to tell the family members the genetic testing results .
But by withholding the information , the risk genes carrier is doing harm to not only himself but to his or her family members .
Without telling the family members , the individual might be suffering in silence and no support will be given by the family members .
On the other hand if the risk genes carrier never informs the family members , the family members may suffer the same fate and this in turn will have a domino effect on the family lineage .
Therefore the to be obliged to tell the family members is act of beneficence as the risk gene carrier is doing good in informing the family of the possible medical problems that they may face .
In conclusion , it is very important for the risk genes carrier to inform the family members as he or she may help the family members to avoid some avoidable medical problems if only he or she inform them .
Therefore the risk gene carrier should be obliged to tell the family members if he or she has a genetic  risk  .
As science and technology progress , we can now detect the presence of any genetic disorder in an individual through genetic testing .
The purpose of genetic testing is to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins which are associated with inherited disorders .
However , one biggest problem that arises is whether the individual , who has undergone the genetic test , be obligated to inform his family members/relatives of the results .
I believe that the individual is obligated to tell his family members/relatives the test result as it is ethical for the individual to inform them and they can seek early medical assistance if needed .
The feelings of guilt and anxiety that arise from  can be minimized by going for counseling .
Firstly , family members/relatives deserve a right to know what kind of genetic disorder they might have inherited from the individual or running in their family line .
Thus , it is ethical for the individual to inform them .
This is important for parents who are doing family planning , as it help them to know whether an unborn child will have a genetic condition .
In this example , a pregnant relative seeking genetic counseling and his geneticist requires information about the individual in order to give her the most accurate information whether her new-born will have any risk of genetic disorder .
If the individual declines her request as he wants  the information about his genetic status to be confidential , her new-born could be in a high risk of getting the genetic disorder (Elizabeth A . V . , Amy C .S . , 2008 , Nov 07) .
Secondly , acquisition of genetic information of a carrier by his/her relatives can help reduce the possibility of getting the disease .
For example , if the genetic disorder is colon cancer , they can seek out for medical advice and treatment while it is at an early stage .
If the disease has not developed , steps like making changes to their health habits can be taken which might lower their chance of getting the disease (National Human Genome Research Institute , 2009 , Aug 14) .
Thus , this information can help them in making informed choices about their future .
Critics have also raised the psychological and emotional issues that the individual and his relatives may experience after he tells them the genetic test result .
His relatives might blame him for 'passing' the genetic disorder to them , causing the individual to feel guilty .
However , being the carrier , he too is a victim of this genetic disorder which was probably passed down from his parents .
In addition , his relatives will understand better by going for counseling that everyone carries gene mutations that can lead to diseases , and no one has control over what they pass on to their children (Elizabeth A . V . , Amy C .S . , 2008 , Nov 07) .
Relatives of the individual will also face a great deal of anxiety that they may have the genetic disorder .
However , they can choose not to be told of the test result in the first place or go for a genetic testing to confirm whether they have the genetic disorder .
If the genetic test result shows that the genetic disorder is not present in them , it can provide them a sense of relief .
Furthermore , they could also undergo counseling to help them manage their emotions better (Genetic Interest Group , 1998) .
In conclusion , I believe that the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his relatives .
It is ethnically right for the individual to inform his relatives , and the relatives after knowing that they may have the genetic disorder can seek out medical assistances to reduce the occurrence/severity of the disease .
The psychological and emotional issues can be minimized by going for counseling as they will understand the genetic disorder and manage their emotions better .
Genetic testing is a scientific method that is used to determine a person's chance of developing an inherited disease .
Every person carries copies of genes that were passed down from their parents .
There is a high chance for a genetic disease carrier to pass down defected genes to the next generation .
The defected genes may or may not develop into a disease .
A defective genes carrier can only determine whether he or she have a genetic disease by running a genetic test .
If a genetic disease runs in the family , a genetic disease carrier's family members and relatives will have a high chance of developing the same inherited disease .
There is a higher chance of curing a genetic disease if it is detected early .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should warn their family members and relatives about the genetic risk .
Some of the genetic diseases could be cured if it is detected early .
Research by Kloosterman (2009) , shows that common antibiotic treatment has the ability to cure genetic diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis , a type of genetic lung disease .
From the Georgina Advocate news (2007) , "Emily Gough , who died last year of Cystic Fibrosis , was seen with her father , Glenn , and sister , Jessica , who is now battling the same disease" .
In this article , the Gough family is battling against a genetic lung disease .
(Slykhuis , 2007) Unfortunately , Emily Gough and her father died because they did not detect the disease early enough to cure it .
Such tragic incident would re-occur if a carrier of a known genetic risk were to hide his or her condition from his or her family members and relatives .
Proper plans for the future could be made if a carrier knows in advance that he or she has a genetic disease .
Oregon National Primate Research Center successfully came up with a technique that could stop future generations from inheriting genetic diseases from their parents .
(Henderson , 2009) If a carrier of a genetic risk were to hide his or her condition , the genetic disease would continue to run in the family line , passing down to future generations .
Proper financial plans could be made if a person were to know early if he or she has a genetic disease and avoid impending financial crisis if he or she is able to borrow money or apply for financial help earlier .
A possible excuse people choose to hide their affliction is because they are afraid of the discrimination they would face from their family members and relatives .
After all , the burden of carrying a genetic disease is not something that one would want to make known to others .
Perhaps a better reason for people to keep the problem to themselves is because they are not aware that genetic diseases are not isolated to just themselves .
This is a case of ignorance  which is not at all bliss .
There is no good reason for a genetic disease carrier to hide his or her condition from his or her family members or relatives if the person is aware of the implication of the genetic disorder .
This is a question of morality .
A person who understands his role and responsibility as part of a family would not want to see his future generation  or his immediate families to suffer from genetic diseases that could otherwise have been prevented if he had discussed his condition .
The reasons to inform outweigh the reasons not to; hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
As genetic testing becomes more and more popular , the moral issues around it have also been raised .
Genetic testing is the newest technology aimed to "test for genetic disorders" , with "direct examination of the DNA molecule" also included (Human Genome Program , 2008) .
The wide spread of this technology aroused an even wider range of heated discussion that who has the final say in how to deal with the testing result .
Since the individual who undergoes the testing is the direct victim from this examination and most related to the result , he or she should have the right to decide whether to say the result or not .
First of all , one's private life is a main perspective of protecting human rights .
According to the definition of private life provided by the European Convention on Human Rights , it "includes the right to be protected from the unwanted publication or disclosure of intimate personal information" CITATION Eth06 \l 1033 ( Ethics in genetic research and practice , 2006) .
As mentioned before , the experiment unit oneself is the most influenced one by this genetic testing , so he or she should decide whether to tell anyone else  .
Imagine that the top-secret information is released regardless of how the individual feels .
The rule of protecting human rights is violated .
Thus the individual should have the final say .
Secondly , the result might be misused against the individual if the choice is left to other sides .
Once the information that an otherwise normal employee is likely to be diagnosed with some rare gene-related diseases , the employer might be reluctant to keep the hiring relationship because the employer has to consider the duration of the employee's commitment may be disturbed by sudden illnesses .
Possible breakups might take place before marriage simply due to the fiance's comparatively higher chance to pass the so-called "bad" gene to the next generation .
Hence it is decided by the individual who takes the genetic testing how to deal with the result .
Opponents may address the equal human rights of the individual's family .
It cannot be denied that they also have the right to know if their genes also possess lurking variables that can cause diseases .
This topic is discussing whether the individual has the final say , instead of whether the individual can hide the truth from others .
A normal person will probably choose the best solution for his or her family .
The cases of concealing caused by selfishness can be decreased by improving the education of moral values .
If the decision is left to others , the chance of perfect equality is also questionable .
What is more , people may be reluctant to undergo testing if they cannot decide on their own .
Then the purpose of this advanced technology cannot be realized .
To conclude , the individual requesting human rights should have the final say in whether to say the result or not .
Reference:
Firstly , informing relatives allows them to take preventive measures against diseases .
Having the same parents can mean that certain disease can run within the family and they are morally obligated to warn their relatives of the possible hazards that may trigger disease , for example , to prevent relatives from eating fava beans when one is detected to have G6PD deficiency .
One can even educate relatives of the preventive measures of certain diseases .
For example , to educate relatives to eat less fatty meals when their genes predispose too weak blood vessels integrity that are prone to rupture .
Secondly , informing relatives of their genetic results will enable better care of him- or herself .
Usually , when a disease manifests itself , it requires many preliminary tests , and the turnaround time (TAT) , from doctor's request , to laboratory test , to reporting of results may take more than a day .
That is only to rule out certain illnesses .
After these preliminary tests , the doctor would order  more specific tests to narrow down to the specific cause , and this may take a few days in specialist clinics .
However ,  the knowledge of the possibility of a genetic disease enables the medical physician to narrow down to specific testing and get the correct diagnosis earlier .
This would then enable earlier medical interventions and ensures higher survival rate .
However , some argue that genetic testing can potentially unravel family secrets , namely adoptions and illegitimate child (Doukas & Berg , 2001) .
But such issues can be solved since we can select results to be in terms of potential diseases , instead of paternity testing .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives for the betterment of the relatives to take preventive measures and also be equipped with related knowledge to save their own lives .
The advent of genetic testing has created a scientific breakthrough in identifying risk factors for disease .
The increasing awareness of the usefulness of genetic testing has prompted many to undergo such testing .
However , genetic testing result may not only concern the tested individual himself or herself but also their family members as they share the same genetic make-up and are equally at risk of contracting a certain disease (Genetic testing helps cancer survivors fight for their loved ones , 2007) .
This has sparked many debates on the obligation of an individual to share the test result with genetic relatives .
While the common consensus is that every individual should have the final decision on whether to reveal the result to others , a decision made not to reveal the result to relatives may have it consequences .
In addition , withholding the result may also have a negative effect on the individual psychologically .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , individual who have undergone genetic testing , should be obligated to inform his or her relatives of the genetic testing result as they may also be equally at risk .
By informing relatives of the result , they are able make necessary lifestyle and dietary changes in order to reduce the risk of getting the disease (Genetic testing helps cancer survivors fight for their loved ones , 2007) .
This also allows family members to step up their preventive measures against the diseases by undergoing regular medical screening .
Furthermore , they can be subjected to early treatment should they get diagnosed with the disease (Babowice , 2008) .
Such early treatment will greatly increase the prospects of recovery as it will prevent the disease from developing further and causing more complications .
Another reason as to why an individual should be obligated to inform the genetic test result to his or her relatives is so that they may be able to receive emotional support from the family (Newstaff , 2009) .
Many a time , a tested individual chose not to share such result with their loved one so as not to add unnecessary distress and anxiety to them .
However , bottling up their feelings will only aggravate their problem as it will have an adverse psychological effect on them .
By sharing such information with family members , individuals may share their problems and worries with them .
On top of that , they may lighten the burden on their shoulder .
According to a research conducted by Georgetown University Medical Centre , those who disclosed their genetic test results to their family members are much contented with their decision than those who did not (Newstaff , 2009) .
Many have also shared their views that informing the test result to their family members had led to a better communication relationship .
It is undeniable that an individual has the final say as to whether to reveal his or her genetic test result .
However , one should always remember that choosing not to do so will only further implicate more problems to oneself as well as to others .
Disclosure of such information to relatives will instead bring about many benefits .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
The new millennium brought about promising medical advancements that have had positive impacts on human's lives .
Remarkable breakthroughs , particularly in the field of genetics , allow humans to better understand the cause of diseases , so as to formulate cure or preventive drugs that can be tailored to individual idiosyncrasies .
This is made possible through a series of genetic tests on an individual .
Genetic testing is the detection of abnormalities in the human genomes , to indentify presence of genetic disorder and to assess the possible risk of developing genetic disorder in the future .
Some examples of such genetic disorders include single gene defects , multifactorial problems and teratogenic problems (Weill Medical College of Cornell University 2003) .
Though the benefits of genetic testing are numerous , individuals are forced to face an ethical dilemma of whether they are obligated to reveal the results to their relatives .
In my opinion , I believe that individuals should be obligated to reveal such information to their relatives .
Proponents who felt that individuals should be obligated to reveal genetic test results asserted that these individuals will have a more open communication relationship with their families .
This is coherent to a study done by Georgetown university medical center on mothers who shared their cancer genetic test results with children .
The research findings shows that mothers who chose to disclose the results are generally satisfied with their decision because they are able to receive the necessary support and understanding from families (Karen 2009) .
Individuals are able to reduce the huge mental burden imposed on them by sharing it with families , which in certain cases can be overwhelming .
This can lead to better mental health and well-being of the individuals .
Though families will be distraught by the results , accepting the fact and supporting each other in the course might lead to a stronger relationship within the family .
Moreover , disclosing the results to their immediate families will better prepare them for any unforeseen circumstances , financially and mentally .
Thus the revealing of genetic results can reduce the mental burden of an individual and bring about better communication and understanding with his or her relatives .
Another point that supports the need of revealing such results to the individual's relatives is to allow early detection of inheritable diseases that his or her relatives might be prone to .
The cancer of the large intestine , which is an inherited disorder , has subtle early stage symptoms that can progress almost undetected till the terminal stages .
When individuals chose to reveal such information to their relatives , relatives will be able to undergo aggressive and constant monitoring of the colon growth which can prevent the disease into becoming fatal (Burt and Jasperson 2008) .
Such early prevention and cure to fatal diseases are only possible if relatives are notified beforehand , and that responsibility lies on the individual who underwent genetic testing .
Such information will also allow family members and relatives to make more fully informed choices regarding their future , including decisions on marriage and career , as well as lifestyle habits .
Thus an individual of known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal test results to relatives because it brings awareness concerning the risk of inheriting the disease to the foreground , not only to the person tested , but for his or her relatives as well .
Arguments brought forward by opponents claimed that the personal rights of the individual are being violated .
This is a biased claim because it failed to consider at-risk relatives' rights to know about the test results .
Relatives have the rights to be informed of the results because they are prone to inheriting the same disease or disorder which can be fatal if discovered too late .
When individuals choose not to reveal the results , it is mainly because of the following reasons: the fear of discrimination , fear of being a burden to the family or not wanting to worry their families .
This is  selfish thinking and is an illogical way of avoiding the problem .
The failure of disclosure of genetics test results frequently cause relatives to be enraged and upset , and this had lead to numerous lawsuits against the genetics provider , as they felt that it should be these genetic providers' responsibilities to inform them , but in fact is the responsibility of the person being tested (Falk , J . M , Dugan , B . R . & O'Riordan , A . M . 2002) .
Thus detrimental effects on both parties can be seen due to the failure of disclosing genetic test results to relatives .
In conclusion , individuals should be obligated to reveal such information to their relatives because it is a personal responsibility , and can lead to  their well-being .
Moreover , relatives should also be informed about the potential dangers of inheriting such disorders so that they are able to make choices and decisions that can change their future for the better .
Firstly , the carrier should inform his or her relatives of the health implications that the genetic test results would affect them .
Most genetic disorders have a high percentage possibility of inheritance and also due to genetic similarities , appear in family members .
Thus family members should be informed so that precautionary measures could be taken by them to prepare for the possibility of the illness in the future .
The relatives could go for regular monitoring of their health conditions .
Furthermore , relatives could go for their own testing to ascertain their chances to the genetic disorder as an individual .
With the testing the relatives could make adjustments to their lifestyle to lower the risk and also to prepare case of ever developing the illness (Sturm , Varga 2008) .
It can be argued that the carrier might be causing unnecessary worry to his or her relatives as the accuracy of genetic test results varies and also dependent on various factors (Goh , 2003) .
Yet with the knowledge of the existence of such risk , the relatives can better prepare for themselves both physically and emotionally so as to be able to recover or overcome the stress if the genetic disorder turning into a medical condition .
Genetic testing is a process in which a one's DNA or an {embryo}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/embryo]'s {DNA}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/DNA] is abstracted and examined for the existence of particular {genes}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/genes] or deficiency that could signify the future attack of certain disease .
When an individual is tested positive as a carrier of a particular known genetic risk , such as 1 antitrypsin deficiency- where an insignificant adjustment in the style of living can prevent one from an "early death" (Wilcke 1998) , or Huntington's disease-where there is no approach to change the consequences of the result (Wilcke 1998) , he or she will be in dilemma dilemma- should he or she be obliged to inform his or her family members ?
Some suggested that when one's relatives are informed of the result , it can cause additional anxiety on the relatives concerned and invade on their lives , thus the positive result should not be disclosed to one's relatives .
However , by informing ones' relatives of the result not only allow them to escape from early deaths through small adjustments in their lifestyles but also ensure the safety of third parties .
Thus , the reveal of the result to relatives has effectuated significant advantages .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives as it not only allows them to escape from early death through changes in their lifestyles but also contributes to the safety of third parties .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members because the family members play a supportive and caregiver role (Mahowald , McKusick , Scheuerle and Aspinwall , 2001) .
An individual being diagnosed to be a carrier of a genetic risk will be definitely lost and depressed .
In this case , family members are important to provide mental supports to the patient .
The support given will be a great push for the patient to look forward and face the reality bravely .
Besides , family members also help patient to think through all relevant medical options which are the best for the patient (Mahowald et al . , 2001) .
In addition , family members play a caregiver role as well .
They provide care and company the patient all along the way for them to accept the fact as a carrier of the disorder .
Through the support and care provided by family members , patients could accept the genetic risk eventually .
Thus , a carrier of the genetic risk should tell his or her family members .
Other than that , the patient should tell the result of the test to their family members because family members act as patient advocate role (Mahowald et al . , 2001) .
This will benefit the patient as the family members will think all sort of ways to ensure patient receives all necessary care .
They will question the health care team and try to get more information for the patient .
These help the patient to decide the best treatment for them .
For example , a patient that has cancer can undergo several treatments to control the spread of the cancerous cells .
In this case , family members who have the information of the treatment can help the patient to decide the best treatment for the patient .
Conversely , if the patient has not toldhe family members the result of the genetic test , the patient will be definitely in lost and irrational in making decision .
Therefore , a carrier of genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members .
Opponents may argue that a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives due to the principles of confidentiality and privacy (Norrgard , 2008) .
They claimed that a carrier should have the rights to keep the result .
This is because the carrier thinks that revealing the result of the test will affect the life of the whole family .
It will create tension for the family .
However , the family members have the rights to know the result .
Since some of the genetic diseases and disorders are hereditary , therefore there are potential risks for the family members to inherit the disease .
The result should be revealed to them in order to be faired to them .
They have the rights to prevent and ensure their safety .
Besides , carriers themselves will be in an unstable emotion condition upon knowing the result .
They are unable to make decision rationally .
Thus , the result should be told to their relatives .
Hence , the relatives can make a rational  decision for the patient and this probably what the patient needs the most .
One should be obligated to reveal his or her own genetic test's results to his family members as the results can help in family planning .
A person who is thinking of marrying , should let his partner know that he has genetic problem as the other party is going to spend the rest of her life with him and it will be unfair to keep her in the dark .
Not only that , those who are already married should also reveal the results to his spouse so that they can come up with a plan for their family like how many children they want and whether they want to take the risk of having a child  .
Taking care of children with serious genetic disorder is not an easy task , and as such , a couple should inform each other of their genetic problem first and try to discuss the consequences and think of a solution together instead of keeping it a secret .
However , critics may say that it is not necessary to inform his spouse about his condition as sometimes the baby will not inherit the disease and even if the baby does inherit the disorder , abortion can still be done while the foetus is still inside the mother's womb .
However , this is not an ethical thing to do and it is to terminate a life .
It will be much  better if they have discuss and plan earlier and thus a desperate measure such as abortion need not be made .
Besides that , a carrier of a known genetic problem should be obligated to tell his family members so that the chances of treating or at least improving his disease will be much more higher .
This is because , when his family members know that he is suffering from a genetic problem , they will try all means to help him to improve his condition .
A person will usually feel depressed and even suffer emotional breakdown when he knows that he suffers from a certain disease what more if it is a disease inherited from his parents , thus when his family knows about his condition , they can persuade , pay more attention to him and even encourage him to go for treatment and not to give up .
Not only that , maybe his family members have wider contacts than him and can recommend alternative medicine or a specialist doctor which in turn can increase his chance to recover .
However , there have also been some suggestions that the carrier of a certain genetic disease who knows it through genetic testing should not be obligated to tell his family members as he will be discriminated and sometimes even be treated as an outcast in his family .
Nevertheless , he should be mentally prepared and thinks positively as eventually his family members will surely accept him as blood is always thicker than water .
In conclusion , a person should be obligated to reveal his genetic testing's results as it has more advantages in doing so than disadvantages as encouragement from his family and family planning is crucial to a person with genetic disorder .
What will be this world if people are capable of viewing their genetic testing results as easily as ordering a dinner in a restaurant ?
Nowadays , there is a new type of technology , named genetic testing , which is designed to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders (Genetic testing , 2009) .
With the help of genetic test , people are able to find or rule out some suspected genetic problems and will be clear about the risks of developing or passing on a genetic disorder .
However , if individuals are allowed to have the final say in revealing the results of such testing , although it has many benefits , its disadvantages still outweigh these advantages overwhelmingly .
That is to say , letting people possess the right to view such testing results is potentially harmful to our community .
Hence , people should not have the final say on whether to reveal the result of genetic tests .
This essay will concentrate on two aspects to illustrate the reasons: side effects of the genetic testing on families and society (Nicholson , 2007) .
Firstly , as for the family aspect , genetic testing may create tension among family members (Genetic testing , 2009) .
It is because one person's result will have deep effects on others' due to their kinship .
For example , if a parent or a child knows that he gets a kind of genetic disorder , then their children or parents may worry about not only his health but also themselves' all the time .
This brings about a lot of trouble to the whole family and affects the family harmony .
Besides , if a baby is diagnosed withome genetic problems , some parents may abandon their child due to the endless treatments and high-priced medical cost instead of hoping to cure their child and trying their best .
Hence , if the results of genetic testing are allowed to reveal to individuals , such phenomena will happen more frequently than before and it will make a difference on society .
Then as for the social aspects , genetic testing may also be sensational (Nicholson , 2007) .
For instance , if the employers know the genetic testing results of their potential employees , they will intend to hire those who are much healthier than others .
Otherwise , their employees may ask for a sick leave from time to time , which will affect the normal operations of the companies .
Besides , if an insurance agent knows the results of a particular customer , then salesmen will try to avoid offering insurance service to one who has some kind of genetic disorder .
Instead , they will spare no effort to sell insurance to the healthy population .
In a word , genetic testing may lead to a genetic discrimination in employment and insurance industry (Genetic testing , 2009) .
Moreover , even if people know their results of genetic testing , usually they are able to do very little  .
It is because genetic testing cannot predict how severely one person will be affected by the disordered genes .
What can be done is only detecting whether there are any genetic problems .
Also , for most kinds of the genetic disorders , the medical technology nowadays is not capable of curing them (What is genetic testing ?
n .d .) .
Therefore , personally viewing of the results of genetic testing will cause a lot of problems to society .
Actually , whether individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results of such testing is a heated controversy in society today .
While the genetic testing can assist people in predicting and ruling out some genetic disorders and problems which are hard to be find in daily life , it will still bring about some  problems to human beings to some extent .
Hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Firstly , there are ethical implications involved .
It would be morally wrong not to inform an identifiable individual of having a possibility of developing genetic disease .
For instance , a parent with high blood pressure may affect the child to inherit the disease .
Researchers have shown that his/her child will have a 35 percent to 65 percent chance of inheriting it (Edelson , 2009) .
Thus , the parent should warn the child of this possibility .
The child can take precautions  with his/her diet and exercise regularly to reduce the risk of having high blood pressure .
On the other hand , some may question  the accuracy of genetic testing , and the unnecessary worries it might bring to an individual .
However , prevention is always better than cure and with additional caution , worries will be eliminated .
Secondly , social issues will also occur .
The genetic disease may spread among the community if an individual is unaware of a possible genetic disorder developing in him/her .
In the case of Huntington's disease , the related family member will have a 50 percent possibility of having the disease (Norrgard , 2008a) .
If so unfortunately the related family member were to develop the disease and carry on with giving birth , his/her child will in turn have a 50 percent chance of having the disease .
When this cycle carries on , it will create a social problems as the disease has now been spread into the society .
Thus , the individual should be obligated to inform his/her relatives to avoid such situation .
On the contrary , others may feel that the individual will be discriminated due to his/her disease .
However , there are laws which protect the individual from discrimination (Norrgard , 2008b) .
This can give the individual a sense of assurance that they have equal chances (in looking for a job) as compared to others .
Surveillance technology such as RFID technology is used for the purpose of monitoring changes , behaviorsand activities and keeping track of mainly humans and sometimes , animals .
RFID technology has been around for more than 10 years and it is used by different bodies or organizations (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Thus , it is not something uncommon in our society as it has been incorporated into many applications of our daily lives such as tracking people and animals .
The acronym RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification and it is widely used in different industries .
We may rely too much on RFID technology that it may take a toll on some of us .
This has resulted in the raise of privacy and ethical issues within our society .
However , it has been known that RFID technology brings benefits to various elements of our lives such as helping in solving problems that we may encounter while handling different tasks and even correcting human errors .
Hence , RFID technology such as human implants and RFID tags should be used to monitor people .
One of the vital advantages of the use of RFID technology is that it can boost the security level effectively in a few areas  (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Safety and security is the primary concern when it comes to managing a business .
For example , RFID tags are widely used in jewellery stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
Merchandises in the respective stores are tagged with RFID tags and RFID readers will be placed at the checkout counters (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Once an RFID tagged item is brought out  , it will trigger the alarm and security guards will be alerted upon hearing the alarm .
this decreases the chances of theft .
Besides that , RFID tags come in various shapes and sizes and the information contained in the RFID tags are not easily duplicated (Ramdasi , 2009) .
This increases the security level and efficacy of the surveillance system in a particular area that incorporates the RFID technology .
Besides that , RFID technology is also important in the healthcare industry as it can save lives (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
Dull and monotonous procedures can be removed or reduced and patients would not feel trapped or isolated and be more carefree (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
For example , patients are tagged with RFID wristbands that contain information about their health conditions , medications , drug allergies and microchips that enable healthcare professionals to monitor  patients (RFID Applications in Healthcare , 2006) .
If any patient experiences any difficulties such as breathlessness , nurses will be able to track the patient and immediately attend to him or her .
This saves time and can potentially save a life .
Since RFID automates such proceduresthat protect the patients from danger , it reduces the amount of personal contact between patients and nurses (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
Information on patients' diseases and surgeries can also be obtained from the RFID wristbands .
Thus , reports can be accessed by the healthcare professionals such as the doctors and nurses without a hassle .
Further medical treatments can be conducted if another doctor reads the reports .
However , there are arguments that are against the use of RFID technology in monitoring and tracking people and animals despite the benefits gained .
One of the arguments that has been brought up is the difficulty in reading the information provided by the RFID tags incorporated in liquids and metal products (Pandey , 2009) .
These substances may reflect the radio waves which makes the information hard to read .
The RFID tags also have to be placed in proper positions , taking into account their angles and alignment in order to obtain a proper reading .
This can be quite a hassle and it requires a lot of concentration .
However , RFID tags are usually placed in an area with optimum frequency which enables the RFID readers to obtain the information contained in the tags correctly .
Active RFID tags , which are tags that use batteries to increase the range of frequency of a system , can be used to solve this problem .
Hence , the use of RFID technology would still be effective and beneficial to us .
In conclusion , we can see that the use of RFID technology does bring important advantages to our society .
Therefore , the use of RFID technology should be promoted and enhanced .
RFID technology provides  better security than other surveillance gadgets such as CCTV and reduces thefts in our society .
Besides that , monitoring of animals is made easy because of the versatility of the RFID tags .
Therefore , if we would like to minimise our workload , save time , ensure that we live in a safer environment and save lives , RFID technology should be used to carry out these intentions .
A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag is a small microchip designed for identification of the object it is attached to .
It is capable of transmitting much stored digital information to receivers via radio waves and has many applications in consumers' products (Cormode 2006) .
However , privacy issues arise when the same technology is used for tracking  humans (Cormode 2006) .
When RFID and other surveillance technologies are used to track children's movement , we are not only invading the children's privacy but also undermining their dignity (Anonymous 2005) .
Usage of RFID implants in the medical field to store patients' medical data has also been linked to increased possibility of developing cancer (Gutierrez 2008) .
With such detrimental effects on health and on human rights of privacy , usage of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
First of all , when RFID is used to tag and track a person , the privacy of the person being tracked is compromised .
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation ."
With RFID , private information of the individual other than his location can be picked up by anyone with a radio receiver and the individual with the RFID will not know who is taking the information and what private information is being stolen (Cormode 2006) .
The information may be misused for consumer profiling by the company collecting all this personal information (Cormode 2006) .
Advocates of RFID argue that the technology will prevent terrorists from entering the nation by reducing forgery of passports (US Department of Homeland Security) .
However , the United Sates Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reported that the ability of RFID to counter forgery comes from its use of encrypted digital data storage and not from its radio transmission capability .
The DHS has also added that other forms of digital data storage technology such as contact chips can provide the same function against passport forgery while preventing invasion of human privacy .
Thus , RFID should not be used to track people since it infringes on human privacy .
Secondly , an article on Electronic Privacy Information Center (Anonymous 2005) highlighted that using RFID to track children's movements and locations not only invades their privacy but can also be very detrimental to their dignity .
The article also compared tagging our children with RFID with tagging of products in markets or tagging of livestock in farms .
this comparison shows that the dignity of children is being affected by the usage of RFID to track them .
Opponents to this position argue that RFID can be used to locate a child's position in the event of a kidnap (Lane 2003) .
However , Lane (2003) argues that due to the limited range of RFID , it will not serve the purpose of locating the kidnapped child well .
On top of that , Lane (2003) also points out that these surveillance technologies may give the children and parents a false sense of security .
Instead of teaching their children the importance of personal safety and the danger of wandering off with strangers , parents may end up relying too much on these technologies for the safety of their children .
Hence , RFID should not be used for the tracking of children .
Lastly , usage of RFID implants to track patients and to store medical information of cognitively declined individuals has been linked to an increased risk of developing skin cancer in areas near the implant (Gutierrez 2008) .
Although the RFID implant aids in getting medical information from these individuals with lower intellect , the increased risk of cancer greatly outweighs this benefit .
Thus , usage of RFID implants for tracking of patients or for storing of medical records should be banned .
In conclusion , usage of RFID or other surveillance technologies to track people not only infringe human rights of privacy and undermines the dignity of our children , it also poses a serious health issue in the case of RFID implants .
As such , RFID or other surveillance technologies to track people should be banned .
The vast and most frequent surveillance is on the internet , the presumed free space .
(Daffier , Whitfield , 2008))For instance , the information awareness office , NSI in U .S . all have unauwould of course to all the data and traffic on the internet .
Billions are spent every year to develop , puthe workplaceaintain and implement the surveillance system to intercept and analyze online information .
The tapping of telephone line by government organisations for monitor citizens and collecting miscellaneous information is also  every country .
Another common surveillance system is that of the surveillance cameras hidden in public areas such as streets , hotels , hospital , shopping mall , bank etc , for administrative purposes or financial security .
RFID tapping is the use of small devices implanted in human body or product to identify and locate , which is already applied in some company to monitor their workers while on the job  .
Some criticize ferociously that such mass surveillInternetthe step towards the tota(Whitfield , 2008) .orge Orwell's 1984 .They fear the fictional Orwelthe NSAand the FBI evethe UScome true , which will be a disaster for human beings .
Some are juInterneted by this blatant way the governments work which they equal to that of treating prisoners .
Numerous civil right groups and privacy groups oppose and regard it as a severelineslation of the tight of privacy anmonitoringom .
The supporters believe that surveillance system is indispensible in indentifying and capturing terrorists and criminals , which is for public welfare  .It's also effective for administrative purpose .
They argue thospitalshe today's mallsexbanksat terrorist can make use of computer software to access to others' information nowadays , why cannot governments on tbodiesehalproductse whole country .

Realistically ,  the usage of surveillance is necessary in some area and has its value in the benefit of whole society and therefore cannot be all banned .
There are always some ready to behave undesirably on any conditions everywhere .
We are compelled to sacrifice some to counter them; otherwise we lose more .

We should exploit the technology to the most forinhe welfare of the whole community .
In the case of surveillance technology , we should concentrate on how to use it appropriately .
Surveillance tecthe sacrificesage should not be all simply banned because of its flaws , but to be regulated and optimized to serve us better in today's context .
Technological advancement has led to the invention of several surveillance technologies .
One such example is Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology .
The use of such technology has made it possible to track people and their activities through their belongings without their knowledge .
This has brought about many debates on the ethical and moral issues surrounding the use of the device (Anonymous , 2005) .
While opponents of RFID suggest that the use of RFID brings benefits such as convenience and protection to patients and children , others view it as a form of security threat and intrusion of privacy (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
The use of RFID can also cause the growth of tumors if chips are implanted into the human body (Anti-chip .com , n .d) .
Thus , the use of RFID should be banned as the consequences it brings outweigh the few benefits that it provides .
Firstly , the use of RFID to track people has raised concerns on privacy issues as they are tracked without their knowledge (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Their whereabouts and activities can be constantly monitored and such information shared .
It can be argued that the use of RFID tags to check on patients with Alzheimer conditions and children may be a form of protection .
For instance , in 2006 , Verichip , the manufacturer of RFID chips for humans attempted to chip 200 Alzheimer patients from Chattanooga , Tennessee to test the effectiveness of the product (Antichip .com , n .d) .
However , this raised a series of heated debates as it is not ethical to chip cognitively impaired individuals who are unable to give informed consent for the experiment (Antichip .com , n .d) .
Hence , the use of RFID should be banned as it invades the privacy of people .
Secondly , the use of RFID to track people may provide a false sense of security (Hook , 2005) .
RFID tags can be incorporated into one's belongings such as passports and identification cards to track and identify people .
This may increase cases of skimming on personal information .
Opponents of RFID may debated that encryption can be used to limit the access of information to unauthorized people (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Furthermore , it can be argued that RFID technology can reduce delays at checkpoints and entrances which in turn would improve efficiency and speed (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Nevertheless , experiments by security research firm Riscure have shown that the encrypted passport can be intercepted and excessive information can be revealed to an unauthorized person , which may promote identity theft (Hasbrouck , 2006) .
Therefore , RFID should be banned as the device is flawed .
Lastly , implanting RFID chips in humans can be a potential health risk .
A series of studies showed that chip implants induced malignant tumors in some lab mice and rats (Lewan , 2007) .
This shows that implanting chips in humans may cause cancer .
However , leading cancer specialists  that animal test results do not necessarily apply to humans (Lewan , 2007) .
Moreover , Verichip Corp insists that the chips are safe and has been implanted in millions of domestic pets without major problems (Lewan , 2007) .
Nevertheless , implanting RFID in the human body should be banned  detrimental health effectson individuals .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it can be a security threat and it intrudes on the privacy of people .
Implanting RFID chips into humans may also result in cancer .
The disadvantages of the use of RFID outweigh the benefits .
Surveillance technology systems are mechanisms which can identify , monitor and track movements and data .
Research laboratories envision tools that can identify and track just about every person anywhere -- and sound alarms when the systems encounter hazardous objects or chemical compounds .
Together these developments herald a high-tech surveillance society that is beyond previous generations' imagination-- one in which virtually every advance brings benefits as well as intrusions .
However , since the benefits reaped from surveillance technology overpowers the inconvenience it results in , surveillance technology should indeed be used to track people .
Surveillance technology should be used to track people to ensure national security by preventing crime .
Ever since this technology has become immensely sophisticated , real benefits have been achieved in the development of surveillance technology systems .
The most common type of surveillance technology is the security camera .
Take , for instance , the pinhole cameras in most bank machines .
These devices play a part in deterring potential criminals from carrying out their nefarious activities knowing that their images are caught on tape and may be used for capture and prosecution .
In addition , this technology also complements the work of security personnel and thus provides added protection against furtive terrorist attacks .
This is evident in the Singapore MRT stations that are equipped with the 24-hour camera surveillance .
Furthermore , surveillance technology helps to combat threats .
This has been proven through the introduction of the newly-developed Infrared Fever Screening System (IFSS) which was a useful contribution in national efforts against SARS .
Some may argue that surveillance technology should not be used to track people as it may have substantial implications on privacy .
Privacy  refers to the interest that individuals have in sustaining a personal space free from interference by other people and organizations .
It is acknowledged that the usage of surveillance technology seems to invade and violate the right to privacy .
People often think of privacy as some kind of right .
However , the concept of this right is a problematic way to define privacy as it is very easy to get confused between legal rights on one hand and natural or moral rights on the other .
One may claim it is his right to stay in a country that is safe whereas the other may claim that it is their right not to want the practice of surveillance technology .
In such situations , it is impossible for both parties to have their rights .
One will have to give up the right to absolute privacy to reap the benefits of the right to feel safe and secure .
In addition , having absolute privacy is just an ideal .
The practice of surveillance technology is necessary for the benefit of the majority as it has been adopted to improve our quality of life .
It will be denying more people their rights if surveillance is not practiced .
For now , the public seems to find that trade-off acceptable .
Furthermore , scientists around the world have intensified efforts to perfect the art of surveillance , hoping to catch villains before they strike .
This will assure the public that it is worth it to allow the technology to invade  their privacy .
In conclusion , although each uptick in protection will typically come at the cost of more intrusion into the privacy of ordinary people , the development of surveillance technology has come up with the best possible inventions to assure that this trade-off will be worth it .
Rather than not doing anything to deal with the problems we have , the implementation of such technologies should be allowed for the benefit of the majority .
There are a number of technologies by which identity of all kinds of material can be tracked .
Some advance surveillance technology like GPS and RFID can even track people's location and health status by using a tiny tag and a reader .
However , disputes rises as the issue comes to tracking of human beings .
In my opinion , these surveillance technologies should not be used to track people .
First and foremost , privacy comes into our mind when we mention  being tracked all the time .
No one would like to have a pair of eyes watching them anytime or anywhere , leaving them an uncomfortable feeling .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) has clearly stated out that all human beings are born free and are equal in dignity and rights .
Everyone should have their own right to move freely without being monitored .
Secondly , the importance  using surveillance technology to track people is subtle .
Some may argue that these technologies can keep people from danger by tracking their health status especially in some working places with high radioactive levels , or in tracking someone's location in case he's kidnapped .
However , workers can still have medical checks regularly to ensure they are healthy as health problems wouldn't come in a sudden; they must accumulate over time .
Furthermore , for parents fearing  the chance of their children being kidnapped , it's unfortunate that through electromagnetic isolation , they would not be able to track their children even if their children were RFID tagged .
Moreover , these children may get hurt if the kidnappers decide to remove the tag or chip implanted under the children's skin .
Besides that , the confidentiality of such data transmitted between a tag or chip and device is questionable .
Someone who has the device and knows the way to encrypt the code can actually have access to the data .
It would be a dangerous scene if someone is tracked by a person who doesn't have the authority to do so .
Even though a high security level can be developed , there will always be loopholes .
Thus , the best way to prevent the leakage of personal data is not to use it .
Last but not least , a report released by The American Medical Association[HYPERLINK: http://www .ama-assn .org/] (AMA) indicated that RFID devices may present physical risks to patients .
Though they are removable , their small size allows them to migrate under the skin , making them potentially difficult to extract .
The report went on to add this warning: "RFID tags may cause electromagnetic interference , which may interfere with electrosurgical devices and defibrillators .
Finally , it has not been determined whether RFID tags might affect the efficacy of pharmaceuticals ."
In conclusion , due to the infringement of privacy , the unimportance of using these technologies , the threat to confidential data and health  , surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID is useful in maintaining security in the country .
The use of RFID at immigration borders and checkpoints enables a country to identify suspected terrorists and keep away unwelcomed immigrants who may pose a threat to the welfare of the country and her people .
( ) This will in turn help to improve and safeguard safety in the country and indirectly help in the economical aspect .
Therefore , this form of tracking of people should not be avoided .
Secondly , using surveillance technology to track patients helps to ensure their safety and thus should not be denied .
The use of RFID-based wristbands helps to keep track of the locations of Alzheimer and pediatric patients to make sure that they do not wander off from the hospital or enter any unauthorized areas It is essential for hospitals to have such devices to track down patients to prevent the occurrence of unwanted incidents .
Furthermore , the use of battery-powered RFID tags can also help hospitals to track down locations of patients in times of disaster when the lives of patients are at threat .
Such usage of surveillance technology to track people is necessary , and hence should not be denied of usage .
In addition , the use of surveillance technology such as surveillance cameras to track people is believed to aid in the reduction of crime rate in the country , which will be beneficial to the society .
With the presence of surveillance cameras , potential criminals will thus think twice before they act .
This may hence deter crimes from happening .
Even though it may not be an ideal and effective way to curb criminal offenses , it can on the other hand allow authorities to work more efficiently when an incident occurs .
The use of surveillance technology to track people , under such circumstances , has once again proved to be useful and thus should not be stopped from using it .
Despite the positive impacts of the usage of surveillance technology to track people , there are many arguments pertaining to how surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
One of the main issues will be the concern of intrusion of human rights .
When companies first started introducing the implantation of RFID chips into the body of their employees , protests were raised by both related and unrelated parties because they felt that it is clearly a violation of the privacy of one .
The workers claimed that it is a way of bereaving them from human rights when their movements are being watched around the clock .
Christian critics even claimed that such acts will lead to apocalypse as stated in the bible (Lewan , 2007 .
However , such arguments regarding religious issues and human rights are unpractical because there is no substantial evidence to prove that implantation of microchips is going to lead to the end of the world , and the argument of violation of human rights is made weak with the definition of human rights being ambiguous .
Conversely , the purpose of implanting RFID chips into the employees is clear- to deny access of employees into restricted and highly confidential areas .
The concern is whether  interests of the company should override the right of human beings .
Therefore in this case , it is difficult to determine whether surveillance technology should or should not be used to track people .
Furthermore , the use of surveillance technology may result in adverse psychological impacts on human beings .
The open-street camera surveillance that has been used widely by many countries in the current society is likely to result in an unhealthy psychological impact on the citizens of the country .
Knowing that every movement  is being watched over , one may feel stress and uneasy , and this will in turn affects his behavior Societal surveillance may also give rise to "mistrust between citizens and citizens and the state Due to this negative consequence in this case , surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
RFID technology should be banned as this form of surveillance technology is still not considered totally safe for consumers .
One of the most serious threats is data theft .
As RFID tags are made to contain information , there is a very high probability of data theft by well hidden RFID scanners (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Moreover , these RFID scanners are very cheap in comparison to a RFID tag .
This will eventually lead to the problem of data ownership and the information unique to an individual might be made known to other people (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Another issue is the possibility of data corruption .
As RFID tags are rewritable and  are not securely locked , there exists a potential for pranksters to change the data on the tags with false information (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
On the contrary , some people might think that using shielding techniques on RFID tags is already an effective protection mechanism against data theft and data corruption (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Although it is true that aluminium shielding can prevent hackers to steal one's data to a certain extent , it also makes transmission more difficult and might not be completely effective in preventing it (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Further research needs to be done to make the shielding techniques safer for consumers .
Therefore , RFID technology should be banned for the safety of consumers .
There is a need to prohibit RFID technology as it indirectly intrudes one's life and privacy .
Nowadays , RFID scanners are highly portable and have a further effective reading range (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Furthermore , there is no need for the tags to be scanned to retrieve the information (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
This implies that RFID tags can now be read without one's knowledge .
As such , human privacy is being violated .
This situation regarding violating human privacy worsened after the Food and Drug Administration in the United States approved the human implants of RFID chips () .
Many concerns have been raised regarding the privacy of people as they can now be easily tracked wherever they are due to the RFID technology implanted in them (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
On the other hand , some people may argue that RFID technology is a form of crime prevention .
It makes the search for missing people much easier and this helps to deter criminals from committing crimes like kidnapping .
However , a stop check will expose this sham reality .
A criminal in a real scenario would not hesitate to capture his prey just because the target has a RFID chip inside him .
RFID chips can be easily removed and a kidnapper would not think twice to cut the RFID chip out of a child to take out the implant .
This in turn makes the child more vulnerable to injuries due to the use of RFID technology .
Hence , RFID technology should not be made available to the general public as it endangers one's life and privacy .
RFID technology should also be excluded as surveillance technology to track people as it is rather costly (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Each RFID reader is worth at least a thousand dollars (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Those companies which have decided to use RFID technology to keep track of its workers or products have to purchase thousands of RFID readers to cover all their workplaces and factories (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
In addition , each RFID tag is rather expensive hence it is not practical to be used in large quantities to identify both people and products (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Due to  its impracticality , RFID technology should not be used to track people .
Though the use of RFID technology has its merits such as crime prevention , it should still be barred because the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people not only infiltrate one's privacy; it is also not cost effective and likely to result in data theft and data loss .
Surveillance technology is increasingly important in the fast-paced and ever-changing world .
Surveillance technology refers to the measure of monitoring , identifying and tracking people , animals or products .
Surveillance technology such as RFID which is radio frequency identification has been a popular debated issue  In my opinion , the use of technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned because of human welfare .
Surveillance technology such as RFID to track people plays a crucial role in preventing the criminal activities as well as monitoring threats .
RFID tags can be inserted into the wristbands which can be worn by the parolees or the prisoners and cannot  be removed .
According to Taipei Times newspaper , it was claimed that the sexual assault parolees should wear the RFID tags in order to trace their whereabouts (Chang , 2006) .
During the  , there will be cases that the parolees will escape and flee to the bent so that the law enforcers can not find them .
Thus , attaching RFID tags on them can easily track them .
If they intend to run away , the police can get to know their locations and arrest them at once .
Apart from the RFID tags , GPS can be applied to investigate the criminal activities such as murder cases , robbery and serious corruption (Michael and Rose , 2007) .
Undeniably , surveillance technology to track people will lead to loss of privacy .
However , protecting the privacy in this situation is not more important than letting the offenders  violate the laws and threaten our lives .
Surveillance technology plays an integral part of providing health care to patients .
For instance , RFID tags in  bracelets are worn by  patients who need exceptional care to make available to the patients' information as well as to know their positions ( , 2009) .
This can lead to the best health care of the patients .
CCTV can be installed in hospitals to avoid the patients being harmed or attacked by unauthorized persons who are hanging around the area in hospitals by monitoring them ( , 2009) .
Besides , RFID is very useful to attach to Alzheimer's patients where the tags can provide the data of the patients so that they will not get lost .
Opponents may argue that the health data of patients is confidential .
However , there should be exceptions for certain extremes .
The health data of patients can provide details to help to be more understanding about the patients' background .
In addition , there is another advantage of surveillance technology in protecting and tracking the children's movements .
As we know , parents nowadays always worry about their children .
However , living in the hustle and bustle of city life , many parents utilize their time to work harder to climb up the social ladder rather than supervise their kids' movements .
Hence , RFID technology is indeed a good method to help the parents to keep an eye on their children's whereabouts .
RFID tags are  sewn into children's attires or set in their wristband to track their positions and activities (Gautam , 2006) .
The importance of this surveillance technology is that it can make sure of the children's safety so that the parents can work at ease .
Although most of the children today have mobile phones , it is also possible that their mobile phones are lost or they have difficulties to pick up their phones  in cases such as kidnaps . .
If the children are  kidnapped , with the surveillance technology of RFID , the parents can track their locations .
If the children try to play truant or are involved in unhealthy activities , the parents can supervise them as well .
Children have their freedom to enjoy their lives but monitoring and supervising them is also essential to ensure their safety .
Parents can talk to the children precisely why there is a need to track their movements .
In conclusion , the advantages of using surveillance technology far  outweigh its disadvantages .
Surveillance technology should be used in a correct way to improve human's life and not to lead to dehumanization .
So , I do not agree that there should be a ban in using surveillance technology to track people .
Technological advances have eased the execution of surveillance activities .
Some have claimed that the application of surveillance technology is advantageous in the safeguard of credentials , protection of national security and in the help of speed border crossings (Lewan , 2009) .
However the same technology can also be used to track people and intrude private information .
Concerns are raised on the moral and ethical issues surrounding the latter usage of such technology .
Among these issues , two will be discussed here .
Both support the fact that surveillance technology creates risk to privacy that far outweighs the technology's heralded  .
Thus the usage of such technology in tracking people should be banned .
Firstly , surveillance technology may threaten personal security by enabling identity thieves , stalkers and other criminals to commit "contactless" crimes against victims who won't immediately know that their rights have  been violated ( , 2009) .
Recently , Americans were told to use Radio- Frequency Identification or RFID-embedded identity documents when they are travelling between countries such as the United States , Canada , Mexico , Bermuda and the Carribean (Lewan , 2009) .
In February 2005 , when the State Department (US) asked for public comment on the implementation of RFID in passport booklets , of the 2 ,335 comments received , 98 .5 percent were negative , with 86 percent expressing security or privacy concerns , the department reported in an October 2005 notice in the Federal Register (Lewan , 2009) .
Indeed , the fear of losing security is a distressing concern among the society .
Secondly , surveillance technology poses a risk to personal privacy and healthcare .
"Tracking devices such as online behavioural tracking systems can be used to target vulnerable consumers for high-price loans , bogus health cures and other potentially harmful products and services ," said Susan Grant , director of Consumer Protection at Consumer Federation of America () .
Nowadays electronic information from consumers is "collected , compiled and sold" () without reasonable safeguards and therefore poses a threat to the exposure of private matters of consumers that may lead to abuse of such information for unethical benefits or intentions .
Some may argue that such tracking systems can be beneficial especially in providing security measurement and protection , for example the implantation of tiny radio tracking beacons in children (Gargano , Gilmore , Pace , Weinstein , 1997) .
This measure is to be seen as an effort to protect the children in case of child murder or kidnapping  (Gargano et al . , 1997) .
However , the motivation for the beacons may change on the part of the parents as the children grow older and begin to learn to protect themselves .
Parents who insist their teens in wearing radio beacons may cause the teens (those who oppose) to refuse the requirement and subsequently select other unpleasant options , including trying to remove the (implanted) beacon themselves (Petersen , 2001) .
As a result , this is how teens' privacy and growth are affected negatively when parents apply tracking devices on them .
Julie Petersen , author of Understanding of Surveillance Technologies () , stated this comment in her book , "Researching this book has given me concerns that we may be moving into a not-too-distant future in which newborn infants are implanted with radio tracking devices , without their knowledge or consent , to 'ensure their safety' from wandering or kidnapping .
These actions may be well-intentioned initially but may subsequently be used to curtail freedom of choice and movement during their teenage years and beyond ."
Unfortunately the use of surveillance technology in tracking people may have higher probability in affecting a person's social well-being as well as intruding his privacy even when it may be well- intentioned at first .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology for the purpose of tracking people should be banned as it has not only received negative response from the public community because of its potential threat to personal security , it may also intrude one's privacy and may jeopardize one's personal healthcare and social well-being .
I .advantageAnother concern about using RFID to track people is the health problems .
Research has shown that implantable RFID chips caused cancer inthe oneimal and they may also cause cancer in humans .
In addition , research also showed that the {inflammation}[HYPERLINK: http://www .naturalnews .com/inflammation .html] caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object can increase the instance of tumor development (Jean 2007) .
Concerning these health issues , it is immoral to ask people implant RFID chips and meanwhile let them take the risk of having disease .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
Advocators may argue that RFID should not be banned because it can be used as an effective and efficient means to conduccausesal control .animalsxample , RFID equipped cards can help control the access to some restricted areas .
Howen be skimmed by hackers , it cannot guarantee securities of society .
Experiment has shown that an RFID ,ntification card can be skimmed and cloned by a hacker .
Furthermore , using the cloned card , the hacker was able to pass into the restrdiseasesrea through the secure and locked entrance (Jones 2008) .
Hence , using RFID equipped cards to track and control entrances is not secure nor effective at all .
To some extent , they even create opportunities for criminals to collect useful information and commit crimes .
,by usingIn conclusion , using RFID to track people not only raises the possibilities of privacy invasion , but also causes health problems .
Instead of benefitting from it , people bear many fear and risk of it .
Thus , although using RFID to conduct tracking may be helpful in some aspects , compared with the disadvantages of it , the use of RFID to track peosecurity for the society
Surveillance technology can be defined as remote sensing technology that is to capture and transfer visual , sound , and spatial information from one place to another place far away .
Several examples are Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) , Satellite imaging , and Global Positioning System (GPS) .
The use of those equipments complementarily can be used to track people where ever they are  , not only in outdoors but also indoors or even beneath the ground in mining projects These great functions of surveillance technology can be implemented and give positive impacts in many aspects including economy , research , security , military , and civil society .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
Firstly , I want to focus on the impacts in economy aspect .
The application of surveillance technology such as RFID in commercial companies like oil Rig Company will increase the company's .
By using this technology , the worker can explore a wider range of exploitation zone which is considered "dangerousr" more safely since workers position can be monitored precisely .
Yahya Mehdizadeh in Digital Energy Journal September 2007 stated that "by implanting RFID chips within the person or within the gear of rig  , operators can validate that those persons are at the right place during important phases of production ."
Furthermore he also mentioned that RFID devices are no longer expensive .
The latest RFID tags are under $1 and the readers are $400 .
Secondly is regarding the implementation in security and military aspects .
"The most notable advantage of RFID chips is that they are visually undetectable" (Mehdizadeh , 2007) .
RFID chips can be implanted in  criminals and terrorists so that the authority can easily track their activity .
This is very helpful in tracing and revealing the roots of terrorism and reduces the level criminal cases .
Eventually , this technology gives  great advantages tothe society RFID chips can also be implanted in the soldier's body so that the commander will know his position if he is  kidnapped .
Lastly is the prominent impact on the civil society .
If RFID chip is implanted into all members of society , it will result in a  lot of  .
We can track missing peopleand  family members .
We also track and identify  lost casualties in airplane accidents and natural disasters quickly , effectively and efficiently  Some  may argue about the privacy matter of the use of this technology .
This can be assured by applying password , encrypter or decoder in the next generation of RFID devices .
It is just the same case with the use of bank account and ATM card pin which has been broadly trusted by all  bank customers .
Another issue concerning the medical safety aspect of implanting the chip in human body may state that RFID tags may cause electromagnetic interference which may interfere with electrosurgerical devices and defibrillators .
However , the American Medical Association report mentioned that it has not been determined whether RFID tags may affect the efficacy of pharmaceuticals .
Furthermore , this report also stated that RFID tags could promote the frequent access for the patient to their medical information and increase the continuity and coordination of care which  reduces many kinds of medical error like adverse drugs event .
In conclusion , 
First of all , there is insufficient control over the people who have access to  surveillance technology .
For example , anyone with a RFID sensor will be able to read and/or detect an individual who has the RFID tag implanted inside him (Sieberg , 2006) .
People with access to surveillance technology can use their access to find out sensitive information about others for immoral use .
Though some may argue that surveillance technology is important for national security , it can also cause a threat to national security .
This is due to the fact that anyone , including criminals and hackers , can gain access to the nation's confidential information , hence threatening the nation's livelihood .
Secondly , the use of surveillance technology invades our privacy .
According to BBC news , 2006 , there are 4 .2 million closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) on the streets of Britain , about one for every 14 citizens .
This means that there is close monitoring of every citizen's movements , hence , infringing their privacy .
Furthermore , privacy is one of the most fundamental human rights .
No one can interfere with one's privacy against their will () .
Surveillance technology will infringe our privacy .
Therefore , it should not be used to track people .
Not only will Surveillance technology invade our privacy , it might also cause individuals to develop health problems .
One of the surveillance technologies is RFID tags .
Research done on rodents , shows that there is an association between implanted RFID tags and tumors in rodents (Foster & Jaeger , 2008) .
This shows that there is a possibility that humans might also develop tumor if implants were placed in their body .
surveillance cameras might also cause psychological impacts , where individuals will have the thought that they are constantly being watched .
With all the possibilities of developing health problems , surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology will cause more harm than good .
S it should not be used to track people .
Individual's privacy might be infringed , information is easily accessible by anyone who has  access to the surveillance technology , and also there might be detrimental health impacts on the individual who is being tracked .
The use of RFID to track people should not be  .
Nowadays there is a fierce debate over the use human implant Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to track people .
Some people say that the use of RFID invades people's privacy; others maintain that the use of RFID can bring us a lot of benefits .
In my point of view , the use of RFID should not be banned for the following reasons .
Firstly , it is undeniable that RFID is very useful in our daily life .
RFID is more efficient and convenient in tracking early released criminals than other surveillance technology as it simplifies the locating process .
In addition , with this technology , parents can easily find their lost children and doctors can easily find elderly people who suffer from degenerative brain conditions  (Wood , 2006) .
Hence , it is not necessary to ban the use of RFID which can bring us so much convenience .
Secondly , we can take actions to minimize the negative effects of RFID such as the invasion of personal privacy .
Many people are afraid that personal information installed in the chip is vulnerable to be copied or changed by hackers .
This opinion stems from the general misunderstanding of the technology or  inaccurate hearsay .
RFID chips are not served as personal information storages; instead they are pointers which point to a highly secured back-end database in which the personal information resides .
As mentioned before , the database is highly  .
Thus it is very difficult for hackers to attack .
What is more , just like we have antivirus software to deal with computer virus , we will be able to prevent personal information from being hacked by coming up with corresponding approaches  (Banks , Hanny , Pachano , & Thompson , 2007) .
Another concern from some people is that with RFID , the government and some intelligent institutions will easily know where we are if we are implanted with RFID .
In my point of view , this worry can be handled by making corresponding laws to regulate the use of RFID .
For example , people themselves will have the right to decide whether to use RFID or not , and in this way their privacy will not be invaded .
What is more , it is also not practical to get everybody implanted with RFID , since it will cost a lot .
In today's world , surveillance technology has been deployed for various purposes .
One of the most debated uses of this technology is to monitor and track people via the surveillance camera and the RFID (radio-frequency identification) .
Critics have argued that this has inevitably denied the individuals their rights to privacy (Stanley and Steinhardt , 2003) ,  and thus RFID should  not be used to track people .
However , the benefits of surveillance should not be downplayed .
This essay shall elaborate on how surveillance technology will ensure one's safety and also on its contribution to the overall improvements in healthcare services for the population by monitoring them .
The security of a country and the safety of its citizens have always been the top priority of every government .
Memories of the terrorist attacks that happened  around the world will always serve as a stark reminder to everyone that a lapse in security will result in heavy casualties .
One of the ways to prevent these from happening is to make use of surveillance technology such as surveillance camera and the RFID .
Surveillance cameras installed at strategic areas will ensure that suspicious characters could be filtered out by the security personnel for checks while RFID tags on prisoners would ensure that they do not escape (Swedberg , 2005) and pose a danger to the public .
As one would remember , the escape of the terrorist Mas Selamat in Singapore had threatened the security of the city and the neighbouring countries .
Deployment of large number of troops to capture him was futile until he was arrested by the Malaysian police one year later .
If a RFID tag had been used , the terrorist would not have been  able to escape easily .
Although one may argue that terrorist attacks still occur even with the use of surveillance camera , one should also note that the recordings would enable the police to identify the terrorists after the attack and conduct a swift operation to arrest them  (Quek , 2008) before they could plan and carry out their next mission .
Besides that , having security cameras around would always serve as deterrence to potential criminals (Quek , 2008) .
Thus , surveillance technology should be deployed to monitor people , especially the terrorists .
In Singapore , hospital bed shortages have been a perennial problem for the government .
The high occupancy rate would mean that more healthcare professionals are needed to look after the patients .
In order to improve the overall efficiency of the medical team , Tan Tock Seng Hospital has rolled out RFID in 2007 to monitor more than 1 ,200 patients (Friedlos , 2009) .
The benefits of RFID includes locating the patients easily for tests and administering of medicine , and a lower response time of the housekeeping department in clearing the bed once a patient is discharged , which will then reduce an individual's waiting time for a bed (Friedlos , 2009) .
This surveillance technology has allowed the healthcare professionals to perform their jobs efficiently and improve the well-being of the patients .
Moreover , as the population continues to age , elderly who are not seriously ill might have to be discharged and nurse their injuries or illnesses at home or in a nursing home (Tan , 2007) .
In order not to compromise their health , RFID should be utilized to monitor them (Broache , 2007) .
This will not only ensure that they are being looked after by a dedicated healthcare team but it will also alleviate the problem of bed shortages .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be prohibited .
Critics have long been condemning the use of surveillance technology on humans .
Their disapproval for such technology has grown stronger over the years since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre on 11th September 2001 .
They believed that many countries have increased unnecessary surveillance on the pretext of monitoring the terrorists (Stanley and Steinhardt , 2003) .
This has caused the loss of individuals' privacy .
I must admit that erosion of rights to privacy has happened .
However , one must weigh the importance between privacy and security before denouncing the efforts by the governments on surveillance .
As mentioned in the previous paragraph , the surveillance camera could enable the police to identify the terrorists easily after the attack and arrest them .
A good example would be the apprehension of terrorists behind the London bombing with the help of surveillance technology (Quek , 2008) .
Hence , surveillance technology should not be ruled out completely .
Since the explosion of technology during the last few decades , there has been a new method to track people , which is surveillance technology .
However , whether using of this technology to track people is acceptable or not has always been a big concern .
People who think that surveillance technology should not be used to track people claim that it invades the privacy right of people .
However , surveillance technology , if  used appropriately , can benefit our life so much that it should not be banned .
Firstly , one undeniable advantage of surveillance technology is it might help us to protect people and their belongings .
Simple systems such as cameras or voice recording can be used to observe shopping malls , buildings and other public places .
It might help to maintain the security of those places as well as find out if there is any robber or thief , thus reducing the crime rate (The Economist print edition , 2008) .
Cameras are usually used in high security or restricted access workplaces to protect these places .
Moreover , police can also use surveillance technology to track potential criminals , for instance , to supervise a person who was imprisoned in the past for a short time to ensure that he will not commit a crime again .
Surveillance technology helps us much in following dangerous criminals such as gangsters or a mafia chief .
Although people who oppose the use of this technology may claim that it would be years before they can pick a terrorist out in a crowd (Yang , 2005) , some intelligent system can now learn the context in which behavior is probably threatening (The Economist print edition , 2008) .
Hence , we may easily filter the suspects and  concentrate on their acts to know if they are really criminals .
Furthermore , busy parents can use simple surveillance devices to keep an eye on their children .
A small tag or camera will give parents information about their children every period of  time; thus  they know that they are safe .
It also prevents children from being kidnapped or  injured in accidents because their parents would know immediately whenever they are in danger .
Hospitals may apply surveillance system to observe patients (Anonymous , 2004) .
Since doctors and nurses are not able to be with patients all the time , cameras and other surveillance devices will record their condition and alert hospital staff when it become worse .
Obviously , the feeling of being tracked will make people feel uncomfortable but the our safety is more precious .
For instance , if you get lost or have a serious accident and you can not call for help , your friends and family would not find you quickly if they do not know your place .
In this situation , surveillance technology is needed , as GPS has been used for years to find lost people .
Furthermore , new surveillance devices are very sophisticated that users will not feel that they are followed .
Thirdly , the use of surveillance technology can make our life more convenient .
Tags and chips implanted in human's body can be used as smart identity cards .
When a person gets off a plane , he goes through a special door , and then the custom-house officer will know all the necessary information on him immediately .
This will save our time as we do not have to spend hours waiting to check-in or check-out .
In some cities , combinations of biometrics and surveillance for access control or checking time and attendance have been used recently (Yang , 2005) .
It is not only used for the purpose of security but for the convenience of residents since they do not have to use keys or worry about thieves .
However , there is a concern that implant chips can hurt people and lead to some unexpected consequences .
Actually , not all types of surveillance use this method since we can use cards , cameras and other modern devices instead .
In case we have to use implant chips , it will be designed and made carefully that it will not hurt the users .
Another worry in the use of this technology is that  whenever a hacker can get into the system , users are threatened as their personal information can be revealed (Zetter , 2009) .
However , systems are made to be able to prevent hackers as well as store the information safely .
The privacy of tracked people will be maintained as long as possible .
In conclusion , surveillance technology benefits our life in many ways that we should not ban it .
Though the consequence that people will be tracked seems unacceptable , the safety and convenience in life for humans is more important .
As long as we use it appropriately , surveillance technology will not have bad influences in our life but make it better .
Nowadays , surveillance technology is growing at a rapid speed and surveillance equipments can be found in many common places such as supermarkets , schools and airport terminal .
Surveillance technology is actually used to monitor and keep track of an individual's activities , behavior and data .
People are actually being observed from a distance by  surveillance technology equipment such as CCTV cameras and GPS tracking devices or being tracked by  means of microchip or  an RFID device which using radio waves .
It has been proven that surveillance technology can be beneficial to mankind in terms of deterring crime and terrorism , monitoring employees and improving patient's welfare .
Thus , surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be banned .
First of all , surveillance technology should be used as it helps in eradicate crime and to identify the faces of a terrorist from  miles away .
This surveillance technology equipment is installed in buses , common places or schools and with the constant video monitoring , detailed evidence of any suspicious movement or criminal activity can be assessed .
Moreover , an individual is less likely to commit a crime if he knows that he is being watched .
If potential criminals are aware  of this fact ,there is a high possibility that crime can be greatly deterred .
In addition , this surveillance technology protects a country's safety and security from terrorist attacks .
For instance ," as a direct result of the September 11 terrorist attacks , United States government and law enforcement officials have implemented surveillance technologies to deter future terrorist attacks(Jim , 2009) .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be used since it puts criminals and terrorists away and protects the society .
Furthermore , employees in work places can be monitored by means of surveillance technology and it has many advantages .
Implementing this technology properly can help improve security in work places .
Examples of devices that are used are entrance and exit cameras , internal and outdoor cameras and cash register and counter cameras (Bill , 2006) .
The presence of surveillance cameras can prevent theft in the company because employees are less likely to steal company products as they fully aware that they are being watched by unblinking cameras which can provide evidence .
However , opponents of surveillance technology argue that it invades an individual's privacy .
They do not realize that with a clear understanding of where and how security cameras can be installed , potential privacy intrusion can be avoided (Lynn , 2006) .
Hence , surveillance tools must be used in every work place to improve the security  as well as the employee's good behavior .
Last but not least , surveillance technology also helps in improving the welfare of both patients and the elderly people .
A small electronic device such as a microchip is incorporated into a patient's body in order to track them by using radio waves .
This kind of procedure is essential for Alzheimer's patients because they have very poor memory and maybe forget the way back if they  go somewhere .
Hence , RFID really plays an important role here to track the Alzheimer's patients .
In addition , the microchips are also applied  to patients so that doctor can monitor their health condition such as heart  rate , blood pressure and glucose level in blood .
I must admit that , opponents of this position argue that microchip incorporated in a human's body can affect the system later on .
It is because our  cells can only identify our own cells and they identify the microchip as the foreign cell and eventually immune systems will act against the microchip .
However , there is no concrete prove about the above argument scientifically till now .
Therefore , this RFID should not banned as it reduces risk of getting sick and saves life .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people since it helps in deterring crime and terrorism , monitoring employees and improving welfare of patients .
If surveillance technology is banned , safety of the society and the country's security will be under a big threat .
Criminals and terrorists tend to commit more crimes since they are not being watched and there is no concrete evidence to put them behind the bars .
Thus , to ensure our continued freedom , surveillance technology must be commonly used  .
The past few decades have seen the improvement in technology by leaps and bounds , and one key area  which we have benefitted from is the use of surveillance technology .
It is a tool which is not only used to monitor a person or a group's behavior , but it also has the ability to track the locations of people and identify them .
Some may express their concern on the use of surveillance technology regarding privacy and security issues and argue that it should therefore be banned .
However , it would be too extreme to impose such a ban , as by doing so , we are throwing the baby out with the bath water .
The use of this technology should not be totally banned but more regulations should be imposed and more should be invested in enhancing the security of this technology .
This is because surveillance technology will help in crime prevention , improve medical healthcare and also identify a person via biometrics .
With the help of surveillance technology , crime rate can be reduced and prevented .
For instance , the installment of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) in the multi-storey parking lots of a building will enable the security guards to monitor the situation and to pick up on suspicious behavior .
Hence , the officers on duty can take immediate action to prevent a crime from happening .
Detractors from my point of view will argue that too much money has been pumped in to the installation of CCTV and doubt the effectiveness of it (Privacy International , 1997) .
However , in a recent study conducted in Hartlepool , United Kingdom , it was shown that crime rate has reduced by 26% from 2004-2007 after installing CCTV at certain areas (SaferHartlepool , 2009) .
Thus , surveillance technology can enhance security and therefore should not be banned .
Another reason this technology should not be banned is the improvement it will bring about in the healthcare sector .
For instance , it can be used to monitor and locate patients in the hospital .
The movement of patients can be tracked and signal will be sent out in an emergency (Kanellos , 2004) .
Thus , prompt action can be taken to prevent undesirable events from happening .
Some may argue that implanting RFID chips may cause physical side effects .
However , according to Applied Digital , a leading provider of identification and security technology , an estimated 1000 chips had been implanted in humans with no harmful physical side effects (Kanellos , 2004) .
Thus , the use of RFID can benefit us in the healthcare sector by bringing about assurance in knowing that patients are well tracked and monitored .
Biometrics is used to identify a person based on his physical or behavioral traits .
This can be done by analyzing finger prints , recognizing facial features and scanning of the iris .
Hence , biometrics which is part of surveillance technology can be used for authentication purposes (Smith , 2009) as for instance , the biometric passport which can be used to prevent identity theft  and also to conduct automatic immigration clearances .
Critics of this objection claim that our security will be at risk as the embedded secret codes can be cloned and thus allow the hackers to enter the country illegally .
While it is true that such an event may occur ,  with the advancement of technology and tighter regulations , this problem can be rectified .
Therefore , the use of biometrics passport will not only increase efficiency but also enhance security at the same time .
All in all , surveillance technology can help to improve the welfare of society by offering a tool for crime prevention , improving the healthcare system and also identifying of a person .
Hence , with the myriad advantages it can bring us , surveillance technology should not be banned .
Surveillance technology can be a form of deterrence for potential criminals , or as a form of evidence when a crime is committed .
Drivers will be more conscious of their speed limits when speed cameras are around; shoplifters will think twice before committing a theft when there are various security cameras in the shopping mall .
This has always been the primary means of crime deterrence to maintain a safe and secure society .
When deterrence failed , surveillance cameras would have captured the crime process , thus providing undeniable evidence that could be used to identify and convict the offender (Long , 2008) .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track people as it is not only a way to deter crimes , but also to ensure justice .
Some might argue that using surveillance cameras to record evidence is already in itself proving that the "presence of cameras had absolutely zero deterrence value" (Long , 2008) as the criminal still commits the crime even with the knowledge of being watched .
However , we have to understand that there is no certainty in deterrence .
In fact , crime rates would probably be much higher if there are totally no surveillance cameras around .
There are others who feel that there is an invasion of privacy when there is unquestioned tracking of people .
Individuals seem to have lost the right to decide whether they want to be monitored .
Phone calls could be tapped; and even along the common streets of Orchard Road , there are surveillance cameras lurking around .
There seems be a loss of personal space for individuals .
Furthermore , identity theft has been proven to occur easily for RFID technology (Expanding RFID Use Raises Privacy Concerns , 2009) where the signals can be read at a distance away from the subject , without proper consent .
Even with further encryption , security has been proven to be easily overcome .
Thus , sensitive information of individuals could be lost unknowingly , and the idea of 'personal space' is slowly becoming obscure .
Surveillance technologies have become increasing popular in recent years .
Types of surveillance technologies include Cameras (CCTV) , Face- Recognition , Biometrics , RFID (radio-frequency identification) and even Cookies in web browsers (Jeffrey A , 2009) .
There is no denying that surveillance technologies that are extremely useful with wide ranges of uses from monitoring traffic to the detection and prevention of crime (Jeffrey A , 2009) .
However , the use of surveillance technologies to track people without prior consent will deny the person of privacy which he or she is entitled to .
Therefore surveillance technology should not be used to track people useless with prior permission .
Examples on how tracking people can compromise privacy can be drawn from the surveillance technology , RFID .
One of the most common uses of RFID is for inventory management .
Positive uses of RFID in inventory management include tracking items with toxic substances , tracking manufactured products through the supply chain and tracking pharmaceuticals to point of sale to ensure proper handling through the supply chain (Alan RP , 2005) .
However , the main concern is when the product reaches the consumer .
There are three possible situations where privacy could be compromised , which are the pre-sale stage , during the sales transaction and post-sale stage .
In the pre-sale stage , when a RFID tagged item is examined by a customer , the store can monitor customers' actions .
Profiling and monitoring can then be used to track individuals and their choice of products (Alan RP , 2005) .
Although this may just be the store trying to use of RFID systems to try to increase sales , it violates the personal privacy of the customer (Alan RP , 2005) .
One example would be the company Prada , which uses RFID systems in dressing rooms to suggest accessories (Alan RP , 2005) . 
When the sales transaction takes place , the store can permanently store all personal information about the customer , including credit cards and telephone numbers and associate it with the specific item (Alan RP , 2005) .
This information could then be used for many purposes like marketing activities and personal profiling based on past purchases (Alan RP , 2005) . 
Post-sales monitoring using RFID also poses a threat to privacy .
The RFID tags used remain attached on items even after they are purchased , which could subsequently be read when they encounter an RFID transceiver anywhere (Alan RP , 2005) .
With the information , it is possible to identify the person as well as personal information such as shopping records and credit history (Alan RP , 2005) .
Invasive custom marketing activities could be developed through reading of tagged items and in the worst case scenario , individual movements could be tracked by just being in possession of the items (Alan RP , 2005) . 
However , it does not mean that the use of RFID for tracking people will compromise privacy .
There is currently a program called NEXUS which allows U .S . and Canadian citizens to register their fingerprints , photo , and other personal data and , if approved , receive a card with an RFID tag (Alan RP , 2005) .
When individuals wish to travel between the U .S . and Canada , the RFID tag allows them to be cleared though inspection in less than five seconds (Alan RP , 2005) .
Not only is it convenient , because the individual already gave prior permission , but it is also not considered to be a breach of privacy .
There are three main aspects in which RFID will benefit human beings .
Firstly , it will contribute to ensuring the security of society , like "airport security , airline security and cruise ship security" (Greene , 2004) .
It is because RFID is able to efficiently detect terrorists and criminals who hide drugs in their bodies , all objects made ofmetal , all explosive devices and so on .
In this way , the  public's  benefits are protected as much as possible .
Besides , in school , RFID can assist officers in checking people who enter and leave school so that they are capable of taking students' attendance and ensuring no unauthorized people come in simultaneously .
Hence , RFID makes great contribution to our society .
The second advantage of RFID is that it may save operation costs and gain more profits for companies .
For example , analysts from Sanford C . Bernstein (Radio Frequency Identification Technology , n .d .) say that the world's biggest retailer , Wal-Mart , saves as much as 8 .35 billion dollars per year by applying RFID in its physical counts of inventory .
It is because RFID helps to reduce Wal-Mart's operation period overwhelmingly .
It takes only five minutes to finish the job which human beings need more than one day to do .
Therefore , RFID is a good assistant for companies , as well as our society .
However , those who disagree with the use of RFID express their concerns about the illicit tracking of RFID tags (Radio-Frequency Identification , 2008) .
Admittedly , such actions may result in the abuse of tracking people and products by some hackers or criminals for bad purposes .
Nevertheless , the advantages of surveillance technology still outweigh its side effects .
For instance , it can help police to find missing people and pets; to trace phone calls and locate the places of potential criminals; and to secure the safety of each country by applying it for the passports and airports in order to prevent stowaways and criminals from both coming in and going out (Radio-Frequency Identification , 2008) .
Moreover , if the government enhances the degree of secrecy of the surveillance technology , these people with evil thoughts may have a hard time to approach it .
As a result , the abuse of surveillance technology may not be a big issue .
In conclusion , the surveillance technology , RFID , should not be banned as it is able to benefit our society significantly , not only on the economic aspect , but also the human beings' security .
Therefore , surveillance , such as RFID , should be used in people's daily life .
RFID is an advanced technology using electrical objects implanting on products , animals , and even human for the purpose of surveillance through radio waves .
It has been applied widely to many areas: passport , transport payments , animal surveillance , product tracking in companies , and even human tracking .
However , the aspects of human surveillance are always controversial topics for many years .
People argue that the use of RFID for tracking people should be banned , and in my perspective , I totally agree with that statement .
The first obvious reason for banning the use of RFID to track people is the privacy .
Since human is different from animals , as well as unemotional objects , they have some basic human rights .
The most important right is the right for keeping some privacy .
The use of RFID is effective for animal tracking , but it "seems to cross a line when technology that's used for inventory management or keeping track of pets is then placed in human beings" (Sieberg ,2006) .
When using RFID for surveillance for finding criminals , for instance , the official authorities you have to look at lots of sensitive and even intimate information .
The individual , aware or not aware of this use , will have his serious loss of privacy .
The second reason is the degree of security of using RFID for tracking people .
Although in a government system , the information obtained from RFID is kept , there is still a chance for hackers to read the card information and exploit the human's medical status or steal the personal identities , for example .
Through this , the hackers can assault the individual's life , or more seriously , exploit that information to assault the government and military systems .
This places our society in extreme danger .
Finally , though some may argue that RFID is a scientific progress , and we should not hinder it , the use of RFID on human may make RFID a useless , or even dangerous , technology .
Let us remind ourselves of inventing nuclear weapons and creating wars everywhere .
Is that a real scientific progress ?
In conclusion , I advocate the ban of RFID to track people .
Using RFID is like a double knife .
It is advantageous , but we should not go too far , or it will kill us .
The word 'Surveillance' originally came from France where it means 'to watch over' in French .
Surveillance technology has a history dated back as early as 1965 , where the first closed circuit television (CCTV) was used in the police force in the United States in public places (Roberts , 2005) .
The definition of surveillance technology is the ongoing monitoring of people or information to detect changes in trends or distribution to initiate investigative or control measures (The Joint Comission , 2006) .
The two most common and effective types of surveillance today is the global positioning system (GPS) and the radio frequency identification (RFID) .
The benefits of surveillance technology conspicuously outweigh the concerns about human privacy issues that are so often brought up by human rights bodies and the law (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
This is because this intelligent technology aids in crime prevention , social control and threat monitoring .
Surveillance technology helps prevent crime .
The presentation of crime across the media for the past 30 years via television news , drama series , reality televisions , etc . , has indicated that crime is a feature of modern life , and the government cannot protect the public by itself (Knepper , Doak , & Shapland , 2009) .
It is therefore important to allow surveillance technology to work hand-in-hand with the police force to overcome criminal puzzles without the redundant concerns over human privacy .
For example , GPS 24/7 continuous real-time tracking of an individual individual , and is considered several times more powerful than the traditional visual surveillance often exercised by the police force (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
According to FOXNews .com on the 21st Of May , 2006 , the authorities can now track dangerous sex offenders with GPS without keeping them in prison at the taxpayers expenses , even after serving their time .
In 1999 , the murder case of Valiree by William 'Brad' Jackson was solved with concrete evidence when the police force obtained a warrant to install a GPS transmitter on his truck and successfully tracked his movement to certain places which led to the discovery of the victim's body .
While there are opponents raising the issue of invasion of privacy towards an individual and also the trustworthiness of the law enforcement personnel to act appropriately , justification can be done by the effectiveness of surveillance technology in bringing justice (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
It would be absurd to compromise the credibility of tracking and bringing a criminal case into light just to preserve the basic individual right to privacy .
Furthermore , surveillance technology can assist in monitoring potential threats .
In a more specific context , monitoring is crucial to suppress transnational crime .
Strict measures have been taken to detect and anticipate any potential terrorist attack .
Since the 9/11 incident , the United States has been keen to negotiate treaties with foreign countries on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA): a body which ensures individuals cannot evade prosecution simply because the evidence of prosecution is located abroad (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
With the speed and accuracy of GPS to track any suspects related to terrorism and crime , it is crucial to identify any formidable plans or plots before disaster strikes , something which could save lives and properties .
So what are the moral and ethical issues behind surveillance practice ?
We cannot estimate the power of data accessibility , and this greatly challenges the established basic individual right to privacy .
The balance between personal privacy and national security lies on a fine line (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
However , the importance of the latter often outweighs the sacrifice of individual interest , with conditions that surveillance is done within the expectations of the people .
For instance , a person should not expect full privacy in public places such as the streets or a shopping place .
In conclusion , surveillance technology to track people should not be banned due to the benefits it bestows: such as the prevention of crime , detection of danger , as well as the monitoring social behavior .
With every advent of technology , there are always cons trailing the pros that it brings .
We should seek credible solutions for issues which arise instead of prohibiting an intelligent invention of mankind .
Intelligence can never be confined; banning can therefore never stop intelligence .
Over the years , surveillance technology has advanced drastically and it has slowly integrated into our daily life where video cameras can be commonly seen monitoring us in shopping centre's , workplaces and residential areas .
The monitoring of one's movements and activities has been introduced to ensure our safety and prevent crimes .
However it has also raised concerns that we are being monitored just like criminals .
Thus , it violates one's privacy and hinders one's freedom .
This also indicates a loss in mutual trust within individuals .
In addition , surveillance technology that appears beneficial in protecting our safety actually has limitations in crime detection and prevention .
Therefore , since the disadvantages of surveillance technology outweigh its benefits , it should not be used to track people .
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology threatens our human right to privacy .
Surveillance technology allow others to monitor our daily activities and record these data in the form of CCTV (closed-circuit television) images , communication records and content enabling them to have access to our personal information .
(Ball , K . , Lyonet al 2006) .
This information can be misused by individuals with ill intention , using it to manipulate it for their own benefit .
In addition , according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 12 , it states that "no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence" (United Nations , 2009) .
Thus , since surveillance technology infringes on our privacy , it should not be used to track people .
Secondly , surveillance technology breaks social relationship and family bonds due to the loss of trust .
For instance , some employers would install surveillance monitors in their workplaces to track the activities of their employee (Ball , K .  et al .
2006) .
This would subject the employees to constant fear of committing mistakes if they are aware that they are being monitored , it could diminish their moral which in return affect their productivity and efficiency at work .
Furthermore , parents would resort to using webcams and GPS systems to check on their children' activities (Ball , K .  et al .
2006) instead of trying to communicate with their children to understand the friends they mix with and to find out their whereabouts .
This monitoring action causes a loss of mutual trust between the parent and child which is a foundation to build a strong family bond .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it creates suspicion between individuals causing the loss of trust .
(Ball , K . & et al .
2006) .
Lastly , surveillance technology such as RFID (implantable radiofrequency identification technology) poses potential health hazards to individuals RFID in the form of Verichip is used for patient identification to provide  healthcare providers with efficient access to patient's medical history and contact information .
(Foster , K . , & Jaeger , J .
2008) .
However , since there is a limited number of RFID human implantations performed , there is insufficient data about the possible side effects related to it , recent tests indicate that there are potential health hazards such as cancer , adverse tissue reaction , magnetic resonance imaging incompatibility and infections that could affect the old and feeble individuals .
(Foster , K . , & Jaeger , J .
2008) .
Hence , since there are many adverse health effects of RFID that is still not known thus the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as the implantation of Verichip in patients bring more harm than benefits .
On the other hand , supporters of surveillance technology state that surveillance technology plays an important role in crime detection and prevention thus maintaining the country's security and prevents terrorist attacks .
However , in reality surveillance technology is inefficient in crime detection and prevention providing minimal protection for us .
Surveillance technology usually only focuses on tracking down criminals after the crime was committed and the damage was done .
For instance , a Metropolitan Police report stated that only one crime was solved by the 1000 CCTV cameras placed across London revealing that CCTV has minimum effectiveness but contributes to massive expenses .
(BBC News , 2009) .
Hence , since surveillance technology is ineffective in crime detection and prevention , it should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , it is evident that the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it not only threatens one's privacy inhibiting them from exercising freedom but the use of surveillance technology also poses unknown potential health hazards to individuals .
In addition , it creates suspicion in individuals causing them to lose mutual trust for one another resulting in breaking of social relationship and family bonds .
Nevertheless , surveillance technology has limited efficiency in crime prevention hence it should not be used to track people since it fails to protect us .
Surveillance technology refers to the use of technology to monitor the behaviors or actions of people , usually in a surreptitious way .
Our most familiar types of such technology include cameras , computers , biometric or aerial surveillances .
As technology progresses , the rate of use of radio- frequency identification (RFID) , which is the use of a tag applied to livestock or people for the purpose of tracking or identification , has skyrocketed in many areas , ranging from government , hospitals to schools .
As an unavoidable consequence , it raises ethical issues , which states that such penetrating technology has invaded people's privacy because more and more personal habits and behaviors are monitored without permission .
However , I think that the use of such technology could be justified if the benefits it brings to the public outweigh the harms it brings to the individual .
It has been demonstrated in hospitals , crimes and workplace .
Hence , the surveillance technology such as RFID should be used .
Firstly , the surveillance technology can be used in hospitals to monitor movements of its patients in case of an emergency .
In conjunction with a video surveillance system to cover different regions of the hospital , it can track the patients' movements any time at any corner of the hospital .
When the subject enters a restricted area or has an emergency , the hospital can immediately know the whereabouts of the subject .
For example , in 2003 , a scenario of applying an RFID based tracking system during the SARS outbreak was demonstrated in two Singapore hospitals .
During the trial , the movement of people in the hospitals can be recorded (Adi T , September 2006) .
Thus , in this case , it is undisputable that the surveillance technology should be used to track people .
Secondly , RFID should be used in tracking criminals so as to prevent crimes and enhance security .
When one commits a crime , the policemen can track one's movement and locate one's whereabouts or extract one's information or past history .
Also , the use of RFID tags in identification of stolen property , in the case of Lowjack system has already demonstrated effective in this regard .
((Christiana .J .
et al , 2007)) Furthermore , in New York , RFID is also being used in schools .
According to information released by the Federal Bureau of Justice and Statistics in late November , the crime rate such as school fights and percentage of students bringing weapons to school had indeed fallen since 1990 .
Hence , we can say that the surveillance technology in tracking people or products should be used .
The most controversial issue about the use of surveillance technology would be the ethical issue regarding people's privacy , which is strongly demonstrated in workplace privacy .
RFIDs in the workplace are attached to employees' identification cards or clothes so that the employer can track their movements any time .
For instance , RFID tags are placed in 80 ,000 employee uniforms at the Star City Casino in Sydney Australia (Gruber , J .) .
Some people say that the installation of such technology reduces the employees to robots , depriving them of their individuality to only-working-machines so as to achieve maximum productivity .
The employers monitor every movement of the employees during the break or even after hours .
This has intruded employees' privacy and thus should not be used .
In conclusion , I think the surveillance technology should be used as its benefits outweigh its harm .
It is useful in tracking patients in hospitals , criminals after they committed crimes and employees in the workplace .
The individual privacy should be put aside when the benefit tothe public plays a more important role .
Surveillance technology such as RFID(radio-frequency identification) , GPS(Global Positioning System) and security cameras are used to monitor the action of the public .
After the September 11 attack , the use of such technology has become more prevalent so as to increase the security level (Vedo Soft 2006) .
It is also used to monitor those who require special attention such as Alzheimer's patients to ensure that they receive appropriate and quick medication during emergency .
Thus , on the whole whole , its advantages clearly outweigh its disadvantages such as an individuals privacy .
Hence , it should be used appropriately to track people .
Firstly , using surveillance technology for crime prevention is far more important than individual privacy .
The presence of security cameras in public places helps to reduce crime rates as criminals fear that their actions will be recorded .
This will make the public feel safer .
According to park officials of Balboa park in San Diego , California , nine months after the installation of a surveillance system , the crime rates have reduced in all aspects and more people visit the park as they feel more secure (Nieto 1997) .
In Singapore , the Safety and Security Watch Group (SSWG) Scheme was introduced in 2006 so that the business community will be more prepared to fight crime and terrorism threats effectively(Singapore Police Force 2006) .
One of the common methods to ensure this is by surveillance technology and this has significantly helped Singapore to be one of the countries with the lowest crime rates .
Secondly , surveillance technology has been proven to be effective for social control as it helps to monitor those who need special attention such as Alzheimer's patients .
Mary Barnes , the president of Alzheimer's Community Care , believes that RFID chip implanted in Alzheimer's patients allow medical facilities and information to be quickly and easily accessible for them (Richford 2007) .
Together with GPS , it is also able to track their location and detect if they are in danger .
This can also be used for other patients that requires special attention like heart and lung disease especially when it involves children and older generation .
This is useful as the caretaker may not be able to attend these patients 24 hours a day .
Thus , RFID help to ease their work but increase the efficiency simultaneously .
One may argue that the RFID chips might have side-effects on the patient's health .
It has been said that the RFID might lead to cancer .
However , there is no strong scientific evidence to show that it is harmful to the patient's health .
According to a TIME magazine article written by Morrissey , a study conducted in 2006 showed that 4% of the 1 ,260 mice implanted with RFID developed tumors .
However , none of them were malignant .
In addition , Dr McGill said "Even if you put in a bland piece of plastic , it will produce tumors in rats and mice ,"(Morrissey 2007) .
Furthermore , the RFID tag has been approved by the U .S . Food and Drug Association(Richford 2007) .
"Should the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people  be banned ?"
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has advanced from industrial and animal tagging applications to being able to track people's movements ) .
This technology has brought about privacy and security issues (Kanellos , 2004; Masters & Michael , 2006) .
However , the benefits of RFID outweigh these issues .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID enhances personnel management .
Efficient employee monitoring can be accomplished by tagging employees with RFID tags and installing readers within building premises .
Some companies have made it compulsory for their staff to wear RFID tags to facilitate personnel identification and access control (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
RFID critics argue that the start-up cost for a fully operational RFID system is high .
Companies have to purchase tags (US $0 .20 - $50 each) , readers (UHF reader: US $500 - $3 ,000) , middleware (may be US $183 ,000) , upgrade system networks and pay installation fees (RFID Journal , 2005) .
However , companies will reap benefits in the long run .
Also , costs will come down as technology improves (RFID Journal , 2005) .
Thus , RFID can be used to improve management .
Secondly , RFID helps to reduce and solve crimes .
RFID can be used to monitor people who may pose a threat to society .
Knowing that they are being spied on , they will have a lesser tendency to commit crimes .
Prison violence was reduced by up to 60% in some United States prisons that had RFID installed (Kanellos , 2004) .
Furthermore , data retrieved from RFID readers can serve as evidence against suspects to solve crimes (Kanellos , 2004) .
Opponents of RFID technology argue that implanted RFID tags cause cancer .
Implanted RFID tags were observed to cause tumours in laboratory animals (Albrecht , 2007) .
This concern is not necessary , because external tags can be used .
Overall , RFID is effective and beneficial in reducing and solving crimes .
Thirdly , RFID allows optimal patient care and safety in hospitals .
Tracking of medical professionals allows them to receive notification immediately when a patient needs help .
Tracking of patients ensures patient's safety by noticing if the patient is at the right place at the right time .
For example , in the United States , South Tyneside District Hospital tagged newborns with RFID tags , and hid RFID readers at exit points (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Unauthorized removal of a baby would trigger the alarm thus enhancing baby safety (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Currently , Tan Tock Seng Hospital is using ThermoSensors , a new RFID tag which is capable of patient location tracking and body temperature monitoring (Friedlos , 2009) .
This has enhanced patient care as nurses have more time for other patients and are notified immediately when  patient has  fever (Friedlos , 2009) .
Unfortunately , there are several security and privacy concerns .
But , these concerns can be addressed by giving individuals the choice of using RFID technology and freedom to remove tags when desired (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Hence , RFID should be used to enhance patient care and safety .
During  recent years there has been an increase uptake of  surveillance technology .
This kind of technology usually refers to the monitoring of behavior , activities , or other changing information of people and often in a surreptitious manner .
(Wikipedia , 2009) .
The current technology has made it possible for the surveillance system to be used in our daily lives , such as electronic payment , supply chain management , and livestock .
(Postnote , 2004) .
But there are also some moral and ethical issues surrounding this technology , like whether this kind of technology such as RFID (radio frequency ID) should be used to track people .
Some argue that the tracking should be banned for it may cause serious outcomes related to the violation of privacy .
But I do not think it is reasonable to forgo this advanced technology for it really plays a great role in the areas related to healthcare and government , and the potential negative impacts brought by it can be reduced or avoided if the regulations around it tend to be sounder  .
I will further elaborate on my stand based on the above two aspects .
First , surveillance is very useful to  hospitals and governments .
As healthcare centers , hospitals need to undertake a heavy task in dealing with diseases and maintaining a high level of security .
"In order to do this they need to protect and treat the patients in a way that will not be detrimental and hopefully will improve their state of health .
New surveillance technology can assist by reducing the delay in treating a patient , reducing errors in treatment , locating vital equipment and medical staff in a timely manner , tracking samples , test results and the patients themselves (Collins , 2004) . . And hospitals use it for mainly three core purposes: treatment , administration and security .
(Sue kennedy , 2006) .
And all of them are of vital importance to the welfare of both the patients and the hospitals .
On the other hand , surveillance tends to be more and more important in helping the government and law enforcement to maintain social control .
(Wikipedia ,2009) .
For example , it equips the government with an unprecedented ability to detect the potential criminal activities .
To a great extent , it contributes a lot to the stability of the whole society while only violating the privacy of the criminals .
So , at this point , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned .
Second , the problems as regards to the privacy brought by the technology could be reduced or even avoided when the regulations around it tends to be more and more perfect .
In fact , many great inventions and breakthroughs in  human history have got positive and negative aspects , such as the automobiles which have brought great convenience to people while causing large damage to the environment by emitting pollutant gases .
And we just cannot stop using the automobiles .
The only thing we can do is to improve their efficiency and seek new and green power supplies for them to make them as environmentally-friendly as possible .
As with the surveillance technology , we have to adopt it while making a great effort to establish a complete and reasonable set of principles surrounding it to make it more acceptable .
We just cannot stop having food even though we are afraid of choking .
In conclusion , surveillance technology has brought great benefits to our life and is accounting more and more in the hospital and government related areas .
And we should try our best to eliminate its negative effects on the privacy field instead of banning its use to tracking people .
The last two decades have witnessed drastic developments in material science and digital processing technology , which have made Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) , an advanced surveillance technology that has been applied in the business and tracking world .
This controversial issue aroused wide concern from society ,  .
While some hold that it intrudes people's privacy intensely , it in fact protects people in certain fields and makes life easier .
Thus , due to the advantages of RFID technology , it should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID can help to protect special groups of people .
For instance ,  it can be implanted in the elderly  who are suffering from degenerative diseases .
(Surveillance Studies Network , 2006) Since it is so dangerous for elderly people with dementia to get lost , carrying a RFID chip enables their families to locate them .
Thus , it not only eliminates danger for those elderly people , but also reduces the worry and effort for their families .
Moreover , for some construction projects with high fatality rates , obviously we need more accurate and reliable technology to protect workers during the programs .
RFID enables us to provide an accurate position of every worker who carries its tag .
Hence , it allows workers to be rescued quickly and reliably in case of an emergency .
This high-tech system was used in the second Gotthard tunnel program and other company's like Kronos Titan , Leverkusen (Germany)in the chemical sector for production of hazardous materials .
(Hansen & Gilbert , 2008)
Secondly , RFID is an efficient and reliable surveillance tool to watch people who carry underlying threat .
For the prisoners in custody , it is necessary to watch and track them in case of adding crime .
(Surveillance Studies Network , 2006) Meanwhile , using RFID to keep watching those employees working in high-security areas confers benefits that are clear and compelling .
Hence , it is so necessary and sufficient for us to apply RFID technology to such areas .
Some of the issues raised by concerned groups stem from either misunderstanding of the technology and its capabilities or by simple inaccurate facts .
Both of these is evidence that the RFID community has done a poor job at conveying to the public , in an accurate understandable form , what technology is and its capabilities .
Education will be a key component in the acceptability , progress and evolution of RFID technology .
Meanwhile , some believe that it should be banned since it intrudes upon privacy .
Apparently , such surveillance technology should be strictly restricted for its potential disadvantages .
However , it should not be banned .
We will lose all its advantages and benefits once such a technology is banned , which will lead to more casualties and threats to society .
Furthermore , science and technology development in such areas will be barred once we ban it , which affects human society and civilization further .
In conclusion , RFID as a surveillance technology should not be banned as it protects special groups of people and helps to watch people who are a potential threat to our society .
Socially , surveillance technology is used to track people .
Radio frequency identification (RFID) chips and tags are used to track people .
It is a boon for parents looking for their children amidst a large crowd , like in an amusement park (Fortune magazine , 2004) .
Employers can also track the location of their employees to ensure that they are safe , especially at hazardous worksites (Intelleflex Corporation , 2009) using RFID badges .
Another way would be to implant RFID chips under their skin .
Citywatcher .com , a surveillance company , is one of those companies to have RFID chips implanted in their employees' arms (Gruber , n .d .) for safety measure .
However , RFID chips implanted under the skin are difficult to remove as they could migrate under the skin (American Medical Association , 2008) and not all employees want to be implanted with these chips .
This however is not a problem as many states have banned employers from forcing employees to receive a RFID implant (Jones , 2007) .
Therefore , surveillance technology should not be banned since there are counter-measures in place and less invasive methods like the RFID tags available .
Another sector using surveillance technology to track people would be the medical field .
Maternity wards in hospitals ensure that babies are not swapped accidentally with the help of RFID tags (Fortune magazine , 2004) .
Patients are also given RFID tags to wear so that should they  collapse , aid can be given to them immediately (Kanellos , 2004) .
RFID tags are also used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's disease according to Kanellos (2004) to prevent them from getting lost .
The RFID tags are broken once patients are discharged so the bed can be prepared for new patients so waiting time would be reduced .
Consequently , if nurses did not break the tag , disorder might result since the bed is no longer occupied but the housekeeping team is not informed .
Surgeries can also proceed smoothly and timely as both staff and patients can be tracked since they are wearing the tags .
This clearly shows that surveillance technology brings about many benefits so it should not be banned .
Surveillance technology is essential in the military sector to track enemies and to search and rescue soldiers .
Technology like the Global positioning system (GPS) is used to track enemies from the air (Gately , 2009) , while the artesian radar and SPY-1 radar is used to monitor the sea (Evans , 2008) .
All these technologies are to deter and detect enemies so countries are not caught unawares should enemies invade .
However , these systems are not without flaws as it was reported that Korean Air Lines Flight 007 strayed and was shot down in a Soviet no-fly zone (Gately , 2009) .
To address this issue , civilians are now able to use the GPS to ensure that they do no stray into these zones although usage is limited (Gately , 2009) .
Downed pilots are also located and rescued efficiently .
U .S . Air Force pilot , Captain Scott O'Grady was rescued within hours with the help of the GPS (LANDAIRSEA , 2009) .
Hence , these technologies should not be banned as it efficiently locates enemies , saves lives and at the same time ensures that civilians are not harmed by the new regulations .
Firstly , surveillance technology can be used for security and deterrent to prevent crimes .
The concept of human tagging has been widely accepted , but one has to take note of its purpose .
Applied Digital Solution produced sub-dermal RFID tags in late 90s and it has found many applications nowadays .
For those regions where kidnapping are more prevalent such as Mexico , children tagging can actually help their parent identify them after many years or it can serve as a means to deter kidnapping because parents can locate their children using gadgets (Wired , February 2000) .
However , some may say that it brings back the nightmare of the images of George Orwell's novel with human tagging as RFID takes away the privacy of the person being monitored , but RFID is not being used on the entire population .
It is just used in specific areas or persons who actually benefits from its application such as in the case of child kidnapping .
The parents have the authoritative rights for the well-being of their children .
Thus , surveillance technology should not be banned but one has to take note of the purpose of its application .
Secondly , the application of surveillance technology has found its use in sports .
With the RFID tag being clipped on runners' shoes , organisers can record the running time of every runner easily and accurately .
It brings great ease to the organisers of the marathon races in which there are so many contestants .
The reason why it was so difficult to track and record accurately in the past is that in such a big event , it may take about one hour for certain runners to even reach the starting point and start the race .
For this case , there is no ethical issue involved so surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
Fourthly , we have seen the application of surveillance technology in health care to tag its patients .
The purpose is to make sure the medical records actually tally with the patients being described .
It can provide information such as patients' allergies and it is extremely crucial to ensure correct association .
Critics may argue that we can also use wrist bands in which there are barcodes on the patients .
However , there is a tendency that one makes mistakes in typing on a keyboard .
Thus , those printed labels are susceptible to errors so it is not that reliable .
Since we have a better technology to ensure the accuracy , I see no reason to ban such surveillance technology .
Moreover , patients are supposed to be monitored so privacy issues are no concern here .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned , but one has to take note of the purposes of its applications .
Its applications in child kidnapping , marathon races , security of a country and health care have brought great benefits to human beings .
The benefits actually supersede the violation of people's privacy or in some case it does not violate at all .
We have seen that the identification technology has progressed by leaps and bounds over the last few decades .
One good example of such applications is the usage of RFID , a cutting-edge technology that uses radio waves for the purpose of tracking and monitoring .
There are however , a variety of issue  associated with the appropriateness to deploy RFID technology to track individuals .
This is primarily due to the fear of privacy invasion , dehumanization , and the social impact of mass surveillance after putting such technology in place .
Nonetheless , despite RFID  still progressing in its infancy stage , it is seen to possess uncapped potential and can be put to valuable uses , especially in connection with hospital- patient identification , anti-theft tracking as well as in government agencies for identification purposes .
Firstly , RFID system can be utilized widely in hospital in-patient identification .The system can be used to monitor the whereabouts of patients and also medical personnel s in the hospital .
One  advantage about the device is that it does not require line-of-sight monitoring .
RFID allows health conditions of patients such as blood pressure , heart rate and blood sugar level to be kept in check from time to time with ease .
These records contain both medical chart information and digital photos to minimize the frequency of surgical errors and improve the efficiency of operating rooms during the clinical processes ( Pye , 2000) .
In addition , implementation of RFID tag is highly useful in tracking the location of Alzheimer's patient .
It ensures a higher level of security and also allows nurses to administer more patients at a time .
Opponents of RFID surveillance may voice concerns over the health hazards posed as a result of over exposure to radioactivity which may lead to cancer .
However , research done has revealed a small and insignificant correlation of cancer risk to RFID .
Secondly , the sophisticated tracking technology can be put into good use in combating theft and retrieving lost items in department stores .
Unlike barcodes , RFID does not need to be placed precisely relative to the scanner .
The adoption of RFID for "logistics units and higher-value , lower volume items" is believed to simultaneously improve the supply chain efficiency as well as prevent property crime .
(Raza , 2008) .
RFID provides tight security that allows merchandise to be tracked effectively .
Whilst some opined that the use of RFID is not favoured due to its expensive nature , its effectiveness is much higher than that of the conventional tracking system .
Thus , it is relatively more cost-saving in a long run .
Thirdly , another application of RFID technology that is currently in use in government agencies is that the setting up of centralized nationwide database that would maintain a complete medical history and other relevant information of a person .
Swedberg (2004) cited that  countries like New Zealand , Pakistan , as well as Malaysia have embedded RFID chips in their citizen's identification card .
Public transportation systems worldwide use RFID enabled system to track and bill use of the services .
RFID chips are also being used in identification cards in corporations and schools to control unauthorized access .
One may argue that these can lead to potential infringement of confidentiality should one's personal information leak out .
However , the worries are unnecessary since the increasingly secure and private operations that are being set up could reduce the possibility of unintended access to information .
With all that has been said , the advantages of the usage of RFID clearly outweigh the drawbacks of the technology .
There is a need for social control of higher security and safety .
Nevertheless , RFID remains the least intrusive technology that allows us to achieve the objective .
It is undeniable that there are far-fetched controversial issues surrounding the use of RFID which requires deep consideration by all of us .
One needs to understand the benefits  brought about by RFID in different sectors .
Hence , this labor-saving technology should be utilized optimally as it is capable of bringing numerous benefits and conveniences to the society .
The rapid development of technology has made it possible for a person to track other people by using surveillance technology .
Surveillance technology is a new technology to monitor and find out into otherr people's activities and behavior .
There are many kinds of surveillance technology and RFID is one of them .
RFID is Radio Frequency Identification that uses electromagnetic spectrum to transmit signals so that we can locate the exact position of someone .
However , as a new technology arises , there may be some controversies that follow and RFID is no exception .
On one side , some people think that surveillance technology should not be used to track other people because it intrudes other people's privacy .
On the other hand , some argue that this technology should be used , especially for security purposes .
However , because of many detrimental effects that occur , the usage of surveillance technology to track other people should be banned .
The usages of RFID to track other people will bring about many consequences .
First , it will intrude into other people's privacy .
For  example the usage of RFID in a smart card that includes a microchip that stores ID , phone number , bank account , or address which are such critical information on each individual (RFID Journal ,2003) .
The problem approaches when there are hackers who can access the information that is stored in a RFID smart card .
This immoral , unfair action will make someone suffer a big loss due to the leak of his/her important information which can be used for mischievous purposes .
Second , the usage of RFID by a company to track other company's data , such that all fax , telephone , or email are intercepted so that all of the vital and very useful data of one company can be detected by other company (Bogonikolos ,1999) .
These conditions will cause unbalanced competition among the companies that will in turn affect many people .
Furthermore , the usage of RFID tag may cause individuals to be profiled and tracked without their consent , for example the implementation RFID tag in shoes or clothes (Blau ,2007) .
Generally all of these conditions will only bring inconvenience for someone who is being tracked .
On the other hand , some people may think that the usage of RFID to track other people will turn out to be beneficial especially if it is operated for security purpose such as surveillance security camera .
By using this technology , all of the activities that are happening can be viewed through the camera so it is important to organize the security of the place (Burnell ,2007) .
The other use of RFID that some people think could bring advantage is RFID microchip implanted inside the human body , especially in those who suffer chronic illness such as Alzheimer or Dementia .
This technology will help their family to identify their position whenever they get lost .
In conclusion , the usage of RFID to track other people will affect many people's lives tremendously . . People's privacy might be intruded , unstable economic condition could occur , and criminal rates will be increased .
Therefore , I agree with the banning of the usage of RFID to track other people because it is such an immoral and irresponsible action that will make other people suffer loss .
Surveillance has existed for a long a time  .
({http://www .oppapers .com/essays/}[HYPERLINK: http://www .oppapers .com/essays/] -Surveillance-Urban-City/79629) However , people have to carry out surveillance physically in the past .
For example , the police had to keep the suspect under surveillance by following the suspect physically .
The had to send soldiers to the enemy in order to master enemy condition .
The development of science has made the process of surveillance much simpler and easier .
Nowadays , we can locate anyone  anytime with just a small chip and a reader .
Surveillance technology is now widely used in several areas .
The usage of surveillance technology to track people has given rise to much controversy as people think that their privacy is being infringed .
However , that the technology has brought numerous advantages to the society is an undeniable fact .
So , in my opinion , the surveillance technology should be used to track people as it could benefit us in many aspects .
First and foremost , usage of surveillance technology in the hospital can improve the success rate of cure especially for emergency cases .
(Kennedy , 2006) Timing always plays a key role in surgery or even in other processes of curing or healing which the public might not aware of it .
In many cases , the faster the surgeries can be carry out the higher the success rate of the surgeries are .
There are cases which the main reason for surgical failure is that the surgeries did not carry out in time .
Does not it sound pity to you ?
In many cases lives of the patients can be saved if the surgeries did carry out on time .
Surveillance technology provide a good solution for this problem by helping the hospital to shorten the time to locate their staffs , the equipment , and most important the patients .
As tracking of the staffs and the patients is such important in the medical field , surveillance technology should be allowed to use to track people .
Firstly , surveillance technology in RFID tagging can be used to track terrorists and criminals .
This increases convenience and efficiency as more criminals can be easily tracked using such tags and their actions can be monitored closely which can help in combating crimes .
RFID tagging can also be used on patients for nurses or doctors to keep an eye on them in case they have inappropriate actions such as moving towards unsafe areas or they suffer from a sudden organ failure .
Therefore , it is crucial for the existence of such technology so that we can live in a safer environment .
Secondly , surveillance technology can also be used to prevent theft .
Cameras installed in shops allow shop tenders to observe the behaviours of customers .
Also , items are tagged with RFID chips which have unique serial numbers .
Thus , once they are dislocated from their original destination , a signal will be sent to notify the shop attendance .
If the item is stolen out of the shop , it can be traced easily .
Therefore not only can the item be recovered , the thief can also be nabbed .
Such chips are useful , cheap to implement and reduce the risk of losing items which lead to capital loss .
However , critics argued that surveillance technology has greatly intruded their personal space where they have this psychological feeling of 'being watched' by others  every single day .
To think of it , would you rather want a safe environment in which your privacy may be compromised , or to choose privacy over safety ?
Everyone has a differentt perception of privacy .
Therefore it's biased to say that surveillance technology threatens one's privacy to a huge extent .
Furthermore , mobile phones , WI-FI (wireless fidelity) as well as satellites also have the ability to track people's actions .
They are still widely in use nowadays .
Thus surveillance technology has become a necessity rather than a burden as we cannot do without it .
Surveillance is the process of monitoring  behaviours and activities , usually of people without their permission .
Lots of surveillance tools are invented , such as CCTV (close circuit television) cameras , RFID (radio-frequency identification) , GPS (global positioning system) , etc .
The extensive and growing use of electronic surveillance technology has resulted in considerable debate especially the ethical questions concerning privacy .
Although it appears to breach the privacy of communities , surveillance technology has in fact enabled to track the public's health , ensured  public safety and monitored  employees in companies .
Therefore , I fully agree that the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
First of all , surveillance technology should not be banned as it has enabled the tracking of the health of the public .
By means of somatic surveillance , information like heart rate and hormone levels can be translated into data for medical purposes .
The implantation of RFID into the body facilitates the proper identification of hospital patients .
Besides that , it can supply detailed body information to hospitals and then the public can alter their behaviours like exercise and diet after  interpretation from doctors .
With the implants , RFID chips may convey  messages regarding health conditions of patients , such as those with epilepsy , heart disease , or mental impairment , especially for those who are unable to communicate effectively with hospital staff about their medical histories or current complaints when they are in need of immediate treatment .
In addition , it also decreases the slight discrepancy of diagnosis by doctors due to the influence of their experiences .
The embedded chip can provide accurate and objective information of patients .
Thus , surveillance technology to track the health of communities aids in reducing  mortality rates due to health problems and also decreasing the misinterpretation of verbal communication by  doctors .
Secondly , surveillance technology can be used by employers to monitor their employees during working hours .
This is very crucial  to ensure that the productivity and the efficiency of workers are kept to a maximum .
For instance , employees might seem to be surfing the web for business purposes at all time , but what they are actually doing is personal business such as online banking , shopping and chatting .
Skiving and loafing of employees cause companies to lose many man hours and resources .
If the behaviour of employees at work is monitored , they will work more efficiently and contribute to the company .
It may be  argued that one's privacy might be invaded due to surveillance technology (Heathfield , n .d . , p . 2) .
However , monitoring can take place under suitable circumstances and to an appropriate extent as it is only installed at the working places .
It has also been said that surveillance of employees can affect the relationship between employer and employees (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , this only applies to those minority spending most of the time online doing personal things and do not meet the company's goals .
Use of surveillance technology has no impact for those focusing on work and doing the right thing (Heathfield , n .d . , p . 2) .
Furthermore , security  is very essential for factories manufacturing coins and jewellery .
Surveillance cameras can trace the movement of the workers .
Suspicious behaviour by the employees can be reviewed by their employers through the electronic records .
This can alleviate  theft rate in the factories .
As a result , surveillance technology can facilitate  employers to monitor their workers with an extent of not breaching their privacy .
Moreover , surveillance technology is vital in ensuring the safety of the public .
Through video and satellite surveillance , polices can track the movement of dangerous criminals and terrorists .
Besides that , tracking of missing or kidnapped children (Stump , 2008 , para .1) is made possible too .
With the help of CCTV cameras , the whole criminal processes can be recorded .
By that time , The police can then trace the culprits' physical appearance and vehicle number .
Thus , the time taken to solve  criminal cases is tremendously reduced , compared with the crime not being recorded .
The video recorded becomes a concrete proof to subject the culprits  .
Eventually , public security is guaranteed .
On the other hand , for those having diseases like Alzheimer's disease , surveillance technology facilitate in find them out if they get lost  .
Similarly , those running away from home , possibly caused by family factors or mental problems , can be tracked via CCTV cameras in the shortest period .
This prevents them from doing things that are unfavourable or irrational .
Hence , public safety can be ensured by the utilization of surveillance technology .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned as it ensures the health and safety of the public , besides being used to monitor the performance of employees .
If we persist with the banning of surveillance technology , the public will be exposed to a dangerous environment in which crime will happen frequently .
After that , crime will lead to adverse consequences to the individual , then to the country and finally to the world .
Without  surveillance ,  decreased productivity of workers may bring the unemployment issue to the surface again .
Although until now there are still many debates about the ethical issues of surveillance technology , it after all still benefits the communities in many perspectives , so banning of surveillance technology should not be initiated .
My stand is to control and not a total ban .
The increasing use of technology has done much for mankind .
It has changed many aspects of our lives and has  ubiquitously penetrated  our society making many of us dependent on it .
Even though technological advances prove to be a marvel as we move faster into the future , they do not only bring about benefits but also negative repercussions if not dealt with properly .
Surveillance has been around for hundreds of years but technology has 'springboarded' it to a much higher level .
Due to this drastic change and lack of legislation , many have used new gadgets to their benefits even if it is against human rights .
Of course , surveillance technology does have its benefits to the society in terms of safety and security , but does it outweigh the undesirable problems that it brings ?
Tracking of personnel has always been in the spotlight because it steps too much into the boundaries of human rights .
The use of miniature tracking devices to trail the whereabouts of one's 'target' has kept human rights activism in action .
One such example dates back to an article "Challenge over tracking devices" , posted on the 21st of November 2000 by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) , where a security company is taken to court under Britain's new human rights law to remove all tracking devices in their vans .
Of course , the company has its reasons to do so such as tracking their vehicles and also providing better service to their customers .
Yet , many have argued that it is against human rights and thus promoted the banning of tracking devices .
On the other hand , tracking devices such as the use of Ground Positioning System (GPS) have recently been more widely available .
The use of GPS has provided people with more accessible information .
It has also benefitted many through an increased level of safety and in locating their vehicles .
For example , when one is involved in a car accident that is located in a secluded place and does not have any communication devices with him or her , the presence of a GPS installed in his car can give loved ones or the authorities  direction in the search for him .
({GPS to the Rescue: More than Simply Navigation}[HYPERLINK: http://www .gps .eu/gps-to-the-rescue-more-than-simply-navigation/] , 28 July 2009 , para 2) .
Therefore , the use of tracking devices can actually bring about benefits if they are used with caution .
Thus , tracking devices not be banned .
Furthermore , surveillance technology like RFID has also been used for the safety of personnel as well as the general public .
Oakland Coliseum located in the United States has made use of RFID to track its staff  to increase the efficiency in deploying  quick response teams in times of need .
In an incident , its staff will activate the respective standby teams depending on the situation (Oakland Coliseum adopts RFID for safety , September 30 , 2008 , para 2-3) .
This will decrease the company's reaction time to each incident and thus help solve any problems that will arise .
In addition to this , Axcess International has also promoted the use of RFID as a safety measure for tracking each individual .
Miners are given ID tags before  their descent into the tunnel .
These ID tags provide real-time location information on the miners' movement as well as location of the tags during possible cave-in (Axcess targets RFID for US mining safety , October 1 , 2008 , para 1) .
Surveillance technology has also been used in emergencies such as the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) .
One such example in Singapore is the installation of surveillance cameras at homes of affected citizens that are quarantined at home .
When they are randomly called , they are to turn on the camera and present themselves at home .
Even though it does not comply with human rights law , it is for the better of the society and the government has to take such drastic measures to ensure the preservation of the rest of the society (Information for Home Quarantine , March 24 , 2003) .
Therefore , 
Undeniably , surveillance technologies do overlap with human rights  , but more often than not , the use of these technologies brings about more benefits than negative consequences .
It boils down to the purpose of these technologies and how one uses it .
In conclusion , there should not be a complete ban of the use of surveillance but only adequate control by oneself or a governing body to restrict the abuse of this powerful tool .
Surveillance technology and security has become crucial to each country since the terrorist attacks in the US on Sept 11 .
Surveillance technology is the use of devices to monitor any behaviour , activities or other changing information that is deemed to be important to any government or personnel .
But this has gone too far; with security came the loss of personal privacy .
Own freedom is compromised thus with much hesitation , I do not agree that surveillance technology should be used to track people .
Personal privacy is our very own right .
We live our own way and nobody has the right to monitor or dictate our actions .
Why should they ?
Be it the government's security reasons or other excuses , still it has no right to impose such a technology on others without our permission .
Public concern for personal and data privacy has also gained momentum in recent years , with government responding by forming an inter-ministerial committee to review the need for a data protection law (Sim , n .d .) .
Secondly , it erodes trust and creates a climate of fear in the person being monitored and the people around them .
Fear is a very strong tool and terrorists use it to create mayhem and destruction in our lives .
Fear causes psychological problems such as anxiety and the loss of a person's confidence .
Anxiety is a very difficult mental disorder to cure and it takes a very long time for a person to overcome this but with constant disturbances from knowing that he or she is being monitored , it will become a significant problem in their daily lives .
"Collection of personal data (e .g . , lifestyle information for insurance purposes) also reveals intimate aspects of the self to others within the work environment" (Santon , 2003) .
"Symptoms like palpitations , breathlessness and tense feelings that are serious enough to disrupt their daily routine" (IMH , 2008) will appear in the person .
Thirdly , not all surveillance devices are used without the person knowing it; some of the devices are used with the knowledge of the person .
Such devices are used to monitor a person's whereabouts as in the case of criminals that have been released from prison and under probation .
A very good example is in certain states in the US  .
Medical risk is an issue if we proceed with implanting the device into a person's body in certain cases .
Adverse tissue reaction , migration of implanted transponder , compromised information security , failure of implanted transponder , failure of inserter , failure of electronic scanner , electromagnetic interference , electrical hazards , magnetic resonance imaging incompatibility , and needle stick" (US FDA 2004 , 4); these not only cause the person's distress but also put the whole monitoring agency on high alert if the device malfunctions .
Huge cost and time will be wasted and manpower will be mobilized just to rectify these unfortunate problems  .
Why should we waste money and time for this failure of surveillance technology ?
It is taxpayer's money we are talking about .
Doesn't the public have the right to dictate how the money should be generated and used ?
For the government works for the people , not the other way around .
But this does not imply to certain countries that expect the people to work for them .
Lastly , the use of surveillance technology can be abused by the government and or any agency that uses it .
The government can use it to track any opposition to its policies .
Like in the case of South Africa during the apartheid period whereby the opposition  was monitored using  surveillance technology .
Thousands of opposition members were arrested and ill treated by the regime .
The situation became better when Nelson Mandela successfully became the president but at the price of he himself being the victim of their abuse .
Greed and corruption sink in when the people at the very top refuse to give up their power and use underhanded means to keep themselves in power .
They will do anything and that does include using any surveillance device to monitor their nemesis .
With easy evidence at their disposal , they will use the law to suppress any opposition at their will .
In conclusion ,  surveillance technology should not be used to track people as it can be abused by the people who use it .
Surveillance technology systems are tools which can identify , monitor and track movements and data .
Previously , the common practice for surveillance has always been through physical means such as prison guards , but in modern times it has been improved and upgraded through image amplification devices such as binoculars , closed circuit cameras and high-resolution satellite cameras (Bogonikolos , 1999) .
Radio-frequency identification tags (RFID) are among the several types of surveillance technologies of today .
It is a type of automatic identification method that is used to track prescription drugs to pets and , in some cases , even humans .
Although these surveillance technologies may provide many potential benefits such as law enforcement , the issue raises a great deal of controversies as well .
Surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
Also , RFID pose the risks of information leak during transmission of information .
The RFID implant uses radio waves to transmit medical and financial account information to reader devices .
One would be concerned that this information will be intercepted; duplicated and abused by others or that the device could be used to track an individual's movements and location .
Proof hackers can clone these RFID chips and hence cause the risk of identity theft to increase .
For example , the United States military were keen on the idea and were amongst the first subscribers of the technology .
Every pallet , carton and big-ticket item being shipped to the military was affixed with a RFID tag (Bogonikolos , 1999) .
With complete product information on a tag , enemies can conveniently extract information off a tag .
The information can then be used to identify the military's strengths and weaknesses and can be used to endanger the country , its soldiers and civilians should the information fall into the wrong hands .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
Although cost for RFID systems in the future will decrease , privacy issues , health issues and security issues will still exist .
RFID still has a long way to go before it becomes a feasible technology to be implemented .
Privacy issues must be given main priority and with sufficient control and attention from all relevant parties , RFID will benefit society as a whole and will not jeopardize human rights .
We live in an age where information proliferates , both in terms of its formulation and its availability .
Modern surveillance technology has constructed a means for us to gather information readily .
RFID first appeared in 1940 with the primary aim of identifying aircrafts for military purposes .
However , as RFID becomes more prevalent in our society , it is now able to retrieve information from almost anywhere , anyone .
Tentatively , with surveillance , security is on whole tightened .
However , whilst maintaining the level of security , surveillance is often seen as an invasion to privacy .
Many would agree that  sophisticated surveillance technology has indeed been beneficial in the security arena especially after the September 11th incident and governments has since then diverted their attention to tracking potential terrorists instead of tracking explosive devices or substances .
For instance , in its effort to locate any suspicious character , Britain has over 4 million CCTV cameras installed along almost every street just to keep track of every individual (BBC News , 2006) .
The implementation of such a system has successfully foiled some of the terrorists' plans .
Furthermore , individuals would behave themselves upon knowing that they are constantly being "watched" , leading to a possible decrease in crime rates .
As far as the government is concerned , with the use of surveillance devices , security is greatly enhanced and discipline is observed .
Thus , tracking individuals using surveillance technology would result in a safer environment to live in .
On the other hand , some argued that such method has inevitably threatened the most basic human rights to freedom as every movement or speech , for more advanced devices ,  is meticulously monitored .
"Privacy is an inherent human right and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect" (Schneier B , 2006) .
Then , there are individuals who abuse the usage of surveillance technology by sending their partners gifts with RFID attached to it so that they will be able to track the location of their partners and know who they are hanging out with .
Obviously such acts are morally wrong and hence the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned if individuals misuse it (Lee and Tan , 2007) .
However , individuals should also have their right to security , which in turn allows the intervention of government .
National security is altogether far more important than the mere privacy entitled to individuals .
RFID is also used to track criminals  , detainees or ex-convict .
The RFID would be able to trace their location and monitor their behavior .
If Mas Selamat bin Kastari was to have a RFID tag , he would not not have been able to escape and there would not have been so much fear instilled among Singaporeans during the period of his disappearance .
By employing such an operation , government would thus be able to prevent any possible mishap from happening .
All these boil down to the question "How much privacy are we willing to sacrifice for the sake of a more secure life ?"
(Anderson R , 2007) .
An opinion poll conducted among Americans and Europeans has shown that 75% of the respondents "want more , not less , surveillance" (BBC News , 2007) .
Furthermore , "If it prevents criminal behaviour or improves its detection I'm all for it" (Jones M , 2006) .
Perhaps , the increases in the number of terrorists attack have proven to us that governments should also tap on the advantages of current technology to counter those sophisticated attacks carried out by the terrorists .
In conclusion , there should be a balance between maintaining security and protecting privacy .
On the minor scale , it is the individuals themselves who are abusing such technology for their own gain .
However , when looking from a broader perspective , surveillance technology would have been the platform to stop any terrorist attacks or crimes from happening .
In addition , since most people recognize the main objective of surveillance technology , such technology should not be banned even if it includes spying individuals .
Surveillance technology is the utilization of electronic equipment such as RFID , GPS , and CCTV to monitor the behavior of individuals or groups .
This technology is widely used in public places for  security maintenance , as well as for the purpose of identification and tracking of information .
For example , CCTV is installed in airports , banks , department stores , and even  streets to prevent crime in those areas , while RFID can be used as an access key within an organization , a means of managing mobile assets of a company , or a tool for identifying and tracking of equipment , staff , and patients in a hospital .
In fact , there are still a lot of applications for RFID in various fields and industries including security , public transport , healthcare , and e-payment that its popularity is increasing rapidly .
Nevertheless , there are some problems and controversies surrounding the use of such technology despite the convenience it brings to the society .
Most concerns revolve around the issue of privacy and confidentiality since the technology is capable of collecting personal data about a person without consent .
As such , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be carefully limited so that it is not misused to track people or gather sensitive data about a third party .
There are some ways RFID can cause privacy concerns .
An RFID tag incorporated into an item can be read from several distances away .
The individual carrying the item may be unaware of the presence of the tag , thus rendering him vulnerable to privacy breaches (Bhaskar 2007) .
Such cases are most likely to happen to a customer purchasing products with RFID tags .
Moreover , if the products are paid by a credit card or in conjunction with the use of a loyalty card , the identity of the customer can be linked to the unique serial number of the tag (Bhaskar 2007) .
This data can eventually be used to find out private information about the customer , which is a serious breach of privacy to the customer concerned .
Therefore , regulations should be made to protect the privacy of individuals , such as the need to indicate the existence of  tags on customer products and the restriction on information gathering .
There are some problematic complications that may arise due to the use of RFID to track people .
For instance , personally identifiable information (PII) such as the license plate number of an individual carrying an RFID-enabled card or travel document can be read by a third party without his consent since the unauthorized RFID reader can read the RFID number from the card or document (US Department of Homeland Security 2008) .
However , some may argue that the benefits of surveillance technology actually compensate for the concerns about privacy .
An RFID tag embedded into items or products can help owners to track down their valuable belongings should their items be stolen or missing .
RFID also helps to identify disaster victims , and provide effective treatment for patients in emergency situations in a hospital .
While these may be true , without the restriction of the use of the technology , abusive use of the information may cost greatly .
In other words , RFID may be used to track people , but only limited to a certain degree .
For example , it is acceptable to track patients if the patients concerned really need it .
Surveillance technology can be used , for instance , to monitor  data exchanges on network or to observe the activity of someone using a surveillance camera .
One of the examples of surveillance technology is Radio Frequency Identification or RFID .
RFID is a system that keeps track of a tagged object by utilizing radio waves (What is RFID ?) .
However , people are mainly concerned with their privacy being violated since they are being tracked down .
It can also give out  important information on the individual without any permission from the person .
Hence , the idea of spying people by using technology such as RFID has to be banned .
There are two main reasons why RFID should be prohibited .
The first reason is concerned with the idea of individual privacy (CASPIAN , 2003) .
When someone buys a product that is tagged with RFID , the radio wave can still be detected as long as the chip is still active and within the range of detection .
This means revealing the position and behavioral information of the person .
Groups of consumers in UK , France , Germany and Netherlands were polled by a consultancy group named Capgemini and 95% of the consumers were worried that the information gathered from RFID could be used freely without their consent by third parties (BBC , 2005) .
This survey indicates that breach of privacy is indeed an important concern for people .
Secondly , the information gathered through RFID can be used in a way that can endanger the life of the individual himself or herself (CASPIAN , 2003) .
In fact , every RFID tag is assigned a unique serial number .
For instance , terrorists with appropriate equipment can target a high-ranking official by setting a bomb to explode as soon as the target is in the detection range .
Robbers can identify rich persons just by reading the RFID tag on the things the person buys .
All of these can be done in a radius of few meters and these make it even harder for the person to realize that they are being spied upon .
These examples illustrate the problem of how the RFID can be utilized to harm people instead of saving them .
Others argue that RFID can be used to stop terrorists from monitoring the nation's food supply , hence keeping the food from  terrorists (Baard , 2003) .
However , in this age of digital information , people can easily find an Internet connection and type a few keywords like "remove RFID tag" .
The fact that by using technology not more sophisticated than what is in a cell phone , the RFID tag can be disabled completely (Invoke Media , 2006) .
This shows that the RFID tag is not effective in tracking people , particularly the terrorists .
To wrap up the discussion on the controversy of using RFID to track people , the examples above show how ineffective is the RFID system on spying people like  terrorists since the RFID tag can be removed easily .
On the other hand , some groups of people can even misuse this piece of technology to harm others for the sake of their benefit .
Moreover , a survey by a consultancy group Capgemini shows that the majority of the respondents were very concerned over breach of their privacy particularly on the use of the RFID system to track them .
Thus , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
RFID , also known as radio frequency identification , is a piece of technology which makes use of electromagnetic or electrostatic waves in the radio frequency  to identify or pass  information through the radio wave .
However , should we ban the use of surveillance technology such as RFID ?
Like many other pieces of surveillance technology , RFID also infringes on privacy issue .
In addition , it also possesses some potential hazards to someone implanted with the chip .
Yet , there are far more important benefits if we incorporate the use of RFID , hence we must not ban it  .
It is common to hear that most technologies are like a double-edged sword; so is  RFID .
Scientists have shown that if  RFID is implanted in the human body , it will interfere with  hospital equipment [Anonymous , 2008] , hence handicapping the doctors in their treatment for the patients .
Thus , it is not encouraged to implant an RFID chip .
However , It will be plain ignorant to ban RFID based on this limitation as there are rooms for improvement since it is still at its developing stage .
The benefits of RFID are its efficiency and the safety it can offer which people in the future will enjoy .
If RFID chips are inserted into prisoners , we can track down  escapees thus preventing worst-case scenarios from happening .
An example is the case of Singapore's Mas Selamat  who ,  an important player in terrorism , managed to escape from prison prison .
Another use is to insert it in minors  to  prevent them from being kidnapped and from going astray .
One recent case study would be the famous case of Jaycee Lee Dugard who was held captive and raped for 18 years by Philip Garrido .
All these tragedies among minors can be avoided if and only if RFID was implanted in them to monitor their movement  [Best , 2004] .
For the past years , the controversy of surveillance technology infringing one's right to privacy still exists and will continue to happen .
However , there can be some laws passed down to ensure that technologies like RFID are not abused but used in the proper direction .
For example , like the surveillance camera , peeping toms and other criminals commonly use them for crimes , yet why does the government still allow such technology to be used ?
The reasons are that the priority of ensuring the privacy of corporations and the safety of the people are of more importance .
Similarly , RFID , which is more feasible and useful than the surveillance camera since it can cover a longer range of areas than the latter , should not be banned .
In conclusion , if we weigh the pros and cons of RFID , it seems obvious that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages  , thus instead of banning it when it is not perfected at this stage , we should encourage the further development of this technology  .
Though the debate about the ethical issues of RFID are ongoing , we need to understand that in whatever new piece of technology introduced , there is always a need for us to compromise in some ways since nothing is perfect in this world .
Surveillance technology refers to gadgets that are able to observe and monitor an individuals' behavior and activity from a distance using electronic equipment .
CCTV's and RIFD (radio-frequency identification) are some examples of surveillance technology .
With the invention of such technology , controversy over the use of this technology has been increasing .
While some feel that the existence of this technology helps to tackle problems related to tracking people , others are against this technology simply because it is an intrusion into a person's privacy (Greene ,T 2004) .
This essay will argue that this technology should not be used to track people down . 
Firstly , the main reason why people are uncomfortable with the usage of surveillance technology is because it is an invasion of privacy (Anonymous , 2001) .
Privacy is the right to withhold certain information about ourselves and also the right to be left alone .
Using surveillance technology gives the general public that they are being watched all the time and that there is no sense of freedom .
Injecting RFID chips into a person it is like  imprisoning a person  , because there is no place where the person can go  undetected .
Many might say that by using this technology  location of criminals and medical patients who manage to runaway can be detected .
But the reliability of this gadget has not been tested , and there is no assurance that with the installing of this surveillance technology , all criminals and medical patients can be detected easily . 
Another point to be raised is that surveillance technology may not be effective in preventing or reducing crime rates as many people  assume that they do .
The usage of the surveillance technology  gives people a false sense of security because they feel that with technology looking after them , they are sure to be safe .
However , this may not be the case because surveillance may only help to catch a criminal after the crime has been committed .
Most of the time information from  surveillance technology is redundant , because the information recorded during the crime does not provide enough evidence to arrest the criminal .
Furthermore criminals are being wiser each day; they may outsmart the technology by hacking in to the system to prevent them from being caught .
Therefore , it is certainly not a wise choice to use surveillance cameras as a replacement of security guards .
Another concern about using surveillance is the health issue .
The usages of certain surveillance gadgets such as RFID being implanted in  the body of individuals have tested as being harmful to the human body .
Humans that are implanted  by these chips have higher incidences of getting cancer (Layden , J 2007) .
Though the possibility of getting cancer is not 100% , why should humans expose themselves to a higher risk of this deadly disease ?
In conclusion ,  usage of surveillance technology can be strongly argued against , because it is a invasion to privacy , it does not really reduce crime rates and it raises problems related to health issues .
The money used to futher develop this technology and to implement this technology would be better spent on more useful areas such as  education and medicine .
RFID is mainly used on tracking employees and patientsneither is reasonable .
According to a report on July 19 , 2005 (Two stories highlight the RFID debate) , the general workers' union GMB in UK required the European Commission to prohibit the tag of RFID on employees .
As the employees were monitored through RFID and GPS even when using the bathroom , they felt annoying dehumanization and loss of privacy .
Proponents claim that implanting RFID chips makes it possible for employers to watch over who sneaks away even during an unauthorized bathroom break (Albrecht & McIntymake005) .
Though , after weighing the pros and cons , numerous civil rights groups and privacy groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people's right to privacy , including Electronic Privacy Information Center , Electronic Frontier Foundation (Wentworth , 2005) , American Civil Liberties Union (2003) as well as US Department of Justice (2008) .
Thus , it is not acceptable to use RFID to track employees .
the USBesides undermining employees' rights to privacy , usin , neither of which is reasonableso remains a big issue .
Advocates of surveillance technology argue that RFID tags provide an alternative to access pthe UKients' information and thus , reduce medical errors .
However , based on a CEJA report (Sade , 2007) , the American Medical Association has officially reported on July 17 , 2007 that RIFD devices contain potential physical risks to the user .
Tagging of these small sized devices may allow them to "migrate under the skin" , which makes it hard to extract them .
Moreover , possible electromagnetic interference will result in a lower efficacy of medication .
Hence , the advantage claimed from the proponents is not convincing , and the use of RFID to track patients is also not appropriate .
Apart from the use on tracking employees and patients , use of RFID on consumers also causes problems such as identity theft .
Security experts have warned against using RFID due to the risk of identity theft (Hook , 2005) .
Although advocates have assured the security of tagged peoples' information (Security assurance and RFIechnology , 2008) , such assurance is proven invalid when the following case occurred as a counter example .
The METRO Future Store has been reported of loss of loyalty cardholders' personal information due to inappropriate use of technology and inadequate customer disclosures (Scandal: the RFID tag hidden in METRO's loyalty card , 2004) .
Katherine Albrecht , Director of CASPIAN (Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering) , "toured the Future Store on January 31 , 2004" and discovered hidden RFID tags in the store's loyalty cards to shopping carts that track customer movements , as well as RFID tag "deactivation" stations that do not work as claimed (McCullagh , 2004) .
This means not only customers' movements are under detection , but confidential items such as signature and application forms containing personal information are easily accessed via an RFID reader , too .
Such a shocking finding convinces people that the RFID trial is not under secure control and thus should be halted .

The issue of whether to use radio-frequency identification (RFID) to track people has been highly debated ever since it was created .
It may appear that RFID and other surveillance technology have brought benefits to public security and the efficiency to attend to a patient .
In fact , the use of RFID and other surveillance technology brings problems to issues such as our basic privacy , health and the public security .
Therefore , I totally agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Firstly , surveillance technology such as the use of RFID should be banned as it intrudes upon our privacy .
According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , Article 12 , it says that 'no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation' (United Nations , 1948) .
Using surveillance technology to track people violates their privacy; thus , it is a very serious offence .
Furthermore , a study has revealed that it is very easy to hack into devices such as RFID cards in passports .
According to the experiment conducted by Researcher Chris Paget who is a Security Consultant at NGS Software Ltd , by using simple gadgets such as Matrics antenna and Motorola reader , we will be able to retrieve personal data from the U .S . passport cards (sixwise .com , 2009) .
Opposition may argue that now passport has a protective RFID-blocking sleeve to prevent intrusion from hackers (sixwise .com , 2009) .
However , as technology advances to prevent such intrusions , hackers and stalkers can advance to break into such protections too .
This means that the personal data of a person can be easily retrieved and thus one's privacy is invaded .
Therefore , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used as it violates the human rights for privacy .
Secondly , the use of RFID can cause serious health hazard .
RFID is used in hospitals to keep track on the condition of patients .
It indeed has brought great convenience and efficiency in attending to the needs of patients .
However , the use of RFID not only poses a threat to the patient , but to everyone around it .
Studies showed that when active RFID tags were shifted around 41 important health devices such as pacemakers , they interfered with the devices in 34 tests out of all 123 tests .
And out of the 34 tests , 22 could cause a serious problem to the patients (Wasserman , 2008) .
Despite the convenience of being able to attend to the patients efficiently , the real problem will be that  RFID can be interfered by another RFID as well .
This will cause a serious problem .
Furthermore , studies have shown that when RFID is implanted into mice , it causes the growth of tumour around RFID (Wasserman , 2008) .
RFID not only poses a risk to  patients , but intensive exposure can be hazardous to a healthy individual too .
Hence , RFID can be a health hazard; thus , it should not be used .
Lastly , surveillance technology like CCTV cameras does not decrease the crime rate .
CCTV cameras are used to "keep an eye" on the public and are said to be a good way of crime prevention .
Opposition argues that with CCTV cameras , criminals will be aware that they are being watched and so the crime rate is reduced .
However , this is not necessarily true .
London has more than ten thousand CCTV cameras; however , eighty percent of the crimes are left unsolved (Davenport , 2007) .
This substantially supports that surveillance technology does not reduce the crime rate and enhance public security .
Hence , it is not necessary to use surveillance technology to track people .
To conclude , surveillance technology should not be used as it not only can not help in solving crimes and maintain order , it also poses a health threat to the people using it and around it as well .
Finally , the use of surveillance technology is a violation to human rights .
Therefore I agree that it should not be used .
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a type of surveillance technology which has been used for a while now .
It works by storing and retrieving data using RFID tags .
An RFID tag is a small object which can be attached to or integrated into a product or even a person in order to track them .
Although RFID has been claimed to be a useful technology such as in the identification and tracking of criminals , the use of RFID has aroused considerable controversy especially in the area of privacy concerns .
Shop outlets , employers and even potential crime-doers can use RFID to prey on their desired targets , hence intruding upon their privacy .
Therefore , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
Firstly , stores can use RFID to track and identify customers without their awareness and pricey items discriminatively .
Shop outlets can charge customers the maximum amount he or she is prepared to pay instead of selling at the same price to every customer by using RFID tags to observe their shopping habits .
For example , stores would definitely charge higher prices for a customer who is price-insensitive and loves to buy branded goods .
The counterargument could be that RFID can be used to provide a better customer service by knowing their customers' preferences .
However , this is not true for all cases since the use of RFID for the purpose of better service could fall into the hands of unscrupulous sellers who only care for lucrative profits .
This can lead to a strong incentive to interfere with customer privacy .
Hence , to be on the safe side , RFID should not be used for any tracking purposes .
Secondly , the use of RFID would allow an employer to monitor every movement of his employees , whether at work or not , in order to assess the performance of his employees .
The employees may not be aware that their personal information is being collected and how this information is being used .
Thus , the privacy of  employees is being invaded when RFID is used for tracking purposes including tracking someone going to the toilet .
The opposition can claim that there is an existing employment law and privacy act to govern the employees' privacy interests .
