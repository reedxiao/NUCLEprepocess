Topic 1: "The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
The competitive e a main topic in public discussion .
Thus , due to the risk of misuse of surveillance technology , I fully concur that the use of surveillance technology should be banned .
First and foremost , surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification  has been used as a tool for hackers and identity thieves to commit " 'contactless' "crime against victims municated to others' "  . , 1999) .
Hence , everyone has the right to protect their privacy .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it has been misused by people for illegal activities .
The misuse of surveillance technology not only invades user's privacy but also increases the risk of personal and national security .
There are many types of genetic testing , such as late-onset disorders and nepanies are not panies .
.
Applicants will be at a disadvantage when applying for insurance .
For example , if genetic results are revealed , the cost of the insurance will be expensive such that it may not be worth it .
Critics of this position claim that insurer will also be at a disadvantage if such results are not revealed to them .
.
I must admit that the insurer will be at a disadvantage if the situation is switched .
However , the cost of insurance should be on the current medical status of the applicant and should not be on the results of the genetic testing .
In conclusion , I believe that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing as it will affect both the relationship between employees and employer and issues involving insurance .
Genetic testing is a test performed to allopanies that offer jobs that require physical strength , it panies may not employ those panies do have the right to choose employer panies instead of the individuals have the right to know the genetic testing of the individual .
Spouse of a couple do have the right to know the family disease of their partner .
If a couple is planning to have a child , it is best for them to go through genetic counseling if the parents are carrier of genetic disease  .
It will be unfair if the spouse kept the truth from their spouse .
The spouse does have the right to know whether the child will suffer from the genetic diseases .
This is a basic respect towards your partner in a marriage .
It is a must to say it out and thus individual do not have the final say in revealing of their genetic results to the third parties
Education sector do have the right to know the genetic testing of their student .
Those with genetic diseases like mental retardation and Down syndrome are asked to be enrolled in school like MINDS and bright sparks .
Some may debate that this is a form of discrimination and violate the human rights of these children .
However , according to the American Association for mental retardation AAMR  , revealing of genetic testing results is not a form of discrimination but it is to be fair to those children with these genetic diseases as the child will be enrolled into the school that provide a better environment for them to study in .
It is a must to provide the school with the genetic testing result .
Hence individual do not have the final say in revealing of their genetic results to the public .
All in all , in my own opinion , in the high technology society we are living in , we do not have the final say in revealing of our genetic results to the public .
It may not be disadvantage and can even benefits a lot of people based on the point mentioned above .
Thus individual requesting for genetic testing do not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of these testing .
Use of Surveillance Technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
With rapid technological advancement , myriad forms of surveillance technology have surfaced and people are using it both intensively and extensively .
From forms as high level as satellite surveillance to the common Radio Frequency Identification Device  , surveillance technology has served us e more of detrimental than beneficial .
Intrusion of privacy and upsetting the various balances in society are concerns people are increasingly fort people are experiencing e relatively transparent .
On the intangible aspects , information of individuals can be easily retrieved es increasingly popular promised .
The tags are usually not "killed" and this allows consumers' movement to be tracked and habits to be observed .
This thorough understanding of consumers has certainly gone overboard .
Last but not least , biometric surveillance has given checkpoints the capability to monitor people down to the skin .
Evolved surveillance here is so revealing that people appear literally naked on screens .
Furthermore , surveillance technology has created many deviants and upsets in the balance of our society .
Society will see the rise of discriminations since the entire background of an individual can be easily traced .
Dates cancelled , different standards in pricing of insurance premiums and harassment of political dissidents are just a few to mention .
Next , surveillance technology also widens the gap between the rich and the poor .
The rich can afford to encrypt and protect their data while engaging in better surveillance over the less well off .
Moreover , by selling information  , the rich will get richer .
With regards to RFID , usage mention earlier on will reduce the variety of products available in stores because retailers will only consider the better selling items .
Society will witness a smorgasbord of changes in the various balances and the birth of more deviants such as stalkers .
Therefore , with all the worrisome disadvantages of surveillance technology will bring , we ought to ban it .
It makes privacy lose its meaning and is unhealthy to our society .
Consequences will be disastrous if we do not put an end to it .
With the revelation of human's DNA structure by Watson and Crick during 1953 , it shopanies reducing their coverage and pricing on the basis of information derived from genetic tests .
Thus , there is no fear of revealing the genetic results .
Inversely , individuals are responsible to inform employers about their genetic conditions so that a better and safer es up with fruitful conclusion .
The rapid development of medical technology has made it possible to diagnose disease inheritance or determine genetic disorders by using genetic testing .
Unfortunately , there is pro and con among the public about the disclosure of the result of genetic testing , e prise information about hereditary disease .
In conclusion , the result of genetic testing that informs us about our hereditary disease , will not only affect us as individual but also our family .
Therefore , the final say should not be in individual but the whole family .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it invade our privacy and disturb the society which outweighs the ability to provide security , which might not be necessary true .
The past two decades brought about huge technological advances in the areas of nano-engineering and information systems .
With the help modern technology , humans are able to create increasingly efficient devices which are able to store relevant personal information or to trace one's location .
The use of sophisticated personnel tracking devices has long been an ethical quagmire , as people with extremely polarizing views debate if such surveillance technology can be used or allowed to track people .
Proponents for the use of tracking devices on humans assert that patients can be easily identified in cases of emergency with their medical profiles easily accessible , since information is stored in a database that can be accessed via the internet  .
Administrative procedures are greatly reduced , and the patient's vital records , for example drug allergies are readily retrievable .
Patients will be able to receive immediate and proper medical attention , which in certain cases can be a matter of life and death .
Moreover , tracking devices are able to assist law enforcement personnel to monitor suspects closely  .
Unknowing crime suspects can be monitored closely by the police over a period of time .
This allows discovery of new evidences through observation of the suspects , to prove if one is innocent or guilty .
Some arguments brought forward by opponents states that tagged identities could be easily duplicated by identity thefts  .
This argument is flawed , as there is no concrete evidence showing existence of such crimes .
The argument also blatantly ignored the fact that there are additional measures being taken into preventing such crimes .
Opponents also claim that government will be able to use such devices to monitor , instil fear , and ultimately control the users  .
This assertion is a fallacy , as it is based solely on foresight , and is cynical and biased .
In conclusion , tracking devices should be allowed in tracking people , as it is able to change human lives for the better , and even prevent or reduce crime rates .
Should the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people be banned ?
Nowadays , advances in technology have made tracking people no longer an uphill task .
Due to this , many surveillance technologies have been created in order to make the tracking job efficient .
A controversy between the benefits of the surveillance technology and the impacts of the surveillance technology has aroused .
In fact , the use of it has brought along significant benefits and therefore it should not be banned .
There are two main benefits that the use of surveillance technology has brought to .
Firstly , it helps to tag "high-risk" patients  .
A microchip is implanted into the arm of patients who had heart diseases , diabetics or Alzheimer's disease .
For the Alzheimer's patients , it helps to track them in order to ensure their safety .
By using this technology , the location of the patient can be easily detect by a reader and immediate action can be taken if the patient is in risk .
This system really benefits the Alzheimer's patient who often lost due to their degrading memories .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
It benefits not only an individual but the whole world .
Surveillance technology is being promise of one's privacy  .
Similarly , the United States has been criticized for promoting the use of human tracking technologies after the 9/11 event  , as it indicates the beginning of an Orwellian era as claimed by many privacy advocates  .
However , the unfounded argument is not adequate to outlaw the use of human tracking technology .
Jacques Ellul noted that "To be sure of apprehending criminals , it is necessary that everyone be supervised"  .
Safety of mankind is not worth being sacrificed just for the sake of their privacy .
A balance should be reached between the two extremes - the banning of human tracking technology and privacy being stripped away from innocent citizens .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned as it helps preventing terrorism and crimes .
Consequently , a verdict should be reached between privacy advocates and law enforcement agencies as innocent citizens have the rights to live in secured environment without facing erosion of their human rights and privacy .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in panies or healthcare professionals to an individual's genetic information may cause invasion of privacy and discrimination .
Although medical personnel are entrusted mercialization and easy access to certain genetic testing may lead to compromising situations for members of the public  .
For instance , genetic information that falls into the hands of insurers and employers e , education , mental well-being , housing status , health , and medical treatment .
Racial discrimination still exists today in various parts of the world despite government efforts to eradicate it .
Who can say what will happen if a patient's genetic information falls into the wrong hands ?
Besides that , disclosure of genetic information to close relatives without informed consent may also cause internal family problems .
Often , prediction based on genetic information is uncertain , especially by those who are not well informed about the nature of a disease .
This misunderstanding not only creates unnecessary psychological , economic as well as social burdens on the carrier of a known genetic risk , family ties will also be affected .
A couple with a positively tested disease has to sacrifice their dream of having children as they do not wish to pass on their defective genes to their offspring .
As such , the couple suffers in silence , having to face social stigma and having their dreams of building their family shattered .
Moreover , the in-laws , usually the more traditional type , may be dissatisfied with the daughter-in-law not being able to produce a 'perfect' offspring , or produce any offspring at all , to sustain the future generation of a family .
In conclusion , the patient of genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Until proper steps such as enactment and reinforcement of laws are taken by the governments , genetic information of individuals should be kept private and confidential to avoid exploitation by unscrupulous parties and also to avoid disintegration of family relations .
The release of genetic information of a patient has wide and lifelong implications on his or her life , and therefore this vital decision should be made after careful thought .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in panies .
Applicants for insurance will be under increased pressure to undergo genetic tests and those prone to diseases are less likely to be eligible to buy insurance .
In conclusion , genetic testing results are a matter that should be kept private for the benefits of the patient and should only be released on an absolute need to know basis .
Genetics plays the role in every disease .
Genetic testing informs individuals and family of their genetic status; this knopanies may deny or increase their premium for carriers of certain genetic disorder  .
Thirdly , family members generally inherit the same set of genetic codes from their parents , and may be susceptible to similar diseases  .
However , one would not be able to judge their preparedness for such information .
It may not only cause unnecessary distress and anxiety to relatives , but will also unravel family secrets; namely adoptions and parentage  .
Thus , it is still up to the discretion of individual to go for genetic testing if they are at high risk .
Therefore , individuals whom requested for genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
"The individuals requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in e up with anti-discrimination acts to protect their rights , educate the public so as to minimize genetic discrimination , and build infrastructures and prepare the medical team to provide them with proper care .
Thus , individuals should not have the final say , as it will benefit the individual , their family , and the society .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
In modern times , there is an increase in the types of threat that can affect a nation's security .
People need to collect intelligence about the situation before it can act against it; this has led to the increasing employment of surveillance technology .
The use of surveillance technology has raised concerns over the intrusion of personal privacy  .
Hopared to traditional passport controls and surveillance methods .
Consequently , not being able to track terrorist movements could allopromise of the nation's security and could pose a danger to people and their health as well as the country's socio-economic stability .
A better solution would be the introduction of a privacy act .
Over the years , there has been an increase in the use of surveillance technology .
This has brought about a pletely banned .
Surveillance technology can be used to control the outspread of acute diseases .
Firstly , the use of electronic cards allomunication provider , SingTel , the location of our loved ones can be detected readily by this new surveillance technology .
.
This is very useful towards families with young juveniles and aging parents because their location could be tracked easily if they are lost in the crowd and thus preventing them from any possible harm they may encounter .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned as it can help to control the spread of diseases and also protect our family from harm .
Furthermore , the banning of this technology may cause more harm to society .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in panies would reduce healthcare coverage , increase health premiums or terminate the health insurance policies in individuals with potential genetic risk .
Furthermore , discrimination imposed by employers and colleagues could influence an individual's self- esteem and psychological well-being .
In conclusion , individuals should have the privacy to determine whether to reveal their genetic results or not since it not only inflicts emotional distress on their family but also subjects them social discrimination .
Advancement and breakthrough in technology has nopanies and authorities .
Moreover , surveillance technology helps protect against bank frauds and illegal activities , such as hacking into personal Internet banking accounts .
DBS Bank has in place security surveillance systems that regularly "monitor and detect any potential form of illegitimate activities"  .
In conclusion , the use of advanced technology to track people should not be banned , as it promotes and enhances the protection of people in many aspects , hence , contributing to a better society .
As the genetic testing is making rapid progress on providing information on the hidden DNAs municated to the public .
Although it cannot be denied that the other family members to some extent also have the right to knopanies can require the testing result before signing for a contact panies judge clients on the testing result and either refuse the healthcare coverage or even transfer this suspect diagnosis to the next generation"  .
This kind of problem will be wide-spreading .
Thus the individual should have the right to decide whether to reveal the result or not , considering his own benefits .
To conclude , the one who request genetic testing should have the final right to determine whether this result should be made public or not .
Surveillance technology as  .
This result is alarming as it suggests of the possibility of a similar effect in humans  .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as the implications are menacing .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Surveillance technology such as RFID  should not be used to track people  .
Do you agree ?
Support your argument monly seen in many places , from leisure places to panies could easily obtain our personal information through social nete vulnerable psychologically and easily manipulated by others .
Therefore , it is ethically puter monitoring and then launch their attacks successfully .
As a result , surveillance technology provides minimal prevention or protection for us .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned as it poses threat to us and is ineffective in protecting us .
Lastly , surveillance technology such as implantable radiofrequency identification technology  brings about potential health hazards .
Today , the use of RFID offers important health benefits such as convenient access to patient's contact information and medical history .
Hoplications such as infections , especially in elderly and weak individuals .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned as it may do more harms than benefits .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it not only ethically wrong but also poses threat to our security and health instead of protecting us .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in

Surveillance technology has advanced rapidly , and it has dominated our lives .
This has brought about many debates on the ethical , security and health issues surrounding the use of surveillance technology .
While some suggest that the use of this technology brings benefits to both country and the puters munication .
It is also been used as a safety to plications to patients' health . .
In late 2007 , an anti-chip activist has raised that for more than one decade it has been knoas  .
This causes a controversy about possible carcinogenic effects; a substance or agent that tends to produce cancer  , that may occur in the implantation of chips on humans .
Thus , this affect patient by adding a new disease to them when they are already ill .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology should be banned as it brings negative implications not only to the citizens but also the world and thus poses a high risk of insecurity to the world .
Surveillance dated back all the e up munity .
Critics of tracking devices have lobbied for tracking devices to be banned as they have to been said an invasion of privacy .
Hopared to its downside .
The main critic of using surveillance technology is the invasion of privacy , this is unavoidable as to safe guard a place , people or nation there are some sacrifices that need to be made .
As seen in the argument the three different areas namely national , disaster and personal security , surveillance technology should not be banned but rather to always to be improvised and improved upon .
Motion: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in e more available to the public .
An individual can request and afford to undergo genetic testing to find out panies for fear of discrimination from them  .
However , by doing so , he is actually putting his family at risk as they will not know whether they too carry the defective gene which would put them at a higher risk of developing the disease associated with the gene  .
Furthermore , the physician would not be able to determine if the defective gene is hereditary and whether the other family members have that gene or not .
Secondly , for his own reasons , such as family disputes , the individual may choose not to act responsibly and withhold the results from family members .
In such cases , the physician would have the right to reveal the results to the family of the individual , especially if the test results indicate that the defective gene is present , there is the possibility that others in the family has the gene as well .
Also , with regards to the problem of discrimination , which is the underlying factor for the individual not wanting to reveal the results , there are laws in place in many countries that states that it is against the law to discriminate against people who have tested positive for a particular defective gene .
The physicians also have their medical code of conduct that states information about the patient is confidential unless it poses threat to others  .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say as to whether the results should be revealed or not as the benefits of revealing the results is substantial to the individual and his family , and it cannot be assumed that the individual will be able to act responsibly to his family in the face of his own interests .
Genetic testing has made possible the determination of genetic diseases .

Using RFID to track people arises many issues .
Firstly , the abuse of RFID invades privacy .
It is hard to guarantee that every racking is innocent and conducted in proper ways and .
For example , overzealous employers and criminally intent people could take advantage of the RFID readers to track employees and victims' movement  .
In this case , victims may lose their privacy even without awareness .
Secondly , because a RFID embedded card is easily to be skimmed and cloned , to some extent , it is a loophole for identity theft .
Using the cloned card , anyone could pass into a restricted area through the secure and locked entrance  .
Hence , using RFID equipped card to track and control entrance is not secure and effective at all .
Thirdly , implantable RFID chips have connections with health issues .
Research showed that "implanted RFID chips caused cancer in mice and rats and may cause cancer in cats , dogs , and humans"  .
Additionally , "although an RFID chip in particular may not cause cancer , the inflammation caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object can increase the instance of tumor development"  .
According to these , there is no way to sacrifice people's health to conduct tracking for any purpose .
However , RFID advocators may declare some arguments for the purpose of alleviating the fear of privacy invasion .
For instance , the reader needs to be within about ten feet of the chip in order to extract data , so it may not handle long-range tracking  .
However , it is still highly undetectable if the reader is installed inside doors or walls .
Furthermore , within such distance , RFID readers could still function  .
Hence , people are still under the risk of being tracked and losing privacy without knowledge .
To conclude , since using RFID to track people raises the possibilities of privacy invasion and identity theft and causes health problems , the use of it should be banned .
Genetic testing is a test pany more money than the company had bargained for  Moreover , employers pany's productivity , such as , costing the company more money on the employees' frequent sick leaves and medical reimbursements  .
In addition , the person munity due to the community lacking the knoes to prehensive protection to all people at risk for genetic discrimination .
Tera Eerkes , founder of personal genetic testing company Qtrait} states that 'this measure does not prevent genetic discrimination against people panies will be forced to hike up the cost of their premiums and might result in healthy individuals being quoted the same rate as the genetic risk group  .
Thirdly , the individual should not be denied of his rights in the decision on whether the result should be disclosed or not , or else , problems might occur .
The European Convention on Human Rights states that "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence ."
.
If an individual is denied of his right to decide on the disclosure of his test result , probably no one will dare to go for testing since they know that they do not possess the right to decide whether the result stays secret .
This will result in dire consequences for example; there will not be proper family planning since genetic disorder is not taken into consideration , which might results in continued breeding of undesirable genetic traits off-springs .
In conclusion , the person who went for genetic testing should have the final say on whether to reveal the genetic testing result so that he will not be discriminated against or even denied of his basic human rights and causes problems
Arguments put forth to ban RFID are faulty .
For instance , it has been argued that the excessive use of RFID tags result in deterioration of personal privacy .
.
However , for the group of people who requires constant attention , safety outweighs privacy issues .
Furthermore , RFID tags can be snapped in half to prevent the transmission of data when it is no longer in use .
Thus , this will not threaten individual's privacy .
Finally , there has been greater concern about RFID not only tracking the data of the patient , but also the patient's actual whereabouts .
.
On the contrary , this is a minor issue as only those with access to hospital's database can interpret the information .
Otherwise , this information is purposeless .
In conclusion , RFID should not be banned as it not only saves time and effort but also ensures one's protection from harm under close surveillance .
Advances in technology have made mass surveillance possible , even to track humans .
Hopletely vulnerable .
It is against the lamit crimes more easily than ever with technology that is so readily available and surprisingly inexpensive .
Another argument to oppose the use of RFID to track people is the possibility of contracting cancer with the implantation of the chips .
"Research in the 1990s showed that implanted RFID chips caused cancer in rats and may cause cancer in humans"  .
Though rats are more likely to develop tumors regardless of the type of injection , "inflammation caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object still does increase the instance of tumor development"  .
Therefore , for the sole purpose of tracking , this sacrifice is not needed .
In conclusion , the banning of the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people would be essential to protect vulnerable civilians from security and health threats .
Radio-frequency identification , more often knoplication of crime investigation , duplication of identity , and in some cases , it can even be used as a political puter hacking .
With the advance of technology , surveillance technology has become prevalent in the society .
Radio Frequency Identification  as one type of surveillance technology is used as a tool to track people .
Although concerns on privacy issues are raised , RFID benefits the society by ensuring safety among people .
Hence , since RFID brings about positive benefits , it should not be banned .
One area which benefits greatly from RFID technology is the health sector .
Firstly , due to RFID , the safety and security of the patients are ensured .
RFID is used to track patients' locations in order to make sure they are safe .
This is especially true for elder patients with Alzheimer .
Patients suffering from Alzheimer have the tendency to wander .
Hence , RFID will be able to lookout for these patients and ensure they do not go missing , making them safe  .
Also , RFID technology can prevent newborns from being kidnapped .
With RFID , the locations of newborns can be monitored .
Thus , if there are to be unauthorized movements , immediate action can be taken  .
With the newborns' safety being ensured , their parents will not have to worry constantly when they are not able to take care of their infants around the clock .
Thus , RFID technology is able to protect the patients and ensure a safe and secure environment in hospitals .
Proponents for banning of surveillance technology in particular RFID argue that the privacy of people is invaded as people's specific locations can be identified  .
If there are standard laws put in place , so that information from RFID tags can only be obtained by authorized people , then , there should not be privacy concerns due to RFID  .
The user can choose whether or not to give out his or her information , as an RFID tag can be broken into two so that information will not be transferred  .
Since , privacy concerns are not much of an issue , RFID should not be banned .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology particularly RFID should not be banned as it results in a safe environment and the privacy concerns regarding it are not much an issue .
The completion of Human Genome Project has contributed significantly to the rapid development of genetic tests valuable tools that aid in diagnosis and prevention of genetic diseases .
Hopelled to peting obligations met by physicians , the genetic care and counselling organisations have devised guidelines which accept disclosure to relatives without the consent of those tested when there is going to be a high degree and immediacy of risk faced by them  .
It has been argued that genetic discrimination will arise in the context of insurance and employment if the decision is not made by those who are tested .
However , there has been limited evidence of genetic discrimination in both areas of insurance and workplace based on recent research .
Moreover , a policy statement by Insurance and Financial Services Association  in Australia have made it mandatory that genetic testing will not be considered a requirement for policy risk assessment .
The statement also claims that the insurance industry will not utilise the genetic information of one for risk assessment of their family member  .
In conclusion , individuals requesting for genetic testing should not be given the full authority to make the final decisions in results disclosure as it coerces doctors from fulfilling their duties in promoting the wellbeing of the society .
Modern advances in genetic research have helped scientists and doctors learn more about genes and homend several other alternatives if the patient is insistent on withholding the test results . 
In conclusion , the medical professionals are able to appropriately handle the delicate issues of genetic testing .
Hence , they should have the right in whether or not to reveal the results of genetic testing .

The Security Implications of VeriChip Cloning  September 10 , 2009 from w .pubmedcentral .nih .gov/articlerender .fcgi ?artid=1656959
Surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification  makes use of technical means to track individuals .
This has brought about many controversial issues on the privacy and health concerns surrounding the use of RFID .
While some argue that the adoption of RFID is a violation of human's privacy , it is indeed helps to protect the safety of family and public and identify patients .
Hence , the use of RFID should not be banned due to the uses it brings about .
Human genetics has made tremendous leaps over the past years , and consequently made significant impact on many people's lives .
As such , the growth of genetic testing technology has initiated considerable debate over the privacy and confidentiality of genetic information .
In any cases , I advocate and concur that the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing or not .
This is due to the legislation polices that have been implemented for genetic testing as well as the moral aspects of genetic testing on individual or third parties involved .
Firstly , genetic information is not like any other medical information .
Basically , it is far more confidential as it may contain more enhanced personal health issues of individual such as determining whether one carries any defective genes .
Hence , it is rightful to say that genetic information should be kept confidential and could only be revealed by the individual .
In accordance with United States federal law , it states that such medical information should be kept confidential and genetic professionals or doctors do not have the right to disclose any information without seeking the consent of the patient .
Though , they may assist the patients by informing them the likelihood of their relatives contracting the same diseases , the final decision ultimately still depends on the individual .
On the other hand , critics may argue that genetic professionals can interpret the genetic testing results more accurately than the patients .
Thus , they can explain the implications of the results more precisely to the family members .
However , only the patients will understand the family members' different behavioural patterns .
This means that they are more appropriate to reveal the results by using a more desirable method .
As a result , they may help reduce the psychological stress on family members .
In conclusion , the decision of whether to reveal the results of genetic testing should lie only on the individual and not other third parties involved .
Any disclosure of results by third parties will be considered breaching the genetic privacy and confidentiality law and may cause unnecessary moral implications .
The advancement in Science and Technology has lead to many possibilities , one of which is the ability to predict one's risk of contracting certain diseases , mostly hereditary , via the study of one's genes .
Called genetics testing , the test results , though not definitive , are highly accurate .
Hence this predictive power leads to one of the many controversies- should the individual have the final say in whether to reveal his/her results ?
Because the results could potentially be used to save lives , yet at the same time be misused , the individual requesting the test should not have the final say .
In fact , this authority should go to the medical professionals; basically the physician undertaking the proceedings of the test and has the part in interacting with the patients firsthand .
Genetic testing is an issue that mankind has place great emphasis on .
After test results are analyzed by physicians , there is a dilemma if the information should be made knopanies  .
Hopanies should have the rights to request genetic information from their employees or clients directly , or indirectly from medical professionals who has a better interpretation of the genetic test results .
In conclusion , although on the surface there seems to be disturbing issues in sharing genetic information , but when observed in depth , the information when shared can be more of an advantage to the individual as well as those around him .
Eventually , the stand that test results should be made known to others by the medical professionals should hold .
The use of the technology such as radio frequency identification  in tracking people has been heatedly discussed recently due to privacy and security concerns .
Nevertheless , these concerns are outmitting crimes again .
Thirdly , RFID helps to identify patients .
A RFID tag plete medical history can be implanted to enable treatments by doctors according to their conditions .
Furthermore , RFID tags help to prevent paring to other munications and broadcasting .
Moreover , World Health Organization's research also shows that under certain limits , electromagnetic magnetic field from RFID will not incur any negative health effects  .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people due to its advantages in ensuring the safety of loved ones , public and also identification of patients .
Advancements in technology have alloplications and hence cause health problems .
Nonetheless , these problems can be solved promised .
Restrictions can also be made to prevent leakages .
With regards to health concerns , precautionary measures can be put in place to ensure the safety of the human implants .
Operations can be carried out plications .
In conclusion , RFIDs should not be banned as it can benefit us e the problems so as to ensure its optimal use .
Today , Radio Frequency Identification  technology has been used almost e as hospitals used a "specially developed Hospital Movement Tracking System  to trace the movements of Health care workers , patients and hospital visitors ."
Secondly , the use of RFID to track people is for the safety of workers who are working in hazardous working conditions .
In an event of an accident , rescue operators can locate workers who are RFID tagged and save them as soon as possible .
.
Moreover , RFID technologies are durable which are able to withstand adverse conditions .
.
Thus , this can help reduce casualties and assist rescue work to proceed smoothly .
Arguments against the use of RFID to track people could be the long- term health implications to the human body .
However , the World Health Organization has found out that safe use of RFID will not have any adverse effects on human's health .
.
Moreover , others oppose this as it causes invasion of privacy due to leakage of personal information to the third party .
.
Nevertheless , there has been data protection technology that is already in place to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing . 
There should be a limit on public spending on the aged so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development  is a suggestion that should be implemented in order to combat the rising cost of healthcare for the elderly .
With the rapid grofort , causing doctors to pensate for the failure of children to look after their parents .
Children should be taught the importance of filial piety since young to ensure that they do not abandon all of their responsibility of taking care of their parents pel children to support their parents if the children are capable and the parents are in need .
An example would be the Maintenance of Parents Act in Singapore , where parents could lawfully demand support from their child in court .
In conclusion , there are many reasons on why and how public spending on elderly healthcare should be limited to allow government to channel the money to other areas of development .
While healthcare for the elderly is still important , however governments must ensure that other important areas will not get neglected as well .
Ageing population is a serious problem faced by many developed state .
It is mainly caused by the increased number of elderly and the drop in birth rate .
The ageing population is creating many social problems such as health problems , high government expenses and high income taxis , e e do not have a medical care account e ineffective in easing the ageing process .
Many states have introduced housing policies , which allow the young couples to live near their parents or giving priority in purchasing house to those people who have married .
This allows the couples to take care each other especially when they are old , or to take care their parents when they are still young .
However , the states fail to realize that people's value towards family is changing today .
The family bonding in most western society is very weak and the young generation does not really have a sense of filial piety in their head .
Also , the stressful working market created by capitalism today is taking away too much time and effort from people so that they cannot spend them with their family , or even cannot think of having a family .
It creates modern value that allows people of opposite sex to live together without having a family .
So , what if people do not get married ?
What if the idea of family is vanished ?
What if the young no longer care about their parents ?
If all these assumptions occurred , the housing policy therefore will not be relevant at all .
Hence , besides housing policies , the governments should also raise the awareness of having strong family bonding .
In conclusion , most of the current policies in easing ageing process have their limitation or ineffective .
The fundamental problem is because the states fail to realize the social problems behind , which contributed to the stressful ageing process .
Hence , in order to ease ageing process , the policies should be designed to solve the root of the evil rather than just focus on the surface of the problems .
Population aging , as stated in the introduction of the report World Population Aging: 1950-2050  is the process by e a proportionally larger share of the total population .
It   stated that average life expectancy for the petitive mon mindset that young people have a higher level of modate to the needs of the elderly .
In short , life today is not similar to the past , challenges lies ahead e . The effects of the aging population maybe exaggerated , but we should not lack foresight and neglect it .
Therefore , government and policy makers have to put more effort to ease the aging process as the elderly are still experiencing inadequate protection .
One of the major concerns of Singapore is its increasing aging population .
Today the median age in Singapore is 36 years .
By the year 2050 , our median age e for the elderly . .This is done e from the age of 65 for life .CPF is a mandatory saving scheme and therefore it ensures that the elderly pared to just increasing the official retirement age .
By encouraging re- employment , the government is assisting the elderly to lead an active and productive life .
Life-long employability also helps the elderly to accumulate more pared to the elderly .
To tackle this issue the government have introduced the Workfare Income Supplement e tax and it is ing years , the government have introduced the 3M that es severely disabled , they can get a monthly cash payout .
To ensure that every elderly gets medical attention , the government have built nemodate more patients .
The government have also upgraded infrastructure to help ease the aging process .
Upgraded infrastructure helps the mobilization of the elderly .
The Housing and Development Board have been building more studio apartments to accommodate senior citizen .
.Nefortably .
Ageing is an inevitable part of life and it is often not easy at all to deal ing more accommodating for the elderly .
Indeed , developments like companies becoming more inclined to hire older panies hiring more numbers of older ing dated .
In Singapore , seventy-five percent of unionized companies have committed to rehiring older panies already have in place formal re-hiring procedures in addition to ad-hoc arrangements that are commonly made .
.
More unionized firms to re-hire older e is noe serious enough to be highlighted in Singapore's National Day Rally .
These two policies are some of the ways that governments are looking into to help the elderly have a better and easier life during their twilight years .
Ever since the "Silver Tsunami" se
The issues of age challenge the e up petition , Singaporeans nopanying life- time commitment of raising a child .
Therefore , due to these plex and multi- faceted challenges to the whole of society .
The government should first understand and address the changing mindset and values of today's society towards problems created by the fast aging population before implementing the policies .
Merely depending on legislation will not help to improve the attitudes of the society towards the elderly significantly .
Instead , this will bring about further resentment and result in a strain of relationship between the young and the old .
In all , moving beyond law to enhance the perceptions of elderly is a more practical way to increase the ability and willingness of the society to coordinate with the government in tackling the "grey tsunami" .
With the gropromises the economic development of the country .
Suppose a country prise of over 130% of Gross Domestic Product  ever since mid 1980s .
The main products being export out of Singapore are integrated circuits , computer parts and accessories .
Since export plays a significant role in contributing to the GDP of Singapore , a vast amount of finance should be diverted to R&D .
Therefore , by providing education and investment into R&D help generate capital for the country .
Economic growth leads to an increase in standard of living which benefits the whole society including the aged .
A budget should be set for the public spending on the aged .
In fact , the governments should adopt and develop appropriate systems and programs customized with respect to their cultural , economic and social context .
Furthermore , it is beneficial for governments to exchange pointers and assist one another in coping with the effects of greying population .
This help to ensure that majority will age with security .
Keeping the aged in mind , we must never neglect the future generations since they will be the ones who will support the nation .
Therefore , we should first cater the needs of the younger ones .
Public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas that are of equal , or even greater , importance .
A substantial amount is spent on the elderly annually , and this sum of money can be put to other uses .
Maintaining and sustaining a country is not just about looking after the aged , but also in developing gropared to younger workers .
Therefore , there should be some government intervention with regards to employment of the elderly , as this will assist them in securing a place in the workforce .
Not only does it benefits the government as spending on the aged can be reduced , it also benefits them both economically and socially .
Longer working years will allow the elderly to accumulate more wealth for future use in times of need .
With this accumulated wealth , they will then be able to meet their basic needs and be less dependent on the government when they retire from the workforce .
Furthermore , working can help to decrease boredom in retirement , as time will then be spent engaging in productive activities at work , and not whiled away doing nothing .
These benefits of longer working lifespan can be made possible if employers are willing to hire the aged , who can then be self-sufficient with minimum , or no , help from the government .
The benefits of limiting public spending on the elderly is seen when this amount of money can be channeled to other areas of our country's development .
One such area is defense , which is exceptionally important to an island country like ours .
We have to be prepared against terrorism and external attacks by other countries , at all times .
Apart from defense , the government needs to invest in out country's development as well , and this includes improvements in our education system .
This will then ensure that our future generations will learn more and benefit from it , and it is of great importance as they are the future pillars of our society , who will lead our country to greater heights in order to be a successful and progressive nation .
There are clearly many areas that the government has to spend on annually , and the graying population is one of it .
However , other areas should not be neglected , as our nation's growth and development is of vital importance as well .
Many ways are , indeed , present to help limit public spending on the age .
It will be made possible if these are strongly enforced , and high cooperation among citizens of our society will help to deal with this issue too .
It is e a burden to their families as an example .
In that case , if the fiscal costs on the aged are cut doe to their hands .
Living in poverty , the younger generations groe old .
And sadly , the circle of poverty goes on .
The Ease Of The Aging Process : Through Research & Development and Government Policies
During the post World War 2  era  , there mon diseases that an elder has is osteoporosis .
Osteoporosis is a condition of decreased bone mass .
This pared to the previous imaging technologies .
Therefore , through advancement in Medical technology , the quality of life for the aged is still high and it enables to lengthen the life span of human .
According to the United Nations , 1 in every 5 person throughout the e up e level , the government e up es to childbirth .
One of these considerations for couples is the need to strike a balance betpared to an elderly as they can contribute to the company for a longer period of time .
Some might disagree that even though they cannot compete with the younger generation for jobs , the government does organize job fairs to help elderly seek jobs .
However , although these job fairs provide more working opportunities for the elderly , the success of such job fairs is largely dependent on the receptiveness of the elderly's expectations to the new job scope .
Furthermore , there should be a maximum cap to the increment on retirement age as we also need to consider the physical capabilities of the elderly .
All these obstacles show that raising retirement age does not address well to the concerns of an elderly .
Therefore , it is clear that social policies do not always meet the needs of its catered groups .
No matter how well a social policy is constructed , there is still loopholes that are often neglected by policy-makers .
This shows that much more can be done to improve the different kinds of policies .
Furthermore , it is important to note that social policies should be flexible so that they can make suitable changes to meet the demands of the society at different points of time .
Once the demands are being met , the route to easing an aging population would be much more smooth-sailing than it would have been thought .
Many developed countries are nomodate to this burgeoning age group .
Despite this , the crux of the issue here lies in hoing age

The rise of aging population has become a major issue in most parts of the ing up petiveness , panies to hire older es .
Therefore , current policies and campaigns are effective in easing the social aspect of aging process .
Moreover , with current technology advancement , we can tackle the physical barriers of aging problems such as low birth rate , increased productivity and reduced physical effects of aging , which may partly attribute to elderly low self-esteem .
With current technology , infertile couples can have a baby through In-Vitro Fertilization  .
In addition , in Japan , researchers and scientists have invented robots to replace older workers in order to increase the workforce .
With potent medicine , the aged are able to live longer and healthier .
Others may argue that the main cause of aging problem is actually longer life span itself .
However , it does prove that current technological advancement is indeed effective in prolonging the population's life span .
With longer life span , people can continue to contribute to society by imparting their knowledge and skills to the next generation .
By doing so , the aged will be more appreciated by the public and also it does help to improve the country's economy with an increased workforce .
Therefore , having longer life span does help to ease aging process .
Hence , technological advancement does help to ease the economic , social and physical aspects of aging process .

Due to poor fertility rates and late marriages , the government is noe .
Although forking out a lump sum of money for medical fees is inevitable , the government should not neglect the economic gropelled by lae earned while they are active in the work force .
.
Minor monthly contributions made during their working years will definitely accumulate to a substantial pool of wealth for their retirement days .
Diverting funds to other more vital areas of improvements has its benefits too .
Firstly , there will be economic growth and country prosperity .
Singapore has strived hard to achieve the status as a tourism hub , and the revenue that could be generated from it alone should never be overlooked .
Therefore , if more funds are diverted to it instead of the elderly , there is no doubt that the country will experience tremendous economic growth and be prosperous .
Secondly , the future workforce of the country will be very productive .
A productive workforce is often defined as one which possesses the best qualifications , and education emphasis is the only way to go about it .
Thus , expanding the current budget on education will surely result in a larger and more affluent generation in the future .
Spending on the elderly is necessary , but it could be done on a ration basis .
We've discussed the far-reaching effects of diverting to other more vital areas of improvement and it outweighs any existing issues .
There are also other available alternatives which could be implemented to deal with the medical needs of the elderly , such as the stressing of filial obligations and the introduction of retirement schemes .
The limit , however , should be duly considered by the government in line with its current policies .

As Singapore has been facing aging population since 1990s , there has been a shortage of skilled petitive in order to be successful .
This can be achieved by managing resources efficiently in areas such as investing in foreign talents and education plished researchers petitive edge in the globalizing petitive in a globalizing world .
At the same time , there should also be certain amount of public spending on the aged as the senior citizens are still part of the society and they should be taken care of as so that a country can progress and prosper .
Singapore has one of the placent thinking that they have already saved enough for their medical bills in the future .
But if one is to be diagnosed panies and help Singaporeans to purchase a basic insurance e due to the 'post war baby boomer aging' effect .
Although Singapore's education system is one of the most efficient in the world , there are still many people not able to get a proper education due to financial limitations .
This might result in a multiplier effect of people with less education earning less and being less healthy in a way .
Also , this group of people might not be able to earn enough to sustain their own medical fees when they grow old thus the burden will again be borne by the government .
Therefore , by paying more attention to education and making sure that all if not most Singaporeans can get a proper education , it ensures that most people will be literate enough to get a proper paying job and thus increasing the working adult is to elderly ratio .
With the increase in the ratio , it will without doubt , relieve the government in financing for the aged healthcare .
On top of it , a case by case basis might be a more plausible way of giving healthcare subsidy rather than just applying healthcare subsidy to the general elderly as a whole .
This will really improve the allocations of funds to those who really need it from people who still can afford the healthcare in Singapore .
Even though healthcare expenditure is inevitable in any country , money does not solve all the problems and it is still very important to educate the people on the importance of retirement planning .
Therefore , instead of encouraging people to rely on the government with subsidized healthcare services , the money should be put into better use like education or other aspect of the nation's development .

and Council for Third Age  , munity .
12 constituencies petitiveness in this fast-paced e a burden to the elderly , especially those who have not been able to save when they were young .
This would give even a larger burden to the working adults and taxes will definitely increase .
However , as we all know , the elderly only constitutes a smaller part of the society , and the younger ones in the social group must be taken care of the same way or more so than the elderly since they are the determinants of the country's future .
More money should not be invested on the healthcare of the elderly who are unwell and not fit for work since they do not have any other means to spend on with that much money given by the government , except for their medical fees .
Instead investing more money in education will increase the likeability of the younger people to secure better jobs , and enabling them to provide their elderly parents financial support , no matter in what condition their parents are in .
Based on the statistics obtained from a government statistical website , The level of education attainment among resident non-students aged 25-39 , despite increasing rapidly in the past few years , is still low at 70 percent in 2008   .This means that the government must set aside more money in instilling awareness of the importance of education towards the young .
This can be done by organizing campaigns , and through media such as advertisements and short documentaries .
The Global Campaign for Education for example , has campaigned in many countries in order to instill awareness towards the importance of education .
Therefore , by succeeding in education and secured better jobs , the working adults will ease the burden of the government from having to invest a lot of money to the welfare of the elderly .
Healthcare for the elderly is important in order to enable them to lead better lives .
However , the well-being of the citizens in general is much more important .
As discussed earlier , the younger citizens are the jewels of the country that determines its future .
The country needs healthy and abled citizens to ensure the country's progress .
Therefore , more of the government's investments should go to the younger citizens .
Moreover , these younger citizens are the ones who will be responsible for their elderly parents' health and well-being , therefore thier health and well-being should be prioritized .Based on a study by the .
Commonwealth Fund which is released on Wednesday , in the Healthday News/Detroit Free Press reports , which includes 4 ,052 U .S . adults ages 19 or older between September 2003 and January 2004 , about 16 million U .S . residents care for sick or disabled family members , and approximately nine million of those caregivers have medical problems , according to the study .
Three out of five caregivers said they had trouble paying their medical bills  .
This shows that in the course of taking care of their parents , the working adults do not take care of their own health , and what makes it worse is that they are financially in need , as evidenced by their incapability to settle their own healthcare bills .
Therefore as evidenced by these kinds of scenarios , the government should set aside more money on healthcare  ,especially for working adults who are taking care for their elderly parents , since caregivers of the ill and unhealthy should be healthy in the first place .
In conclusion , the government has shown much concern to the elderly by investing a lot of money in their cause .
However , the amount of money invested way exceeds the amount they need .
Therefore , the amount of money that the government has obtained should be invested on the other important areas of development , such as education and healthcare .
A country needs to progress , and this would never be achieved by solving one part of the problem only , but all the parts that lead to the problem .
In developed countries such as the United States , Japan and Singapore , the aging population has been an important issue .
The Singapore government has implemented policies pulsory primary school education and subsidies for students from poor families .
Furthermore , in the 2009 Key Budget Initiatives , the government is enhancing school education by "providing better facilities for an all-round education in every school , enhancing both the size and quality of the teaching force and bringing in allied educators into schools to collaborate pany" .
On the other hand , there is also a setback such that there e pulsory insurance scheme can be introduced to ensure more savings .
The government is also "committing to a substantial expansion of the healthcare sector by investing $4 billion to restructure the heath care system to handle the aging population such as the development of community hospitals" .
Patients can then recuperate at these community hospitals which generate savings and increase efficiency on treatment of more acute cases .
In evaluating the government policies , I do agree that these are workable solutions to a large extent .
However , more research has to be done in order to keep elder dependency low and provide cost effective and affordable healthcare .
In 1950 , there e up pared to a plain .
No matter hopared to the past .
What if they do not have enough money to see the doctor ?
Do we let them die on the streets ?
As the standard of living increases , a minor operation will cost at least a whopping $10 000 .
The medicine and the appointments to see the doctors are normally for a lifetime , which would mean more necessary costs .
Some of the elderly may not be eligible for the government policies because they do not fulfil certain requirements .
There are people who believed that the aged should fend for themselves .
However , if we take a closer look , we will see a vicious cycle where the problem will eventually fall back on the children and back to the economy since they will have a keep a portion of their salary for the medical bills .
In conclusion , the government must plan properly to allocate sufficient resources for the aged , yet not forgetting other aspects of the country .
As policies makers decide on how much resources to allocate , they must remember that these policies will be subjected to changes as everything else changes .
Hence , we must be flexible and focused to know which direction our country is heading towards and plan adequate resources properly .
With the continued decline in fertility and the improvement in health in Singaporeans , Singapore faces a greying population  .
In addition , the ageing phenomena are becoming more complex e more modernised , the level of the family social support to the old plex changes in the environment , there are theories on successful aging munities throughout their life time .
With regards to social exchange theory suggests that the degree of interaction of elderly is determined by their ability to engage in social exchange .
We munity .
Companies in Singapore tend to prefer employing younger employees , and pany is undergoing restructuring , the older panies to continue employing the elderly , companies still hesitate to keep them because of possible health problems .
Forcing them to accept less respected job , also mean loe , to earn for a living as retirement age has increased .
This creates undue stress and negative psychological impact on the aged , at the same time a social stigma on them and also inadequate income .
A survey from MCYS  shoe usually inadequate , 29 .9% of them credit it to loe .
Unlike Japan , the companies tend to treasure the experience of older pany , allopetent .
The aged in Japan are very much respected as compared to those in Singapore , hence , aging with more dignity .
Taking a closer look , the success of the policy on employing the elderly is still inconclusive , as it takes years to change the perspective of a society .
At the very least , the elderly is still able to be part of the workforce .
To a large extent , most of the existing policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The HDB housing policy which encourages families to stay closer to their parents allows elderly to continue their role in helping their children or even an additional role as a grandparent .
The HDB provides additional grants through CPF for families to purchase flats within a certain radius of their parents .
With the close proximity , family members can travel to and fro with ease , helping them in terms of household matters and even taking care of young children .
This allows bonding to increase between them and also increasing the self-worth of the elderly .
In terms of improving the ability of the elderly in engaging social exchange , mobility and places are the important aspect .
The government is creating a more disabled and elderly friendly environment by making improvements in housing estates and public areas .
For example , the transport authority aims to have lift facilities in every mass rapid and light rail transit stations .
In order to encourage active aging , the government is bringing activities closer to housing estates like the RC or CC .
These activities include not only physical activities , and also voluntary activities .
The government also set up the Council for Third Age to further promote active aging  .
Presently , though social policies are still solely draft out by the government .
However , Singaporeans can be involved in improving these policies by providing feedbacks through government portals like Reach .
With such initiatives , policies are now more focused in terms of improving the lives of Singaporean as a whole .
Aging population is noing crisis .
The progression of aging could be also alleviated monly affiliated municate and care , not just mainly rely on the development of technology and science .
In addition , plementary healthcare products to strengthen their body against diseases as we well as retaining their mental alertness .
At this point one may wonder that whether the manufactured supplementary healthcare products are safe to be consumed as there are cases that the products are proven to be potentially health hazardous .
However , numerous measures have been imposed by authorities such as the Health Sciences Authority to insure that the merchandises are secured to be utilised .
Nonetheless , consumer themselves have to prudent when selecting the varieties of healthcare products .
In the recent years , besides many issues such as e an unprecedented problem es older , he munity ones e per month into CPF .
Besides , the government also encourages its citizens to /node/28185
In conclusion , for a country to be successful , it not only has to look after the well-beings , in this case , the elderly , but also to ensure the continuous development of the country in the economy , education and technology sectors .
These sectors will in turn ensure the vibrancy of the country , which will lead to long lasting growth .
It is not wise to allocate large public spending on the aged due to social problems such as ageing population , but instead , set the sights further , tackle the root of the problem , which is to educate the public the way to plan financially for their future .
This will help to develop the country as a whole , as it diversifies the country's development .
The most prominent demographic trends in the mon occurrence is not just a short term resultant but a long term problem caused by the falling of fertility rates and high mortality .
Aging of a population has become such a natural process that is happening among most of the developing countries and Singapore is not being spared too .
In fact , Singapore is one of the fastest aging populations in Asia and therefore , there is a need for the government to develop and implement nemodate to this nee about due to the improved in medical technology , public health ae .
Because this group of people petitiveness of Singapore , ing a pulsory for all Singapore citizens to save for future use .
Hence , it is impossible for our government to provide pulsory for all Singaporeans to set aside 6-8% of their salary to put into their personal account that can be used to pay for hospital fees .
Members of the CPF must keep a minimum of $17 ,000 in their Medisave account to pay for medical expenses .
According to statistics , the average active member's balance in 1994 was S$73 ,816 which shows how efficient the CPF saving scheme is .
Therefore with such policy in place , public spending on the aged is already limited in this sense .
It is panying the aging population , much public spending including pension and health provision is expended on the aged .
More and more elderly people , especially some of those e a great difficulty for young people noe .
While the population is shifting toe fortable environment during old age .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
Do you agree ?
Introduction
It is ales to allocation of the budget pie for the country's development .
Whether is it for educational , economical , societal or military advancement , it is of paramount importance that policy makers make suitable decisions in the best interests of the country and its people .
In my opinion , channeling too much government funds to taking care of the aged can have detrimental effects on the country's development .
Therefore , I am for the statement that public spending on the aged should be limited .
Uncontrolled government spending on healthcare or infrastructure for the aged could result in other groups of needy people not getting their share of the government's financial aid .
These include the handicapped , juvenile delinquents and loe families .
These less privileged groups of people are also members of the society e families struggling to make ends meet may be desperate and might resort to robbery and burglary to ease their financial burden .
Teenagers munity .
These are complex social problems that might significantly impact other members of the society , and hence , development of the country , if not handled appropriately .
In a pragmatic view , channeling large amounts of funds to the developments of the country such as research and development and education would in the long run benefit the country's economic growth .
However , it would be morally wrong to leave the elderly who are part of the society alone .
The elderly did contribute much to the country in their younger age and the society should be obliged to look after them when they are older and not cast them aside .
Furthermore , public spending is made for everyone in the society to enjoy and seek help from and we cannot limit the funds for the elderly just because they are not able to produce any returns after enjoying the funds .
Therefore we should not limit public spending to a large extent .
With changing values in the developed countries , people are giving birth to fewer children .
This change in mindset changes the percentage of young against the old .
As a result , the percentage of old is certainly rising rapidly .
With increasing amount of people turning into old age , the portion of the public spending on the aged should not be decreasing instead .
Nonetheless , the focus of a country is to grow and prosper and developments on other areas are seemingly more important .
Therefore , the society has to maintain a high standard of living as a developed world and since elderly is the bulk of the society; we should spend more to help improve their live so as not to lower our overall standard of living .
Hence we should spend on other developments but not to the expense of forgoing that for the elderly .
The aging process is an inevitable part of life .
It brings about physical , emotional and social changes that affect individuals significantly .
Follopared to one in tmendable contribution to the society parison and is present in different cluster of people .
It munal help from charitable organization than for the elder to turn to these organization for aids .
Hence , it munity .
Allocation of the state's budget has to be justifiable .
With competing interests that necessitate public spending , public spending on the aged e first .
A pragmatic government e . Consequently , a larger tax base should then sufficiently provide a larger portion of public finances for the aged .
History reminds us of the contributions by our forefathers .
It is thus the responsibility of the society to look after them .
In countries such as United Kingdom , promise financial resources allocated for the general population .
In fact , investment should be on nurturing of our people as they are contributors to the economy .
Through training , re-training and investing on quality education , it nurtures the people .
Educational institutions provide quality teaching e obsolete .
More public finance on aged promise the investments on human capital .
In addition , it only satisfies the social and moral obligations to the aged .
Being pragmatic , munication , our transport netparison to public funds on aged , government only serves the social responsibility of looking after the aged .
In conclusion , aged people cannot rely on government to take full responsibility for their needs since there are other priorities in country's developments peting interests for financial resources , public finance on aged is least of a concern .
it will definitely put a strain on the economic budget and reaps no economic returns if public spending on aged has no limits .
In this ever competitive e obsolete , exhausted and unproductive .
Hoe a long es to choosing their desired education route and es more significant , spending is unavoidable .
In fact , the resources allocated do not have to be solely for the old as other sectors could also seek betterment from it .
For instance , the Lift Upgrading Programme  benefits the old as prehensive child care system that resulted in many expatriates moving their family over to munity for they had garnered experiences which are of practical use to the young .
The State share a part in supporting the elderly for these are the people who had have a hand in nation building and morphing the society which we lived in now .
Spending on the old does not denote an economic dead end .
To the contrary , the old has the potential to open new doors and bring about more opportunities both within and into the country .
Taking care of the aged is nopromising public spending on other areas of the country's development for the aged is unavoidable .
It is true that by doing so , a country's development and productivity e feeble and require assistance , e families from education .
Therefore , there is a need to organize strong branches of organizations , like Community Development Councils  , to decide e ranking  It is also important to implement measures that require people to rely on oneself rather than government .
On the whole , a country's public spending requires very delicate planning .
Since the aging population is one big issue now , necessary spending on the aged cannot be stingily kept away .
Not only is it due to moral obligation , ignoring the aging population would also result in other social problems that might be even more difficult to solve .
As the government wants to maintain a country's development , public spending on the aged should be limited but not to the minimal .
It should be at the maximum limit where the government can still withstand so as to help as many elderly as possible .
A nation's success does not solely depend on economic growth but the welfare aspect too .
Therefore with careful planning of expenditure , solving aging problem generously would benefit the country in long run .
The aging process is not a pleasant process for humans to go through .
Hoe up fortable one .
This is especially important , considering that Singapore had got one of the fastest aging populations in Asia , according to reports by the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  .
Some of the developments and policies are the construction of studio apartments specially for the elderly , the upgrading of the Housing Board  lifts munity hospital stay .
All these developments and policies have contributed topanies that employed elderly .
These petition for the limited amount of jobs available and increase the unemployment rates .
The positive impacts of raising the retirement age still outpanies and the fact that single elders munity hospital's fees .

One and a half decades ago , many countries had to support the aging population through plish more tasks in a given period e group elderly are unable to enjoy such medicines and healthcare treatments because such treatments tend to be long term care which can be very expensive for them to afford .
In addition , Operations/ drugs have side effects which the elderly might not be able to recover from due to their failing health .
As a result , they might end up having more illnesses that can cause health to deteriorate .
Medical cost will be much higher than before .
In conclusion , the current research and development/policies has not quite fulfilled its aim of helping the elderly cope with their aging process .
The government is helping the general population of the elderly in terms of providing subsidies on research and development such as emphasizing on the importance of filial obligation , finding cures for illnesses that plague the elderly , and encouraging greater productivity .
All these ideas are good but in today's world , it is actually not feasible in helping the elderly to cope with aging process .
Very often , the elderly would be left feeling sad , weak and even outcast even with these current research and development .
The new research and development/policies in the future should be well thought so that they will provide aids for the elderly instead of hindrances for them to go through the last phase of their life .
Aging has been an issue in many countries and especially developed countries .
The declining e due to their loe rises es less agile and thus less productive .

Government e group .
With the close proximity , the physical needs of the elderly panionship from their family living just a fee a burden on the aged physically .
Hence , it is dependent on the individuals' filial piety values that determine the success of the HDB policy .
Evidently , the policies aimed at easing the aging process of a country have various aspects to fulfill in order for it to be effective .
Governments have to look into the economical and societal impacts an aging population brings along .
Apart from that , they have to satisfy the three different needs; i .e .
the financial , social and emotional needs of the elderly .
If any one of these aspects is compromised , Singapore petitive world .
Thomas Love Peacock  once said , "The munity and family .
Hoparison to the elderly .
Thus , the opportunity cost to invest in the education is lower than to invest on the elderly .
Besides , moral value especially to make the children beholden to their parents can be inculcated by introducing the appropriate modules in their education .
This will help the elderly indirectly as the children are trained to embrace the Eastern value to respect and taking care of their parents .
Investment in education will also lead to development in the country as education serves as a platform for further development in all other sectors such as R&D and Health .
Thus , such investment will definitely pay off in the future economic growth .
In view of providing mutual advantage to both elderly and economic development , it is best for the government to revise on its budget allocation so that the right proportion of budget is divided wisely among the ministries in the country .
Elderly should not be granted a lump sum but instead divert the fund to other areas which will lead to future economic growth .
This is because administrating the budget to the elderly is only one-way benefit but if the budget is allocated to other areas such as Education and R&D , everyone including the elderly can enjoy the advantage .
What are therefore needed are a wise policy planning and a closer look at how the allocation will influence our future and society as a whole .
Aging population are compelling governments to create or revise policies and development that may affect life of citizens .
At the same time , this sustainable shift in aging population poses challenges to policy makers .
Policy makers start facing the challenges such as hopanies in the country .
With development in both education and infrastructure , foreign investors panies in a country with a pool of talents and with great infrastructure with this it can boost up the country economics .
Nevertheless working policies and development to ease the aged can help with the country expansion .
This can be achieve by emphasize in increasing and raising more productive children in the further generation as mention "by raising more productive children so that the cost burden is spread over a larger and more affluent future generation"  .
Raising and increasing productive children not only can , attract foreign investors to invest in a country with pool of talents and the burden of looking after the aged population is being spread out with prosperous further generations .
At such , a win- win situation can be achieved as we not only ease the aged population but also assist in country expansion .
Next , advancement in technological tools is required to ensure the sustainability of the health care system .
These technological tools are developed to make life of the aged easier , less stressful and even healthier for them to continue live independently .
For example , monitoring systems are currently researched to allow the aged to remain in their homes longer even they are being treated with chronic diseases , rather than moving them into a nursing home which may incurred more costs .
The dae less acute prehend forts .
Another policy suggests that money be invested in the educational system , so that more productive children are raised , "resulting in a larger and more affluent future generation"  .
I feel that this is the key solution to easing the aging process , for a more productive younger generation means that all costs required to keep the aged healthy and comfortable can be borne by this efficient younger forts close at hand , al/technical_reviel
On the contrary , the increasing in public spending on the aged by the government will increase the fiscal budget .
This will inevitably increase the government's load .
Therefore , the spending in other essential areas such as infrastructure , financial , and education will have to cut down .
The cut downs of spending in these essential areas might hinder the growth of a country .
Considering these important factors , many people will eventually support that public spending on the aged should be limited .
However , in my opinion , every choice we made definitely has an opportunity cost which means something has to be given up in order to attain the objective we want .
So , I think with proper planning on the spending by the government , we should be able to meet the balance between public spending on the aged and other essential spending .
In conclusion , the public spending on the aged should not be limited because it is as important as other areas of the country's development .
The country's budget is generated through taxpayers' contributions and returns on investments made .
At present , a substantial amount is spent on the elderly every year through direct and indirect promises the opportunity cost that this amount can be used on , namely on education , health care and creating economic groforts that a thriving market economy is able to provide .
The government can attract foreign investment ventures and increase the competitive edge of firms by reducing tax and rent abatement .
The government can also create a more competitive labour force promising their pete in the global market , Another option is to allocate part of the budget to Research and Development for local institutes to attract and develop the best talents .
This can be exemplified by the efforts the Singapore government had been making to finance the Agency for Science , Technology and Research  .
All these evidence shol
Recently , studies can be shoing to have the fastest aging populations in the e a risk to economic groing so serious .
Those people aged 70 and above have even weaker health than people of aged 50 to 70 .
They need money to support their increased health care costs because they have already used up their savings .
As so , they will place further demand on government funds .
At this point , one may wonder that aging population is a very important issue to take note .
However , country's development is also one of the matters that Singapore needs to be concerned of .
The country's trade , finance , transport , sports and education are key factors to drive a country's economy which cannot be neglected .
Having to maintain good trade relationship with the other countries such as having free tax and levy on imports and exports will help to grow the economy and benefit the people in Singapore .
Spending on education will help to nurture the people to have a good education from young and make Singapore a good place to seek education .
Development in sports such as hosting the Youth Olympic Games will be a great boost to the tourism sector as the Games is expected to generate a minimum of more than 150 ,000 visitors per night for Singapore  .
All of these will boost the county's economy .
Singapore is moving through a transformation to an aging society .
The challenge is to encourage healthy and productive life of the aging population and find ways for them to contribute more to the society so that they can play a valuable role for the country .
The government should not use aging population as a reason to limit public spending as they always encourage productive and healthy living for the elderly people .
They are still very important to the country and the government must play a part to take care of them .
Aging society is a primary concern for most parts of the modate the older population , but hopetitiveness .
They also have a referral centre to help jobseekers .
This allopetitiveness in the pete internationally .
For that reason , student exchange programs in schools are increasing .
Similarly , the government should have subsidies to encourage the underprivileged students to sign up and allopetitiveness of the workforce by having and encouraging people to upgrade their skills .
The other way is to have students receiving quality education since young .
In conclusion , the government should have wise policy planning .
A significant amount of money should be diverted to other areas such as education and research for the country's development and a smaller amount for subsidies in medical and healthcare .
Public policies that encourage and facilitate education , basic research , and the application of promising technologies can enhance the well-being of current and future generations of older people  .
This is true as when public funds are directed into research , education and technology , it initiates economic growth .
With economic growth , it means increasing revenue for the country .
Subsequently , with the increased public funds due to a good economy , the government will have a larger budget for the aged .
Every year , governments take into serious considerations on the allocations of their limited public spending .
In Singapore's Financial Year 2009 , the expenditures allocated had been revised and redistributed .
They are social development  , security and external relations  , economic development  and government administration   .
One of the reasons panies are not willing to offer a higher salary rate even if they manage to secure a job .
Hence , it is vital that government does its part by diverting more of its spending to help the aged .
Although these issues can be address by not limiting the public spending , there are still other ways to resolve them by diverting the money to another area - improvement in the education system .
Education prepares the younger generations for the future workforce , making them more affluent and teaching them to achieve success .
In addition , it emphasizes the importance of filial piety which encourages children to have the full responsibilities to take care of their aged parents when they grow up .
The provision of a higher standard of education also encourages the children to be more independent for their own survival in the future .
It also creates a "work more and save more" mindset so as to reduce government dependency .
Most importantly , improving the education system helps in developing the country socially and economically , so diverting the money to this area is a more effective and efficient way to help the aged indirectly .
Secondly , creating more job opportunities is another area whereby money should be diverted to .
In order to reduce the needs of the aged to fully depend on the government , the government should encourage the aged to support themselves instead .
It is impossible to support them in the long- run as there are many other areas of concerns which the government needs to look into as well .
Hence , with the creation of more jobs , the government can assist the aged to secure a job and allow them to support themselves , with the condition that they are still in healthy conditions .
It also allows the younger generations to easily secure a job and support their aged parents independently .
All these promote social and economic developments of a country too .
Looking ahead , jobs creation is a more resourceful way in developing a country with its public spending .
With regards to all the points mentioned , it is concluded that public spending on the aged should be limited .
The idea of limiting the spending on the aged and diverting the money to the improving of education system and creating of more job opportunities is to prevent the over-reliance of the aged on the government , eliminating the wrong perception of "I will still survive with this 'free' money from the government" .
Therefore , since the improvement of education system and creation of more jobs bring about more long-term benefits than having an unlimited public spending on the aged , money should be diverted to these areas as part of the country's developments which eventually , will impact the aged positively .
* "To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
Do you agree ?
Discuss this statement in relation to your particular field of study or interest  .
Thirdly , the shrinking ratio of younger generations in the future indicates the importance of elderly to remain productive to the economy .
Generally , it is assumed that the young should support the elderly .
The younger generation should remain in the workforce while the elderly tend to retire at a stipulated age .
However , this scenario may change in the future due to the lack of human resource in the job market .
To prevent the disruption of labour market , elderly are likely to remain in the work force in the near future .
Thus , an elderly friendly environment is essential to enhance the efficiency of the work force .
As the country ultimately benefits from the productivity of the aged , it is rational for the government to utilise public spending on the aged .
Therefore , the public spending on the aged is as crucial as other areas of country's development .
In conclusion , the assumption that public spending should be used in other areas of country's development due to the lack of productivity of the aged is flawed .
Increasing awareness on healthcare has allowed the elderly to remain productive in the workforce which in turn benefits the country as a whole .
Therefore , public spending is essential due to the high healthcare services fees , the lack of resources to support the growing numbers of aged and the labour input of the aged in the society .
In essence , public spending on aged is rationalized and valid as the aged remain to be a valuable asset in the country .

The aging process has indeed become a phenomenon in Singapore .
This is mainly due to a shift in the country's population .
The government has responded to this issue by establishing policies and programs to manage the aging process .
Most of the policies aim to reduce the problems associated pulsory savings meant to meet one's basic living needs upon retirement .
Under the CPF scheme , the Medisave scheme is developed to lessen the impact of medical and hospitalization expenses .
Hoes munity hospitals munity hospitals will free up beds in the main hospitals for acute illnesses .
Easing the aging process by establishing policies that solves explicit problems has proved to be inadequate .
These policies may be useful only as a short-term solution .
The government may need to consider the social changes and needs of the younger population to improve the aging process on a long-term basis .
This may include the impact of the rise in living expenses and the influences of the western culture .
Without considering these social changes , the aging process may increase government expenditure and the burden of the future workforce generation .
Public spending on the aged is favorable , but other areas of the country's development should not be compromised as the resources are limited .
Undoubtedly , the spending on the aged is essential as they have contributed to our society greatly , but this should only be done to an extent and shall not be the full responsibility of the government .
Moreover , the advances in technology , prolonged the life expectancy of every single human , making expenditure for old age soars to a great high , due to the high medical cost .
According to the Friedland and Summer  , if a nation spend more on the aged , besides slomodations for the homeless , e if there are no limitations set on the spending for the aged .
This is because the e , to be self reliance , in order to support their aged parents .

While public spending on the aged is vital , it should not comprise the other aspects of the country's groe , they may face difficulties and restrictions in seeking appropriate medical treatment due to financial problems .
It is therefore crucial for governments to extend assistance to the elderly in the form of medical subsidies , allomon saying goes , "Children are the future pillar of the nation" .
They should be given every right to receive education under any circumstances .
Resources of the country should be diverted into this aspect to provide scholarships and bursaries for the needy children prise of the few who requires assistance from the government .

Being a firm believer of 'Prevention is better than cure' , I agree to a certain extent .
In year 2000 , seven percent of Singapore's total population is over the age of sixty-five , homodation .
By three methods that tackles the problem in a long run .
In conclusion , it is noted that capping of public spending to the aged will provide more cash flow to other sectors , which will in turn reduce and tackle the problems faced now .
All three areas of education , healthcare and social policy are equally important whereby unnecessary funding to other sectors , like to the military , can well be avoided or reduced .
As mentioned by Mr . Lim Boon Heng: "As the population of the aged grows and the numbers grow , the sustainability of a free service is one we have to look carefully at .
Naturally , for those who can't afford it , we should extend help funded by public generosity ."
There is only a certain extent the government can increase its public spending on the aged , in particular home care .
Ultimately , prevention is still better than cure , we need to solve the problem from its root .

There alply to make the built environment accessible-friendly for the elderly .
For examples , the authority ensures the installation of lift at every storey of Housing Development Board  flats and Mass Rapid Transportation  stations , as ings .
They had commented on one shortcoming that there are still a large number of buildings ment that privatized buildings are not accessible-friendly for the elderly .
In addition , lifts and ramps are currently built at those older MRT stations such as Queenstoe For the Elderly under the Central Provident Funds Scheme  , e for elderly panies cope panies to cope panies who are interested to re- employ older workers  .
This is to help them to deal with changes in areas such as wage restructuring and the cost to re-train the older workers .
As such , with these initiatives , the public should be rest assured that the minimum of initiatives will be carried out to guarantee that the elderly can extend their working lives with least problems .
In this way , they can then work to occupy themselves and age with ease that they can at least contribute to the economy .
In conclusion , current research and development have indeed helped the elderly in their aging process in the ways as mentioned above .
Despite the fact that we do not know the exact measurements of how well these developments have helped the elderly , it is for sure these developments are done to make sure our aging population can be well taken care of .
Furthermore , the most important thing here is that we can see everyone to age with ease , grace and happiness so that there will be lesser aging issues to be addressed .
Public spending is the government's expenditure on various sectors , munity-based programmes and residential care for the aged .
This includes elderly homes and activity centres .
Hopulsory pension scheme in 2006 pulsory superannuation system also prepares the people for their old age .
These saving schemes in different countries would help ensure that the people have a minimum amount of savings after they have retired .
Hence they would most likely be more self-sufficient and public spending on the aged should be limited .
Public spending on the aged is the expenditure by the government covering on health , infrastructure and projects aimed at improving the lives of the elderly .
A large amount of the expenditure used is contributed by government taxation on the es from the pocket of the e in the form of subsidised training schemes .
Such courses should be put in place to encourage the e more knopromised and must be put in place by the government in order for the aged to stay healthy and not be a burden to the society .
Instead of spending money on treating the illnesses of the elderly , money should be allocated to promote healthy lifestyle in the elderly .
For example , lessons in gymnasia and fitness centres can be conducted specially for the aged to encourage them to exercise and keep a healthy lifestyle .
In Singapore , petent , and that hospitals and polyclinics have the best available facilities .
In addition , the costs for medical care should be subsidised as some treatments can really be expensive and most of the people promised because they are necessary to maintain a healthy ageing population .
Therefore it is important to strike a balance on the allocation of public spending in order for the country to develop favourably .
Singapore is facing a fast gropanies' standards .
The government also lengthened the retirement age to be 65 years-old instead of 62 years-old .
All procedures of this program are arranged under the nee into effect in January 2012 .
It is hoped that the longer the panies panies and prepared the older petitiveness level eventhough it has a big portion of aging population .
The golden generation itself will be happier since they will not feel to be useless or abandoned .

Yes , I do agree that the current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The current architecture improvement and research and development on technological products for the elderly have helped them to overcome the difficulty they faced ing physically disabled or less e depressed over the problems they faced in the aging process mit sucide .
Although there is an increase in the number of elderly committing suicides , it is only a small number of elderly committing suicides in Singapore e some of the problems the againg population may face in the aging process like fallen eyesight and lack of technological knofortable and easier life compared to the past when there is no such research and development or policies available .

The populations of many countries are rapidly ageing as a result of declining fertility and increasing longevity .
The group of 60 years or over is expected almost to triple , increasing from 673 million in 2005 and 2 billion by 2050 and the share of the elderly is also predicted to rise from 64 percent to nearly 80 percent in 2050 especially in developing countries  .
As the aging problems are getting seriously noe the difficulties by providing various financial supports .
The elderly e . Burden of responsibilities of taking care of their aged parents , taking care of their children , rising cost of living and at the same time petitive society .
Although stress is so common and has become a part of modern life , but munity than you could ever imagine .
In conclusion , public spending should not be limited and divert to other areas of the country's development in order to make their old age into golden age .
Aging population noe the topic for a lot of discussion .
"As early as 1979 , the Institute for Research on Public Policy issued a report monly assumed as "a burden to society" .
This essay also e an actual crisis of the society , and government has taken action on attempt to decrease their social welfare expenditures during period of fiscal constraint .
According to "A graying world"  , there are basic strategies , which policy makers and government can consider implementing to lessen the burdensome of older generations to the younger .
These strategies prove that instead of spending much money on supporting the aged , government can seek for another alternatives to reduce the burden .
The most considerable strategy is that stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow's grown children to support their own elderly parents through informal and family channels .
Originated from Asian cultures , family obligation is the most precious thing , which characterizes the parents-children relationship .
Parents have brought their children up , and in return the children will have the responsibilities to take care of parents when they get old .
It continues for the next generation , who are their little kids .
It is the culture of family-oriented and gratitude for their parents' giving birth and a settled position to them .
Filial responsibilities might be understood in many ways , such as obligation to help elderly parents , or to keep in close contact with them , or to live near them , etc .
Societies in which the extended family is weak and high long-term care costs such as the United States should learn from Asian countries , where most elderly people still live with their adult children .
Diverting money to other areas of the country's development does not mean government will take less responsibility to this social problem .
In contrast , it should be thought as one way to help reduce the burden of aging population .
By investing to other areas such as technology , economics , service , health care , etc .
society can developed dramatically , which is in return , contributing back to lessen the burdensome of the country's development .
Hence , elder dependency could be reduced when the elder can support themselves for their own daily expense .
For instance , in Singapore , young working people who are dynamic , active , creative can take a role as main contributors to the country's budget , while the elder can work in food court or any service jobs .
That is a good classification of working labors in the society that take good advantage of the scarce labor force .
Moreover , by doing so , the elder can earn for their living , have a savings for future need on health care , and have less dependency on their younger generation .
In conclusion , this essay shows a favorable view of social spending on the aged should be limited , and money can be diverted to other areas of the development of the country .
Although it is a controversial issue to talk about aging population and its burden to the society , this essay indicates alternatives government can do besides spending too much on the aged to adapt to the challenge for the future , which is "to ensure that people everywhere will be enabled to age with security and dignity and continue to participate in their societies as citizens with full rights" . 
Countries petitions are conducted , aiming to motivating the elderly to reacquire nemittees have been established in schools , communities , corporate , and government .
The various advisory committees stand out as a platform for the elderly to share their rich experience , which sometimes is quite precious to the young generation .
To sum up , the working barrier of the elderly has been lower and they have found different ways to enrich their lives and contribute to society .

Current development on communities has created convenience to meet the needs of elderly such as barrier-free facilities , security systems , housing , transportation , and so forth .
These physical community's assets help to provide elderly a good quality of life and ease their mental health in the long run .
Hopefully , governments aim to get all elderly in communities fully engaged in social activities and involve them in lifelong learning .
Yet , some elderly are still facing a problem of being left out or discrimination in their old age .
Societies are responsible for stressing filial obligation among public to look after their elderly parents .

Welfare cost for the aged will increase indefinitely as the aging population keep increasing , so without limiting the public spending for the aged , it may eventually take much larger portion of the national budget .
There are also other areas that urgently need government attention as well and some of these can help increase government's fund which in turn will also increase public spending .
Many things can be done to alleviate the problem without increasing the portion for the aged like the CPF policy , but the government still need to think the next step as the aging population problem still growing and growing at the moment .

In conclusion , countries have used various means in ensure a better aging process for the elderly .
This will be further improved as the country is developing on other aspects like technology , education and economy .
However more attention should also be paid as the speed of aging population may exceed the speed of solving curbing aging policies .

The elderly should be encouraged to return to the e and can go up to 75% of the total fees .
With this subsidy , the more elderly pared to before .
Furthermore , plicated surgeries have also become simplified as a result .
Nevertheless , these measures are only methods which make it more affordable and easier to seek treatment but it does not solve the problem .
The elderly have to be convinced to adopting of a healthy and balanced lifestyle .
Therefore , besides providing subsidies , they have to be more proactive in reaching out to the elderly who are not likely to seek out information on staying healthy .
With the overly successful "Stop at Tpanies can contribute by employing them .
Nonetheless , many elders lack skills .
Yet , they are more expensive to employ .
However , it must not be overlooked that these elders are experienced and could contribute in a different way .
Employers could also offer other kinds of employment , not necessarily to be the same job or pay as of their previous employment .
The government has also several programs to retrain older workers and upgrade their skills , ultimately , increasing their employability .
With jobs , the elders could then be self reliant .
Hence , spending on the aged population could then be limited .
An ageing population is an issue that many developed countries are facing .
While it may seem daunting to the economy , all it takes is a lot of planning ahead and the unity of the entire nation .
As our Prime Minister said , by preparing well and early , the present generation of Singaporeans will be able to enjoy healthy and fulfilling lives into their sunset years , without putting a heavy burden on their children and grandchildren .
The aging population is becoming a problem that many people e very costly to the mon illnesses like diabetes , eye cataracts , bone and joint problems , and heart problems .
These problems need continuous attention and therefore incur repetitive and expensive expenditures .
There is also a need to build elderly friendly environment like railings , lifts that goes to every floor of the buildings , and slopes .
In addition , there e a huge burden to the e to the country .
People e more affluent to spend and stimulate the economic groe a snowballing effect causing further improvements in the economy .
Spending to develop the country can generate extra revenue to the country , creating a more affluent society .
This will be beneficial for the elderly and also the working population , as the more affluent society will be able to pay for the healthcare expenses of the elderly .
For the benefit of the whole society , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Yes , I agree that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
In Singapore , the government and society have come out muters; Older HDB flats being upgraded to lifts that stops at each level and car parking area noes e out e a problem to the society but just a natural process in Singapore .
Aging population is one of the issues that Singapore is facing today .
The Singapore Department of Statistics  mentioned in its Population Trend 2008 report that senior citizens aged 65 years and above make up of 8 .5% of the population and it e under pressure .
Having an aging population meant that there es from taxing the e . This action e to support them .
Thus , in order to meet their needs , the government has came up e base on their CPF contributions made during their e and could be for hospitalization expenses .
As the senior citizens are more prone to health sickness , having this Medisave account would greatly benefit them .
Thus , public spending on the aged could and should be limited as the government had came up with several approaches to help deal with the aging process .
Aging population should not be the only issue that is given most attention to as there are other areas of the country's development that would require the public money .
For instance , the government should spend part of the national budget in trying to increase the fertility rate .
Singstat mentioned that despite the slight increase in fertility rate , the fertility rate is still considered low .
Having a low fertility rate would impact Singapore in the long run .
The government could probably use the national budget to provide incentives to encourage Singaporeans to do their part in increasing the fertility rate .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas of the development that would require the national budget .
In conclusion , though there should be public spending on the aged , it should nevertheless be limited .
This is because of the consequences related to doing the otherwise such as pressurizing the national budget as well as the workforce itself .
In addition , the government had already done his part in preparing its citizens for old through the CPF Life and Medisave Account .
Furthermore , there are other areas of development that would require the national budget .
I agree to a large extent that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The aging process means as time passes , the people mon because the elderly tends to have a slomonly and most of the people around the panies have to compete e poorer and responsiveness might be slopanies take this opportunity to penetrate the market panies have actually offer phone models panies panies are attentive to issues regarding the aging population and have done action to help ease the aging process .
Being one of the fastest aging populations in the Asia region , Singapore faces many challenges in trying to overcome this aging problem .
Ever since the last 30 years , the young population in Singapore has shrunk tremendously .
Accounting for less than 4% of the total population back in the 1960s , elderly aged 65 and above today constitute 7 .3% of the total population based on the Singapore Census of Population 2000 .
This projected a significant gromodate to this current changing age structure , on-going development of government policies , covering areas like economics , social and architecture , have been carried out aggressively through these years .
At this point , one may e this problem , government policy is implemented to encourage Singaporean couples to have three or more children if family finances permit .
This includes the implementation of financial incentive schemes , such as the Baby Bonus scheme , to parents binations from their parents .
For parents having their third child , the amount contributed will be doubled .
Purpose of this financial scheme is to assist parents in the payment of the development and education of their children .
Through these implemented policies , it will help facilitate the growth of the fertility rate , while at the same time solve the issue of aging process .
To further tackle the rising trend , government also implemented different housing schemes so as to better allow the families to look after their aged parents rather than putting them in old folks' homes or leaving them to look after themselves .
Examples of housing schemes include the Joint Selection scheme , which helps the parents and their children in their application for separate flats but in the same block or housing estate .
Multi-Tier Family Housing scheme is another scheme which allows preferential treatment in flat application , lower-down payment and also maximum loans for those who opt for it .
The applicants can request for flats that are larger in size with enough space for two independent households .
Through this policy , it helps to create responsibility awareness of the younger generation to look after their aged parents .
Furthermore , it also enables the aged to continue living in the environment that they are familiar with .
Supporting services and subsidies are provided to families with aged dependents so as to assist them and at the same time , help the aged to remain physically and socially active .
Catering to the upward trend of the aging population , initiated programs such as free health check for the elderly are implemented to encourage these elderly to constantly conduct full body checkup to ensure that they are in good health condition and also advise them on the dos and don'ts in their everyday life so as to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Besides that , incentives are also catered for the elderly to further motivate them in conducting health checks .
With these , it will help to ensure that the elderly are physically and mentally healthy and thus more productive in their old age .
As we can see , the aging process is not slowing down .
All the policies implemented were to facilitate the process smoothly so as to reduce the impact of aging towards the society .
I could say that these implemented policies do help a lot in easing the aging process .
Perhaps what we can hope for is the constant innovation and improvement so as to serve the aging process better .

The integration of the health care service providers through the medical policies will result in higher quality and more affordable health care system .
For economic policies , having CPF and raising the retirement age will allow additional wealth accumulation .
Thus , the development of these policies has helped to ease aging process to a large extent .
Ageing has alpared to decades ago .
It is norm that ageing are often associated with illnesses such as Parkinson and dementia as a result , it is a concern of many .
Thus , medical breakthrough by University of Nottingham in the research with regards to slowing down and preventing of Parkinson and dementia from has definitely relieved many .
Although , some may argued that breakthrough in the research do not severed the root of the problem as those who are down with the diseases still could not be cured .
However , one must realized that the breakthrough can help the aged to be better prepared or even prevent being contract with the diseases .
Additionally , since there is a breakthrough , the possibility of a cured cannot be rule out as well .
Besides , if more are able to slow down or even prevent themselves from getting the diseases , the aged can lessen their medical cost which will lead to a reduced cost of living .
Therefore , medical research greatly enhances the confident of aged to face the eventual ageing process .
Clearly , the current research and policies have help to ease the ageing process tremendously .
The breakthrough in the medical research field , not only provide a cushion for the aged with regards to old age illnesses but also help to reduce their future medical expenditure .
Similarly , the CPF policy , put into operation by government , lessens the worries of ageing as medical and life expenses aspects are already well planned for .
Finally the HDB grant policy decreases the worries of the aged living with their children .
It is relatively hard to deny how much ageing had been made much easier .
Aging is a continuous , complex , and dynamic process .
Aging process as defined by Wikipedia is the process of physical , psychological , and social change .
Physical change means that one's health puter .
In addition , there e up e for the elderly in their retirement .
Under this scheme , they can get around $360 to $440 per month upon reaching the age of 62 .
As a result , elderly individuals can enjoy their retirement e into their Medisave account to meet their future personal medical expenses .
Therefore , they do not have to worry for medical expenses when they are old .
Besides that , the government also provides financial assistance to needy elderly individuals who do not have the means to pay their medical expenses .
In conclusion , advancement in technology , economic policies and social policies implemented by the government has helped to ease the process of aging .
Elderly individuals are able to live freely , independently and fruitfully while pursuing their choice of life after retirement . 
Currently 7% of Singapore's population is over the age of 65 , hoe tax and thus solving both problems of shortage of labour force and petitive society e level group .

Due to the ageing of the baby-boomers and the loe governments' and policy markers' concern in the developed mittee , to infuse a culture of personal responsibility and lifelong planning for old age .
Public spending on the aged has been rising rapidly due to the ageing population , because people need more health care as they groplacent stage to prevent any public objection or difficulty to adapt to lesser financial assistance .
Hopromised due to the ageing population .
Infrastructure development affects the economic progression of a country; therefore , it should not be overlooked .
For example , the accumulation of America's public infrastructure deficit over the past several decades has resulted in a variety of infrastructure bottlenecks-traffic congested roads , clogged ports , and an antiquated air traffic system , e is generated .
Therefore , infrastructure development is a crucial segment that affects a country's e . If a country neglects other aspects such as education and infrastructure development , but overly focus on public spending on the aged , its economy will suffer drastically .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
In my opinion , I do not totally agree e petitive age , employers monly suffered from old diseases itantly , driving the country's development .
In The Graying World  , Peterson argues that a lack of limit in public spending would "impoverish future generation" .
However , the withdrawal of governmental support in the health care for the aged would shift the responsibility to the families of these aged and burden the development of the country in the long run .
As argued by Friedland and Summer in Doomsday Predications about Population Aging Are Exaggerated  , the costs incurred by the families would "end up getting shifted back to the public sector through less direct and often more expensive means" .
How would this assist in driving the country's development ?
In addition , discontentment could be stirred up as people may question the lack of governmental efforts in the taking care of its citizens .
Therefore , instead of striving for better development for the future generation , setting a limit on health care for the aged could burden and prevent a country from developing better , in the way that it should be .
Public support for the health of the aged is for a real cause , for the elderly who have difficulties in affording it .
Hence , the public spending on the healthcare of the aged should be practised flexibly and should not be viewed as a hindrance to the development and progress of a nation .

In the recent years , global aging issues are an uprising concern .
The population in many developed countries is aging , and Singapore is no exception .
If fertility rate does not increase , these issues e up munication e up munity hospitals , day rehabilitation centres for the elderly , and long-term healthcare facilities include hospices , home medical , nursing or therapy services and nursing homes .
These facilities mostly cater for families panies might think that it is a more of a burden to hire an elderly petent , and most importantly , younger .
In the current context , public spending on the aged has been significant especially in the developed countries such as Singapore .
With better education system , there mon to see an increasing in the aging population .
As such , governments pared to the past .
We may also have notice that our buildings are often undergoing maintenance and upgrading as it is part of the government scheme to maintain the condition of the building , minimizing the wear and tear after years and most importantly meant for the public to have a better environment to live in .
The above mentioned could be another area in which the government can divert their expenditure to .
Education is another area that the government should focus on as it aids in the development of the country .
The government can invest on having additional amenities in school such as gymnastics; swimming pool; and indoor sports hall as a form of relaxation , providing a conducive environment for the students .
Besides that , expenditure can be channeled in increasing the subsidies in education to encourage people to take up more studies , removing barrier due to insufficient cash flow .
As people are educated , they were able to contribute to the workforce in the near future .
As fertility rates remain stagnant , many countries are experiencing aging populations .
Governments have thought of many measures so as to help improve the aging population situation .
They have invested time and money into research on policies that can help solve the aging population crisis .
Moreover , since such a trend is only likely to happen in the short run , much has been done to buffer its negative impact on society .
Therefore , I agree to a large extent , current research development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Demographic changes such as a groe under pressure as groing up e for the country .
For example , the retirement age in Singapore and Britain used to be 60 and 65 respectively .
Hopanies to invest in Singapore's economy .
The Foreign Talent Policy mon illnesses that old people are inflicted pletely solve the aging population crisis .
It only helps to alleviate the problems caused by an ageing population .
The only way to really solve this problem is to increase the birth rate of the country .
Only by providing more children will the cost burden be spread over a larger and more affluent future generation .
Therefore , I conclude that although current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent , but they have not managed to fully solve the problem .
With the decline of fertility rate in recent years , statistics have shomonly knopromised .
Due to the advancement in technologies and the implementation of efficacy policies by the Singapore government , these have helped to alleviate the problems that are accompanied by the aging process to a large extent .
Take for instance , in the past , due the lack of current research and developments available , most elderly}

The burden on an average e . According to Singapore Tourism Board , Singapore achieved a record of 9 .7 million visitors in 2006 , from 8 .9 million in 2005 , and is hoping to achieve a target of 17 million visitors by 2015 .
In order to achieve the target , Singapore has recently invested a substantial amount of money into the major development of the tpetitive among Asian countries and other popular tourist attractions .
The Integrated Resort is one of the many strategies that Singapore adopt to generate more economic growth and boost the country's Gross Domestic Product  .
There are many areas where public spending should be used for a country's development .
In developed countries like Singapore and Japan where ageing population is an issue , the importance of public spending on the aged can outweigh that of other aspects .
On the other hand , developing countries may invest most of their public spending on infrastructure instead of on the aged because economic development is likely to be their primary objective .
It would be unwise to limit healthcare spending on the aged since different countries have different needs .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited due to its significance in view of the ageing population .
Instead , the government should allow its public spending on the aged to hang around a certain percentage .
I strongly agree pel people to save money for later use .
For instance , China has developed a complete system e and e under great pressure .
All in all encouraging people to set aside some money for themselves is the most wisdom method .
Throughout the years , the issue of aging has become a tremendous challenge for the developed countries .
Due to the increase in the standard of living , better medical treatment is available and this has caused the life expectancy of the people to increase .
People are marrying later in life and this has caused a fall in the fertility rate .
Young people are nopanies e obsolete and there's not much value they can bring to a country anymore .
However , is it really true that the elderly is irrelevant to a country's development ?
This is not the case .
When the government provides sufficient money to look after the elderly , what is developed is the intangible moral value of gratitude and piety .
When a nation looks after their elderly without reservations , the lesson conveyed to its populace is that one should always look after the people who have contributed to our development .
As a result , what we learn then is to be grateful to the people who have aided us .
Such values are the essential element of the society .
It helps create strong lasting bonds between citizens and the result will be a more cohesive nation .
What about education and research and development ?
A strong education system and a strong research and development sector , when situated in a country that is not unified and chaotic will not be able to reap the benefits that they are supposed to generate .
Thus , public spending on the elderly does provide important benefits to the country and should not be limited thus .
Lastly , a country that does not take care of its elderly sufficiently runs the risk of having it younger population abandoning it and migrating to other countries .
No one would like to stay in a country with insufficient care for them in the future .
Majority of them would think that their hard work does not pay off .
They work so hard to contribute to this economy but the result turn out that the government do not provide sufficient care for them when they are old .
Hence , no more future leaders will be staying back to help the country to boost up the economy and run every sector .
This will turn the country into a gray society .
Therefore , public spending on the elderly should still be invested in term of financial policies and benefits .
In conclusion , we should not see elderly as a burden but an asset .
Even thought other sectors such as education and research and development are important to us , we should not forget ours greatly contributors .
There are the ones who build up a nation from the basic to what we have now .
Therefore , we must be grateful to those who aided us and create a sense of belonging to everyone .
In this way , younger generation will then work harder for the nations in the future .
The baby boom in the 1960s and the current lomunication might cause them to lose the ability to pulsory , it is necessary to garner support from the government to provide social welfare services , day-care centres , social support and improvisation of health systems .
Such coordination between the working population and government will benefit the aged who is concern with the provision of welfare from the state and this will give them a sense of security .
An ageing population is a e under pressure as groe tax e for a better economy .
This will allow for better economical growth for the country which in return gives more funding for the government to spend on the elderly as well .
In conclusion , Public spending on the aged should be limited and the money should be diverted to the other areas of the countries development like economic growth , research and development and the welfare of the people as this will allow more business , better facilities and encouragement for the people to be capable in supporting themselves and for their elderly parents , in the sense that the government is allowing the people to solve their own financial problem instead of providing of taking up their responsibilities which allows the government to invest and provide for other areas of the countries development .
Clearly , spending for the aged is important .

Lastly public spending are required to maintain high standard of education in various educational institutions .
A high standard of education is an important factor of maintaining a highly educated workforce in the country .
Investing in education is like investing in the future so the future generations are able to meet future challenges .
In Singapore , the government invests heavily on education through subsidising school fees of schools and post-secondary education institution .
In the Singapore Budget  , the Ministry of Education is investing $7 ,884 million into subsidising school fees .
This is to ensure that school fees are affordable and allowing every citizen to receive a proper education .
Over the years , the problem of a rapidly aging population is becoming prominent and an area of concern for many countries .
Consequently , economic gropetitiveness in the labour market .
The process of gaining knopanies .
Hoing prominent .
In recent time , terrorists have accessed to sophisticated technologies that could create greater destruction to the surrounding and to instil fear in the people .
Hence , organisations and agencies related to national defence ought to receive adequate financial assistance for research and development .
In this bination of effective policies that would allow the nations to grow and flourish .
Aging population is a e up munities can be solved and other essential policies can be sustained .
By limiting public spending on the aged , some spending can be used to sustain economic groes and thus can accumulate more panies to urge them to employ older munities and support necessary policies for the country .
Different countries will need to have different solutions specially tailored to fit their own countries and public spending should be split evenly so that there is a balance in each area .
Presently , existing policies have helped Singapore extensively in providing ease to the foreseen aging crisis .
To achieve successful ageing , the government has implemented various policies to be panies agreed that retirement of older munity .
For instance , accessible infrastructure provides a safe and comfortable environment for the elderly to recuperate their old age .
Indirectly , it also helps to maintain social netmunity .
Last but not least , to ensure that basic healthcare is affordable to all Singaporeans , Singapore has prepared her people with MediShield , MediSave and MediFund .
This is done by putting safety nets to ensure that healthcare remains affordable .
Besides , the government has decided to build more hospitals to cope with higher demands in the future .
Hence , with the multi-dimensional approach taken by the government , Singaporeans are able to enjoy quality healthcare services .
In conclusion , the government has done well to prepare the country for ageing population in the aspects of economy , social and population growth .
However , to allow ageing policies to be truly successful for the future generation , it should be reviewed and remodelled when necessary .
The society should also maintain a positive and mature attitude towards ageing population .
Most importantly , individuals should be responsible and self-reliant to take up ownership of the ageing issue .
Public spending has been increasing in many countries over the years .
With the petitive .
Many countries , such as Denmark and Singapore , have started to retrain their petitive in the industry .
The three reasons provided explained why public funds on elderly should be limited and divert to other areas of development .
These areas will affect how much a nation can support its aging population .
Although the elderly are an important asset , but they are not the only asset a nation has .
In conclusion , the nation needs to sacrifice the elderly temporarily for the benefit of everyone .
By diverting the resources to develop on other areas , the elderly will benefit more in the future .
The nation must not be short sighted and seek to solve problems of an ageing population only .
Policymakers should think of how the nation can solve the ageing population in the process of developing plans that will benefit the other areas .
To achieve this , we need to remember this; assisting the elderly is important but building a nation is more important .
In the developed countries , many countries are facing the problems of fast ageing population .
There panies that are affected by the current economy dopanies to encourage the balance among mitted for their work  .
Government may also spend the amount in development where it can attract foreign talents to the country to solve the problems of manpower shortage .
In order to ensure that there are sufficient funds for these areas of development , the government will have to limit the amount of spending on the aged .
It will tend to create awareness on the serious problems due to the ageing population if public spending is limited .
This is to ensure that the elderly and the working people will not over rely on the government for aids .
In addition , it is the responsibilities of the elderly as well as the working people to plan financially for their future  .
During their contribution to the working world , the aged should be able to plan ahead in advance for their future on the likely cost incurred for health care services .
If public spending is not limited , the aged or the working people may take the aids provided by the government for granted thus they may not work hard during their contribution to the working world .
However , some may think that if the public spending is limited , it will result in pressure on the aged as well as on the working people as they will have to provide for rising health care costs in the future .
Also , the numbers of working people supporting the aged have reduced thus putting strain on them .
In order to solve this problem , the government have implemented certain policies to aids the aged , some of the policies are the introduction of the Central Provident Funds , tax reliefs and the Public Housing scheme .
Central Provident Fund is a saving plan that has provided Singaporean with a sense of security in their old age .
For example , the MediShield are used to better prepare them for the future medical costs  .The implementation of these policies will hence reduce the burden on the aged and thus reduce the public spending required on them .
In conclusion , the government should provide certain subsidies to the aged but to a limit .
If not , the amount of the spending given to the aged will be a bottomless pit .
More policies can be implemented to encourage individual responsibility in taking care of the aged so as to reduce the burden on the government .
Therefore public spending should be limited to a large extent .
Investments in education and infrastructures are important for the country to develop too .
Education allows the younger generation to be empowered with knowledge and helps to cultivate talents which can lead the country and businesses .
Public funds are needed to build educational institutions and schools .
Infrastructures such as public roads and transport systems need to be established too .
With good and convenient infrastructures , the lifestyle of the citizens will improve .
The country will then be able to develop in all areas .
In conclusion , for the country to develop , it is crucial to ensure all areas are taken care of .
Overlook in one area can lead to serious consequences .
Without economic stability , the country will not have enough funds to run the country smoothly .
A weak military force will cause the country to be easily destroyed .
Without education and good infrastructures , the citizens will not be able to improve and maintain their standard of living .
Even though it is significant and essential to help the aged , public spending on the aged needs to be limited .
Excessive spending on the aged will help them in the short run but will also impede the development of the country .
A better way is to evaluate critically on the level of importance of the different areas and balance the public funds according to priority .
"Our baby boomers ing more evident and the increased pressure on public spending for the aged has left Singapore pondering on hopetent or physically-competent aged promised .
Whilst we spend resources resolving the issue pertaining to the aging population , implications such as the increase in societal costs could arise if welfare programs are curtailed , cut and restricted .
Every day , a considerable sum of our money is spent on miscellaneous fees such as transportation fees , education fees , and utility bills , housing maintenance or even healthcare bills .
If these burdens are lightened , people will have more flexibility in spending power , which could in turn help churn the economy .
Consequently , there should be a threshold of public spending for the aged and the welfare programs should be a better attempt to aid everyone in Singapore equally .
Taking into account the issues of not having enough money to pay for expenses , we should all the more fund areas which can in turn generate more revenue for the country .
Through economic growth , funds can be used collectively and more profits and benefits can be allocated to the aged .
This is a cycle .
The only way to deal with this unique matter is to divert money into more productive areas , rather than assigning in all for the aged which have little or no returns at all .
Pen ultimately , by limiting our public spending on the aged , it will not exacerbate the effects of aging population .
But by putting other areas as a focus for economic growth , we can actually ameliorate the whole picture all together .
Singapore's constant upgrading of facilities such as having lifts that serve every floor of a building and replacing stairs promised as it contributes to the groing the future leaders of the country .
For example , in Singapore , seminars , munication skills and decision-making .
Furthermore , when they enter the workforce , they will able to fully utilize these skills and contribute effectively to the economy .
Hence , by preparing and nurturing the leaders of tomorrow from young , they will be able to lead the country to a whole new level .
In conclusion , it is necessary to look at the big picture and pay attention to areas such as tourism , housing and the education system to help in the development of the country .
In other words , there should always be a limitation to the amount of funds spent on the aged as they constantly need support and there will never be sufficient funds .
Limiting public spending on the aged should be done so for the favours of other areas of the country's development .
Besides taking care for the aged , there are several other areas the government should put the same amount of emphasis on e fortable usage .
In conclusion , there are so many other issues of the society the government has to consider other than the aging population .
These issues have similar , if not higher importance , as compared to the aged .
The government should always measure the economic and social benefits and costs before implementing any policies , and implement those with the highest benefits .
But the question is: Will the government be firm enough to make the harsh decision ?
As people grofortable environment to enjoy their retired lives .
Some examples of government's spending on the aged in Singapore include healthcare benefits like the ElderShield and lift upgrading programme in HDB to provide an environment mon misconception that the elderly can rely on the government to support them during old age .
As seen from past experience from other countries , over-dependence on the government prehensive social security savings plans that has provided many e earned by the e . Only then we can increase our capability and independence to support the aged and thus it is wise to limit public spending .
In conclusion , we should limit public spending on the aged in order to ensure that we can be more efficient and ensure that there is better allocation of resources by developing areas that can benefit the entire population .
Also , the government can implement more policies to allow the population to be more independent and increase the awareness of preparing for old age .
Most importantly , the government should divide public spending equally according to the different needs of the various areas of country's development .
Public spending on the aged should be limited to maintain the standard of living of the aged and to reach out to those who are in need of financial aid .
"In Singapore , factors such as a relatively lopared to the younger generations .
Some of the reasons for an aging population are caused by loe .
By setting a budget on public spending for the aged , the government can develop in areas such as building infrastructures , attracting foreign investors , improving education system , and expanding the research and development of defence technology .
Last but not least , the government can use the money to expand on the research and development of the defence technology .
With better defence technology , the government need not spend money on buying defence weapons from other countries and instead , earn they can earn revenue by selling their own weapons .
By limiting the public spending on the aged and using it on defence technology research , Singapore will be better equipped in safeguarding itself as well as earning additional revenue for the country .
At the same time , an expansion in the research and development of the defence technology will demand more manpower .
As a result , more jobs opportunities will be available for not just the future generations , but as well as the elderly .
Limiting the public spending on the aged opens up other areas for development such as infrastructure , education and defence .
These developments will improve the lives of the current and future generation and in the long run , dependency of the future generations when they are old will be minimal as they will most likely have sufficient money for retirement .
Therefore , public spending for the aged should be limited and focused on developing other areas .
Global aging is a critical topic that the monly seen in Singapore plement panies are still discriminating against employing older panies' unwilling rationale  in employing older workers .
Hong Kong has also adopted such practices through its 4 yours CADENZA Community Project which seeks to create an "Elder-Friendly Employment Practice" such as job design , flexible working hours and friendly physical environment  .
This strategy of longer employment seems to be a highly feasible and accepted solution in tackling global aging .
Spread of Financial Burden
Policymakers have also step up efforts in reducing the financial burden of an aging population by providing financial aids and encouraging people to save in advance for their retirement .
Medisave , Medishield and Medifund Sliver are some examples of medical schemes introduced in Singapore to lighten the medical cost burden of its senior citizens .
In addition , the state enforces its main retirement saving scheme , the Central Provident Fund Saving  whereby individuals are oblige to contribute a fix percentage of their monthly salary to their CPF account when they are employed .
In this way , the people are indirectly saving for their old age .
Unity is the Best Strategy
Aging population is a global phenomenon that affects everyone .
With the development of various policies and strategies , leaders must understand that the best strategy is one where everyone unites together in conquering the long term battle of global aging .
They need to recognize that the effectiveness of any strategies will depend on every individual involvement .
Nevertheless , leaders should continue to revise current policies and develop new strategies so as to better prepare and tackle harsher challenges ahead .
It is inevitable that public spending mitted suicide in 2007 fortable living we have today .
After all our education , can we really call ourselves a civilized nation if we close our eyes to the suffering of the elderly living with us ?
Therefore , government's expenditure on the elderly should be allocated such that it is sufficient to help those elderly who are in need .
However , the government should take care of the country as a whole and not just focus on providing for the elderly .
The government should not neglect the need for funding the other development areas such as education and tourism that can boost the country's economy .
With more resources allocated to the country due to its economic growth , the government can also spend some of these resources on the elderly .
Nevertheless , an efficient and well-organized government should have planned the national budget carefully and have allocated desirable amount of funds into the various aspects of spending areas in the country .
This is especially so for richer countries because they have the financial ability to finance sufficient resources into the different areas of development .
Hence there is no need to restrict public spending on the elderly just to have more resources to be diverted to other areas .
Singapore , like many countries in the petitiveness of the economy and increases the strain and burden of the pulsory to all mitments like house installment , e group , the government gives different rates of subsidies to the different classes of wards in hospitals .
For example , Class C wards receive the most in subsidies .
On top of this , the government also strongly encourages her senior citizens to adopt a healthy lifestyle .
For example , regular physical exercises and a well-balanced diet are encouraged .
Public spending is the expenditure by government e earned pulsory savings scheme in Singapore so that they can use this savings to support themselves in their old age .
This is to ensure that people will not face financial problem when they retire .
In conclusion , the government should set boundaries on public spending on the aged so that people will learn how to plan financially for their own old age at the early stage .
Public spending can be also used in other areas of the country's development to boost Singapore's tourism industry .
The aim is to attract more visitors to the country and create benefits to the economy of the country .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to others areas of the country's development
In these recent years , the entire panies from almost every sector of the economy .
The governments are strongly expected to efficiently use money from the national budget to maintain a sufficient economic gropletely disagree .
I personally support the latter .
One more factor that should be taken into account is the moral or ethic aspect .
The elderly used to work and devote their talents and efforts to the development of the country .
Therefore , their dedications and sacrifices should be respected and rather relevantly rewarded by younger generations .
Moreover , policy makers and authorities should set good examples for the young .
A stable society in which all generations live in harmony requires a good moral foundation .
Once traditional values are reflected in the law , the law will be more practical and those traditional values will be more deeply ingrained in the society .
Furthermore , when the younger generation witnesses how their seniors are being whole-heartedly cared , they will have motivation to work harder and contribute to the country .
However , in some cases , the government probably should prioritize other areas of the country's development .
Let's take Zimbabwe as an illustration .
In a country where inflation rate reached an unbelievable figure of 11 .2 million percents , where almost every families have to struggle to put food on the table , where the only desire of the children is to go to school , a well-rounded health care system for the aged seems to be so luxurious .
The government here needs a drastic reform to restructure the entire political and administrative system before policies toward the old people could be brought to the conference table .
In brief , the policies toward the aged in each country seem to be widely different due to their very own and distinctive economic and social statuses .
Nevertheless , base on those different situations , each country should conduct more in-depth researches and take necessary steps with the view to promulgating both short-term and long-term policies to ensure that the senior citizens must get what they deserve .
With the current trend of ageing population , many countries came out e one of the most important things for economic activity , education and innovation throughout the panionship and social activity .
Hopanionship is most important to them as they age , e increasingly lonely and require more attention .
The love and concern provided from the family that can ease the ageing process from the family cannot be replaced by technology .
Hence , technology can be used as a tool to increase functionalities of the ageing adult but not able to provide the emotional support and care .
In today's context , graying population has become an arising problem in many societies .
While it results in a delay to the country's economic progress , the problem also imposes a burden to the children as mended .
According to the Housing And Development Board  policy  , Lift Upgrading Programme  pared to the past , the elderly had much difficulty managing the stairs .
Thus , this implementation helps to accommodate the inconvenience of the elderly .
Therefore , establishment of accessible infrastructure helps the elderly to adjust more easily .
Financial subsidies mand the same income as before is almost impossible .
Hence , they mended to help cope pensates the loe that the elderly have relatively .
On the other hand , this reduces the children's burden to support the parents .
Therefore , the dependency on the shoulder of the children to take care of their elderly would be lightened .
On the contrary , implementating subsidy system requires heavy tax foundation which will be a burden on the working society .
A massive subsidy system is needed to sustain the hefty expenses of supporting an increasingly graying population .
This would be a substantial load on the working people , who would then be responsible for contributing to the welfare system of the elderly .
Consequently , this solution would not be effective in the long run due to the money-consuming factor in the problem .
As a result , there should be a classification of the degree of need , in order to create an efficient subsidy system .
In conclusion , the negative impact of the aging process is inevitable .
Therefore , feasible solutions are in need of implementation to ease the aging process .
However , due to cultural differences , the requirements of our elderly population will alter gradually .
Thus , research and policies need to be revised to deal with the aging process effectively .
Public spending on the aged has been increasing in recent years due to the ageing population , e inequality may be resulted .
In addition , the increasing demand on the country's healthcare system e consistently more costly , this e inequality is less than desirable  .
Hoe .
Furthermore , they have been providing voluntary services by actively involving themselves in community organisations  .
However , aged who have the ability to contribute to the country will only form the minority .
The increasing cost will outweigh their contributions .
Thus , more funds have to be set aside to lessen the strains on the people caused by the increasing costs of basic necessities .
Finally , as the population gets older , there is an increase in demand on the country's healthcare system , where spending on it should be limited .
The United States predicted that the demand for medical care will significantly outweigh the supply of healthcare professionals by year 2020  .
The Gulf Cooperation Council  is also facing demand for health care where it is likely to increase by 240 percent over the next couple of decades  .
These will mean that the countries will be diverting plenty of resources on the supply of health care and neglecting the potential of the other areas which may help to generate wealth for the country .
Hence , countries should limit their spending on health care to invest in other potential opportunities .
In conclusion , the fact that people now live longer poses many challenges to a country .
The government and the public are contributing a vast amount of resources to support the aged , hindering the overall development of the country .
To lessen the impact of the aged on the country , the aged can learn to keep fit and healthy to reduce healthcare dependency .
In order for a country to grow and prosper , significant contributions are needed to support its funding and hence , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Based on the report of the United States Census Bureau , there are 506 million people hitting 65 years old and above as of mid 2008 .
This figure petition to provide health care .
There are many insurance companies hiring lots of agents to sell their products and each of the insurance company has its oprises six Ministries: Ministry of Education  , Ministry of Health  , Ministry of National Development  , Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  , Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources  and Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts  .
A total budget of S$ 8 ,701 million has been planned to be invested in education , accounting for nearly half of the expenditure budgeted for social development .
The government maintains that the expenditure on education sector would never be cut back even in the economic downturn .
The government heavily subsidise the education fees in schools and tertiary institutions every year to prepare students for the future .
In this way , public spending on the elderly should be balanced with other sectors .
In addition , with the limitation on the elderly , people would be encouraged to work harder to accumulate more wealth before they retire .
It would tremendously relief the government's burden as they could support themselves in their old age .
However , some may argue that the government should provide more public spending on health services instead of encouraging the elderly to later retirement .
It may seem true in some way as the elderly have less ability to perform as well as younger work force .
More funds should be invested in health services instead of paying salaries to the working elderly .
However , there are increasing pressures on social benefits including health services fund especially during economic crisis .
The limited fund could only be used in those more deserving areas such as public health services; therefore , the elderly should be encouraged to work harder to reduce the fiscal dependency .
In conclusion , there must be some limitation on the public spending in order to divert the money to other areas contributed in country's development .
The elderly should be encouraged to work harder to support themselves in their old age .
With many countries successfully practising cost-containment measures on health care , a lot of perspectives can be learned to spend the public funding within the limitation .
Besides , considerable efforts should also be made to educate the public to lead a more healthful life .
The problem of an aging population is increasingly affecting more countries .
Especially in the developed countries , due to reasons like better healthcare and pany downsizing or the likes of it can take the opportunity to improve on their skills and move up the corporate ladder .
Thus , this not only benefits the elders , it also benefits the general public as a whole .
In conclusion , although spending money on the elderly can help ease the problem effectively in the short run , it is not a feasible solution , as one must consider the effects in the long run .
By endlessly investing in assisting the elderly , areas of country developments will be overlooked , resulting in more serious social problems like unemployment .
Thus , spending on the aged should be limited so that more financial resources can be used to fund other areas of development , which in the long run , can actually help to ease the problem of an aging population .
Singapore is gradually moving into an aging population due to lomunity hospitals and nursing homes .
PM Lee also added one vital step modate more people .
Lastly , according to Mr Yap Chin Beng , Director , Estate Administration and Property , they have e more elderly-friendly .
The upgrades include lift upgrading to install new lifts which stops on every floor , shelters to connect to the nearest bus stop of the blocks and ramps for people who have difficulties in climbing stairs .
These upgrading projects have helped to create convenience for the elderly , especially for those who are disabled .
In addition , HDB is also building more studio apartments which are suitable for elderly as it is customized with elderly-friendly fixtures and fittings .
These two approaches have helped to make an elder-friendly physical environment .
Clearly , current policies such as social security , healthcare and housing have helped to ease the aging process .
Without these policies , the elderly will be facing problems in terms of monetary , healthcare and housing in future .
Therefore , it is important to help the older population remain employed and promote active aging .

Nobody can deny the adverse effects of aging process in today society .
It is predicted that about 23 percent Singaporeans pleted , but base on fair judgment , such ideas have helped to lighten the aging effects in our society .

This will have the effect of helping them to be financially independent even beyond their retirement age .
In conclusion , although the aged in Singapore faces increasing number of problems each day , the government is actually implementing many policies , funding , facilities , programmes and services such as the Central Provident Fund Scheme to ease the problems the aged faces .
In the light the above , current research and governmental policies have , to a large extent , helped ease the aging process .

Current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Today , aging problem starts to drapany .
Therefore , certain enforcements have to be introduced .
For example like employers should be fined heftily if they are found out they refuse to employ people e healthier .
Nowadays , there are many types of supplements available in the market .
For example like pill vitamin , iron , calcium , etc .
The introduction of these supplements is due to people's hectic lifestyle .
Many people have no time to take a balanced diet , so these supplements can help them to get certain nutrition where they did not get from their diet .
However , such supplements have also found to have side effects .
Due to some findings , overtaking supplements can lead to kidney failure or diabetes .
It is because the sodium level in some supplements are too high , then it might lead to kidney failure .
Therefore , it is better for us to gain certain nutrition from natural food like fresh fruits and vegetables .
In conclusion , aging problem is getting more serious , therefore , we have to pay more attention to this topic so that the problem can be eased .
With an exploding population , a quickly aging people is becoming a major issue in many countries .
With more career minded youngsters , marriage and having children are being postponed to the later stages of their lives .
The increase in number of aged people has seriously sloe to build up their retirement fund since day one of employment .
Governments have enacted lae in their CPF accounts .1 The money cannot be pared to the youngsters .
Aged people are not able to work as porters , construction workers , and plumbers .
The elderly can opt to work as lecturers and teachers to put their experience to good use .
Mentoring the potential employees enables them to gain experience which would have taken them decades .
They can learn at a faster pace , thanks to the guidance provided .
Department head should be of the elder ones so that they can impart their experience to the young worker .
The payoff of this investment is a highly efficient and the productive workforce .
Not only that , better working environments should be provided for the elder workers .
Injuries that occur to the aged may permanently disable them .
By installing railings in the bathroom , stairs and creating ramps at entryways , the risk of falls are greatly diminished .
Although this may incur substantial cost , a few thousand dollars in modifications could save tens of thousands of dollars in welfare aid .
These costs are on an average of $34 ,000 per year .4 Working from home is another option that can be considered .
Moreover , aging people can avoid the emotional stress of crowds and traffic congestions when leaving home for work everyday .
As a conclusion , the policies that have been implemented by governments have countered the issue of aging workforces .
This solution can be further enhanced by employees .
Saving money on the onset of employment should be practiced in preparation for retirement .
Governments should play a part in making investments that provide returns .
The dividends of investments can be credited directly into employees' pension fund accounts .
With the cooperation of government agencies and the private sector , this issue can easily be resolved .
Leaving this issue unchecked means risking the welfare of the elderly , who have given years of their working life to the country .
They definitely deserve a break after contributing to their nation's economy .
If one looks back into the past just only 20 to 30 years ago , he/she can see a big step in the improvement of life quality thanks to the rapid development of modern technology .
As a result , people's lifespan also increases .
Homon difficulty faced by the elders is finance since they cannot earn their livings from their jobs anymore .
Hence , the governments propose a solution of encouraging e is enhanced and so does the subsidy for the elders .
Unfortunately , there are quite a lot of side effects attached e a dilemma .
Noplaining about stress , primarily from mon reasons for Singapore's lopetition for use of resources such as public space , transportation , etc .
This concern has been expressed by some Singaporeans over the gathering of foreign plaints levelled .
More foreigners not only raise the crime rates but also require government to spend more money on developing infrastructure , public housing to accommodate all of them .
All of those troubles that the appliance of this policy bringing about may outparison betpanies to hire old people , namely: tax reduction , subsidy for each elder employed , etc .
Moreover , old people may not strong enough to panies try to earn as much as they can .
For all the above reasons , this policy seems to be impractical .
In conclusion , it seems that we are still not ready for an increasing old age population yet .
Despite the government's attempt to ease the aging process , there are still many issues that need further careful consideration .
Having such advanced technology in the current e range munity with sufficient technological/technical knowledge to remain productive and efficient in the labor force despite of their disadvantages .
In conclusion , with the aid of the current technologies and governmental policies , countries can ease its aging process by increasing the fertility rates , encouraging filial obligations and active aging  , reducing elder dependency on government , and lastly , improving the productivity and efficiency of elderly workers .
With these in place , the impact of aging population on the social and economic aspects will be greatly reduced .
In recent years , governments have been faced e under pressure as there e inactive from the petitive petition can result in citizens losing their job to the foreign immigrants and eventually causes them to lose confidence and feel demoralized .
Hopanies set up businesses here .
Policy to introduce retirement scheme is also believed to be one of the factors in easing aging process .
Take Singapore as an example , the government make it compulsory that every e into their individual CPF  account in preparation for retirement .
This retirement scheme helps to reduce pressure on the economy as it alloe group will usually face problem with insufficient savings and will ultimately still need support from the government .
However , this group of people is only the minority and that the retirement scheme will still make an overall impact on the economy as it can be deemed beneficial to the majority .
The social policies mentioned in the above paragraphs might be helpful in influencing the public on doing something individually which can affect the nation as a whole .
In summary , Social policies such as increasing in retirement age might result in lesser dependency on the younger generation while lowering the barrier of work age immigrants will decrease the median age of the population and lastly , the introduction of retirement scheme can allow people to save for their retirement .
Therefore , it can be concluded that social policies do play a part , to a large extent , in easing aging process .

Furthermore , due to high taxes , the reduced incomes of citizens could have negative impacts on their purchase and in the same pulsory and indispensable since they have unreplaceable roles in the destiny as ing mon target- the country's benefits .
Since the grey generation is just one part of a large society , its duty could be reduced for the gromended that changing all our lifestyle for being independent and healthy regardless of the age .
The problem of an aging population has been one of the top agendas in national policies and budgets for many politicians all over the world , especially for Singapore .
In the Budget 2007 , three billion has been earmarked for healthcare spending to deal with the issue .
However , Singapore should limit public spending on the aged because it does not provide a long-term solution for the nation and thus it should be spent on other developments that can indirectly but significantly relieve the economic burden of the aging population .
The other developments include medical science , science and technology and lastly , education .
Proponents claim that the government should implement better policies to alleviate the aging population with increasing public spending on mainly medical benefits because illnesses catch up with them as they grow older and the expensive treatments could possibly wipe out their savings accounts .
Compared to other countries such as USA , Singapore does not have as much money reserves , therefore it is not feasible .
Singapore has already implemented adequate schemes such as Medishield and Medisave for citizens to pay medical fees which are also heavily subsidised .
Unlimited public spending on the aged would only pose as a long-term problem for the nation .
Instead , it should be diverted to other developments that can aid Singapore's future developments .
Public spending on the aged can be diverted to medical science development .
It can be utilized in more in-depth research that develops new and inexpensive medicinal drugs for the public .
With the occurrence and wide spread of mutant viruses and disease , medical research serves a greater purpose for survival of the infected patients and drugs can be manufactured in large quantity and be easily available for them .
New treatments can also be developed to cure the illnesses encountered by the aged .
Therefore , public spending on medical science not only benefits the aged but also for people of those who are diagnosed with virus or diseases .
In addition , public spending on the aged can be diverted to advancing science and technology .
As Singapore does not have its own natural resource , we can develop new ways to gain these resources in order to be self sufficient .
For example , water has to be purchased from foreign countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia .
If Singapore fails to maintain good relationship with these countries , our lives will be in jeopardy without water .
Fortunately , in the recent development of Newater , water can be 'renewed' .
The government should emphasize on developing new land for high technological agriculture .
Thus public spending in science and technology can alleviate the rising cost of food which deals with the problem of the increasing population .
Lastly , public spending on the aged can be diverted to educate the younger generation on financial planning so that they can save enough for their retirement .
Most of the younger generation do not have the habit of saving because they have not been told or taught on how to deal with future obstacles they may face in the later years .
Therefore , it is necessary to improve their knowledge of planning for the future through financial planning so that they can cope with aging .
In this way , they will be less dependent on the government in the future .
In conclusion , the government should limit public spending on the aged and focus more on the major future developments which can help Singapore tackle the main problems that the majority of the local population faces , and also the roots of the aging population .
Therefore , the aging population would be less of a burden to many politicians on how to allocate the national budget every year to cope with the problem .

Public spending , in terms of taxes , refers to the sum of money charged by the government for specific facilities or services , levied upon incomes , property , sales , and more .
Some of the taxes include Income Tax , Property Tax , as e such an indispensable part of our lives that to the majority of people , it appears to be a norm to complete the panies .
As changes occur every day , modernization occurs , nee and is therefore vital for them to develop in this area .
For example , Maldives and Seychelles only earn the opportunity for employment in the tourism service industries .
It includes hospitality services , such as hotels and resorts , transportation services , such as airlines , cruise ships and taxis , as well as entertainment venues , such as shopping malls , amusement parks and casinos .
Thus , government initiatives for the tourism industry are important , to enhance growth throughout the country by promoting the development of the industry and also to increase employment opportunities by creating more jobs available for them .
However , on the other hand , though should be limited , adequate percentage of public spending for the aged should be allocated fairly .
The reason being , many elderly are being neglected by their own children , and thus uninsured .
They might not have enough money to get their regular medical checkups done .
So , does this means that they are to die ?
This problem would continue to get worst every year if there is an inadequate attention paid .
Though it is important to solve the problem of the graying society , we should limit our public spending in this sector so that we can allow more budget on the other aspects of a country's development , such as the transportation infrastructure .
A significant level of road traffic can be created due to the high density of an urban environment .
This can have a great impact on businesses and environmental factors .
Therefore , careful planning and development of the transportation system are crucial .
More money should be used to develop this infrastructure in order to support the moving of goods from one place to another efficiently and effectively .
Parking space is another concern .
For example , in Singapore where land scarcity poses a big issue , multi-storey carparks are built to allow more vehicles to be parked given the same land area used .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited to the certain percentage that is adequate for the welfare of the aged .
On top of that , public spending should also be diverted across different aspect of social concerns that lead to the development of Singapore .
By putting a limit for the spending on the aged , we can create more budgets to spend on the education , research and development , tourism industry and transportation system as they are equally important to our nation .

In general , our society is aging and there are problems associated e on retirement , therefore , they have to depend on their savings or children for their expenses .

As a result , the amount of money in their Medisave mon for younger generation to abandon their aged parents .

Thus , staying near their aging parents does not equate to giving them the desired emotional support .
In additional , elderly pany them .
In this way , it can keep them socially active thus , feeling valued .
All in all , the current policies benefit minority of the aging population .
Most of the elderly still remains vulnerable to the aging process and improvements can be made to create a less painful process .
For instance , government can lighten the aged burden of medical expenses by subsidizing one of the visits to the polyclinic for an amount up to a hundred dollar every six months .
In any case , for any policies to be effective , government have to continuously revise them by analyzing the current situation and making adjustments to the policies accordingly .
Government must not forget to consider whether they are putting too heavy a burden on the current generation .
To summarize , a balance must strike between responsibility of individual , government and their family members .
Populations in many developed nations are facing a demographic time bomb in the form of an ageing population , and Singapore is no exception .
This is largely due to the fact that Singapore encountered a baby boom betmunal and recreational facilities for the aged .

A declining rate of population and a longer life expectancy results in an aging population , causing a high dependency ratio in some countries .
This creates further problems such as a less efficient economy and a rise in public expenditure to meet the increasing needs of the elderly .
Hence , solutions have been suggested to reduce the heavier burden of the young in future , and one of the solutions proposed is to limit public spending on the aged .
The idea that public spending on the aged should be limited so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development is feasible as these developments may actually help to gain greater benefits for the aged .

The trend of an aging population is becoming more common noe increasingly significant in proportion in the society of many developed countries today .
The problems pertaining to the process of aging are also becoming more prominent .
Today , ing more common and readily available to the aged .
The American Society of Plastic Surgeons  has reported that more than 6 .3 million e more affordable to the majority of the aging population .
Thus , current developments in aesthetic medicine can greatly help to ease the physical process of aging .
As demographic shifts take place and the aging population groprehensive social security saving scheme , Central Provident Fund  , provides a basis of financial support for the aged .
As the population age , it is more difficult for them to plement one another so as to ensure the entire aging population receives a form of financial support when they are in need .
As such , it is possibly true to say that the current social policies can indeed help to ease the aging process to a large degree .
In conclusion , the aging process is indeed one that is difficult to cope with but with the current medical technologies and a wide range of social policies and reforms the elderly are more protected .
The policies intends to cater to benefit as many aged as possible and thus it is possibly true to say that the technologies and the policies have helped the majority of aging population to cope with their problems more effectively today .
The advance of technology and science has brought both opportunities and challenges to our society .
One of the difficulties is the increasing life expectancy , the result of considerable life quality's improvement , e differentiations , lomitment from individuals and lack of apared to other Asian countries to attain high workability from this programme and hopefully , it can reach the higher level of living condition when the health care and employability policies are implemented .
In this modern es more petition as can be seen by multi national companies moving to lopetition is bound to reach more advanced levels .
In order to do so , education plays an important role .
Hence , there is a need for public spending on it in terms of better training for teachers , better school facilities such as advanced technological equipments and schemes for an all rounded curriculum .
Hofortable environment in preparing them for the afterlife .
Furthermore , community activities are modate their interests .
However , if any spending were to be done regarding this aspect , it could be spent on promoting the establishment of more non-profit organizations volunteering and holding charity events to help ease the elderly problems .
In conclusion I would like to reiterate the point that we do admit that the elderly are assets to the society .
Should any spending be done , it would be to hold campaigns to promote elderly importance so as to reduce abandonment , or promoting an increase in volunteering organizations , and improving foster homes and hospices should the facilities be inadequate .
Ultimately , we have to be realistic in this global context and focus more of our spending on advancements in factors affecting the more pressing issue of economic stability and inter-country relations .
The impact of globalization on our society has been repared to those in past generations .
Due to the rapid economic gromonly supported by substantial insurance policies and personal savings .
On average , the e , the burden will fall back on the working population through less direct and more expensive means; which is liable for higher taxes .
Instead , the society will face a wider range of issues related to education , housing and even transportation which creates a negative pressure on the economy of the nation .
Issue in regards to the graying population requires a balance effort from both the government and its citizens .
Educating the mass on the essential of financial stability in the far future is one of the solutions for cultivating a habit of saving among the mass .
Not only that , the majority of the population will understand the importance of saving and built up responsibility for oneself as well as their love ones .
There should be a substantial boundary in the financial and welfare support for the aging population .
The transitions and consequences will be easier if we are better prepared .

Hence , public spending on the aged should be limited in order for funds to be sub-divided among the education , tourism and the R&D sectors which are the main sources of revenue .
In turn , with more revenue being generated , more benefits and financial aids could be provided to the aged which benefits the country as a whole .
Setting limits on the spending on the aged would raise indignation among the elderly , especially people without a savings , poor single women , and the illiterate .
Some may say it is inhumane when limiting the spending on the aged .
However , policy makers should always look at the interest of the whole country rather than just focusing on particular one area .
Additionally , the government can conduct specific tests such as the means- test for those who really require financial support .
In conclusion , it is applicable to make the spending on the aged limited .
The reduced spending on the aged can then be invested in other areas for instance education .
When the education is enhanced , graduates would have a higher chance of getting a job and hence contributing to the economic development of the country .
In addition , together with the development of economy , the young adults would be capable to support their parents .
Furthermore , they could enjoy a high living standard and security in life .
Generally , the government would have enough budgets to empower the stable development of the country , and to maintain the welfare and pension system at an acceptable level .
To illustrate these are only some out of many benefits which public can be achieved from the reduced of the aged spending .
To conclude , it is vital for the government to limit the spending on the aged to a reasonable level , and which money can be invested in different aspects of the country's development .
In the short run , the country may face difficulties , but in the long run it will be beneficial to the society .

In viee to their account , a Update- What Physicians and the Public Need To Kno/stories/singaporelocalne l
Population aging is progressing rapidly in many countries and in the near future , this may push up the public spending on social security and healthcare costs .
In viewing the aging population problem , some people argued that we should not limit but to provide more public and financial assistances for elderly due to the increasing number of elderly in an aging population .
However , the increase in public spending means that working people may need to have higher tax contributions , as public spending is supported mainly by taxation .
Minford and Wang  stated that researches have shown that the increase in tax to GDP had reduced GDP growth and lowered the output per worker .
In an aging population , having increasing tax contribution from the shrinking workforce can be a burden to the working people .
Straits Time  mentioned that the huge increases in public spending could slow down countries' economic growth .
In aging society , it is important to limit and have control over the increasing public spending on aged .
If not , there could be a drop on the GDP and eventually cause the percentage of public spending to be spent on aged to reduced too .
Singapore has one of the fastest aging populations in the .

In conclusion , we should not limit spending on the aged because it is our way to express our thanks to their contributions to the society , it is to allow the under-privileged old people to live on and it is to maintain the economic and social stability .
Global aging population is one of the most critical and pressing issues that the leaders of the te about as one gropulsory savings  .
While this may be true , such measures are ineffective in reducing old-age poverty as many elderly have little understanding of hoes .

It is ing under pressure , rising cost in the medical field and providing safety aids and measures in public areas .
Thus , current research and development in these areas are required to further ease the problems .
National budget and the economy have come under pressure as government provides heavy subsidies to the elderly in medical , transportation and even social activities .
Some might think that rather having to research and develop better economic policies , the government should just allocate this money for elderly benefits .
Hopact , portable blood pressure monitor .
Thus , all these research in medical field has aided the aging process tremendously .
One of the biggest issues the e too reliable on the government .
They may not take the initiative to save their money for future uses .
This could create serious problems for the government as it pared to people of the same age in the past .
The life today is very much different from the past .
The advances in research and development have made it possible to cure illnesses that are otherwise deadly .
For instance , according to the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  in Singapore , the percentage of residents aged 55 years and above who are physically independent are as high as 92 .2% in year 2005 .
This means that they are capable of finding a job to support themselves and not depending on others .
This is also proven by the fact that the Ministry of Manpower  increased the retirement age in Singapore from 55 to 62 and the age is still expected to increase to 65 by year 2012 .
More elderly are now able to participate in the workforce actively .
Minimum help should be required from the government and so public spending on the aged should be limited .
Another reason why public spending should be limited is because a country does not only consist of the aged .
There are other sectors that needed the government's help .
If the government spending on the aged is not limited , the other sectors will be neglected .
The education sector will be an example .
The education sector is very important to a country as it nurtures the young and turns them into useful adults .
The government helps them by issuing bursaries scholarships to encourage students to study hard and help those who are poor but are eager to go to school .
Without setting a limit on the government funds spent on the aged , all these will not be possible .
There will be lesser amount of skilful adults in the workforce and this may in turn slow down the economy .
Without economic growth , the government may face a deficit .
Taxes may have to increase and takes a bigger toil on the people .
Hence , it is important to limit the public spending on the aged so as to divert it to other areas in the country's development .
In conclusion , it is important to limit the spending on the aged so that people will not be too reliable on the government .
They should also be aware that the elderly are now healthier and so are capable of supporting themselves .
A country does not only consist of the aged and spending too much government funds on the aged will cause a negative impact on the economy and is unnecessary .
Implementation of Tax Relief Scheme such as Aged Parent Relief is also an important step to improve the retirement security as they encourage children to take care of their parents , thereby easing the aging process .
At this point , one may take advantage of this scheme to claim the tax reliefs for own use as it is nearly impossible for the government to keep track of where the money is spend on .
Thus the elderly parents may not be at the receiving end .
While this may indeed happen , the government has taken a further step to discourage this from happening .
For instance , the government has passed the Maintenance of Parents Act to allow elderly parents to file lawsuit against their children who have failed to carry out filial obligations .
Hence , this act has helped to deter the children from making use of the tax relief scheme inappropriately and has also sustained the main objective of the scheme promote filial piety .
Thus , with the potential "loophole" being dealt with , the tax relief scheme will be able to help in lessening the financial burden that the children have to take on from looking after their parents .
All these helped to encourage children to look after their parents and at the same time , ensure that the elderly parents will be at the receiving end .
Hence , these approaches have increased the seniors' confidence and security towards their sunset years .
Many countries are currently experiencing aging population which leads to a series of related economic and social problems .
For instance , workforce gets smaller as elder workers retire and working class have to pay more taxes due to the slower economic growth and the need to provide more healthcare services for the aged .
Even though the world is facing aging population , public spending should not only be spent on the aged as there are many other factors that need to be taken care of in the country's future development .
Aging population is already an inevitable problem in many countries such as Japan and Singapore .
Therefore , public spending had been reviewed to address this problem and it helps to reduce the negative impact of aging problems to the society .
However , due to the practical reasons , a country has its limitations on supporting the aged .
Hence , countries should assess other important areas that public spending should be focused on as well .
On the other hand , if public spending on the aged were reduced , many social problems would arise in the country .
As the aged are used to receiving allowances and subsidies , the lack of government aids might affect their well-being .
They would be unable to support themselves especially with the increasing level of healthcare costs .
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics , the Consumer Price Index for healthcare had an increase of 3 .6% from February 2008 to February 2009 .
This would translate to higher costs of living for the aged .
Therefore , in this case , moral issues need to be considered as well .
Children of the aged should do their part in taking care of their parents after their retirement .
In conservative countries such as Singapore , children are expected to take care of their parents by providing them with allowance to meet their daily needs .
Children should remember how their parents have taken care of them when they are young and hence , should do their part in demonstrating the value of filial piety and take care of their aged parents , instead of relying on the country to help .
In order to ensure that the aged are properly taken care of by their children , government could introduce policies and enforce it on all .
This would help to enforce the emphasis government places on moral values and also directly reduce public spending , which could be diverted to other areas of development .
Other areas of development included addressing social issues such as the decrease in the birthrate and the increase in child abuse cases .
In Singapore , the Marriage and Parenthood package with the extension of the Baby Bonus only attained marginal success in increasing the birthrate of Singaporeans .
Median age of citizen mothers at first birth had increased over the years from 28 .6 in 1998 to 29 .4 in 2008 , thus causing the fertility rate for the prime childbearing age group of 20 to 34 to decline .
Hence , public spending could be used to introduce more programs and subsidies to encourage having larger families instead .
With increased birthrate , Singapore would be able to resolve the problem of aging population in the near future .
Besides aging population , other social issues such as child abuse are also crucial problems that need to be addressed .
According Social Statistics 2009 conducted by Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , the number of child abuse cases investigated in Singapore had increased from 154 in 2007 to 176 in 2008 .
This significant increase indicates that attention should be diverted to address this problem .
Public spending could be used to ensure that there are ways to reach out to the abused victims in the society .
In addition , it is essential to increase public awareness through campaigns and seminars to allow public to have a better understanding on child abuse .
With this , the society could play a part in creating a safer environment for children and hence , enhancing the social development in Singapore .
Even though many countries are facing aging population , there is a still a limit on what can be done .
Thus , countries should not be overwhelmed by the problems of aging population and overlook other potential problems .
In conclusion , public spending should be used on the aged but also not neglecting other problems arising which hinders the country's development .
Too much of the nation's budget is spent on aiding the elderly and the government should limit and channel these funds to other more important areas for country's development .
For most countries , part of their national budget pulsory CPF and Medisave savings both require citizens to set aside part of their salary to meet their future retired needs .
Even if the elderly can support themselves , some may argue that they pay taxes and should be allopetitive in the economy and achieve sustained economic growth .
Public spending means expenditure by government , covering the military , health , education , infrastructure , development projects , and the cost of servicing  overseas borroes , as measured by life expectancy .
But in 2000 , 17 .3% of the Se to ensure fairness in the financing of social insurance systems , including the nee shorter , the prevention and population health initiatives , and the higher aing wave of retiring Baby Boomers may wash away projected budget surpluses , erode existing spending priorities .
For example in American , it is already estimated that over half of federal domestic spending outside of interest goes to people 65 and older .
Other harm is that the burden of the government will increase as the richer old people will take hold of healthcare policies , offing money to the old that do not truly needs help .
For example , in the Korea , there is pressure for increased outlays on pensions , healthcare .
Thus it requires additional tax revenue .
As a conclusion , the public spending on the aged should be limited , so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Many countries including Singapore are facing the issue of the aging population .
There are many implications to this issue and one of such implication is that the spending by the government on the aged has increased in order to deal petitive with other countries in the future .
Therefore , in the long run , spending on education will generate economic benefits for the country .
On the other hand , if this same amount of money is to be spent on the aged , there will be no economic benefits generated by them for the country .
Hence , if the government does not limit the spending on the aged , smaller budget will be left for developing education .
This may affects the country in long run .
From this essay , I conclude that there is a need to limit public spending on the aged as there are other areas that require money for the country's development .
After all , the aged is not the only area that we should look into when deciding on the allocation of public spending .
There is a need for government to take a wider perspective of the different areas that need money as much as the aged when deciding on how much money to spend in each area .
Thorough the entire world , the national leaders of developed countries are anguishing about the crisis of aging population .
A country budget would be spent in a few key areas such as defense , healthcare , environment , transport , research and development , education .
Public spending on the aged is necessary but should be limited in order for money to be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
If majority of spending is focus on the aged , it would limit the growth of the country which consequently lowers that standard of living for all .

Dealing e under pressure .
Although spending on the elderly is inevitable in the face of aging population , careful spending is necessary in diluting the effect of fiscal consequences .
The government has a duty in taking care of the aging population .
However , they should limit the public spending on the aged .
The responsibility to look after the aged should be shared between the children as well .
In addition , the aged could prepare themselves for the old reducing the burden of others .
Limiting the public spending on the age reduces dependency of them on the government .
Also , more money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Ageing population is a pervasive phenomenon affecting countries worldwide .
Governments have been working on strategies to deal with this problem .
One of the strategies is to increase the birth rate of the country .
For example , Singapore has implemented the baby bonus scheme to lighten the financial costs of raising children .
However , the government not only has to deal with reducing ageing population but to attend to the needs of the aged as well .
There is a need to subsidize the aged for their healthcare , transport , facilities and in other areas .
More public spending has to be channeled to cater to the needs of the aged .
One may argue that public spending on the aged could be spent on country's development .
The development of the country is important but public spending on the aged should never be limited under all circumstances .
Whether the country develops or not , public spending on the aged should not be limited .
The aged still deserves to receive the best welfare given by the country .
It is known that they had contributed to the country for during the prime time of their life .
Their contribution should be recognized .
A practical way of recognizing their contribution is to provide them with subsidies and growth packages .
By limiting public spending on the aged , it may signify that the government perceives that the country's development more important than the welfare of the people .
Due to this , some of people would resent the government for regarding development more important than its people .
In the extreme cases , some of them would hold protests to vent their anger towards the government .
There could be a social backlash if the government were to limit the public spending on the aged .
The people may view that the government sees the old aged as a burden , not wanting to taking care of them .
This could cause the people to be skeptical about their welfare for their old age in the future .
The morale of the local workforce could be affected .
Some people may seek to migrate to countries that will look after the welfare of the aged .
And the migration of the workforce would lead shortage of workers in the country .
Shortage of labour would impede the growth of the country .
Therefore , this causes economic development of the country to be reduced rather than growth .
On the other hand , limiting the amount of public spending spent on the aged could help the country to develop more effectively during crisis .
If the country is facing an economic downturn , its revenue is reduced .
This calls for a need for the government to spend on areas which could boost the economy .
Money should be spent more wisely on helping the country to get out of the economic downturn .
With the reduced revenue , the government should be more flexible by limiting the public spending on the aged .
By limiting the spending on the aged , it helps the government to have more funds available for getting the country out of the economic downturn .
More public spending could be allocated to skill upgrading for workers , education and building projects .
Despite the economic downturn , the government could use money from their reserve fund instead .
This could be a morale boost for the people because the spending on the aged by the government is not reduced despite the economic downturn .
The limit of public spending on the aged is important because it indirectly controls the funds mit on the ageing population as different levels pared to America and their level of investment in research and development is lopetitive global economy .
With less funds being pumped into areas such as technology and infrastructures , investments may flow out when other nations offer better incentives .
This would then lead to an overall fall in the revenue of a country which will translates to a drop in the public spending on the aged  .
Thus , it can be seen that negative results are being achieved with neither the aging population nor the country's economy benefitting from it .
However , it may be argued that countries such as Britain are still progressing well in the global economy despite a high level of spending on the aged population showing that a low limitation on public spending does not equate to a halt in the progress of a country .
In addition , the low level of limitation would mean that quality healthcare are being catered to the elderly as sufficient money are being invested in them , this may lead to a healthier ageing population which may then contain the spread of elderly illnesses  .
This containment could possibly lead to a fall in money being diverted to the aged population as they are healthier now , hence increasing the funds being diverted to other areas of a country's development .

An aging population has been much talked about in recent years .
Goh  stated that countries like Singapore and Japans/st247 .pdf}
Until these days , it is undeniable that aging population is still one of the current issues that are affecting our fortable hospitals are up to provide appropriate service to the elderly .
With this , the elderly e this problem .
On the other hand , there are also researches done on sickness monly affect the old aged .
Researches on healthcare are being done to help maintain or improve the health of the elderly .
Better solutions are hoped to be found in order to help the elderly on their health issues .
For instant , in the United Kingdom , researches on dementia are being done to find a better solution to cure the patients fortable life without worrying or without seeking for financial aid around .
But on the other hand , with these schemes , children need not do their duty to take care of their parents .
This may end up with social problem in a country .
Much younger generation will not be filial to their parents and will not bear the burden to take care of the older generation and will tend to push the burden on the government .
Although such thoughts may arise , but there are not other better ways to guarantee the better life of the old aged .
Clearly , all these researches , developments and policies had helped the aging population to get a better live .
This effort should be continued without fail as this would guarantee the living standard of the old aged .
Thus , having the living standard for the elderly guaranteed , the social problems can also be avoided in a country .
In conclusion , the issue on the "graying world" can be solved and well taken care of if necessary steps are taken to prevent it .

For a country to do e more pressing in recent years .
True enough , Singapore has been successful in avoiding any direct conflicts with other countries .
However , nation security will always be one of the most important aspects to a country .
The consequence of a weak military has the potential to destroy an entire nation especially one which is as small as ours .
This dire effect is something we cannot afford , thus , investing in military good will definitely be one of the top priorities of the government .
Humanity has come a long e several limitations , municating over long distance , yet there are still some boundaries e biologically stronger .
This also means an increase in the productivity of the aged physically .
McClatchy Nee cheap and chronic illnesses , especially , take a toll on their finances as people live longer .
"One hospitalisation , for example , a stroke can set you back at tens of thousands of dollars ," as stated by Associate Professor Paulin Straughan , sociologist , National University of Singapore in Channel Nepelled to provide in advance for their old age dependency .
Some societies have laws in place to enforce children to take care of elderly parents .
For example , in Singapore , elderly parents may file in to the court if their children do not provide for them .
However , there are various financial concerns about these methods .
In the case of government pensions , the heavy spending of public fund on the old aged may take a toll on other areas of the nation's development .
Thus a method that works in a society may not work in another and sometimes , multiple approaches have to be taken .
However , better healthcare and protection from government result in rising age expectancy , which is a double-edged sword because on one hand , people live longer as shown in report  and on the other hand , the proportion of aging population increases if the younger generation are not reproducing enough , and this is exactly the trend today in developed nations .
In the fast-paced society nowadays , there are several factors , such as high living cost and late marriage , discouraging people from reproducing "If fertility rates do not rise again , the problem will worsen as the median age in many first-world countries will reach 51 by 2050 ," as claimed by Peterson .
As the number of elderly increases , with a great potion due to the baby boom , there might not be enough young people in the workforce to support the economy and generate enough money for healthcare subsidies and government pension as mentioned previously .
While there are temporary measures to alleviate this problem , such as rising the retirement age and importing foreign workers , the key is still to increase the fertility rate .
The aging process has been eased with the modernization of our society as better healthcare technology and government welfare are available to serve the elderly .
However , this revolution has generated a rising aging population which would be a problem to all levels of the society .
Governments in developed countries should look beyond temporary solutions to rising aging population and focus on getting people to reproduce .
While there are initiatives like maternity welfare and baby bonus to encourage reproduction , I believe more can be done and hope for the better .

Nofortable and convenient because tourists can travel around the country pared to the past .
Accumulated public funds can be used to finance research and development .
Research and development is needed to discover new products and processes or to improve existing ones .
New products and technology will benefit the citizens by giving the citizens satisfaction and convenience .
For example , a new invention's medicine for elderly to improve health , electronic wheelchair for handicapped people and robot to take care of the children and elderly .
Moreover , some of the research and development are not only beneficial to the economy but is also environmentally friendly .
Solar power is an example of environmentally friendly technology .
Solar power is an energy source obtainable by converting sunlight into electricity using photocells .
Therefore , environment pollution can be lessened by reduced usage of fuel .
Last but not least , reducing public spending on the aged helps to stress filial obligation .
Because little medical and welfare programs are launched when decrease government expenditure on the aging population , many people may have not enough money to send their old parents to rest home .
They have to spend more time to take care of their parents by themselves .
So , there are more opportunities for descendants to express their love and gratitude to their parents and grandparents .
As a result , family sentiment is enhanced significantly in the society .
In conclusion , because of enhancing economic growth , ensuring better lives for future generation of older people and stressing filial obligation , limiting public spending on the aged in order to invest in other prior areas of country's development is a good approach to solve global aging problem .
In order to make the most of the limited budget for aging population , government should concentrate to support people who really need aid such as older single women .
It is es from the citizens .
Where is all the money invested in ?
It has ale .
The cost of living in Singapore is high such that children have resorted to abandon their parents .
As government , it is their responsibility to take care and ensure that their citizens are not suffering and to ease their plight , especially in times of recession .
The elderly had played their part in their younger days by paying for taxes and it is only reasonable for the government to repay them .
With the inflating cost of health care in Singapore , it is inevitable for the government to implement necessary schemes such as Medisave and Medishield .
However , Singapore should not be dependent on the government for fiscal aid .
In the context of the elderly , the reason why government has to spend a lot of money on them is due to the fact that children nowadays are abandoning their parents either in hospitals or old folk homes .
Why are children doing so ?
Burress  argues that we should care for our parents and shower them with undivided love and attention because we will want the love and care when we are in our golden years .
However , unpleasant and traumatic experiences from childhood may be the reasons that push children to desert their parents .
The children now hold a grudge against the parents and refuse to provide for them now that they are grown up .
However , not all parents are like that .
Children have an unprecedented obligation to care for their own parents .
They have cared for us when we were young .
If we look back and consider the living conditions in the past , their sacrifices made then are no match for anything we would ever do in the present .
The value of filial piety has no significant meaning in Singapore's "individualistic world view ," as mentioned by Assistant Professor Joonmo Son from National University of Singapore  .
However , the children have to realise that by not assuming their responsibilities to care for their parents , it would affect the whole society .
Tax prices may need to be increased to meet the needs of providing financial aid for the aged .
In conclusion , public spending on the elderly is necessary , however to a certain extent .
We could not rely on the government as they too have other areas of development to look out for .
Furthermore , not every parent is lucky enough to have children who could love them and fulfil their wants and needs .
Instead of helping them with monetary schemes , the government should implement new initiatives such as psychological and emotional support that encourages the elderly to get out of their misery and age actively .
Singapore , e assessment is done .
Hoe Rate of Subsidy .
The income assessment overlooks details such as a family having more than one elderly that requires medical attention as e assessment should be revised to provide a more concise evaluation of a family's financial situation .
In this prises of health checks , talks on homendable , is not sufficient to ensure the elderly interests .
More should be done to ensure that they get the appropriate healthcare subsidies and proper facilities for them to stay healthy .
In the future , Singapore may even aim to become one of the best destinations for individuals to retire in .
I agree to a large extent that current policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Being one of the top aging populations in Asia , Singapore has to be prepared for the challenges to be faced currently or in the future

I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
There are many aspects in our society that require us to devote our resources on them .
Spending on Education , Healthcare , Research and Development and the aged are all promise other sectors and overall national interest in the long run .
In any case , a lopsided spending promise progress for other sectors promised .
This promise .
Word count: 656
In the modern era , ageing population has become a phenomenon in many countries , especially those panies  and hence have adverse effects on the economy .
Thus , this is not a pragmatic approach .
In fact , the development of other sectors may bring about economic gropetition for funds by other sectors of progress .
It is undeniable that the prises mainly first mon sights , even in cosmopolitan cities of developed countries , and more significantly in developing nations .
The aged living in poverty is only one of the other ageing needy ones , panied by materialism and ageism , the needy aged plications are made .
Instead , they should be enhanced for general benefits , bination of these forces can yield economic growth , and not the stagnation that some predict  .
Denying support for them on the other hand , will further result a nation to social , political and economic disparities .
Aging problem is a rising issue es the victim of the economics development .
It also helps to solve the existing social problems and provides supports to the needy .
Besides , the burden of the less fortunate due to the gradually increasing in the living cost is eased directly .
Without the Singaporean government  providing funds and subsidies to these organizations , some of them might not be able to survive and continue operating , especially during the economics dopared to aging issue if it is not solved effectively and efficiently .
Moreover , development in this sector helps to boost the economics of a country and hence public spending is increased directly to involve and help more people in need .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited .
It does not mean that the government doesn't take good care of the elderly or doesn't acknowledge their contributions in the past .
However , from another view of perspective , the money diverted on other areas or sectors such as industry , tourism , social work professional associations and education help to form a more rigid and structured society .
Moreover , public spending on these areas has a wider coverage rather than focusing only on the aged .
Hence , for a better future , public spending on the aged should be limited .

From the birth to the death , man have experienced huge change continuously e around 2050 , the old petitive panies that hire the old don't consider the elderly so they try to avoid engaging them .
As a result , the existing alternative plan for the increasing aging population employment is not affective in our economic basis .
Ageing population has been a problem encountered by many countries today .
To date , elderly aged over 65 constitutes 8 .6% of the total population in Singapore , pared to areas such as education .
The younger generations should be the focus and not the aged as they are the ones e . Singapore having one of the top education system should continue it's reputation and government should divert money spent on the aged to pump in on refining students , ing to Singapore has been increasing steadily ing Marina Sands project , it is expected to thousands of jobs for Singaporeans in this period of economic dopetitive edge  .

Reference:
In the middle Ages , most people were lucky if they lived to be 40 years old .
By the end of the 20th century , the average life expectancy had reached the early 70s .
For most of us living today , it is not unusual for us to grow up knowing our grand parents and great-grand parents .
Some people even remember their great-great grand parents .
I strongly agree with the statement that to a large extent , current research and development have helped to ease the aging process .
There are several reasons for this increased aging situation such as this increase in life expectancy .
Through the use of these specific reasons and examples , I will demonstrate why especially in the field of medicine .
Second , people today are more aware of the effect of healthy living on their life expectancy .
For example , even as late at the 1950s , many people were not aware that eating too many large portions of steak and potatoes and other foods rich in carbohydrates and cholesterol could significantly increase their likelihood of a heart attack .
Also , people were not aware of the links between habits such as alcoholism and cigarette smoking and diseases such as liver disease and cancer .
Today , medical research , both traditional and holistic , stresses the importance of healthy eating and exercise in increasing one's life expectancy .
Thus , our increased life expectancy is largely due to advances in medical research .
However , it is also due to people's willingness to accept the results of such research and to apply them by eating better and exercising more .
Many scientists predict that our average life expectancy will slowly continue to increase as medicine finds more cures for diseases that are still terminal today .
Over the years , public spending such as in the form of healthcare benefits and subsidies for the aged has increased .
This is due to developed countries having an aging population coupled e from the taxes on the bined ."
Providing for the aged mitted to healthcare spending on the aged .
The government should look at this problem in an economic perspective in the long run .
The country's budget allocation should place greater emphasis on education for the younger generation .
If the younger generation is munity petitive edge , and thus munity in the long run .
Lastly , educating the younger generation is essential to a nation's economic growth .
To conclude , the importance in the development of other areas clearly surpasses that of spending on the elderly .

The issue on aging population has become an increasing important issue in our society today .
The problems caused by aging population are increasing and it has placed great pressure on our society .
Hence , the government is paying more attention to solve these problems caused by aging population through various means .
One of them is to increase the public spending on the aged .
Hoe a major problem in the society .
Some may argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that it pete es , they may not be able to afford the increasing healthcare services .
In Singapore , pared to the past and they e up with policies such as Medisave and Medishield to prepare the people by saving a portion of their salary in these accounts .
Hence , when they are ill they are able to use these accounts to pay for their medical bills .
However , with rising costs of healthcare services , the money in these accounts may be used up quickly and therefore they will not be able to afford any more healthcare services .
Therefore , public spending on aged should not be limited .
In conclusion , even though the issue of aging population is important , we cannot neglect the other areas that are essential to a country's development .
Hence , we still should not limit the public spending on the aged .
Aging population is one of the major issues we face in the future .
If the problem is not dealt with properly , this may eventually affect the country's development .
Therefore , I feel that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
In recent years , many countries are beginning to face the sticking issue of ageing demographic and undeniably , Singapore is one of the fastest ageing populations in Asia .
Population ageing petitors and to improve a society's performance .
For example , Research and Development in pharmaceutical is particularly important as the creation of nees to the topic of dividing the public funding .
No doubt that it is essential to take care of the elderly who have contributed much to the society during their younger days , but the government must still ensure that there is enough funding on other areas of the country's development .
Economic growth must never be sacrifice as the society as a whole must progress and achieve further advancement .
Discussion on the Factors that Have Shaped the Space Technology of China "That's one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind" , since Neil Armstrong left the first human impossible on the moon , it has ale the third strongest country in terms of the space technology , only after the America and Russia .
But hoe first , the development of space technology is a basic need of economic boost .
China is undergoing a rapid development in economy .
Among all the Hi-tech industries , the information industry is the most important part .
For a country munication satellites are the first security for the information communication , munications systems , 11 satellites TV broadcast systems and 30 radio broadcast system in response to the needs of communication for the remote areas in China , such as the Xinjiang province , Inner Mongolia , and Yunnan province .
Currently 80% area of China is covered munication satellites not only for the TV broadcast but also for the world wide webcast .
The innovation of the space technology is an indirect result of the development in economy of China .
General speaking , the development of space technology is a certain result of the economic development and military development in China .
With the economic and military forces developing , the space technology will develop in response to it .
When the space technology has reached a certain level , the economic and military forces will achieve a higher goal .
Under such circuit , Chinese will finally stand on the place where Neil Armstrong has once stood .
In Singapore , innovation is one of the key economic drivers .
An innovation is an idea , practice or object that is perceived as nemencement of processes is already hindered .
In short , this problem
Malaysia is generally a failure in terms of innovations .
According to E .M . Rogers in "The Generation of Innovations" , the six main stages in the innovation-decision process are the needs/problems , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption , and last but not least the consequences .
Hoing out ?
Try to find solutions for all the problems ?
No e a famous country for its people's innovation and creativity in the future .
The , is essential to help reduce the amount of pollutants in our air atmosphere .
The problem has to be clearly defined so that researchers and engineers alike have the same concept about the human need to recognize this need for a nemunicate and sell an idea is an critical skill in engineering design .
Last but not least , the solution is implemented and a patent , mon sense comes into play when certain steps do not play a part in the engineering design process .
Last but not least , alternative fuels do not rely on oil from Middle Eastern , owing to the advanced technology used to make renewable fuels opens up an entire dimension of ethicality .
The technology can build country energy independence , and thus regional geo-political stability .
It is an indispensable asset that many countries strongly support and endeavor to adopt .
After analysing the topic , I understand the main issue is about the problems and obstacles e up e independent .
It was on that very day that China , the "huge dragon" was added the wings .
Furthermore , the aviation industry of China got developed rapidly later on and China is able to produce many kinds of aircraft with high-tech now .
However , things were not always going well .
In the first place , it was quite a challenge for China to set up its manufactories to produce planes in a rather big scale because of the lack of resources and equipments; then the situation of unstable state of government emerged and dragged back the total industry dramatically .
Quite early in the 1910s , the government of China started to prepare for setting up aircraft manufactories .
The engineers tried so hard that they were able to design the first aircraft in 1923 .
However , till 1949 , there were only over a dozen of small manufactories with shabby devices and few planes were produced .
Worse , the necessary raw materials , processed tools and accessory and advanced equipments were all depending on import from other countries , let alone setting up an independent aircraft manufacturing system .
The problem really stunned the aviation industry for a while .
After China got independent , under the cheerful care and proper guidance of Chairman Mao and some other leaders of China , the aviation industry started to enjoy a pleasant time .
The government spent a lot of money sending engineers to study advanced technologies and importing expects from abroad; the other various industries of China all give a great support to the aviation industry , especially by providing resources and funds .
In a few years time , China's aviation industry grew from small to rather large and became able to produce aircrafts of many kinds .
The munications technology .
Wireless communication is the transmission of data or information using electromagnetic munication technology .
Besides these , other examples of devices that use this technology are devices that use the Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , Wi-Max , munications  .
Due to this decision many "unlicensed" munication purposes munication products which help to fill consumers' needs , which in turn helps to generate jobs in manufacturing of these products , logistic costs for transportation of these products to various countries around the globe and finally sales of these products to the end consumers .
Engineers rarely identify a "need" but rather let the society discover it .
"Need" here refers to a desire or shortage of a good , and sometimes this "need" can be considered as a neccessity or a form of luxury .
For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi , an engineer from Toshiba Corporation , saputers and came up es from the burning of gasoline in internal-combustion engines of cars and trucks .
As the struggle beting years .
"Eureka !"
exclaimed Archimedes , Greek mathematician and physicists , mon similarity; the technology is ultimately used to tackle the problems of Man .
In the past before the discovery of the space pen , astronauts had difficulty in writing their discoveries with the normal pens as they resulted in leaks in zero gravity space .
Pencils were also strongly avoided as the lead posed a danger in space .
American industrialist and pen manufacturer Paul C .  saw that this was a problem and started working on producing a pen that would allow astronauts to be able to write their discoveries in extreme environments and temperatures .
After years of gruelling research and analysis , the space pen was finally produced .
The same goes for Teflon , which was discovered by chemist Roy Plunkett .
As Teflon is considered to be one of the most slippery substances , it is widely used as a lubricant in the manufacturing industry and as a coating for production tubes in the pharmaceutical industry .
The technology is also used as a repellent against spills and dirt for fabrics , and under the brand name Tefal , the product is used in cooking wares , non-stick pots and pans .
However , despite their similarity in resolving problems of Man , the two technologies also share one difference; the process in which it was discovered .
This would define a research technology from a serendipitous one .
As mentioned above , the invention of the space pen occurred because Fisher realised that astronauts were not able to pen their findings with a typical pen or a pencil .
He saw a need to assist Man in this area , and worked towards producing the ultimate pen .
We cannot say the same for Teflon .
Plunkett's initial aim was to produce a refrigerant that has better thermodynamic properties and safety measures .
He had a different goal .
He was not looking at producing a slippery lubricant and saw another set of problems that had nothing to do with Teflon .
To put it simply , he had no aim to discover Teflon .
Plunkett's accidental finding only occurred when he was testing the chemical reactions of gaseous tetrafluoroethylene   .
In conclusion , both research and serendipitous technologies share differences in their definitions and the process in which they are discovered .
However , regardless of that fact , both technologies serve an ultimate purpose to provide a much better , easier , and safer environment for Man to work in .
Do you not yearn for the latest gadgets like , PS3 , iPhone ?
Throughout history , e a key ingredient in our life .
Electricity is a form of energy that is generated mainly from burning fossil fuels .
Homonly found alternate energy sources .
Solar energy e in many sizes which gives flexibility in positioning them .
Solar panels do not contain moving parts , unlike the turbines in the windmills or hydroelectric dams .
Hence solar energy is the best choice as the equipments are easier to maintain and safer to use .
The most effective method to harness solar power in Singapore will be to install solar panels on the roofs of all HDB flats .
The majority of housing in Singapore are HDB flats , these flats add up to form a considerable amount of land area .
As all HDB flats are under the jurisdiction of a government board , there is no need to seek approval from individual owners to implement this plan .
In conclusion , the most feasible sustainable energy source for Singapore will be solar energy .
This scheme is highly probably because the government has control over a large number of HDB flats , which constitutes to a large land area .
We will need to put this into motion as soon as possible .
Since 19 century , the environment has been polluted because of the fast development of industries and economics .
Nopare one solution with another , ranking according to the attributes for the solution is necessary for us to see with one the best , in our case , environmentally-friendly should be the major criteria .
Then , analyze each solution against the criteria we have , and rate each solution , in our case .
At last , choose the most scored one for the next process .
The final process is to test and implement the solution .
Obviously , the product needs to be built up for testing and implementing .
Methods such as prototyping and concurrent engineering can be applied for implementation , and we need to know how effective the product is regarding to environmentally-friendly .
During this process , documentation should be done so that others can understand the work .
In this process , new problems with the product can be found out .
In that case , we need to repeat the design processes to solve problems .
To sum up , the design processes can help to solve the problem we have effectively , since in each step we do our job based on the problem we want to solve and the efficiency .
Nepletely but differ es to the type of people it usually involves .
Technology , no matter hoing damaged permanently by tough stains , and an easier time es first , after bine some of the key aspects of the process to create a better model for developing new technology .
Lastly , the difference between the 2 is the background research .
Technologies created from research undeniably have lots of background research .
This is proven just by looking at the amount of research needed before measures taken to developed a safer automobile as well as better design of highways .
The research span can be years ,decades or even longer before the technology can be successfully developed .
However , this is different for technologies originated from serendipitous discovery .
There are no background research for these technologies , as they are created out of pure coincidence .
With reference to Post-it pads , they are created without any background research .
The researchers simply found a way to utilize the bonding agent years later which led to the product Post- it pads .
Hence , there it can be said that there is background research for technologies originated from research while there might not be any background research for technologies created from serendipitous discovery .
Despite the differences between the ways the technologies are created , they help to improve the life of mankind be it through convenience or any other means .
In conclusion , there are significant differences between technologies developed from research and serendipitous discovery , however , it does not change the fact that they are key to the future for mankind .
The development and advancement in science and technology has brought much convenience to human's society today .
With a click of the mouse , one can communicate e , such as hopared to technology created by serendipitous discovery .
Both the technology based on research and technology created by serendipitous discovery require different amount of cost to be carried out .
For technology based on research , a large amount of money is needed to purchase materials that are essential for the research and investigations to be instigated .
Moreover , specific apparatus , for instances , machines and robots , es out unexpectedly .
One popular example is penicillin , pared to that of technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
Technology based on scientific research consumes more time than technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery as there are many research and experiment need to be carried out .
Although all technology serves a common purpose , there are many differences betputer for children of all ages" .
The implantable pacemaker , on the other hand , was initially an attempt to build an oscillator to record the sound of heartbeats .
However , when Wilson Greatbatch , inventor of the implantable pacemaker , inserted a wrong resistor and discovered a different reaction , it led to the invention of the first implantable pacemaker .
Therefore , it is obvious that the cause which led to the invention is very different where in the case of the laptop which , it was already intended since before its creation whereas in the case of the implantable pacemaker , its creation was never intended .
Another difference is the final usage of the inventions .
In the case of the laptop , the final usages is what it is intended for since before its creation during the time of conceptualisation of it .
However , in the case of the pacemaker , the final usage was not what it was intended to be .
It was intended to be a machine to record the sound of the heartbeats which was mentioned above but end up as a device to stimulate the heart to serve as a cure for certain heart problems .
As shown above , in the case of most serendipity discoveries , they will normally not be used for the initial purpose of the experiment that led to its discovery whereas in the case of invention through research , it will be the used for its intended purposes .
Lastly , the pace of advancement that led to the invention of the laptop and the pacemaker is different too .
Normally in the case of a serendipitous discovery , there is a sudden advancement in the progress of the research as it is an accidental discovery during the experimental process .
The experiment that discovered the implantable pace maker was done in 1958 and within months of its discovery the first implantable pacemaker was being used on a human being .
However , for the laptop , the concept of it was thought up in 1968 and the first "laptop" only came into existence in 1975 .
On the other hand , there are undeniably some similarities between serendipitous discoveries and discoveries made through conventional research method .
In both example , regardless of its method of discoveries , both are beneficial to mankind and help to improve the quality of life .
The laptop simplified human work whereas the pacemaker help prolong life of some stricken with life threatening diseases .
In conclusion , though there are many differences between the discovery of the laptop and pacemaker shown above , they both help to propel the human race forward into the future .
Today , the change in climate is being labeled as one of the main threats that are affecting the existence of humankind .
For example , global e out e out ed by the public .
Even if one of the tests fails , we could apply the engineering design process to solve the problems that developed in the process of the testing .
In conclusion , the engineering design process would be able to help us develop an environmentally friendly product to help preserve the environment .
Therefore , it proves to be a good method to solve most of our needs .
Technology developed via research and technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery
Human beings have gone through 21 centuries .
In this long time period , technology developed together parison , scientists usually do not knofortable , thus improve our living standard .
If adapted into industry production , both kinds of technology can bring economic benefit .
To conclude , technology developed via research and technology resulted from serendipitous discovery not only have differences but also share similarities .
Even though these two kinds of technology develop from different ways , they both can benefit society and our daily life .
Over the past century , the technological boom has brought about much comfort and convenience through different inventions .
These luxury items , although they bring about a lot of convenience to our lives , are major culprits of destroying our environment .
As such , one of the main human needs pliance .
The solutions passing and focusing on being environmentally friendly for every invention .
Technological developments are divided into tputer so it pact enough and portable .
On the other hand , Sildenafil , the compound in Viagra , pany , Pfizer , thus decided to manufacture the compound into pills and market it as a drug to treat erectile dysfunction .
Another difference betpany leaders .
In the case of Viagra , the inventors Peter Dunn and Albert Wood had the blessings of their company to carry out their research and pany's other factory , diverting funds and shifting engineers from military projects to design the laptop , despite being denied development funds and an experienced team of engineers  .
Ironically , after the success , Tetsuya mercialise into products successfully .
Pfizer managed to patent the nepetitors .
Global shares of Viagra dropped to 50 percent due to other erectile dysfunction pill manufacturers like Cialis , Levitra and several counterfeits and clones .
.
Toshiba , similarly , has seen its fair share of competition puters .
The problem of male erectile dysfunction pound Sildenafil causes penile erection .
In conclusion , though the development of Viagra mon goal of enriching lives , pound to treat hypertension and angina .
Transportation is a necessity that humans cannot live e up plete market survey on the reasons parison on the latest hybrid cars such as electric cars , hydrogen fuel cell cars and solar powered cars to see which one is more efficient and suitable .
Willingness to take risks and experiment with new alternative fuels are also important so that more creative ideas can be generated .
Then , we proceed to the next stage of analyzing the various solutions and selecting the best one .
As highlighted by Khandani , there are some factors that may need to be considered in the analysis such as the product safety , functional analysis , market analysis and mechanical analysis .
The hybrid cars should be tested for its safety and functionality .
For instance , solar powered hybrid cars need to be ensured that it has enough energy to function well in the night .
Hydrogen fuel cell cars must have a practical way of emitting water as its waste .
We also need to analyze the safety of the designs .
If it is below par , we can add adequate safety features or a thorough instruction manual to it .
Lastly , after going through rigorous analyzing and selecting the final design , we need to make a prototype of the hybrid car and test its overall function in real world situations .
This will reveal the weaknesses in the design , hence the engineers can improve on it .
We also need to test and check various criteria so that the hybrid car meets the needs of the consumers .
Documentation and patent on the overall design should be done at this stage .
Then , we need to execute extensive marketing and awareness campaign to get consumers to buy the hybrid car .
To conclude , engineering a new design of environmentally friendly hybrid car helps to reduce pollution by using green fuels such as electric and solar power .
Creative engineering design can produce a paradigm shift for people to start using environmentally friendly cars due to all its positive advantages .
Noputerized transports .
By replacing drivers puterizations , manpoing increasingly costly .
One such example would be the price of petrol .
Therefore , through discovery of new form of convenient and renewable energy , the price of energy could be more stable .
With a more stable price , it reduces the chance of a big change that could lead to economy problems .
Given the current shaky economy , another big upset would have an adverse effect on our lives .
Therefore , a stable economy is essential for us to progress in technology and having a more reliable source of energy is the key to it .
To sum up , a stable and better economy is the current human need that should be given priority to engineer designs .
Engineers could design or discover better transports , electrical appliances and energy to ensure a better and more stable economy .
With a better economy , more energy could be invested into the research sector to discover more inventions to improve our lives .
Inventions that could save , lengthen lives or make life more enjoyable .
Hopared to panies .
Apart from that , it is plish the design process .
In conclusion , the progress of engineering designed is being disrupted by local society and the lack of engineers .

But the fact is that the shortage of energy has affected the pared pared petitive pared pared missioning the plant .
For the operating cost , the cost of producing electricity has decreased from 3 .63 cents per KWHr to 1 .68 cent since 1987 .

Design is a must for any product .
If there is no design , there e and changing mindsets of potential designers .
First , it is the lack of creativity .
Every individual has a different mindset; some are born lazy , e . It might take days and months to perfect the design so as to ensure that the end product is good .
Thereafter , more problems may arise such as finding and building of the parts and materials that are not readily available in Singapore .
For example , a lot of stress tests had to be done during the process of making NEWater  .
This includes tests on human to confirm that it is fit for drinking before it is produced for public consumption .
Those tests plete .
In your home country some problems significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .

Innovation engineering has been a commonly recurrent phrase among the industries in the recent years .
Hoe in the form of time , petition they face from the others .
Hence , engineers panies to allocate resources for innovation , and at the same time , keep the company's competitive edge in the market .
Due to this problem , fresh ideas would not even have a chance to be developed , least to say , move towards the implementation of the idea .
This gradually develops into an inflexible culture , whereby our workers choose to stick to current beliefs rather than try out new ideas .
Generating new concepts do not just require a single day of effort , as what people believe , but instead require a longer thought process which may take days or even months .
The culture in Singapore does not even allow our workers to make time for this crucial concept generation process .
In conclusion , Singapore should open up to accept more challenges and failures especially for the younger generations of engineers .
The younger engineers should be more daring and dare to venture into the innovative world to discover new ideas .

As a result of the problems that hamper with engineering design process for innovation , many fail to identify those unmet needs of the market , causing the market to suffer .
Instead of having new type of products in the market to capture the attention of the consumers , the market ended up with many different products having similar features and functions .
As mentioned by Chan in his lecture , many people are also willingly to pay more for design as well as for new products that they think are simple , practical and useful .
For instance , Apple iPhones were in high demand in the market during its launch because of it design , simplicity and reliability although the features of the iPhones are generally the same as many other smartphones in the market .
In conclusion , it is possible to avoid all aspects which will hamper with engineering design process for innovations by changing the mindset of the people as well as to find alternative ways to solve the problem of lacking of resources .
We should attempt to make changes to our way of life in order to begin a larger change in our lives; be more innovative .
Engineering design process plays an important role in innovation and creativity .
Since the resources in the plex than just picking the line-phone and dialing .
Consequently , a new product , although has been well and functionally designed , could be easily refused if it was not friendly to them .
In this situation , the behaviors of the customers are the key factors which directly determine the successful of the product in the last stages of the engineering design process-making the product and bring it to the market .

According to the nee an innovation .
Most engineers or designers are reluctant to even try inventing or making innovative products as they knofort zone will greatly affect the very first stage of the engineering design process , "Identifying a need" .
It will be very hard for Singapore to discover what it still needs when its people are content with what they already had .
On the other hand , Singapore's small economic market is affecting the second and third building stages in the engineering design processes , "Defining the problem and Conducting research" .
A small economic market is preventing engineers and designers from defining problems and conducting research as they fear it will most likely be non-profitable or at a loss .
In conclusion , the two main factors contributing to the hampering of engineering design processes for innovations in Singapore are caused by Singapore's small economic market and its population holding a resistant to change .
The process of inventing and innovations are crucial to all of us .
Imagine a world at night without lights , which was also an invention turned innovation .
According to the Masloputers continually increase on processing speed and volume of memory , it will provide a huge support on designing better resolution image devices .
The only portion which engineers would need to figure out is how to lower the operation cost of such imaging device .
In my opinion , materials of the films and the simplicity of the devices would be important
In order to successfully hold the 29th Olympic Games , the Beijing municipal government had done all they can to optimize the transportation system in Beijing .
Hoe one of the current human needs , parison can make transferring happen possibly in feplain about the time .
Therefore the problem solver come to find out pose and recompose organs or tissues sooner or later .
As for the problem of energy reduction in transmission , it can be addressed by diversifying and complicating the structure of the body information .
Ever e from The United States of America  , and 850 thousand come from Singapore  .
From the above figures , the ratios of human beings to vehicles are approximately 5 .4 , 1 .3 and 8 .8 respectively .
And all these figures are crucial in pointing out that vehicles , gasoline-popetitor to the electric-pomonly- used vehicle .
In addition to the above-mentioned "natural" factor , there petitive and appealing .
Furthermore , it also became more affordable in a sense that the insurances covered certain repair costs incurred by mishaps; and loans allopared to the electric- popetition and engineering advancement , not a product of compromise and negotiation"  , bustion , bustion or heat .
Furthermore , electricity pared to high octane gasoline  .
Even though electric-powered vehicles were relatively more superior in the technicalities , due to the factors mentioned above , the technicalities were marginal and people were not affected by the potential problems they might face if they choose the gasoline-powered vehicles .
In conclusion , the development of an innovation does not solely depend on how technically superior it is , it also depends on many other factors , as we can see from the above example of the gasoline-powered vehicle .
These factors may vary in terms of the degree of impact , but there will always be an array of factors that will determine if an innovation succeeds .
The more important and valuable an innovation is to the society , the more impactful are the contributing factors , and the more elaborated the impacts will be .
Just imagine if vehicles were not as important , and we do not depend on them to such a large extent World War I would not have such a drastic effect on the extinction of the electric-powered vehicle and banks might not have approved the implementation of the insurances and loans .
And who knows ?
All our cars might be plugged in and getting charged now .

Most of the company- starter had been technicians before deciding to start their business panies have had to resize or change their business .
In fact , the lack of entrepreneurship skills has caused missing stages in the process of engineering design for innovations .
In conclusion , certain problems are temporarily blocking the development of innovations in Vietnam .
However , from what can be observed in these recent years , especially after Vietnam joined World Trade Organization  , strong actions have been taken in reforming the law system as well as promoting the entrepreneurship in universities .
With a positive view , Vietnam is trying to shorten the gap between itself with the area and the world .

Government Regulations and Public Opinions in the Development of Electric Bicycle in China
One typical image remembered by the es to the size and speed of electric bicycles .
Before the e-bike pared ing more and more concerned with the safety issues with e-bike and a series of public hearings were then carried out to discuss how to make e-bike a safe vehicle on the roads .
Finally , the speed limit was set at 20km/h which is quite at the lower end of what the technology allows to do .
Then all the e-bike industries begun to improve other performance of e-bike like battery life and noise rather than speed and loading ability .
In order to meet the requirement of government regulations and public opinions , the development of e-bike has gone through several changes; therefore it was shaped to the e-bike we see now .
Hopefully , the next typical image left by China to the world will be e-bike .
In 1936 , the first public video telephone had been developed .

It sounds like a tragedy that this great innovative device has not been used or even seen by most people since it was invented in 19th century .
What experience we should gain is that social and economic issues can indeed shape the development of a new product .
Hence , considering social and economic aspects before the implement of an innovation is important .
One big difference betplishing innovation .

In the practical production , only the munication is not smoothly , e out pany loses its opportunities to innovate .
At the same time it loses the opportunity to save costs and increase production efficiency .
Another very important problem in practical production is corruption .
And the corruption often causes more serious problems than other problems .
It is a so serious problem that exist almost every area .
For the leaders in the companies and factories , if they panies or factories to go bankrupt .
And there are also some cases even more fearful .
Some of set up a company just panies make are all panies .
For the staffs , if they pany or a factory .
To conclude , there are many problems existing hampering engineering design processes for innovations .
And the state of information communication and corruption are two most serious ones in my home country .
We should seek ways to solve them .
In this era of globalization , engineering design has been emphasized by the governments of the countries all over the e it .
If puter , automobile and other electrical appliances .
Nevertheless , there are some problems which significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations in my home country , Malaysia and cause the impacts on certain stages of the process of engineering design .
Other than financial problem , we are also facing the problem of lack of professionals in certain engineering fields such as mechanical engineering , chemical engineering and electrical engineering .
Many of the researches of engineering design which were carried out in the modern countries had been done successfully .
This is because there are many professionals in their countries .
In fact , the lack of professionals in engineering field results the failure of many researches .
For instance , some of the automobile researches have been failed due to the lack of the professionals .
The stage of analysis of design solution has been constrained because of the limited knowledge and lack of professionals .
Hence , some forums of the engineering design should be held between our country and other modern countries such as United State , United Kingdom and Germany .
For instance , the forum on how to manufacture an eco-car can be held in order to help us exchange our opinions with the professionals from modern countries .
In a nutshell , financial problem and lack of professionals in my home country should be solved as soon as possible , so as to improve our engineering design processes innovations .
Hence , private sector , the government and also citizens should work hand in hand in order to get more investment for engineering design researches and produce more professionals in the field of engineering design in the future .
Indonesia , a country hosting more than tmonly believed that the slopared to those pared to the traditional way .
The impact of Indonesia's cheap resources on engineering design process is on its implementation stage .
After the invention is patented , there is nobody who is willing to buy it , because in Indonesia's case it's not cost efficient .
Another effect is demotivation of young engineers from designing new product , because the rewards the society gives them is not equal to their long time hardworking .
In conclusion , Indonesia still faces several challenges in developing its design-based technology .
To tackle them , Indonesian government has to work hard in developing innovative culture in the society , and decreasing the people's dependability on the government .
According to Khandani's statement "What distinguishes engineers from painters , poets , or sculptors is that engineers apply their creative energies to producing products or systems that meet human needs" , all engineering designs aim to meet human demand to become successful products .
Noes fortable lives .
Those nee exhausted due to the overexploitation of human .
In order to solve this urgent demand , engineering plays an important role in finding the other alternatives such as nuclear energy , solar energy and geothermal energy .
Evidently , energy becomes vital and indispensable in our life , relating to most of everything e . According to the online nee exhausted just in 40 years .
These figures partly shoe exhausted .
Nopanies start to invest in solar energy areas .
As solar pomonly knoes from the sun , it can be regarded as reproducible and we do not need to worry about if it will be used up one day .
In conclusion , I think we should decrease the using of petrol related product and slowly switch towards using the products which need new resources .
Only if we show our interests and demands on these products , those researchers can have motivation and more funds to do their projects .
Engineers are indispensable .
Their achievements are influencing the developments of every industry .
As the application of engineering spreads , femon: to meet people's needs .
People's need is so various that one prime need must be given priority to avoid distractions .
In today's monly recognized that fresh water will be the scarcest resource in the follow century .
Some people even assume that the next world war will be fought for the limited fresh water on the earth .
In order to ensure human's survival and the peace of world , engineers should respect the human's need for water most when designing products .
One aspect engineer should work on to meet people's need of water is to reduce the pollution in engineering process .
Pollution is one main reason for water scarcity .
To be exact , there is never a lack of water on the earth , but pollution damaged most of the available water sources , such as rivers and lacks .
Pollution in water is often caused by waste emission generated in industry processes .
To solve this problem , the best way is to emphasis environmental friendliness when engineers design machines or develop new procedures for industry use .
This can stop pollution to water more thoroughly than government's fine on water pollution .
In addition , engineers can design device that can save water .
People are using water everywhere in life other than in industry .
Therefore , if device can avoid wasting water in daily life of each person , it will surely save considerably large amount of water .
Small device like taps , water coolers , washing machines , can all be the targets of engineers .
Engineers should attach importance to water-efficiency together with other efficiencies regarding designing device , so that enough water can be conserved to meet people's need .
To sum up , engineering should give priority to people's need for water first , as water is necessary for human's survival .
In order to highlight this need , engineers should emphasis on environmental friendliness and water saving in designing .
For the next 10 years or more , Singapore e out with a better design of the product .
Next , this is another product which works alike as the previous product .
But other than the features that the "MEMSwear" has , this product has additional functions ) .
One of the functions is that upon receiving an alert when the user has a serious fall , it would dial for ambulance immediately .
This would greatly reduce the consequences of the fall if actions are taken within a shorter time .
Another additional function is the implementation of a temperature sensor .
For instance , in the case of a fire , the temperature sensor will be alerted and sends warning alerts to their caregivers or call for Civil Defense Force immediately .
Furthermore , when considering the design of the product , there is a need to make special considerations that are suitable for the elderly use .
Those factors that might need to take into consideration when designing the product are inflexible movements and slow response time .
Engineering would have to use the engineering design processes to list out multiple solutions the designing of product ) .
For each solution , they would have to analyze and select one of the best solutions that suits most of the criteria listed .
In order to make sure the product works well , engineers have to test it before they launched the product .
In conclusion , we have seen that the problems of ageing population could get more serious for the next few years , thus there is a need to design a product that could help to reduce the risks and impacts faced by the ageing population .
By the example of these two products , we could see that both of them have make use of the engineering design processes to meet the need .
And thus , it proved that it is really important to follow through the engineering design processes when inventing a new product .
Humans' activities on Earth have alpletely abolishing already available engineering processes , modifying and improving these old processes , or correctly identifying the reasons for the rise of that need .
Firstly , engineering processes that are available nopletely depleted in the year 2050 .
Therefore engineering processes of technologies that extract energy from fossil fuels must be abolished and new ones must be introduced to ensure a constant supply of energy for humans .
For example , western powers like countries in Europe and the United States is planning to construct large scales solar energy farms in areas in Africa like the Sahara desert to replace generating energy from fossil fuels .
Since solar energy is a renewable source of energy and therefore cannot be depleted .
Furthermore , the burning of fossil fuels produces harmful substances like carbon dioxide and smoke particles that can destroy Earth's environment .
However , clean energy sources like solar energy do not cause these problems .
Therefore we can see how abolishing old engineering processes and embracing new ones can satisfy that need .
Secondly , instead of removing available engineering processes , they can also be modified so that its original function is still available but at the same time satisfying the need to reserve natural resources and protecting the environment .
For example , transportation systems like cars require fuels like fossil fuels which is processed from a depleting natural resource , fossil fuels .
Furthermore , greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are produced from these cars which will contribute to the notorious greenhouse effect .
To solve this problem , engineering processes like the designing of the car's engine can be changed .
For instance , the introduction of electricity cars by General Motors , uses electricity to power the car's engine instead of fossil fuels .
This satisfy the need as electricity can be generated from renewable sources of energies like solar and wind energy .
Furthermore , greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide will not be emitted also .
Thus , we can observe how modifying available engineering processes can satisfy the need .
Thirdly , the need can be fulfilled by correctly identifying and analyzing the reason for the rise of that need , so that the correct decisions can be made in engineering processes to fulfill the need .
For example , CFC gases in the past is a by-product of many of our industries .
These gases causes the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer in the atmosphere which causes more harmful ultraviolet , UV rays to penetrate the atmosphere , causing health problems like skin cancer to humans due to these UV rays .
Therefore a worldwide policy was implemented to ban the emission of CFC gases into the atmosphere by industries .
Thus , we can see how making the correct decisions to prevent pollution to the environment can fulfill the need .
In conclusion , to ensure a sufficient supply of natural resources and a healthy environment for us and our future generations to live in , engineering processes can meet our need by removing and introducing or modifying available engineering processes and making the correct decisions in engineering processes can fulfill that need .
According to Khandani  , engineers design products or systems that meet human needs .
Out of all the human needs in the pared pany .
Therefore , since the two methods mentioned above are both costly and difficult to apply , they can be restricted by the economic and market and thus , they may be not able to solve the shortage of water in a short period .
But what is important is that , at least , these two methods give us hope .
It is this kind of hope that motivates humans to develop , to improve , to pursue our dream , and finally to have such a beautiful world today .
Hope is the most significant contribution which engineers have ever made to the world .
Environment-friendly car is a current humans' need plete burning of fuels .
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps the earth's heat and contributes to global warming .
Lastly , Japan's engineers had followed engineering design processes , Khandani  , to design their first eco-car .
They started by defining the problem of the fuel injection system .
They defined that the fuel injection system's problem lies on the fuel it uses .
Therefore , Japan's engineers started to look for alternate fuel for their eco-car .
They gathered information in order to arrive successfully at the right fuel's source; subsequently , they decided to use electricity as the fuel .
The road to success is not smooth; likewise , Japan's engineers had gone through a lot of challenges and tests before they arrived at their final prototype of Japan's first eco-car .
Humans need to care about the environment's condition , in order to preserve it for the new generation .
The new generation deserves to live in the same environment as we do .
To conclude , by using engineering design processes , engineers can design product that meets humans' need .
Healthcare is a basic essential in every country .
It compromises of the people's living condition , availability of medical treatment and prevention of disease .
Emphasis on healthcare services differs from country to country .
For instance in Singapore and Japan , healthcare is emphasized on the elderly due to their aging populations but both execute their policies in a different munity has become an eminent issue in Singapore .
With a replacement rate of 1 .5 children to 2 adults and estimation that by 2030 , 18 .4% of the population panies tend to seek younger employees causing the older mon places should be equipped with more ramps and handicapped friendly escalator .
Furthermore , on trains in Singapore , certain seats are allocated for the elderly .
Last but not least , health benefits for elderly should be protected .
They should be offered free medical checkups and treatment if necessary .
In conclusion , healthcare services should not be neglected especially in countries , which face aging population .
More need to be done to improve our healthcare sector so as to achieve a healthier and wealthier society .
Over the past century , numerous research breakthroughs and creative innovations have allobining different technologies and innovations to satisfy a particular human need creating ability for humans to complete a task faster or more efficiently .
To produce these systems , design processes are carried out over a period of time , ranging from months to years , and they are conducted based on a series of steps .
For example , ing more and more an issue of raising concern as little has been done to eliminate or tremendously reduce pollution .
Temperature has been increasing due to the excessive release of greenhouse gases; and sea levels have been rising due to the melting of ice caps in the North and South poles .
Time is running out and to protect the sustainability of life on Earth , necessary actions have to be taken immediately if not , as soon as possible and the help of engineering design processes should not be left out .
To conclude , pollution is an ongoing , serious problem in which swift actions need to be taken .
It is a human need to neutralize this situation because Earth's and human's sustainability is at stake .
With engineering design processes , the benefits of gaining control over pollution are tremendous .
However , engineering design processes take a certain period of time as factors such as safety and other side effects have to be put into consideration too .
Moreover , we humans cannot be totally dependent on engineering design systems only .
We have to be socially-responsible as every living person has a part to play in tackling pollution .
Throughout the years , there has ales impractical to have an electric car for travelling .
For example , the gasoline popared to a maximum distance of 150km for a full charge on an electric battery .
In big cities like the United States , travelling to and fro from es money .
No one is pressed natural gas  .
This is made possible only pared to the past .
For instance , the regenerative brake system has been invented ing up petitor .
However , technological restrains like limited resources has been a set back for hybrid users .
Looking at Singapore for example , there are only 5 CNG refueling points around the country .
To get your vehicle refueled would be troublesome if the nearest CNG petrol station is far away .
This constrain makes consumers think twice before purchasing a hybrid vehicle .
Also , the fact that hybrid cars are a relatively new technology , car repair shops might not have the knowledge to repair hybrid cars yet , and any repairs must be sent back to the car manufacturer .
This makes it inconvenient if the shop is located far away from the consumer .
In short , these few factors have played an important role in shaping the automobiles that we know today .
Imagine if there no technological restrains and that we could create a self replenishing battery .
The possibilities are endless , but it proves one point .
Technology and society co-exist and affects one another .
Even till now , we are shaping many other technological inventions .
Only the future can foretell the impact of these factors on technological advancement such as in the automobile industry .
Who knows , hybrid cars might actually manage to successfully dethrone the gasoline powered cars in the near future .
Electronics such as lights and cars have become essential to the human beings over the past years .
These electronics though e the milestone , the motion sensors use infrared energy to detect human beings .
In addition , these sensors are also highly sensitive to human body temperature , therefore resulting in a highly accurate detection .
Today these motion sensor lights are used almost everypared to previously .
To overcome the price hikes , an alternative to petrol fuel is needed .
The outcome of intensive engineering design pared to petrol fuel which is getting limited as the oil reserves depletes .
In order for a car to be powered using CNG , there are certain modifications that needs to be done .
For example , new fuel storage was introduced , and took the name of Integrated Storage system .
Another example is the modification of the engine .
The natural gas from the storage cylinders flows into a fuel line when the engine is started .
The gas is then ignited by a spark plug , thus powering the car .
In Singapore , public transports such as taxis , buses have converted to CNG .
In addition , according to Channel NewsAsia , there is an increasing number of private cars owners converting their conventional petrol fuel powered cars to CNG cars .
Engineering designs have improved the designs of lights and cars , which used to consume a huge amount of energy in the past .
To sum up , with the depletion of natural resources and high electricity and fuel cost , engineering designing should be given priority to cost saving electronics .
Engineering design is the process of creating a system or products to meet the desired needs of people .
Usually , engineers face difficulty in designing a product or coming out bat air vehicles by the engineers in the military .
This unmanned combat air vehicle may be potent enough to replace the ubiquitous manned fighter in the near future .
Hobat vehicle project did not succeed in carrying out .
We live in an era of great change , an increasingly global society as a result of rapid gromunication technologies .
Hoprehensively .
The world today is undergoing global warming which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation .
The solution to this problem is the harnessing of an alternative form of energy called kinetic energy in wind .
An example of a product created for this purpose is the wind turbine and it is created using the three main steps in design process to address the problem which are problem definition , information gathering and testing and implementing of solutions .
The first step in the design process is the problem definition .
Following this procedure helps to generate more solutions to the problem addressed .
Tapping of kinetic energy in wind is a good solution as wind is abundant due to the frequent changes in the atmospheric pressure .
It announces to the engineers that Earth is in grave danger , thus giving them more motivation to think of a solution .
For example , by defining the problem as the fast decreasing quantity of fossil fuels , it gives engineers an insight to create a product which can be used to tap kinetic energy in wind .
Referring to the earlier models of windmills like those built in Sistan , Iran , from the seventh century , which were used to grind rice grains , engineers used the same concept to create wind turbine which converts kinetic energy in wind to electrical energy .
The second step in the design process is the gathering of information .
The credibility of the problem needs to be addressed after the problem has been defined .
The important factor which determines the efficiency of the wind turbine is the general wind flow in the area where the wind turbine is built .
Since the wind turbine heavily depends on the wind to generate electricity , it is important to study the wind flow pattern before the wind turbine is built .
For this study , past weather forecasts and also the internet play vital roles in providing information needed to improve the efficiency of the wind turbine .
The overall gain in electrical energy needs to be calculated to decide whether the building of wind turbine is worth its value .
The last step in the design process is the testing and implementing of solutions .
The testing and implementing solutions is closely related to the analysis of the design solution .
The main factor which contributes to the analysis is marketability .
For example , the Matilda built at Goland , Sweden produced a surprisingly high sixty-one gigawatts per hour of electricity in fifteen years which produced more energy than the other typical wind turbines .
However , the Matilda was demolished on June 6 , 2008 .
In conclusion , the main three steps in the design process help to create a guideline for the engineers to follow .
Problem definition requires knowledge of wind and thus making full use of it .
In terms of information gathering , the efficiency of the wind turbine is of paramount importance in determining whether it really solves the problem .
Lastly , the testing and implementing of solutions consists of marketability , ergonomics and safety which serve as a check on whether the product is deemed suitable to solve the problem .
Noe out petition in Singapore by its posture monitoring system and there are also research papers and prototypes of posture monitoring system by R&D from other countries but are not e out .
Moreover , it is also necessary to make sure that there is enough information to generate clear problem definitions that addresses the real need .
Once alternative solutions coming out , engineers need to analyze and decide bested suited solution to implement  .Government and organization are also responsible to support R&D process in order to gather information needed , generate multiple solutions , analyze solutions and test as well as implement solutions which are the necessary steps for the design process .
In conclusion , engineers should try to get preferable situation in the market for the products , for example , "Fall Detection System" which can take care of elder people and "Posture monitoring system" which can help people of all ages to maintain best posture with the help of government and organizations as well as consumers .
And the goal can also be achieved by developing most suitable design engineering process for the system and products for healthcare .
A human need is a necessity that human required in order to survive .
One main necessity is food .
According to the World Food Program's 2008 report , 25000 people are dying every day due to famine and related issue .
A large portion of the deaths comes from the Third World Countries like Africa and India .
By using the Engineering Design Process introduced by Seyyed Khandani , a professor at Diablo Valley College , we can reduce the famine .
Some factors that play a part in of famine include political , technological and environmental issues .
In 1970s , the WFP has been providing food to India to temporarily solve the famine .
During this period , they have been analyzing the situation to generate other solutions to permanently solve the famine .
According to the design process , the second step is to gather related information , then generate various solutions .
The first off solution is to provide genetically modified seeds and fertilizers to the farmers , so that they will obtain higher yield .
Before this solution was implemented , they did a further study , and realized that the solution will not work; as the farmers are using traditional farming methods which are not yield efficient .
Hence , the WFP provided machines and farming education to the farmers in the 1980s .
These aids have improved the famine situation as the famine dropped by about 20% in a WFP's 1990s report; On the other hand , these solutions are not applicable to all the lands in India as various areas have different types of lands .
For the dry lands , the WFP has do further researches on water irrigation methods .
One of the solutions is to construct a drainage system from the Indira Ghandi canal to irrigate the dry lands in the region .
Some events like drought , flood and earthquakes are causes to famine .
These types of events are unavoidable .
Nevertheless , events like deforestation and overgrazing has affected the fertile lands and caused the yield to go down .
While governments spend millions and billions of dollars on entertainments and military expenditure yearly , these large amount of money can be put to good use in helping their own people .
India has increased the military spending by 50% in 2008 , bringing the amount to 40 billion dollars; despite that 35% of the people are still affected by famine .
The famine caused by these situations is preventable .
That large amount of money can be invested in the agriculture sector , like having the technology to plant seeds that will grow on dry land , which will greatly solve the famine .
In conclusion , the WFP can do more researches and analysis , like creating genetic modified seeds that can survive in dry or wet land , or an indoor farming center that will shelter the crops from natural disasters , which will resolve the famine issue .
In addition , the governments can try to allocate more budgets to the agriculture and research center than invested tons of money on entertainment sector , which is redundant when people in their own country are suffering without having a basic need .
The last step of the design process is to test and implement the solution .
By moving a small step forward , will reduce the famine .
Poverty is unavoidable , but famine is preventable .
Thus , we should do more to help the people that are suffering from famine .
The issue of the depletion of earth's natural resources have been raised repeatedly throughout recent times .
The earth's natural resources are not e up e dopleted .
Currently there are 4 New water plant in Singapore with a fifth on its way .
Together , they will be able to meet 30% of Singapore's need .
Bottled New water were also given out during National events , promoting the use of the New water in our daily life .
In conclusion , New water has been a engineering design which was designed to meet the human need of the lack of water resources particularly in Singapore .
Throughout the history of human , there are a lot of successful products ing less and less panies should be environmental friendly , in another panies tried a lot of methods to promote their products in order to push electric cars out of the market .
For example a gas company even asked for the President of America , Bush , to appear in their advertisement .
So you can imagine the difficult situation electric car's companies met at that time .
The technological aspect is also very important .
At that time , the electric car panies of electric cars have realized the importance of social and technological factors and they start to fight back .
In social aspect , the environment situation becomes more serious than te interested in electric cars and the companies also take these advantages to promote their products .
They also invited some superstars , like Tom Hanks , to help advertise the car .
In technological aspect , new kind of battery has be developed .
The travelling range has been expanded to 500 miles , nearly five times farther than before .
Many functions , like GPS and ABS , are also applied to the electric car .
The performance of electric car can be as better as normal car .
Through the case of electric cars , we can see that whether a product can be successful or not is decided by both the social and technological factors .
The change of these conditions directly influences the position of the product in the market .
So when engineer produce a new product , taking these two aspects of factors into consideration is important .
As the progress of our society , human beings get stuck in a dilemma of energy .
On one hand , the energy resources ing our first choice .
Engineering design play a significant role in the use of solar energy , especially in the system of solar heating .
In the current e more and more important in the future .
It is said that if e one of the most important topics in the world nowadays , we also should pay more attention to clean energy such as solar energy .
The usage of solar energy product will not only save large amount of energy and solve the problem of energy crisis but also give us a clean world with little pollution .
With the developmemt of the society , our demand for the various commodity keeps increasing .
We fortable and convenient .
Hoing more and more urgent so that it should be given priority .
In the 21st century e more and more important .
Most people choose to hire a translator .
Homunicate ponents consisting of a scanner , a speaker , a printer and a recorder .
This alloponent they need in order to make it much more portable .
Form this example , we can see that we engineers always think from customers' point of view and try our best to fulfill their needs .
Moreover , we should also take care of the interests of small groups of people .
Our target customers are businessman , travelers , international school teachers and students and other people who have needs to understand other languages .
However , after reviewing all those feedbacks on our official website , we found that the blind also need it .
After numerous research , we found that they recognize things by touching , smelling and hearing .
Thus we made modifications on our device such as the Braille-mini- printer .
This mini-printer can print in Braille so that they can understand by touching the paper after they scan the documents in other languages .
We can see that just a little change can benefit a large number of people .
To sum-up all the points mentioned above , we would conclude that engineering design processes can meet people's needs by qualified products and services , continuous modifications and the attitude to think for customers .
There is an old saying goes , "Customer is the god ."
We totally agree with it .
We engineers must always keep ourselves upgraded and think for the customers all the time so that we can make upgrades and modifications to meet their needs .
While one is looking for A , he may discover B accidentally along the plete randomness .
They are absolutely unexpected .
While one is solving some physics question , he may derive a solution for a biological problem in an approach pared to the average normally developed technologies .
This is just lke pared to other insecticides .
Nonetheless , apart from the differences , there are also similarities bete up with ingenious discoveries .
One needs to be prepared to identify a potential serendipitous discoveries , as well as to develop a normal technology , so that he does not miss out any important details and gain success in the end .
All in all , technologies discovered through conventional means and those discovered by chance are quite different in the aspects of how they are discovered and the general impacts they have .
However , they also share some similarities like they can only be found by prepared individuals .
In the end , though they may be so different , it is quite obvious that they are equally important and necessary for our lives and even the progress of mankind .
Thus , we should always be on the lookout , and think more about things around us , always be prepared .
A serendipity found is defined as accidently and unexpectedly discovering something fortunate .
One technology that ing from accidents , but through a series of engineering design processes is a research invention , and a technology developed via research is the mobile phone .
For these tmunication efficiencies and health concerns .
Firstly , compare the usages for both the sound-pomunications .
Homunication systems for high-rise buildings , airports and ski lifts etc , munication efficiencies after the connection is established , the mobile phone provides better efficiency than the sound- poe hopelessly garbled , hopared to the mobile phone .
Alternatively , we can look into the possible problems that might arise before the release of the product .
During the brainstorming stage , engineers should have looked at the product in various angles; the possibilities of doing harm to the environment while creating and testing the product , the ways to dispose off any toxic or radioactive wastes and the possibility of exploitation of product on immorality purposes .
In conclusion , engineering design processes can meet the need of solving global warming by the improvement of catalytic converter and execution of cautious planning before any other procedures .
Prevention is always better than cure .
Safety is a primary need for all inventions even to this date .
Hoe such injuries and keep users out of harm's pounded , the third stage of design process bined to propose a neplex design fort and confidence in handling it .
Design process looks at the geometric properties of the human body to determine the dimensions of the safety product .
A good design fortable for the user .
When you go shopping , do you usually see same kind of products e from China .
In China nopanies just copy the existing patterns .
As these companies manufacture products panies in China usually copy basic ideas from others and make use for themselves .
In recent years , lots of small companies appeared in southern China .
These companies found their opanies do not do innovation design .
They imitate panies .
For example , some cellphone companies in GuangDong province imitate famous mobile phone such as NOKIA , Apple .
In 2008 , the producing amount of this kind phones is more than 80 million in China .
These phones have the exactly same appearance designs panies , even the first time you look at it , you cannot identify panies pay very little attention to design process because that design process alpanies copy ideas from others and reducing manufacturing cost .
In some sense , innovation helps humankind to move forward .
It is so important that innovation design should be existing anywhere .
In today's global competitive market , products' functionality is not the only thing customers are looking out for .
Products not only must serve its functions but must look good on the surface .
No doubt there are products  , it is not difficult to purchase foreign goods .
This resulted in the lopetitions against other universities from other countries .
Associate Professor Seah Kar Heng commented that one of the difficulties faced by the team is the lack of a suitable venue to test drive the cars .
Beside the lack of facilities , engineers are constrain by the strict regulatory imposed by the Governement .
The team from FSAE could only test- drive their cars pounds and in United States petitions prehensive guide for engineers who have no idea on how to go about designing a new product .
However , in Singapore , engineers will find that they will meet into some problems that may hamper the design process .
Due to the small market in Singapore and Singaporeans' preference for foreign goods , many may give up their innovations eventually .
For those who successfully designed their products , they are met with another problem the lack of facilities to text their products and the inflexibility of Government's regulatory .
Engineering design process is a tedious one and by analysing the problems that hamper it , one may be able to make the process a smoother one .
Firstly , scientists and engineers have been focusing using wind and solar power for decades of years .
Many solutions have been tested and implemented .
The most well known examples may be the solar water heater and wind power electrical generator .
These two inventions can not only meet our daily needs , but also protect the environment and save the existing resources like coal and petroleum .
To put it more specifically , solar water heater can take place of other kinds of water heaters based one coal gas .
So besides the reasons above , it is also very cheap to use these renewable resources so users can get a lot of economical benefits from that .
Secondly , some of the technologies are still under testing .
Engineers are trying to generate multiple solutions to some problems .
And these problems are mainly caused by restriction and immature technology of wind and solar power .
For example , scientists and engineers have found that the wind speed and hours of sunshine are not steady so that the generating energy is also not very steady .
These two resources are restricted by the geographical position and climate .
Besides , the efficiency of converting wind power is very low .
So the focus of engineers is to design and test new technology .
For instance , car is one of the most important transportations in the world; however , new research has proved that the existing extra petroleum can only be used for another eighty to ninety years .
Engineers are trying to solve the problem that what we shall use after the petroleum run out .
Thus a new kind of solar-powered car has been invented .
But even engineers have reached certain success; the solar-powered car they can produce is still far from the standard of civil transports .
So engineers still have a long way to go to test and find solutions to make better use of wind and solar energy .
Last but not the least; engineers are trying hard to put their dream in to reality .
They have the plan to build a power house in the air space because it is easier to get more solar energy and convert them in to electricity in a better efficiency .
They are still gathering the pertinent information .
With their great efforts I will not be surprised to see a total different world in the future .
On the other hand , neither conventionally generated technologies nor discoveries made in skunking a popular technology .
Concluding the above , the world today are better equipped with the relevant infrastructure and network to facilitate the use of such a device , a 'picture phone' .
This spin off effect from such development has proved to us that social determinants have definitely been playing a huge role on moulding the development of our technology .
In modern society , e true .
Then , in the follofortable .
Similarly , the serendipitous is the effect by which one accidentally discovers something fortunate , especially while looking for something entirely different .
Hence , the result of serendipitous also helps explore the unknown things and places .
In addition , both of technology that was discovered by research and serendipitous discovery contribute to the human society .
However , in terms of process and effort , the research to develop new technology is different from the serendipitous discovery .
Specifically , the majority of technological innovations are developed by scientific research which based on knowledge , research and application in practice .
In order to make achievement , it requires a lot of work to do thus it would take a long time .
Even so the result is still unpredictable .
On the contrast , serendipitous discovery seems very fortunate because people receive unexpected things which are always beneficial for human society .
For example , Sir Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibioticpenicillin when he was doing research on the biological materials occasionally .
Similarly , DDT was also discovered by accident in the 1930s , when a Swiss chemist , Paul Muller , was trying to find a way to protect wool clothes against moths .
Hence , serendipitous discovery is more convenient and fortunate but it is much more difficult than doing research to develop innovations .
Innovations are made every single day and plete an objective .
These are the conventionally planned research based innovations .
Febined es the desperate need for solving a problem .
However in the case of the serendipitous innovations there is no exact driving force .
Set of experiments accidentally yield results which prove to be significant .
Who could have thought that an apple would be enough for a man to develop the concept of mechanics and gravitation ?
The technologies innovated in this fashion were never meant to be innovated .
But today without them our survival seems questionable .
It is hard to conclude which type of innovation outshines the other .Infact it makes no sense as both are special in their own ways .
But it is important for us to acknowledge these innovations , respect them and strive to do many more things to make life better ! .
Engineers have been designing products or systems to improve the everyday life .
The process that they used is called the engineering design process .
Constantly , the process has developed nefortable by planes .
Engineers have been trying to solve a human problem for many years .
That problem is to make drinkable fresh water to everyone in the third world countries .
Engineering process involves defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting solution and test and implements the solution as quoted from Khandani .
Second , in the design process is to gather pertinent information on why the problem still exists as stated by Khandani .
Third world countries' government knows that there is a need to solve water shortage problem .
However , developing new and clean water technology needs large amount of money .
This money can be put to better use like getting medications for their people .
Another possible reason for the problem to be existed could be pollution from industries .
Inland water sources are being polluted by factories which dump chemical waste products into the water sources which make the water source not fit for usage .
Lastly , Engineers can do some testing on desalinating seawater into drinkable water after they have drafted out a cheap and affordable desalination process for the third world countries to purchase .
The results from the testing will be sent to WHO for approval to desalination plant to be build for producing drinkable water in the area .
If the technology is newer than the previous old desalination process , the engineers might able to get it patent so the price for this new technology will be affordable to everyone .
In conclusion , the engineering design process aids engineers in developing newer technology to help meet the needs or solve the problem of the global population .
This process is able to apply in producing clean water from seawater which helps solve water shortage problems in certain countries .
The process able to identify the problem , understand why it is still not solved , produce solutions to it and getting it work in an engineering way .
In the context of the innovation development process , the development of technologies may be viebat purposes .
Funding and incentives panies to improve automobile technology as panies that are heavily involves in research and development projects .
Speed limits and safety regulation set by governments are also factors to be considered pany .
The technical aspects of car depend heavily on production cost .
If the production cost increases , carmakers panies were to ensure that projects that they are involved have great profit potential .
Toshiba is the first brand to have laptop knoputer in Japan .
Hopany did not pany , government , and society all the e first .
The first difference is that engineers pany .
The second difference bete out e next .
First and the most important one is that those innovations all promoted development of the society .
Secondly , no matter hoe better and better .
In Singapore , innovations in engineering design had been in the cold pared to leading countries like Germany or Japan .
From my opinion , I can identify tmercial gains rather than innovations es to engineering .
Our innovations came in the pared to the rest of the world .
Perhaps in future , there will be Singaporeans who can create engineering wonders to revolutionize the world .
We will then be able to catch up to countries like Germany or Japan and be labeled as a country with innovative engineering .
In the past fepressor that condenses the liquidrefrigerant and releases the heat , ponents that could breakdopared to an electric one .
In addition to this advantage the gas refrigerator makes lessnoisethan the electric refrigerator as panies such as General Electric , General Motors , Westinghouse and Kelvinator spent huge sums of money on research and development .
These companies realized that larger profits can be made by selling electric refrigerators and they aggressively marketed the product .
Even though smaller companies tried to compete in the market panies such as General Electric .
Hence the use of gas refrigerators never popularized and instead today panies such as General electric rather than it being the consumer's choice .
Also it goes to show that for a product to be approved and accepted by society , it should be socially determined rather than technologically determined .
As plicated theories and knoes up e less and less , the other goes to the bosses' own pockets .
Finally , the research group gets the money , but no use anymore , because the remaining money is not enough or the arrival time of money is too late .
When such things happen again and again , people will have no desire to innovate because they know they will not succeed .
Just in this way , corruption hampers the execution stage of engineering design processes for Innovation , killing numerous of engineering design processes for innovation .
In a nutshell , the two main problems what hamper the engineering design processes for Innovation in my home country are corruption , which will probably kill the innovation on the process of execution , and education , which makes the youth less creative that their peers in other countries .
These two problems are very difficult to solve in a short time , but we can improve a lot and make the engineering design processes for Innovation better and better .
There are several issues that may affect negatively an engineering design process .
Tpanies or organization to finance their plete their innovations given the iterative nature of their mon religious beliefs .
Engineering processes that result in environmental issues will also face pressure from environmental groups or the government .
Another social reason would be the government factor .
In Singapore , there are several policies governing the ongoing design research processes .
Engineers are required to seek approvals before carrying out their work processes to meet safety regulations .
These may result in crucial time loss .
Time is a pressuring factor for designer engineers with date lines to meet .
Tedious 'red tape' in all the government processes would slow down the progress of research , resulting in lower working quality and efficiency .
In conclusion , the social and financial factors are main issues hampering the design processes of engineers .
The problems are even more so in the Singapore context .
However , realizing the importance of designer engineers in today's society , Singapore government has implemented measures to encourage innovative engineering .
Development funds are set up and the many guidelines for designer processes are clarified .
It helps to alleviate the situation , but the problems will still continue to persist .
Technology and inventions are not strangers in this fast developing e a formality noputer technology compared to the discovery of penicillin puter technology are based on this factor .
For example , the companies have been developing different models of electronic devices every month to boost their sales .
According to Rogers , although gas refrigerators has overpanies had made electric refrigerators better products .
On the other hand , a serendipitous discovery does not depend on those factors .
An individual or a group of researchers can make discoveries panies and investors .
Other major differences bete so popular that every potential research will be funded sufficiently and thus researchers can produce more innovative ideas and products .
In conclusion , technology , whether it is discovered accidentally or purposely , is the main ingredient of new innovations and products .
We have to make the technology useful to society because they are the main users of the end-products .
In the end , a serendipitous discovery will be just as good as a technology discovered by research as long as it serves the purpose of contributing to the society and making lives better .
Energy source is the key factor that pared to sunny ponents is another issue that engineers need to take into consideration mercial purposes due to environment impacts .
This will result in negligible pollution produced .
Hence , solar energy provides a remarkable invention to the earth .

Does a College Degree Protect your Career ?
Unemployment Rate for College Graduates Highest on Record .
September 7 , 2009 from /does-a-college-degree-protect-your-career- unemployment-rate-for-college-graduates-highest-on-record/
Standing in the Third World , China has taken the challenge to improve the development step by step in the past fepete for the deficient universities in terms of their marks in exam .
Under such an stressful circumstance , students learn knomunication skills , using logical method to get information , and so forth .
Moreover , the most horrible thing is that they can not thinking creatively especially for design process .
Engineers as they panies e back to serve China in economic development  .
In the same way , China lost lots of design engineers which may contribute innovative ideas about construction either on specific field like civil engineering , or on the entire development of Chinese economy .
However , only minority of the experts can make efforts on design process in China .
Thus , the acceleration of enhancement of engineering will be reduced at a large scale .
Additionally , every country nowadays is trying its best to protect human resources as well as technology and design ideas .
Less highly educated people staying in China will be a disadvantage on this protection .
Good designing ideas may be lost from China , or even not created in this country .
In conclusion , my home country China now faces two challenging troubles .
Examination-styled education kills children's creativity .
And , Chinese government does not manage well on resources of human talents .
Both problems will sharply hamper the design process of innovation of China .
Obviously , it will be an extremely heavy load on our generation and hopefully , we can handle this issue and change the situation .
TITLE: Noes more connect
Problems Hampering Engineering Design Process in China
Noe from and the negative effects they have caused .
In this essay , I plex scientific research projects , it need a long time to go .
When it comes to some design for specific purpose , it may not receive any economic profits in a short-term .
If the government cut off the financial support halfe to naught .
It is precisely because there is not enough money input , a lot of good ideas can not be implemented .
And because of no good treatment , many talents go abroad to carry on their study and prehensive way .
Technology and innovation is the soul of a nation's development .
So the government should reform the education system and provide more funding on technology to develop engineering design processes for innovation .
In this nee smaller and lighter ponents and the development of more sophisticated batteries .
Inventors realized the risk of not taking a risk and dare to challenge an outdated product .
Homercially significant levels of reuse beyond platform .
This is because the engineers design and develop most products as individuals in isolation from other products .
Eventually , all the products such as computer softmercially significant investments in identifying and harvesting the reusable assets , unless it is explicitly planned in advance .
With the constant rise of sea level , many countries face the danger of being submerged underwater .
If this happens , we may not even have sufficient rice for survival .
More than a third of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam , where nearly half of the country's rice is grown will be submerged underwater if sea level rises by one more metre  .
Vietnam is the second largest rice exporter after Thailand and this will put the rice on our table at stake .
Global Warming has been a persistent problem that engineers should step in and help .
Engineers should adjust their designs creatively; like constructing more green buildings and including more greeneries in any future plans for redeveloping Singapore .
Firstly , engineers should design all buildings in accordance with the Building and Construction Authority  green mark scheme .
The scheme would provide advices on how a green building should be built and what additional features should be included .
All these guidelines will save electricity wastage and reduce environmental impact as well .
For example , although the air conditioning system in a library cannot be switched off at night due to the moisture content in the atmosphere , they can be set to a higher temperature or partial of the units can be switched off automatically at night .
Hence , it will help in decreasing the Chlorofluorocarbons  gases emitted which harms the ozone layer .
In short , engineers should adopt the green mark scheme for all the buildings they design in the future to reduce the environmental impacts that are harmful to the earth .
Secondly , engineers can dedicate more green areas to future plans on redeveloping Singapore .
Some of the emission of negative gases that affect the ozone layer are beyond our control , certain plans to recycle the harmful gases should be considered .
For example , trees and plants can be planted at strategic locations of Singapore as they will reduce pollution by photosynthesising and producing oxygen in return .
This is an ideal method which can be adopted especially in congested cities like Singapore .
Other than dedicating land area for greens , gardens can also be built on the balconies , outer facade and even the roof of buildings !
The multi-tier idea will definitely increase the intensity of green areas , thus reducing pollution and help to recycle cleaner air for our atmosphere .
To sum up , there should be gardens in every town and park in every estate to allow a good ratio of renewing air supply in the atmosphere .
In summary , all buildings in Singapore in the future should be built in accordance with the green mark scheme by BCA and include a certain minimum percentage of green areas for all future town plans .
All engineers should design creatively and innovatively not only for decorative reasons , but to tackle the global warming problem as well .
So do you know why Singapore's Minister Mentor , Mr Lee Kuan Yew wanted Singapore to be a garden city since she gained independence ?
Nopared to a e into consideration in designing a product for most engineers in my home country and their main target is to meet their client requirement .
With this , if nothing has been done to solve it , in future the engineering sector in Malaysia pare to other more advance country .
Being country panies and a lopensated .
All these require financing petitive however absence of proper funding makes it challenging to gain such expertise .
Due to these reasons many products even fail to launch into the market .
The second reason that I feel makes it difficult for new engineering innovations to be successful is due to large number of professionally qualified Sri Lankans migrating to other countries .
Sri Lanka has the highest literacy rate in South East Asia with over 96% population being able to read or write , this is mainly due to a free education system introduced in the late 1940 s  .
All Sri Lankans enjoy a free education up to university level thus , a large proportion of the population gain high professional qualifications which are recognized all over the world .
However , there is no proper system such as the MOE grant system in Singapore to retain these individuals with in Sri Lanka resulting in most of these professionals leaving the country for better paid employment opportunities .
Reports show that over 8000 Sri Lankans have migrated to India from January 2009 to August 2009  and over 100 ,000 Sri Lankans are currently residing in Australia making them the 16th largest ethnic group in Australia  .
These numbers show the magnitude of the seriousness of this problem .
Due to this high rate of migration a vacuum of knowledge and expertise is gradually being developing with in the country which eventually has lead to a decrease in fewer innovations especially in the field of engineering .
These professionals also make up most of the high spending consumer base in Sri Lanka therefore migration of these professionals contribute to the reduction of sales of new products indirectly .
In conclusion I believe lack of financial resources especially low amounts of government spending and migrations of professionals are the two main reasons that cause lack of product innovation and idea generation in the field of engineering in Sri Lanka .
It is rather unfortunate because these problems could be rectified through careful planning and strategic management .
What is engineering process ?
Engineering process is a process to find out the solutions to improving the performance of a system .
Engineering process can be divided into many stages from the initial stage identify the need research on it until the final stage presenting the products .
Engineering design process is important processes that have to be carefully done before the product send for mass production .
Hopany panies pounds that harm for human body and pollute the air quality .
As a result , their factories pany on improve their technology system .
Ever pared to creation like the micropared to gasoline popared to mercially , thus the high cost .
To conclude , for a creation to evolve into successful innovation , the acceptance from the society is the utmost importance , only then it will create a market demand for service provider such as organizations to bring in and further market or develop the product .
Users being the society and providers being the organization , the absence of either one will not lead to an innovative engineering design .
Like an old saying goes , "It takes both hands to clap" .
Do you knoplete or done es up e up e up ments on the projects .
Hence , engineers are unable to continue their work .
In conclusion , the political corruption & political parties' problems in India are highly affecting the work of an engineer .
When an engineer works hard to create an innovative or creative design projects , their works are delayed or rejected due to political corruption & misunderstanding between political parties .
The dream of an engineer is destroyed as there is no one voice to lead the country .
Engineers cannot provide good services to the public when corruption is involved .
Innocent people get affected by these problems too .
Public cannot get better living standard because of political corruption & political parties as they stop the engineer's projects & ideas for better living lifestyle .
To solve these problems , India has to form a good & strong politics .
The current political parties are mostly occupied by senior citizens & uneducated members .
Young & educated members should join the politics to lend the country in the right path .
In that way , most of the engineer's hard work & innovative ideas will be fulfilled .
Engineering design is the process of an attempt to improve the current system by analysing the needs of users , researching , finding solutions and presenting the final product  .
Hopanies pacting a desktop sized personal computer into in the form of a laptop pany will also expect the engineer to show some tangible results for them to continue funding the project .
However cost , time and speed are related .
Therefore to be able to show some achievement , the speed of research would need to increase thereby increasing the total cost incurred .
With the significantly increased cost , less people would support the idea of continuing the research .
Hence , we are now trapped in a catch-22 situation where faster results would mean more cost and more cost would mean less support .
The engineering design process would then be stranded at the research stage if the support garnered is insufficient to justify its funding .
In conclusion , the problems that pose the largest threat to the engineering design process would be the disapproval of ideas due to fiscal reasons and also the need for quick results for proper funding to take place .
The latter is a more challenging problem as it not as straight forward to solve as the former .

There is a common catch phrase in the Singapore educational system - think out of the box .
Essentially the concept of 'thinking out of the box' revolves around the idea of innovativeness .
Some people find it difficult to do so and interestingly enough , they even took courses to learn to be creative .
Little did these people knoe , it becomes easier for one to innovate .
The first problem that a prospective innovator plaints .
In doing so , they are not being objective in resolving the problem instead; they are trying to give themselves a false sense of disillusion that the problem is caused by others .
While there may be some truth in it , it just goes to show that Singaporeans place their priority in shifting the blame to others before identifying theirs .
This does not meant well for any new Singaporean innovator seeking to engineer a new product design .
By shifting the blame on external factors , the underlying problems will never be resolved .
Therefore , in order to be prepared in all aspect , innovators need to be alert to all possible problems he might face .
In conclusion , it is clear that there are many factors that will hamper engineering design process for innovation .
More often than not , many people succumbed to these obstacles and never had the chance to realize their ideas .
Ultimately it boils down to the amount of planning that an innovator does .
The more work he does in anticipating problems , the less he will encounter .
After all , people who fail to plan , plan to fail .
Undoubtedly , China has emerged as the petitive to stand out among all .
Perhaps , the only best e the one of the largest semiconductor industry in the puter engineers created the poe a sensitive issue in China .
In fact , China even has a poor reputation for protecting intellectual property .
This has in turn discouraged engineers , both local and international , to conduct any research or experiment in the country .
Moreover , the issue of intellectual property even dismay many foreign investors to provide sponsorship for engineering design in China .
Therefore , the external factors may also undermine the engineering design processes .
All in all , although there has been significant progress e , the country would benefit even more significantly due to the contributions from the engineering design sector .
Many people usually consider Singapore as a hub for Engineering and Innovation .
We have a strong economy , a stable social system , as petitive1"  allopass these above processes to produce innovative design , certain problems arise to hamper our design processes .
Tparison to Europe and the United States .
Thirty years ago , our industry es .
Also , the second process of "Generate Multiple Solutions" is affected .
The value of 'going by the book' may render us so accustomed to stick to the fail-safe solution we learn from textbooks we do not want to write books anymore .
This problem can be seen from the way our students consider education .
To the Singaporean student , education is primarily aimed for the passing of examinations and to acquire a job , rather than to join ranks of our leading Engineers in development and innovation .
If we were to persist with such static frames of mind , then we can never breakthrough our existing achievements; be it through innovation and Engineering via the Engineering Design Process , or even by any other way .
Moreover , our lack of establishment in engineering research and development may pose further problems to the Engineering Design Process .
Professor Seah has given a classical analogy of this issue when he narrates his personal endeavours to design the NUS car .
According to him , one of the greatest problems the NUS team encountered during the design process was the inability to seek advice from experienced people on how to build a car; due to the absence of an existing car industry in Singapore .
"Testing and implementation" would hence be based on trial and error , and the pool of knowledge we base our future innovations upon is greatly limited to foreign talent and textbooks .
We would be unable to "Gather Information" effectively , as well as select the right solution to our problems if we were to encounter any .
We have seen how the problems of our lack of experience and expertise , coupled with our static mindsets , can affect multiple stages of the Engineering Design Process for Innovations , and ultimately innovation itself .
Unless we strive to break our existing conservative mindsets- to be inquisitive in mind and daring in heart as our government calls for; then can we bring to life the true knowledge of engineering .
We would then be able to impart the full knowledge of engineering to our future generations: the experience , mindset and example of true engineering philosophy .
In Singapore , there are various problems that may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
These problems comprise of , insufficient funds , insufficient resources , design may not be aesthetically pleasing to be selected and copyright infringement .
Of these four identified problems , I pletion of the process might be slowed down due to financial constraint and the parties involved in the engineering design process might have to seek financial help .
For example , in the case of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort , the engineering processes were affected due to financial constraint .
According to Channelnewsasia , it was reported that the shares for Las Vega Sands Corporation have lost an astonishing of more than 90% in a year , and it was US$8 .8 billion in debt .
As a result , many feared that Las Vega Sands Corporation might go bankrupt .
Therefore , the opening of the Marina Sands Integrated Resort had to be delayed .
The above example was an illustration of lack of sufficient funds to keep the innovation design going .
Lacking in funds can lead to the disruption of the progress of an engineering design process .
The engineering design process will be disturbed when there is not enough money to buy relevant resources required .
Insufficient funds may not allow the engineering design process to proceed .
For example , the innovation design of the race car from National University of Singapore may not have been so successful without sufficient financial support from the school .
Therefore , shortage of funds and financial help may hinder to the progress of the engineering process , as in the case of , the Marina Sands Integrated Resort and also prevent an engineering process to begin , as in the race car example .
Another problem that might hamper engineering design processes for innovations would be insufficient resources .
Insufficient resources would mean , not having enough raw materials or materials needed for the engineering innovation design process .
Resources need not be mainly on materials , but also manpower or labour .
For example , in the case of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort , there was a shortage of materials such as sand and steel .
There was sand ban on sand exports and contractors could not get sand that was needed from the fabrication of concrete .
Secondly , there was a lack of manpower and the construction process was slowed down as a result .
These two main factors , lacking in manpower and materials had hindered to the progress of the engineering design process .
In conclusion , as illustrated in the case of the marina sands integrated resort and the engineering innovation design of the race car , we can see that lacking in funds and resources are two obstacles that engineers had to consider .
The impacts that each problems had , can affect gravely on the progress of the engineering innovative design and they should be well- planned .
In conclusion , the idea of having a small size phone and internet came from the social people , and the GPS function and big button telephone is the idea which are proposed by the government .
The telephone is definitely both a big business and a successful technology story which and the society definitely played a big part in it .
Technology cannot change society , only the society can choose how the technology develops in a feasible way .
Engineering design process may be defined as the process es very difficult and inefficient .
Advanced technologies used in foreign country cannot be introduced into Malaysia because of insufficient capital .
Maintaining and repairing the high-technology machines and devices require high costs , too .
Furthermore , talented people are hard to be attracted as there is no good e them as time passes .
With the world's population increasing , it is expected that there will be a growing demand for food .
Hence , one current human need that should be given priority is to have sufficient food for the world population because we all do not wish to be in the Malthusian trap of over-population .
According to Khandani  , engineering design processes can meet this need through the systematic application of the five main steps: defining the problem , gathering relevant information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing a solution and lastly , testing and implementing the solution .
The first step of defining the problem by identifying and establishing the need , ensures that we have chosen a 'real' need and not a 'perceived' need to work on .
Indeed , having sufficient food is a 'real' need because we have seen how Thomas Malthus's ghost stalks many of the poverty-stricken areas such as Ethiopia , Somalia and Niger where starvation due to famine has led to the loss of many lives .
More importantly , this step reminds us that we are addressing the 'real' need of having sufficient food for basic sustenance which deserves more attention and not the 'perceived' need of having food for relaxation , personal fulfillment or interest .
Next step of defining the problem involves developing a problem statement which allows us to specifically address and successfully meet the need to have sufficient food .
In this case , it would be to increase food production by designing a crop that is able to withstand adverse environmental conditions so that more land can be used to grow crops and a crop that can be harvested all year round so that the amount of food produced is not limited by seasons .
The crop designed must be low cost so that even farmers living in poverty can also afford to buy the seeds of the crop .
Moreover , the crop should not rely heavily on the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in order to grow well as this will have detrimental effects on the environment .
The next step of engineering design process-gathering relevant information enables us to be aware of the types of crops currently being manufactured and used , from which we can assess their effectiveness and improve on the current crops used .
Information regarding current research efforts on crops development can also provide us with an invaluable insight .
We can also utilize our creativity to generate alternatives to meet the need to have sufficient food such as devising new irrigation methods or new ways to make barren land fertile again .
Furthermore , analysis of the design also makes sure that the design can really work and people are willing to use the design .
For example , we can test the feasibility of the design by first implementing it in a small field and see whether the crop designed actually matures faster .
We can also carry out market surveys or make industrial visits to obtain people's responses and opinions on the design which we can take into considerations when improving on the design .
All these will help us to make an informed decision whether to implement the design on a larger scale .
In conclusion , through engineering design process , we ensure that only 'real' need is being addressed , relevant information is gathered to serve as a basis to generate multiple solutions and the design is analyzed thoroughly before it is implemented to meet the need of have sufficient food .
What determines a technology to be good or bad ?
Well , technologies are there to supposedly improve our peting panies like General Electric and General Motors had an economic advantage over smaller companies that produce gas refrigerators .
For example , Kelvinator , a large electric refrigerator production company had a budget that pany .
As a result , these larger companies can afford to pour huge amounts of funding into electric refrigerators as they had earlier decided that larger profits could be made from them .
Moreover , panies can afford to spend a huge sum of money to intensively promote their electric refrigerators to gain better advertising .
Smaller companies panies being influenced by potential profitability and having gained access to better funding , social factors also played a part .
Better advertising by larger companies has led consumers to believe that electric refrigerators are still the product of choice .
This is an example of hopanies socially shaped the product .
In addition , consumers also have an issue petitive edge over the other .
In conclusion , companies and even individuals have economically and socially shaped electric refrigerators , making them a preferred product over technologically better gas refrigerators .
In this nebustion engine are specifically configured to ponents such as cooling system and piston engine valves should be taken into consideration .

China has been developing very fast these years .
Along pany panies .
Many of them fully control a certain type of resource .
In this petition in a markect .
As a result , many state-run companies do not have incentive mechanism or the mechanism of selection through competition .
The consequence is that a large number of the employees treats theirs jobs as "iron rice bopany corrupts and becomes obsolete .
With regard to the next problem , the protection of lae into play .
China is no more than a neplete .
Thus , there are cases of intellectual properties not being protected .
Moreover , the lapany for so many years e from both inside and ouside of the entrepreneurs in China .
From the inside , petitive environment and a legal system which helps innovation of engineering design prosper .
The development of technologies may be viee an agenda in most country .
Governments have been encouraging and giving apany to develop the alternative energy efficient products like solar technology .
Hopany slopanies reduce research fund on innovation and development .
Economic challenges have moved the shift from solar technology to the cost of building it .
Company has been trying to get the market share by pricing their solar cell at extremely lopany cut their price for the same technology product .
In the cut throat competition , less revenue is generated and less fund is put to the research .
These petition pany pany has created solar technology advancement on military petition and engineering advancement , not a product of compromise and negotiation .
The need for innovation and technology are to bring along for daily aspect of life .
"Great innovators and original thinkers and artists attract the munist party .
Therefore , academic institutions are difficult to escape from acting like a government department .
For instance , the head of research groups and the presidents of universities are all assigned by their superiors in the party .
So e a consensus that China does little on the protection of intellectual properties and patents .
What is puters in China are illegally installed puters for government use .
Moreover , the protection is also inadequacy in terms of patent .
According to the statistical figures , about 30 percent of patents are illegally used e out in China , it is more likely for them to be ignored and discarded .
So in this es more prevalent and China becomes more open .
According to an essay in Sina .com  , China has sent 1060 ,000 students to study overseas but only 275 ,000 of them have come back and contribute to their motherland .
The rate of brain drain is near 70% .
It is astonishing .
As knoe back .
The road for China to become strong in innovations of engineering design is still very long .
We Chinese should work hard together to make China strong and we would grad to see that one day , the logo of 'make in China' can change to 'create in China' .
I believe the current human need that should be given priority is the need to reduce traffic congestion as it has always been a problem left unresolved for many decades .
With the help of engineering design process , many of such problems that we face in this present world can be minimized and resolved .
Engineering design process flows through these stages of defining the problem , gathering information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and finally testing and implementing of solution .
Firstly , on defining the problem of traffic congestion and also gathering vital information on this human need .
The problem of traffic congestion is constantly happening throughout the world everyday and it is affecting the way we carry out our daily routines .
This problem leads to the lost of precious time that could be put to good use and it also affects the progression of work and major projects .
With this lost of precious time , we often have to make use of extra time to make up for the time lost in traffic congestion .
Thus it will also create an impact in the financial losses and holding back economic growth throughout the world .
Secondly is the generating of multiple relating solutions , analyzing and selecting of a suitable solution .
One of the solutions that I came up with is to have a signboard attached to all traffic lights; this will indicate to all the drivers whether they should avoid travelling on certain roads that may have traffic congestion .
Although there are radio stations to report on traffic congestion , however some drivers may not tune into radio stations or may not know of other alternative ways to redirect their paths .
This results in accumulating the length of traffic congestions as the numbers of cars keeps piling up after it occurs .
This solution of indication can prove to be very useful , when an accident or traffic congestion occur .
The sign board will have the three arrows mainly representing , left , straight and right directions .
For example in an event of traffic congestion , the central transport system will be notified in the shortest possible time .
Signboards that are in area of traffic congestion and other possible affected areas would be updated and give suggestion to the drivers to redirect them away from the traffic congestion .
This central transport system would also provide an update for the traffic police; so that they may go down to rectify the situation .
Lastly is the testing and implementing of solution .
With this idea of solution , I would build a 3D replica of this system to test on the effectiveness of the reducing traffic congestion .
I would continue to improve on the design with more stringent tests and experiments which will give me the most suitable configuration for a specific area on the island .
In conclusion , I see the need to improve on the transportation system around the world .
Using engineering design process , we could design a specific solution to allow the transportation system to have a faster and smoother flow of traffic .
Engineers have a constant need to upgrade current technologies to keep up e up es too late .
Another way to increase food production is to engineer grains and seeds so they produce more within a shorter timeframe .
They are genetically modified with desirable qualities to meet the needs and conditions of the place they are grown .
Crops are more robust and can withstand harsher conditions like strong winds , while carrying more grains atop their stem .
By genetically engineering many of our foods , we can actually increase food yield from the same plot of land in a shorter amount of time .
However , Khandani mentions that the solution isn't perfect and we should keep revising and "going back to the drawing board" .
Our solutions are not one off .
We need to constantly modify them even as they bring about more problems .
In short , man will always find ways to solve our daily problems through engineering .
When people around the world are dying from hunger , engineers can be called to present possible solutions and find the best and most efficient way to deal with them .

In addition , ponents for trouble-shooting .
With such attractive advantages installed in the eco-car , it might slobustion cars , it mend civilians to replace their current vehicle to the eco-car .
As a result , there bustion cars as an example , when it is running low of fuels , the driver can easily top up his vehicle at any petrol stations nearby .
But as for the eco-car , the resources it uses may not be readily available , so it will not be very convenient .
Although the eco-car may be a great invention to remedy the problem of global warming , we should not solely depend on it .
Instead we should put more focus on the other factors which have greater impact on global warming

There are many problems than can be solved systemically using the five design process that Khandani mentioned .

Many useful feed back is needed in order for more problems to be identified .

Technical innovations are essential to the development of a nation .
Hoplex engineering design processes .
According to Khandani , the process of solving design problems can be generalized to five steps: "define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , and test and implement the solution" .
In most cases , it is not easy to go through all these steps successfully due to the hindrances from various facets .
In this essay , I e up e these hindrances one day .
At that time engineering design products or systems will boom to meet people' needs .
Einstein once noted that"the god doesn't play dice ."
From his perspective , since every natural event happens as a result of a cause or collective causes , I'm not sure if it is proper to refer the discovery of LSD , short term of Lysergic acid diethylamide , as an accident .
At least it is not an intentional consequence like the discovery of risperidone , a medicine for mentally disordered people .
In the follomon side effects include severe anxiety , akathisia , sedation , dysphoria , insomnia , sexual dysfunction , loplicated than that of risperidone .
According to above , even though riperidone and LSD share some similarities in their pharmaceutical effects to certain extend , they are different from each other in terms of controllabliities of side effects and their consuming groups .

If the sick do not recover completely , it is likely for him to get injured again at the same place .
Even bine patible properties to human beings tissues , because the intra-articular longitudinal fibers allow for tissue in growth .
Compared with the human ligaments , the LARS ligament is much more tensile .
Futhermore , if we use LARS ligaments in the reconstruction of cruciate ligament , the time of recovery can be reduce a lot .
The professional player who uses LARS ligaments can return to the court in 3 or 4 months after the surgery while the classic method will cost 6 to 12 months to recover .

There are tmercial airliner plish their tasks at night through GPS- receivers that coordinated their movements mand posts .
When the GPS is paired together with satellite cameras , enemy tracking and identifying targets are made convenient .
Next , the public demands have pushed the benefits of the GPS greater when gadgets are integrated with GPS to provide constant relative motion and time coordinating .
Using such products , users are capable of navigating in any part of the world .
At such , even the user's estimated time of arrival can be calculated .
Such products have saved lives when rescuers tracked the GPS signals from their gadgets to locate the victim's whereabouts , bringing the success rate of search and rescue mission to a higher level .
Today , the GPS is a widely used technology in not just the transport industry , but also in military and civilian purposes .
It has also since developed into a cost saving technology as it saves not just petrol and gasoline , but also time and effort .
Besides that , many victims owe their life to GPS when rescued from disasters and accidents .
It has been published that the GPS will fail in the year 2010 , however , with its wide range of purposes and benefits , efforts are being put in place by various governments around the world to not just keep it functional , but also to improve its capabilities .
Therefore , we can expect to see more GPS-related technology in future .

Serendipitous scientific discoveries often refer to those unexpected surprises scientists came across fully by chance in the area of science and technology .
These unplanned serendipitous "accidents" often turned out to be good results .
Actually a lot of major discoveries made by excellent scientists are unexpected gifts from good luck .
Some of them did change the course of history and still have a significant influence on the entire human race today , even the mon fields mon antibiotic in drug storesis one of the most famous .
Alexander Fleming was a British bacteriologist  who served as a captain in an army medical corps during World War I .
He had been searching for antibiotic substances that can attack a variety of bacteria since his graduation .
When he served in the army , he noticed that a lot of soldiers died from simple infections caused by small wounds .
In fact , at that time doctors had no cure for infections .
Every day hospitals were filled with patients who only got infections from a small cut or a scratch and more seriously those who were contracted with pneumonia or tuberculosis .
However , doctors and nurses could do little to save their life .
Fleming spared no effort to carry on his experiments and research in this area , hoping that he could find a cure for such simple but lethal infections .
After the discovery of the new substance , he came to the problem of how to cultivating the mould and how to isolate and purify the antibiotic agent .
Both of them seemed to be quite difficult .
Fleming continued his research and trial for a long period of time with his assistant , but to no avail .
During World War II , the work was taken over by two other scientists and they soon found a technique to purify penicillin and started the mass production .
It saved a lot of soldiers' life in the war .
Of course Fleming's contribution was never forgotten .
He shared the Nobel Prize for physiology/medicine with the two scientists .
It is quite interesting that penicillin was once discovered by a scientist serendipitously .
However , what would have happened if Fleming had never been concerned about the search for the cure or he had had no interest in this area at all ?
What would have happened if Fleming had ignored the contamination and just dropped it into the cleaning mixture ?
The whole world would have waited for more decades to see the discovery of penicillin .
It is just because Fleming was intrigued by his research that he could notice the mould contamination on the bacteria culture and stretch out further reflection on it , while others couldn't .
Hard work finally pays off .
Serendipity only favours those with high aspirations and determination who whole-heartedly dedicated themselves to their beloved career .
Century after century the engineering design processes for innovations speed up all-round social progress and create the civilisation panies involved in the research have some experience of breaking off or failure .

Then , this becomes a vicious circle .
High risk means less money pumped in .
Less money leads to higher risk of failure .
Finally , fepanies pound talents .
But the fact is that the lack of researchers has become the 'bottleneck' restrictions for most of the companies in China .
Statistics suggest that the R&D teams in companies tend to reduce .
What is panies e the last choice for some talents .
All in all , it is the lopanies to pump in more money to the process and attract more talents to contribute to the technology progress .
Additionally , companies should import the advanced ideas and skills from the developed world to improve the technological skill of themselves .
Only in this way can we expect a better environment for innovation and more significant scientific and technological progress .

A large number of the creative ideas have failed in their engineering design processes because there are some problems in Singapore panies such as Creative Technology .
In Creative Technology , time constraint has significantly hampered its engineering design processes for innovations .
This time constraint is caused by competition from other companies plete its engineering design processes for innovations so that it can launch its nepetitors and hence , earn the rights to claim that the innovations belong to it .
Mr Sim Wong Hoo , chairman and CEO of Creative Technology , commented that having amented that in order to be apleted as soon as possible .
Furthermore , because of time constraints , certain processes in the engineering design processes may be compromised so that the ZEN can be completed earlier to beat the rest of the competitors .
Therefore , time constraint is the main problem that may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .

And due to the immense pressure of the public , the US government turned off the SA  in May 2000 , which maked GPS develop from a critically military supplied technology to a real dual-use system for both civilian and military use .

Afterwards , both the military and public demand for precise navigation promote the further development of GPS and make it like what we see today -a precise dual-use global positioning system for both civilian and military .
Similarities and differences betpare and contrast the discovery of penicillin and the development of embryonic stem cells these tes from the needs of society .
However , differences still can be seen from the impetus .
For the development of embryonic stem cells , the main reason why it can develop rapidly during such a short period is that the society needs a new way to transplantation .
It is not applicable to transplant an organ from one person to another .
Similarly , because the society needed a new medicine to cure some diseases like pneumonia , penicillin was discovered .
But there are significant differences between these two technologies .
The discovery of penicillin is by accident and after a long time it was being used as medicine .
Impetus to these technologies is society needs and differences can be seen from it .
Besides impetus , researchers involved also have a slightly difference .
Obviously , almost all researchers involved are scientists and engineers and that is the similarities between these two technologies .
However , there are slightly differences between these two technologies in terms of researchers involved .
For the technology that was developed via research , like the stem cells mentioned before , it has a tendency that it involved a large group of researchers and even researchers from different countries .
However , for the serendipitous discovery , it more seems involves a smaller group of people , sometimes even individual .
Researchers involved in these two kinds of technologies are almost the same with slightly differences between them .
There are similarities and differences between technologies developed via research and via serendipitous discovery in the aspect of impetus to the invention , researchers involved in the innovation development and the effects on society .
In the future , more and more useful technologies will be developed and they can give us a lot of benefits .

The success of a technology not only depends on hopanies are one of the most lucrative business in today's panies suffer a loss in profits , the possibility of getting put out of business increases significantly as panies .
They even resort to underhand means like spreading false information about the nepanies capable of producing electric cars must ensure that 2 percent of their sales are emission-free cars .
Hopanies , car manufacturers and the government considered issues from the economic viepanies and the government who are largely influenced by economic factors .
Innovations can come about through serendipity or research .
, Serendipity is the accidental discovery of a nepanies , leading up to its big marketing success today . 
Innovation starts pany to the public .
These are the te up with better ideas to solve problems and make our world a better place to live in .
One of the earliest inventions brought about by mankind pany .
There are several similarities and differences betpared to conventionally generated technologies .
Products generated by each environment may appear similar but actually differ in many pany .
This is simply because in order to produce cutting-edge technology , large amount of research has to be done .
Hence long hours are required before any results are visible .
A feputer and Xerox's attempt at developing the puter .
It is thus evident that huge amount of financing and support is generally required in both environments .
Hopany .
An appropriate example pany's top-brass and hence very little financing , manpopared to the IMPACT car by GM .
The second difference betpared to the traditional corporate environment due to the lack of financing and hence room for error becomes much smaller .
The last and perhaps the most significant difference in the environments have to be the difference in the features of technologies developed by each environment .
The "skunkpany .
An example of such a difference is again present between the IMPACT car and the Toshiba laptop .
Under the stressful skunkworks environment , the researchers from Toshiba are able to think critically and design the product to fit the needs of the society .
On the other hand , the researchers from GM have failed to realize that the public and society was not ready for their invention .
The limitation of their product also meant that it was only open to a small market .
In conclusion , it is clear that the technology churned out by a "skunkworks" environment differ greatly to that of a conventionally generated technology .
The features and characteristics of the "skunkworks" technology set them apart from conventionally generated technology .
An innovation may come from different mon viees panies to produce environmentally friendly cars .
Engineers' motivation to design electric cars is obvious .
Hopletely irrelevant problem may hide behind the undergoing research , and eventually some great discovery is accidentally made .
Increasing number of death rate due to traffic accidents have become a major problem in many countries .
The World Health Organisation  states that traffic accidents are in the ninth position among the reasons e out pared e out e out with ideas which will be a useful and economic solution to the problem .
To conclude , it is very clear that engineering design process will be a useful method in solving the current human problem which is the traffic problem .
The three important features mentioned , problem identification part , analysing part and selecting the best solution , are the key features of the design process which will be really useful in solving the problem .
In the field of information technology , there is a clear boundary betpatible pare puter programmers and others puters .
It is agreed by programmers from largest IT corporations such as IBM and Sun Microsystems that Linux is so far the most suitable environment for high-performance computing .
Finally , there is the problem of security .
This is mon .
Despite their different structures and platform , the tputing knoputer users .
Mac , on the opposite , ing price drop , Mac is expected to be the operating system of choice for education and business .
Besides the environmental factors , cars can affect our economy negatively .
With the depletion of natural resources , funds have to be diverted into researching a cheaper alternative to gasoline as a fuel .
Cars drain our Earth's natural resources , thus inciting political skirmishes over oil , and overwhelming the roads of today's cities  .
Countries with few natural resources have to spend increasing amounts of money to import gasoline and other crude oils for these cars .
According to research on gasoline prices  , the price of a gallon of gasoline was about US$150 in 2000 .
By the end of 2009 , the price for a gallon is expected to increase to about US$250 .
Once again the solution presents itself in the form of hybrid cars that run more on electricity that can be harnessed from the sun or produced in man-made power stations and cost less than gasoline .
While the damage done by our continued reliance on cars and gasoline is severe , it is still not too late to do anything about it .
In order to prevent more serious economic and environmental damage , dramatic reductions in oil use and carbon emissions have to be made within the next decade .
Policy makers and carmakers need to change the vehicles they design and the energy and transport systems they are embedded in .
Relying on hybrid cars might just be one of the most feasible solutions we can look at to save our planet .

Conventionally generated technology and technology created in a skunkpare on their development differences .
One puter; another puter .
One difference is on the problems the invention puters that puters , but exceeding puter puter market .
When Tetsuya Mizoguchi , the inventor of Toshiba laptop computer envisioned developing a product patible to an IBM system , he pany back then suffered huge losses in marketing their personal computers .
With strong disagreement from the company , Mizoguchi could not realize his dreams of making laptop computers .
Another difference is hoputer by going 'underground' in the Toshiba's Ome factory  .
He channelled funds secretly and shifted 10 engineers from a military project to puter .
The development process ponents puter and generated good sales results .
In spite of these differences , both Compaq and Toshiba flourished in the laptop computer market puters puters , they had the same motive of creating great laptop computers and took part of the big pie in the market .
We are living in the flourishing era of telecommunication pany founded in 1984 - , e more accessible to the users by increasing the memory and embedding entertaining features such as music player , integrated camera , and 65 ,000-color display instead of monochrome display .
The remarkable launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007 e . Its SurePress touchscreen panies thrive and panies fail in personal technology" , "but RIM is an example of hopany to survive in the shadow of better-financed giants"  .
In other words , RIM has defied all odds and survived due to its understanding of the needs of its users , the risks from its enemies , and other social factors that could shape the success of an innovation .
In recent years , many neponents that has to posite covering for the components .
This technology uses global plasma to eliminate unposite coating , Sponents , land-based turbine blades , helicopter rotor blades , military ponents , oil and gas productions .
Having a wide range of applications , namely apply outer coating for different kinds of engines from all fields which includes food industry whereas for CWRU's technology , the applications are still quite limited to the packaging of items like  food , medicine and electronic parts .
On the whole , it is not important whether a technology is discovered via research or by serendipity discovery and given a similar technology it is not necessary for them to have similar objectives , applications and methodologies .
This is because the most important issue is that both the technologies are able to improvise the outer layer of materials , making them more durable and long lasting .
For example like the wings of the airplane , with the help of the new discovery they are now more resistible to the air pressure and strong air resistances .
Hence both the developments can be considered big contributions to the world technology .
Robotics technology plays a significant role in the military forces of modern era .
Many nations , especially the United States , are increasingly focusing their research on the field of robotics today for military purposes during bat medics during times of ing obstacles such as stairs or rough bumpy grounds during the rescue  .
Another reason is that it reduces the risk of losing a human's life .
For instance , in situations e a part of the U .S . military operations .

Technology has been evolving fast throughout last 50 years .
Neputer into reality .
The smallest laptop it produced , Toshiba's Libretto U100-S213 , has only the size of 21 .0 x 3 .33 x16 .51 cm and weight of 2 .2 pounds .
Obviously , it is much more portable than many of the other laptops .
On the other hand , Apple has also release its highly portable laptop called Macbook Pro which is the thinnest 17-inch laptop in the world .
Since it has the smallest thickness , its weight is also very small .
Hence , we can see that both Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop are similar in their portability .
However , in spite of being highly portable , Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop have significant differences in their designs and durability .
Apple aimed to make Mac its own unique laptop .
As a result , the corporation spent a lot of time in designing Mac laptop .
Mac laptop is designed to be beautiful in its appearance and advanced in its operating system and software .
Its fashioned design has brought it many customers , especially the young people .
According to a Student Monitor survey conducted in US in 2009 , 43 percent of the university undergraduates in US preferred to buy Mac laptops .
While Apple works hard to ensure that Mac laptop has the most gorgeous design , Toshiba focuses more on the performance instead of the design of the laptop .
Despite the change in size , Toshiba put little effort in changing the appearance of the laptop .
There is no dramatic change in the design of Toshiba laptop over the last 20 years .
Besides , the two brands of laptop also differ in their durability .
Since the lifespan of the laptop might be difficult to measure , we investigate the durability of their batteries .
The battery is the most significant device of a laptop .
Computer engineers always endeavor to enhance the quality of the laptop batteries in order to enable the laptop to work longer without plugging in A/C supplier .
The latest Macbook Pro has achieved the maximum working time of 8 hours on a single charge .
In order to achieve this , Mac has adopted two innovations , which are bigger battery pack of lithium-ion cells as well as adaptive charging .
The battery pack in Macbook Pro occupies the space of the removable battery and obtains a 40 percent more capacitance .
In addition , adaptive charging reduces the wear and tear on the battery and gives it a much longer lifespan .
In contrast , although Toshiba also adopted lithium-ion cell battery pack in its laptop , the longest battery life was measured to be 5 .1 hours , which is much shorter than Macbook Pro .
Therefore , in terms of design and battery durability , Mac laptop has a better performance than Toshiba laptop .
On the whole , there are quite a number of similarities and differences between a conventional technology and a skunkworks technology , just like Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop .
Although Mac laptop seems to have a bigger market , Toshiba never stops innovating new type of laptop .
In addition , without Toshiba , we may not see Mac laptop today .
It is hard to conclude which technology is betterconventional or skunkworks .
They both have their advantages and disadvantages .
As long as the importance of the innovation is highlighted , the development of the technology would be bright .
Before the first laptop puter users find it hard to puter .
Furthermore , most of the Japanese do not have a computer at home .
These factors clearly shoputer in Japan .
Hence , this has driven Tetsuya Mizoguchi to develop a portable computer , despite being rejected by his company , Toshiba  .
He recognized the market potential of the portable computer and continued to develop a portable computer pany's knoputer .
During that time , Toshiba has just suffered huge losses puter  .
Therefore , they are unputer has great market value  .
It proved the Toshiba Company panies to develop their opetition , each company is constantly trying to outdo each other by constantly developing and promoting their latest product .
This trend has stayed on even till today , peting e a product , if factors such as economic , government support and usability of the product supports the development of the innovation .
In Singapore , there are tes to innovating nees to learning and adapting to nee up ing up with good ideas and innovations .
Therefore we might need to first look into the causes of the problems such as the Singaporean's "Kiasi" and "Kiasu" mindset caused by the kind of environment we live in and probably the education system for the younger generations in Singapore .
As is known to all , nowadays  ,science and technology are playing a more and more important part in social society .
We can even say that science and technology have been treasured so much that they are almost treated as a symbol of a country' strength .
Design , therefore , as an important source of more advanced science and technology , is being valued more and more by people and even countries .
As the saying goes , knowledge is wealth , knowledge is power .
In spite of such facts , however , there are still some problems appearing in our country which hamper engineering design processes for innovation .
As a result , in the long run , the problems will make a bad effect on the development of science and technology .
The first problem that hampers engineering design is the old education style .
In China , we attend classes just to remember useful knowledge which can be applied in the exam .
We are always adapting such a teaching pattern that teachers teach and students memorize .
That is to say , teachers never value the importance of training students' thinking ability .
Besides , in the examination , we only solve problems with methods that teachers taught us and almost never think about other methods .
In other words , faced with a problem , we cannot solve it using our own methods .
What is more , teachers also do not pay much attention to practical activities , such as social research and experiment class .
In fact , they just think It a waste of time .
To be a designer or inventor , the most important and also the basic quality is creativity .
Only when scientists have rich experience and various methods can they succeed in their work .
Also , before they can begin to design , they must know about their objectives first .
That is to say , before they design and innovate , they must know what to create first .
During the process , they must know how to design .
But due to the current teaching style , students do not have any aim and ability to create and invent .
The second problem is rules in the protection of inventions .
Since China has been built for less than one decade , it is certain that there are some problems in the laws and rules .
As a matter of fact , China does not realize the importance of laws in protection of invention in stimulating development of science and technology .
As a result of the defect in invention law , the production invented by scientists cannot be protected very well .
Therefore , many scientists may make an invention , only to find that it was stolen by others and their works made no effect .
In such conditions , scientists will be discouraged from inventing to some extend .
Due to the above two problems , Chinese Engineering design was harmed seriously .
To help China make great improvement in science and technology , we must pay attention to design .
In other words , we should create a good environment for design and solve problems that hamper the design process .
It is time for governments to take measures to make improvement in education and laws .
In Singapore there are many constraints panies such as Nokia , Samung and Sony Ericsson have released their oe in order to progress .
Our government does in fact provides some kind of incentives to researchers .
In short , although the ageing population and the mindset of Singaporeans may prove to be a challenge to engineers , it is possible to overcome them .
Engineers must be open to new ideas , adept to their target consumers and be willing to take risks .
The movie star , Paul Neplicated steps such as drafting outline , analysis and problem-solving as e out e . A good government e out e to a standstill .
As a result , it may end up in failure eventually .
Hopanies e across problems due to insufficient funding and eventually it leads to a standstill .
The second problem that hinders the engineering design is the environmental issues .
Frankly speaking , there are engineers e out e out with a clear policy to benefit for its people together with the concern towards the environment .
Otherwise , most of the engineering design for innovation could be a failure without any success .
Noputer technology and network technology broaden the range of credit card's service and make a strong link between the card and our daily life .
Thirdly , from a social perspective , credit card brings a lot of convenience to our life .
There are several simple methods of payment by using credit card such as punching the card on POS machine and RFID machine , network payment and telephone payment .
No matter when and where it is , one can get money by credit card instead of carrying a lot of cash .
This character of credit card makes it adapt to the pace of modern life .
In summary , the consumption concept that consumption before payment is the main reason of credit cards' production .
The relevant technology plays an important role in creating a small and portable electronic card which has the memory function and can be linked to the network .
The convenience that credit card brings leads to its wide usage in the world and makes it fashionable till now .
China is a developing country .
On her plete governmental and legal system .
Some government officials do not do panies pany lose precious time .
Moreover , if the techniques can bring generous benefit to the company , some officials may use all kinds of excuse to delay or even refuse to give permission until they get bribes from the company .
In some other cases , in order to protect big companies , officials may prevent neing into certain area .
In modern society , 3G technique brings a nemunication company did not have that technique and their profitable old businesses may be replaced by 3G business .
So they collaborated e less and less .
From the research , the World Health Organization assumes that about 80% of all disabled people a and macular degeneration .
That is bat bat munity services activities such as fund raising .
The final solution is offering proper jobs and giving appropriate training for blind people .
According to the research the amount of blind people in plish and to be able to having confidence .
So that other people must give respect to them .
Moreover , their passions are same as others .
They too have same dreams and assurance that they can reach their target .
If blind people get the same chance as sighted people , they surely can achieve the same quality of life .

According to a nepanies .
Hopanies .
Hence , lack of financing resources has became the major problem for them .
Obviously , they need help from the government .
Unfortunately , Malaysia is claimed to be a developing country .
Therefore , Malaysia government petitive and creative .
This is because they are not taught to think critically since they panies in Malaysia can hardly create a new technology due to the financing problem .
They do not have the modal to do research even they have a great idea .
Moreover , Malaysians with these kinds of qualities and attitudes also act as an obstacle in the innovation process .
They will just blindly follow the trend .
It is hard to have a new idea pops out from their minds as they will not think out of the box .
In conclusion , the engineering design processes for innovations in Malaysia is still in the very first phase .
Malaysia government should be more concern about these two major problems and solve them adequately .
In my opinion , the problems can be solved if the government thinks of changing the education system .
Besides that , Malaysian should also start to work hard in order to make Malaysia a developed country instead of developing country .
Hence , creating a new gadget in Malaysia would not be a dream; it is just a matter of time and effort .
In the eastern part of the globe there exists a place called India , renoe his ing an innovation !
These malpractices are one of the reasons for the greedy nature of the private sector as e a success .
For example , broadband costs in India are still one of the highest in the world , simply because not a lot of people are aware about it and thus not a lot of them want to take it , this forces the ISP  to raise increase the profit margin per person .
Is this because of the lack of IT literacy in India ?
Well , first , the literacy rate needs to improve before we can even start thinking about IT literacy .
The government education system at the primary and secondary level is a total flop , the syllabus is outdated and the curriculum is something of a joke .
India has a long way to go in terms of primary and secondary education although university level education is on par with the international standards .
All in all , poverty and corruption are the weeds in the endless fields of possibilities called India .
Only about five years ago , mercialized only in recent femon usage of laptops , it is economically advisable to use search engines for information gathering .
Comparing with going to bookstores or libraries and watching TV , which cost people time and money , it is cost effective to search information through search engines .
For advertisers , the cost of search marketing is much lower than that of the advertisements in other forms like on TV programs .
In this world where profit means so much , more and more advertisers are exploring the new field of search engine advertising .
The economic factor really contributes to the growth and development of search engines .
Secondly , search engine is a relatively easier tool that everyone can accept .
For example , the homepage of Google is very clean and simple .
Without much distractions from fancy designs and display of every piece of information , users can access to what they want to find directly .
Moreover , the sophistication of the search engines enables users to accurately describe the information they want and view them in an assorted manner .
In addition , search engines are mostly globalized .
For example , "Google" has many versions in different languages .
Singapore also has its own "Yahoo !"
search engines .
This helps to expose their people to the outside world by browsing other countries' WebPages through search engines .
Thus the above mentioned features have encouraged more people to use search engines .
The last but not the least , search engines lead people into a realm of information .
It is so resourceful that people basically can find anything they want by typing some words in it .
It really links up the real and the virtual world as people gain knowledge from internet and apply it to the everyday life .
It does no only have a vast database , but also possess advanced functions which classify and sort these information into different categories .
For instance , the "Google" scholar function allows users to search specifically scholastic articles .
Furthermore , as most search engines use "spider" protocol , the information presented is least biased because they are listed out based on their relevance to the user's input .
Without many advertisements to disguise the truth , users can process the information more conveniently .
As a result , the problem of too much irrelevant information present in books and TV can be alleviated .
The development of search engines is thus undeniable and spontaneous .
In conclusion , the emergence of search engines in our daily life is due to the economical , practical and information coverage factors .
It definitely started a new age of information gathering .
Through making the gathering process easier and more reliable , it saves the time , effort and resources of people .
Therefore , it is no wonder that it has remained popular in these years and still dominates the international search landscape .
According to recent statistics , every 1 in 8 people in Singapore aged betmunity to be able to design products to convenient them .
Hence , it is one need of Singapore as a munity .
Through our engineering processes , munity spare a thought for your convenience when you age ?
Up till 2007 , there are 2 .4 Billion people or 36% of the planet's population actually carry at least one phone , puters , the internet service and the mobile phone .
Reports also show that the increased connectivity through mobile phones and the internet may lead to improved economic growth and job governance .
The government encourages the wide usage of mobile broadband service such as 3G and 3 .5G broadband services .
Furthermore , with the private sectors cooperating with the government to offer more different kinds of mobile services , this helps in the usage of mobile phones .
As a result , the number of people using mobile phones is increased .
As a conclusion , the economic factors , military demands and the government priorities are the main factors that lead to the innovation of the mobile phone .

From 1840 to 1949 , Chinese people es appeared in that period of time .
But noe these tes appears in Chinese market and the technology of China will be raised into a new level .
From a technological point of viees into play .
In order to come up ing up e to terms e up promised .
As for the Malaysian power plant , The plant , due to the inadequacy of safe uranium containment as well as the skilled labour to handle them , the project is unable to be carried out .
The incident at Chernobyl , Ukraine serves as a good reminder as to why safety is of utmost importance .
In order to cut production cost , several safety precautions have been removed from the initial blueprint .
On the fateful day of April 26 , 1986 , one of the reactors exploded , consequently causing the area to be inhabitable till this day and instantly claiming 4 lives in the process .
In a nutshell , engineers may have great ideas and innovations .
Unfortunately , not all of them can be realized .
In fact , many of them will not .
However , all is not lost .
With small but useful engineering design ideas being introduced daily , serving as a basis for many bigger innovations , it's only a matter of time before the many obstacles which are holding engineers back collapse .

Engineers are trained to solve problem and design products to fulfill human needs .
Overcoming a problem requires time and repeating trial to make sure that the product is safe to use and e a serious issue all around the  eq \o\ac , more than 75 per cent of air pollution is emitted from vehicles .
Exhaust fumes are bad for human health and e the air pollution problem .
Electric generated vehicle ing more and more serious nowadays .
It has to be created to fulfil the world's need nowadays so that our future generation has a healthier earth to live in .
Engineers can make world different by their expertise and knowledge .
Picture a scenario in mind: a man sitting in front of a computer is busy using email , eBay , online banking , and teleconferencing .
This is ecommerce , puter netmerce is considered to be socially determined rather than technologically determined .
To specify , the formation and development of this technology is mainly contributed by three factors: public's needs , economic consideration , and government regulation .
Engineering design , also knoe easy .
It has to go through a five step process before coming out fort of their opanies are more concerned about their profits , and hence are reluctant to risk on innovation .
In addition , the society is unable to accept nepany .
Thus , issues promise the quality of another area .
As a result , it is very difficult to attain a balance among all the areas .
Unless a balance among the areas could be achieved , the design process plete before being able to come up ing the two major problems , Singaporeans will then be able to create and innovate .

So the government provided the priority to the car industry .
Especially during the Cold War , in order to demonstrate America's superiority and wealth , the government became more encourage the car industry .
In conclusion , the adoption of car and this technological innovation was not only technological determined , but also shaped by economic factors , military demands , and government policies and priorities .
Te true due to lack of funding from the government .
One of the problems that hampers innovations in engineering may be China's rigid education system 
In many companies , brilliant and capable engineers panies .

Passionate engineers ventured 'in the dark' and started a skunk parable innovation that pany , have their opany need not to be enforced in their secret pany .
An image has to be maintained .
Smart dress codes are to be adhered to at all times and pany's interest .
The engineers often follopany rules while their leaders support them financially .
Skunk work projects do not have the backing of their leaders , resulting in secrecy and extra work .
Engineers must be highly motivated and passionate to achieve results .
Therefore conventional projects and skunk works projects are different in nature .
However an engineer can be successful as long as he is highly motivated , passionate and diligent .
Tmercialize it .
It is necessary to recognize that the entire process is fraught mercialization .
For a nefort zone and is often unmon in the market are electric refrigerators , which generally produce a "humming" sound .
A soundless refrigerator was in fact produced in 1930 .
However , during that time , large investments went channeled into the research and development of electric refrigerators .
Furthermore , electric refrigerators were more aggressively advertised for .
All these factors led to the downfall of the soundless refrigerator .
In sum , a society which is less receptive of new ideas and innovative products could lead to the hampering of engineering processes for innovation .
In conclusion , there are several factors that play a part in the success of innovative engineering processes .
It is necessary for engineers to exhibit a high level of creativeness .
Moreover , for a new product to succeed in the market , it has to be accepted by the society as they are the ones purchasing the products and making them profitable .
Two problems are identified which might hamper creativeness in engineers .
Although measures that tackle these problems might have already been introduced , we have yet to witness the effectiveness of these measures .

Thanks to the technology development , our life is much easier nopany surprise the panies and human life , innovation in skunkworks plays a more vital role than the conventionally generated technology .
Compressed Natural Gas  vehicle is an alternative fuel vehicle .
Instead of using fossil fuels such as gasoline or diesel , it uses compressed natural gas ing more and more serious , the development of such environmental friendly vehicles becomes a must .
Many automobile manufacturers  conducted a lot of research , development and innovations for a number of years using CNG as a fuel source for vehicles .
CNG equipment manufacturers have invested in research and development to improve this technology and make it convenient and available for consumers globally  .
Apart from reducing the air pollution , Natural gas vehicle also produces lopress natural gas in a small container which can be put inside a car .
With this development , the modern CNG vehicle became possible .
From 2000's , the oil price grew tremendously , but the price of natural gas was much less .
In order to reduce the fuel cost , many people preferred CNG cars in that period .
More owners of private cars country wanted to convert their petrol-driven vehicles to also run on CNG .
This actually spurred the manufacturers to improve the technology of conversion from gasoline vehicle to dual-fuel vehicle so that the cost can be reduced and more car owners could benefit from the CNG technology .
Lastly , the development of CNG vehicle is also influenced by the government policies .
Due to the increase of the oil price and the necessity of improvement of the urban environment , many countries' governments support the development of CNG vehicle .
Many countries which are abundant of natural gas introduce CNG cars and buses to their public transportations .
For example , in countries of South American , such as Argentina and Brazil , there are about 3 million CNG vehicles which are mainly used as taxicabs .
Some other governments provide tax rebate for the owners of CNG vehicles , so that to incentivize the using of eco-friendly vehicles .
For instants , the Singapore government provided 40% discount on the Open Market Value  cost of newly-registered green passenger vehicles from 2001 in order to build up the intensity of CNG vehicles  .
With the help of the favorable policies and sponsorship from the government , more talented people are attracted to the CNG vehicle industry research .
As a result the CNG vehicle technology is shaped by the government policies .
In conclusion , CNG vehicle technology is a socially determined technology .
Without the requirements of cheaper and cleaner vehicle and the governmental support , it might not as well-developed as now .

All of these included building a prototype of the machine used to pick the tomatoes , contacting producers who were willing to sell their products , making their research results known to the local farmers and collecting their feedbacks to improve .
Finally , they came up with their research results after many years' research , in due time according to their plan .
In contrast , in the case of Warfarin , the process was a reversed one .
The product came out first accidentally , followed up with some research to get a better understanding of the discovery .
Warfarin was put into practice directly after it , because its use was totally known when discovering it .
The whole process was highly effective and by chance .
No one expected it before head .
Besides , although both these two technology were successful , the keys to their success are different .
As the hard tomato program was a research project conducted by a group of people , I think the success was mainly due to teamwork and cooperation of the whole group .
On the contrary , the key to success in Warfarin lies on Prof Link , who discovered the chemical .
In conclusion , the mechanized tomato program has different start , process and key to success from the discovery of Warfarin .

The naissance of all the greatest technologies and discoveries aling out of a technology people plete numerous experiment and test , plenty of money e to help them make the most popleted and formal research process , like the atomic bomb , many others technology es from their experiment or research .
Even some greatest discoveries come from accidents without any indication , for instance , the discovery of penicillin and the invention of gunpowder .
Gunpowder is invented by an ancient Chinese alchemist accidently .
One day the guy wanted to find some medicine called elixir of immortality aiming to give people a permanent live .
Dramatically , what he encountered was not the success of the magic drug , but an explosion and the birth of gunpowder .
However , the a bit foolish guy didn't set enough value on this great power as it should , so didn't the other Chinese people .
Gunpowder didn't have a chance to step onto the stage of the history until the famous adventurer and merchant Marco Polo introduce it to Europe from China .
Only after that the world began to pay enough attention to this powerful chemical medicine gradually .
In 2005 , one of the most dreadful nepare the feasibility of all the solutions as well as the efficiency .
If all the solutions are capable solving the problem , then the one which is the most efficient should be chosen .
The real example is that people now are pro to hybrid gas-and-electric-powered automobile instead of the conventional ones .
Toshiba's laptop and Microsoft's operating systems are tpared to Microsoft's operating system .
According to Rogers , due to the fact that Toshiba's laptop creator Tetsuya Mizoguchi failed to convince his superiors in Toshiba to support his laptop project , he parison , although Bill Gates himself is the boss of Microsoft , he received much external support .
In January 1975 , the president of Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems  agreed to let Gates and his partner to develop a program for MITS neputer .

He recognised that IBM is dominant at the time and it patible peripheral Toshiba's laptop .
If Mizoguchi had done othermanded almost half the market share in Japan , despite the fact that there petitors . 
Similarly for Microsoft , Gates rode on the success of IBM's personal computer by becoming the full oputer .
The program was then sold to IBM , without the copyright .
This had allowed them to be a monopoly in the industry .
In conclusion , despite the fact that both skunk work and conventionally created technologies differ in environment where they are being produced , they will still be successful if their creators have the determination and are full of ideas .

One of the fepare the new energy with the new energy that is discovered at the same period to see which is better  .
The energy crisis appears to be increasingly serious as human beings' consumption keep increasing while the increase in energy supply is slow .
Since engineers are the most important in discovering new energy sources and the aim of their work is to meet people's needs , they should give priority to the development of new energy .
Over the last couples of years , panies like Lenovo and Haier exist panies are operating their small business everye ?
I think it is because of lacking innovations in engineering designs .
Many companies , especially the small ones , are follopanies lack money to support innovations in their product design .
As I mentioned , many manufacturing companies in China are running their business in a small-scale .
What they manage to do is making their designs slight different from other similar ones , panies have to take the price from the market , panies have enough money to support innovative design , they may not do so .
In Chinese emerging market , not all invests in innovation are repanies are manufacturing products for large transnational corporations , panies .
And the main reasons why we lack innovation are high costs and low rewards of innovation in China and unsatisfying engineering education system .
I hope things are starting to change now .
The common challenges faced by every developed and developing countries are the daily demands for improvement in various areas , be it economy , infrastructure or even society .
Nation building is never easy; hence governments mon obstacles , in mon global issue , especially worst in Japan , and that is the ageing population crisis in Singapore .
The entry into the 21st century provides the world with a whole new set of problems: pandemic flu , terrorism and the emergence of a group of senior citizens .
Singapore has no chance of avoiding it as it also experienced a post war 'baby boom' period during the 1960s .
A new research report revealed that Singapore is set to be the world's third- fastest ageing nation , as the proportion of those aged 65 and above will double to 20 per cent in 2020 .
Adding on to this problem Singapore , being a small country , has always faced a talent crisis .
Low birth rates coupled with the outflow of local talents force the government to resort to adopting a foreign talent scheme in order to increase the talent pool in the city .
An ageing population creates a new dilemma to engineers working on their designs , because they have to rebuild or edit all their past creations so as to be 'elderly-friendly' , a phenomenon unheard of during the early days of nation building .
This will be a somewhat testing task as they cannot rely on any past references in Singapore , so any designs will be a risk taken by them .
There is a distinctive difference in the aims and the expected results achieved for the experiments that resulted in penicillin and in-vitro fertilization due to the element of luck .
Rogers  suggested that researches parison of the tparable to those developed by researches .
The developments of both technologies are similar in terms of the complexity of the processes and the impacts of the technologies are equivalent .
Until recently , the problems of aging population have become a major concern among all the nations throughout the e up e , the problems of a fast aging population panies to keep their employees for a longer time .
Legislative changes e . In this panies to employ elderly pulsory saving scheme to help workers to benefit in their retirement .
Employees will contribute twenty percent of their salary while employers will contribute thirteen percent towards this saving scheme for workers .
The purpose of this saving scheme is to emphasize on self reliance .
To meet healthcare needs , Medisave was introduced to allow CPF members to use their CPF savings for hospitalization .
In this way , most problems of the aging population is taken care of .
Singapore has also emphasize and instill filial piety to the children of the aging population and to support their parents through meeting their financial needs and emotional needs .
The children of the future should provide for their parents as much they can even though their financial status looks bleak so that the aging population will not have to rely too much on government help .
Children also should arrange for their parents to live under the same roof so as not to only provide for them financially but also to show care and concern to their aging parents .
For example , children of the aging parents are able to bring their parents to consult a doctor if any minor medical conditions arise , thus preventing serious illnesses from developing .
Singapore has encouraged people to buy a HDB flat near their parent by subsidizing a substantial amount of money .
By living together , the children can also provide a listening ear to their parents and even warn them against making wrong decisions .
This will definitely reduced the fiscal cost of elder dependency .
However , some critics might disagree with this strategy .
No matter how much we encourage young people to care for their parents , it's still their personal choice , the society or the government cannot force them to do their part .
However , if the government does a good job in educating the young people and introducing policies to encourage young people to be more caring towards their aging parents , this would be a very effective strategy .
This is because what the aging population needs are their children providence and their care and concern .
In conclusion , I think that many developments and policies have helped to reduce the aging process and also solving the problem of a fast aging population .
Although this problem cannot be solved in a short period of time , theses policies and development will help to curb the problems of an aging population .

Aging is becoming a hotter problem e less vulnerable , it is not so good to do so e less vulnerable when they are aged .
Moreover , when more money is spent for people when they are younger , it could raise a better workforce for the nation .
The productivity of the country will therefore be increased , and again , with more wealth earned , public spending in general , and on the aged , in particulars , will be increased as a certain result .
Have present studies , development and policies helped to relieve the aging process ?
This is the question many people grapple e less painful .
As one ages , they need not suffer the torment of illness as the previous generations did , and are able to spend more time on other meaningful activities .
Fifthly , various social policies have been introduced to ease the aging process .
For example , filial obligation is stressed through informal and formal channels to increase the pelled by lae earned es at a cost .
For those who are not able to afford them , they will not be able to enjoy the benefits .
Social policies also require funding in order to put the plan into action .
Therefore , the ability of recent advancements to ease the aging process can be greatly limited by financial constraints .
In conclusion , economics , medicine , architecture , technological inventions and social policies have helped to ease the aging process but they required financial resources to achieve .
Therefore , the elderly and their children supporting them must have sufficient financial resources in order to take advantage of the benefits of modern day advancements to ease the aging process .
In recent years , there is an increasing number of countries faced ing up pulsory .
We have to prepare more healthcare teams to specialize in treating illness related to the old as it is commonly knoprised for the e . The elderly depend on their savings or their children to support themselves through the old age .
Even though so , some of the elderly may not have saved enough to last them till death or their children are not pared to the young and also , the old age may receive less all-rounded treatment in healthcare sector based on the stereotype that they are in the natural process of aging and that they are less likely to recover .
The government then has to interfere to educate the public to be less prejudiced against the old aged .
This will take up part of the public spending which should not be limited .
On the other hand , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as the economic sector .
If the economic improves , people would earn more money and thus the burden on the children taking care of their old-aged parents would be relatively less as they could better afford the costs of taking care of elderly .
On the contrary , this is only applicable to filial children who are willing to take care of their parents .
Those elderly who are unfortunate or those without kids may face problems as they would have no one to take care of them and would be worse off without any help from the government .
As a result , public spending on the aged should not be limited as it is needed to help these elderly .
To sum up , the government has to assume responsibilities in taking care of the elderly and to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to accept an ageing population , public spending on the aged should not be limited and money should not be diverted into other areas of the country's development .
Statistics from the World Health Organization  stated that:
From 2000 until 2050 , the munication , keep track of their personal health record and also make follofort of their omunication .
Next , national developments and policies such as pension systems are arranged to provide the retired elders income .
The fund may be set up by a corporation , the government , or any other organization to pay the benefits of retired munity .
In conclusion , technology and the national development and policies have helped ease the aging process .
Technology applications such as Telemedicine l
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
Clearly , this suggestion considers the interest of the country but not the aged .
Although the country's development is essential , it cannot neglect the frailer aging group of the population .
Regardless of the problems an aging population may bring along , it cannot diminish the fact that the elderly is still part of a country's assets .
If the government decides to cut its expenditure on aging population , the elderly mon problem faced by the elderly .
As they aged , their body constitution becomes weaker .
As a result , they are more vulnerable to sickness and disease .
They have to make occasional visit to the doctor for diagnostics and remedy .
The cost is heavy , especially nowadays when new technologies and treatments are expensive .
This is where the government can provide financial aid for the healthcare services required by the aged .
The government can subsidize part of the healthcare expenses borne by the elderly .
This will lighten the burden of the aging population as well as the younger workforce .
Therefore , public spending for the aged should not be reduced for the country's development .
Instead , the government should increase their spending on the aged so that they can reach out to more needy senior citizens .
Certainly , if the government diverts its spending to other areas of the country's development , they would enjoy a growing economic growth .
Because of that , they will be able to collect more taxes , which can be used to aid the aging population .
On the other hand , with little economic growth , the government has no choice but to cut down on benefit programs for the aged .
However , it takes time to realize a noticeable increase in economic growth .
It may be many decades from now .
By that time , an unfortunate group of the aged will have been deprived of welfare programs previously planned for them .
These people will suffer as the country works toward other areas of its development .
This is because the country has to limit its spending on the aged while expanding other areas of development .
This is where the government has to make a tough choice between the aged and the country's advancement .
Clearly , the consequences of cutting expenditure on the aged outweigh the other in many aspects .
A sizeable segment of the aged will be suffering through the process of achieving an economic growth .
Consequently , they will be struggling for survival with the limited welfare policies available to them .
In other words , if welfare programs for the aged are reduced due to limited spending , many problems will arise .
Subsequently , the government have to spend more resources to solve the arising problems .
Therefore , it is better to give equal if not more spending to the aged , keeping existing welfare benefits in place .
I concur e and pared to one that e , elderly will find themselves less dependent on others .
Moreover , their experience gained can prove valuable to the economy .
For example , with increased measures from government for putting elderly into the workforce , the elderly will be able to depend on themselves .
All in all , the strategy on reducing elder dependency through the 3 methods can prove to be valuable for an aging society .
"Old age is like a plane flying through a storm .
Once you are abroad , there is nothing you can do" , said Golda Meir .
Indeed , perhaps everyone is afraid of aging because it not only marks deterioration in physical health and significant psychological changes , but also places more financial burdens on the government and the society , because obviously , the elderly need fiscal support , better health care and facilities specialized for their elder problems .
Therefore , it is suggested that "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development" .
From my point of viemendation is completely reasonable and convincing for several reasons .
First of all , investment should be focused more on education as it takes a higher priority than other fields of development because education plays a very important role in the society , determining the wealth and success of the entire nation .
More specifically , a good education system will produce a more talented and creative generation who can replace the current old generation and continue to devote their best to develop the country' economy in the future .
One example of necessary financial support is the investment on developing and upgrading the current facilities used in education , including information technology equipment , laboratory and library system .
This is particularly important to developing and less-developed nations' education , like Vietnam , China , Philippine and Malaysia , where teaching and learning are still following the traditional method with less support by IT and using old textbooks , as well as laboratories with obsolete devices .
Hence , students will be able to approach updated knowledge more easily , experiment and apply what they have learned in reality .
Another way to carry out this strategy is that the budget can be used to promote and export the country's education .
This is exactly what the Singapore government is doing to attract excellent students from other nations .
By providing tuition grants  and financial aid for living costs for foreign students along with a career bond , Singapore will have a greater workforce serving them for at least 3 years after graduation .
Besides the concerns about environmental protection and education , public spending on the aged should be partly transferred to public infrastructure development projects such as public transportation , schools , hospitals because such developments are directly related to the improvement in living standards of senior citizens .
Firstly , a modern infrastructure will bring about higher capabilities , effectiveness and efficiency .
One example of this could be the extension of access to most public places and even on public transport vehicles for people with physical disabilities , such as designing paths or elevators specialized for wheel chairs , or placing special directions for the elderly with sight or hearing problems .
Secondly , due to higher efficiency , such system will help reduce the operating expense and subsequently decrease the living expenditure for citizens .
For instance , a well organized public transportation system will help minimize the use of private vehicles which is costly , and reduce traffic congestion and accidents .
And therefore , to some extents , the elderly will indirectly benefit from this policy .
In conclusion , people may be upset with this idea because they may think that the aged increasingly lack of care from the society .
However , if considering the positive impacts it brings about the entire society , obviously the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages .
Hence , this idea should be carried out soon for the sake of everybody and the government needs to promote and analyze the pros of this policy in order to avoid misunderstandings  .
"Old age is still young , its potential is not fully realised , and institutions , norms and resources advantageous for old age still need to be developed ."
-Baltes and Mayer , 1999
Population ageing is an international phenomenon .
In Singapore , it's no different .
According to SingStats , 8 .5% of Singapore's population is above the age of 65 .
This figure was 7 .2% in the year 2000 .
As the population continue to age , government spending on the aged would increase as more and more people would rely on the government for their needs .
Many arguments have been raised on whether the government should limit this spending as the money could be used for other areas of the country's development .
I do not agree with them .
The government should not limit the spending on the aged .
In fact , they should make sure the needs of the aged are attended to .
In the past , literacy rate of the people is low .
Many elders of the current generation have little to no education thus in the economical active years , they weren't able to save a lot .
Moreover , most of the money they earned was spent on their children to make sure that they receive proper education .
This action of placing the younger generation's interest before theirs and making sure that they get proper education increases the literacy rate of the country and contributed to the country's development .
In other words , the old have contributed a lot into shaping our country to what she is today .
Therefore now that the country has prospered , the government should look after the people who helped made it possible .
On the other hand , some may argue that since the elder spent their money on their children , it's now the responsibility of the children to look after their needs , and not the government's .
If that were to happen , it would impact the society as social cost would increase and the younger generation may find it harder to start a family .
Throughout the years , Singapore has concentrated on the country's development .
According to Singapore Ministry of Finance , in FY2009 , 41 .5% of government expenditure would be placed on the economical and social development of the country .
Looking at the numbers , we could tell that sufficient funds have already been placed for the country's development thus no additional funds are required .
Even if there is a need for additional funds for economical and social development , instead of limiting or cutting cost on the aged , the government should look at other areas to cut .
For example , expenditure on security and defence is 34 .3% of government expenditure in FY2009 .
This is certainly too much an amount to be spent on security and defence .
A reason for the stand that government should limit spending on the aged is that the aged is not of much use to the society thus the government should not concentrate so much on them .
However , Singapore's policy of re- employing the old has proven that to be not true .
Most of the aged proved that they can continue to work and contribute to the society in one way or another thus their welfare should be looked at as well .
In conclusion , spending on the aged should not be limited or diverted as for a developed country like Singapore , many successes are brought about by them and they helped shaped the country to what it is today .
If there was ever a need for more funds to be injected to the development of the country , other areas and not the spending on the aged should be looked at .
I agree that the implemented polices eases the aging process .
After Singapore gained independence in 1965 , Singapore safortably .

There have been many controversial debates on ing years and the spending on other sectors remain unchanged .
Homit crimes to fund those expenses .
To deal pulsory savings during one's financial active years to prepare them for old age .
Filial piety should also be enforced .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited because they deserve to receive help from the government when they need it as they once helped to contribute to the country's development .
In order for those elderly from the past generations to live reasonably well , but not to the extent of "luxury well" , government should assess the living condition of these elderly and provide them with the necessary aid instead of limiting public spending on the aged .
In recent years , public spending on the aged has gradually increased , sparking countless discussions about pletely ignored .

Aging population is becoming more and more serious problem , consuming a great amount of money from public programs .
There are several solutions proposed to ease this problem .
One solution is limiting the money spending on programs for the aged and diverting that money to other areas of country developments .
Some critics say implementing this solution might be implied that the government does not e like older single e test and assets test to assess compensation payments  .
Starting from 1 January 2009 , Singapore has run a mean testing system in its public hospital: a certain group of citizen e e lower than 3200$ per month will have their hospital fee subsidized by 80% while those who earn more than 5200$ monthly will only have their hospital fee subsidized by 50%  .
In conclusion , country which faces the aging population problem should consider limiting public money spend on the aged and instead using that money on country developments .
That cut-off money can be considered as an investment on the country economic .
Besides , a country could also run supporting programs to make the policy run more effectively , such as promoting children's willingness to support the elderly parents and implementing means testing programs .
Yes , I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be used for other developments .
There are several reasons on e in a stable economy .
Therefore , the e if they decide to continue to e more convenient .
As for the elderly , they munity centers and etc .
Besides that , elderly fortable promising anyone .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
I disagree to this statement .
The idea of reducing public spending for the aged e groups .
Thus , /deaths2003 .html} , there /reasons2003 .html} .
Although these statistics were not specifically targeted on the aged , it indicated that being a financial burden played a part in their decision to terminate their life earlier , be it instigated or not .
Thus , the well-planned move for moral education may not be imparting the correct moral value in the end .
To sum up , without a doubt diverting public spending from supporting the aged population to the other development in the country may at first seem to be the best option , but eventually , it could in turn result in more harm than good , be it by upsetting the balance of wealth in the country , educating of wrong moral value and conveying the wrong message to its citizen workforce .
With the development of society , governments and policy makers pay more attention to the phenomenon of aging populations , especially in developed countries .
According to incomplete figures , in the European countries , spending on pensions , health , and related issues is 15% of GDP  currently .
Hoe unstable , since cultures are different and cultural fusion need a long period of time .
Hence , it is not necessary to limit the public spending on the aged for attracting talented immigrants .
On one hand , limiting the public spending on the aged does not mean that munities .
Such costs may even be higher than the original cost of public spending on the aged .
At the same time , cutting doe up with more ways to help the vulnerable group and it is the duty of government that pays more attention to the vulnerable group in the society .
The aged belongs to the vulnerable group , as the productivity of the elderly is relatively low , but their medical expenses and social costs are higher than other age groups .
Thus , public support on the finance for the aged is extremely important .
In contrast , some may say that it is obligation for children to show filial obedience to the older generation , so young family members need to take care of the older generation and government can bear less responsibility for older people .
Due to this , the public spending on the aged should be limited .
However , the aim of government is to enable people in its country to live better and happier .
If we just cut down the public spending on the aged and divert the money to other areas of the country's development , this is contrary to the purpose of the government .
In other words , why do we divert the money to other areas of the country's development ?
Because we want to make our country stronger and the lives of citizens better .
In consequence of the same aims , diverting the money to other areas of the country's development is an extra and needless job .
I agree e .
If public spending on the aged were to be limited and diverted to funds to encourage couples to have more babies , many people will plan to have more babies since their worries of not having enough money to bring up or to support so many babies have been partially subsidies by the fund .
As the increase in the fund for baby bonus leads to more people planning to have more babies , this would eventually reduce the problem of having too many elderly which make us move towards an aging society .
Besides , when these babies grow up , they will be able to work and earn money to support their parents .
In this way , it indirectly reduces the problem of having to set aside a big amount of money to aid healthcare services for the elders .
I do not agree e a developed country .
Hence , there is no munity to ask for financial aid .
Thus there should be a limit to the public spending for the aged .
In conclusion , I do not agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be divided to other areas of the country's development .
The elderly can contribute to the society by using their life experiences to make important decision for the country .
They e the safest county that can make the best decision .
Until recently , there is alpetitiveness , productive capacity in the economy and decrease in public services petitive and productive .
Japan is a country pete es to employment and resulting in a huge percentage of the population being unemployed .
Furthermore , foreign investors petitive society , Singapore needs to make the necessary investments on other areas to ensure that it remains its foothold in the global economy .
Therefore there is a need to analyze the importance of each area and cleverly distribute the spending .
If we do not limit the spending on the aged , Singapore may risk the possibility of losing its current global recognition status that it has always had .
Aging is an inevitable process e a global problem es to sloe out panies to recruit and retain mature panies have already adopted the scheme .

On the other hand , I mentioned in paragraph two that Singapore is a highly developed country now .
Despite so , we cannot take things for granted as we are still mainly dependent on external economies of other countries especially the Europe and United States of America .
Unlike other countries , Singapore has limited land and has no natural resources .
Thus the solution is to pump in money to further educate younger Singaporeans , invest in other countries and constantly carrying out Research and Development .
All this will be possible only when Singapore continues to invest more money in that respective area .
As the amount of money needed to invest in the respective area is huge , the government may need to consider using money from other aspects such as setting a limit to the amount of money spent on the aged if there is a situation whereby Singapore is financially strapped .
To conclude , these are the probable factors that may arise if public spending on the aged is implemented .
Not only that , if the government is scrapped financially , the government may consider setting the limit and help Singapore in its development .
Ageing is viepelled to live .
Despite the challenges surrounding the ageing society , it is still depicted as the best part of our lives - 'the golden years' .
This description of old age is true as most countries have nopulsory saving scheme for citizen old age .
Alike munity health screening programme is also inaugurated for seniors .
These enable the aged to lead a better quality life e to mind are visions of loneliness and neglect .
Over the years , efforts have been made to develop elder-friendly public infrastructure and housing as munity based support services .
In Singapore , HDB flats are nopany more than that of the young people , I find it hard to imagine an old person feeling very happy fort of their homes , surrounded by family and friends .
I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
It is munication systems .
Currently , the government has set aside an amount to build integrated resorts , the casino , and tourism attractions to attract tourists to come to Singapore .
This e in and improve the economy .
In conclusion , an aging population may decline Singapore's economy .
However , since the elderly in their younger age may have contributed for the society and the economy , we should spend a certain amount of money for their needs if they have problems dealing with money issues .
But , the amount must be balanced and have to take into consideration for other needs such as improving and developing infrastructures , creating employment opportunities and the rising standard of living of the nation .
The extent to plicated issue in many developed countries .
Over spending may result in a shortage of resources in the development of the nation plicated money scandal .

In the modern societies , the aging population is increasing as a truth es of the young people es to mind: if someone cannot work in his young age , so that he cannot live when he is old if he has no one who care for him personally ?
It is such unclear whether this argument is true or not but I hold the belief that the governments should try their bests to help these kind of people to earn money in priority .
For example , the disable people can receive a special help all their lives , including the old periods as well .
Aging , a biological process e a quite serious problem for some countries in the recent decades .
Japan for instance , ing the mercial sector of a country e . Japan , in this case , is one good example .
Japan , as one of the developed countries , has put great emphasize in its industries .
Their industries , starting from the modern gaming industries such as koei and konami to the more luxurious and "heavy" industries of sport cars such as Mitsubishi are well-known have a wide range of customers around the world .
With the industrial sector well-developed , Japan can still maintain its economy from falling despite of its average population age of 42 and proved that funding the industrial development sector can really help in easing the aging problem by reducing the impact .
Just as the aging population is a serious problem , spending for the old age population is also a problem if it is not done properly .
Spending on the old age must be limited and not too many as there are other aspects as shown above that also need to be funded .
On the other hand , spending on the old age should not be too little either as spending too little will cause the population to be upset and therefore decreases the government stability .
It is a challenge for the government to find the right portion of the spending that has to be allocated for the old age population in the country as it is one of the obligations and responsibilities a government has .
The better , however , is spending more on the other aspects rather than spending on the old population .
If one can solve the aging problem and develop the country at the same time by spending more on other sectors in the country just as mentioned above , why would one choose not to and spend more on the old age population ?
The aging problem is gradually groe more serious in the near future as the lifespan of mankind keeps increasing .
This is es into play .
Technology acts as an essential role in helping ease the aging process for the elders in mainly three pletely redefine the meaning of being old .
Other anti-aging products such as a skin-care cream can contribute in making a part of the consumer's body stay young .

Work commitment makes it impossible for their children to be with them twenty-four seven .
Web-camera is a technology that can help bring members of the family closer .
They might not be able to meet physical daily but at least it is an alternative for the elderly to have their empty heart filled and know that they are care for .
Working children can also use web camera to keep a lookout for their elderly parents at home and should any mishaps happen they can go to their aid immediately .
In conclusion , technology helps an elder to adapt to changes in aging process easier .
It can help fulfill their psychological , biological and sociological needs .

Governments often put their focus on the country's development such as economic gropelled by laplacency , the benefits of investing in a military can only be projected as a contributing factor to the economic gropromised for the country's development .
In the contemporary society , the elder are e a profitable workforce for society .
As a result , they can support themselves more effectively not only when they are young , but also during their old ages .
In addition , governments can spend more on developing technologies .
By doing this , more and more useful and efficient tools and machines can be invented which will improve the productivity of every economic activities .
So it will enable the economy to expand which means more jobs will be created for everyone .
Not stopping at this point , governments can also use money to encourage more researching in many fields such as healthcare , etc . . . That will definitely better the living standard of citizens and improve the economy as well as ease the aging issue .
In conclusion , governments should cut off the inefficient amount of money spending on the aged and use it to invest in other aspects of society so that the result is better off not just for the aging problem .
Many developed countries such as Singapore are faced e a restraining factor for the groe in parallel to the nation prosperity .
Furthermore , non-profit organizations dedicated to take care of the elderly are able to obtain donations easier as the members of the public are more able to contribute .
Clearly , economic groplicated equipments that enable them to bring revenue back to the country .
Educating the population not only improve the economy by alloe more efficient , but also alloe here for these special treatments to cure their illnesses .
The country's expertise can also be sold to other countries too .
However , the mentioned advantages to the elderly are only applicable to the aged who have caregivers and are able to afford health services and education .
Single and poor elderly would not be able to reap the benefits but suffered because of limited public spending by the government on them .
Effective measures to identify these needy elderly are needed to separate them from the wealthier cohort .
Following which , appropriate amount of help is given equally to them so as to fully utilize the limited resources .
In conclusion , the country's development is more important than the aging population as it helps the entire population including the elderly .
The public spending on the aged should be limited as the other domains that would assist the country's developments are beneficial both to the population and the elderly .
The statement puts forpared to other sectors such as social , economical and political progress in a country .
Based on this idea , the government of a country should focus on improving these areas munity .
We cannot abandon them as ultimately they are still an integral part of our society .
Government should spend much effort to take care of them by providing financial support .
It plained that he had no job , no children to support him and a petty monthly sum from the government simply could not support him .
He had no choice but to resort to bank robbery for survival .
He further confessed that even if he gets jailed , at least then he ing years , as people live longer ing a group that's too significant in numbers to ignore .
If a country fails to take care of this significant portion of society , its people would lose confidence in government's ability to handle other topics as well .
Then , all other developments are futile as no amount of progress can replace a government's credibility in its people's heart .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to divert this money to other areas of the country's development .
The reduction of the funds allocated for the elderly might lead to many social issues .
Apart from that , it is morally e . Thus , public funds are essential for the aged to uphold their standard of living .
Certain social issues such as poor quality of life and insufficient funds for basic healthcare may arise from limited funding .
In general , most of the aged in Singapore are economically inactive and have a lot of free time on their hands .
In order to prevent them from turning to vices such as gambling and drinking , organizing more activities at various community centres are required for them to lead healthy social lives .
As these activities require government funding , limiting spending on the aged e families who face high costs of living and cannot support both their children and elderly parents .
Hence , there should be distribution of public funds to the elderly parents of these families .
On top of that , there are elderly who have no children , so if their financial conditions are unstable , they should able to given the necessary funds to make ends meet .
In retrospect , in order to maintain a healthy social life for the elderly and lessen the burden of their families , sufficient funding should be allocated .
Therefore , considering all the various negative impacts in terms of social , economic and cultural factors on the society , I feel that public spending on the aged should not be limited and diverted to use in other areas of the country's development .

I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
This is because excessive public spending on the aged can hamper the country's development in other areas such as education , research and investments .
If the aged have children , the children should also be responsible for their parents' pulsory saving policy can be a double edged spulsory for children to provide for their parents with the basic necessities such as housing and allowance .
Although such policies can reduce the people's dependency on the government , it may not be practical for some .
This is because some children may already have problems supporting themselves or even a new family which they started , so they may want to support their parents but are practically unable to do so .
Nevertheless , the government can be flexible with the policy such that if the children have financial difficulties they can then seek aid from them .
In recent years , many developed countries have been facing problems related to aging population , especially pressures on social support systems .
In view of the fact of dramatic increase in national budget spent on the aged , some people suppose that government should limit its expenditure on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , from my perspective , I unhesitantly take issue with the above idea and believe that elderly people deserve public support policies , instead of boundaries on healthcare and welfare schemes .
One of the primary reasons why government should not set limits on public spending on older people is the aim to create a higher quality of live for almost everyone .
A society is developed or well being only if its citizens satisfy the minimum requirements of health , happiness , safety , prosperity , and fortunes .
And obviously , those of old age should also be provided services such as healthcare , insurance , housing . . .Thus , there is no reason for government to eliminate its expenditure on this area while many people's lives can be improved thanks to the support .
Another factor that policy makers should consider before deciding to set boundaries on public spending on the aged is issues related to moral standards that recent years have witnessed their decline in many countries .
From this angle , public support policies for elderly people will make young generations change their attitude toward older people .
Improved healthcare services , subsidies . . . not only aid the aged in poor financial situations or make their health better but also are the ways people express their respects to the older , which has positive impact on enhancing younger people's treatment .
Last but not least , most elderly people after all have contributed to the development of country during their young ages through productive services as well as taxes .
Therefore , limiting public spending on them is irrational .
They deserve more support policies .
Government should not consider the rising expenditure related to programs to support a growing elderly population without mentioning their contribution in the past .
When taking account of all the above factors , I can safely conclude that public spending on the aged should not limited even though the amount of money can be used to invest on some areas like education , infrastructure , development projects .
Policy makers should find another solution to reduce the rising cost of healthcare or welfare schemes to maximize the benefits of both citizens and the nation .

Most developed countries are nomunity hospitals as munity hospitals .
This munity ones .
Also , special apartments called studio apartments are being built for the elderly .
On the other hand , some may argue that the public spending on the aged should be diverted into other areas of the country's development .
Diverting the public spending into other areas of the country's development will cause the aging population problems to increase and hence also increases the burden of the younger generation .
As such , the public spending on building new infrastructure for the aging population should be encouraged so as to prepare countries for their aging population and ease their aging process .
In conclusion , current research , development and policy have help to ease the aging process and prepare a country in facing the demand of an aging population .
By creating policy of encouraging elder employment , the elders in the society will be more independent and able to support themselves .
Increasing the awareness of filial obligation will result in more adult children living and taking care of their elder parents .
Finally , building new development of infrastructure caters to the elders will help a country prepare for the aging population .
In many countries , the proportion of older people is steadily increasing .
It has been shoe up with many strategies to deal with the problem .
Although we cannot solve the problem in the short run , we can ease the problem in many ways .
To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
However , we should still go on to ease the problem .
The growing aged people has bring with many problems including greater pension pressure , increasing medical expenses , and the heavy burden of nursing care for the elderly and so on .
It can slow down the productivity of the society .
It also gives more burdens on young people .
It also discourages the young people to work hard because they think they can depend on the society when they are old .
It also has great impact on health-care .
For governments , there are generally two ways to deal with the problem .
One is to reduce the future old-age dependency burden by increasing available resources , which means to increase the size and productivity of tomorrow's working-age population .
One is to rethink the private attitudes and public policies that now equate old age with a loss of health which somehow entitles the elderly to government spending .
We should do the both ways to make deal with aging problem by making aging both more secure for older generations and less burdensome for younger generations .
The policy makers have find out many ways to ease the problem .
For example , government encourage old people continue to work , and government encourage people to save for their old-age , and encourage young people to product more and so on .
These policies have indeed eased the aging problem .
Without these policies , the government may increase spending on the old people or the young people will be more burdened .
For the young people themselves , they should work hard for their old-age and save to prepare for the old-age .
In this way , it can reduce the burden of the next generation and reduce the spending of government .
Also , it can encourage people to work hard and help to increase productivity .
For example , Singapore encourages people to save for their old-age .
In the past , the old people just depend on their next generations .
This can make the old people not secure if they have no children or their children are poor .
Thus , the people can secure themselves when they are old in this way .
For society , it can support the old people by building charity .
There are many charity funds in the society to help old people .
It can ease the aging problem without giving burden on the government and poor people .
What's more , it can help to distribute the property and decrease the gap between the rich and the poor .
However , some developed countries have high healthcare costs and thus aging may still impose an economic burden .
It is important to set appropriate limits on healthcare .
To do this , we should know what "health" means for an aging population .
Thus government should decide on what is essential and should therefore be supported by the public sector , and what should be left to individuals .
Besides , different countries have different policies for their own .
Every country has own features .
Thus one should not copy the so called paradigm of developed countries .
The developing countries may not have enough capacity to deal with the problem because they have not enough money .
The developed countries can also help developing countries to ease aging problem as it is a global problem .
Some countries deal with the aging problem by encouraging young people to have more babies .
It is a good way to ease the problem for the countries having small population .
However , it does not always work in other countries having big population like China .
To a large extent , governments , society , and young people should do something for the aging problem .
We can ease the aging problem from different angles .
So far current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
However , we should keep calm and continue to deal with the problem .
It is a es a panies , in the society petitiveness in the global market , resulting in rapid increase in economic gropared to the rest of the population .
The government funds petitive elderly people e more skilled and hence increase their competitiveness in the global market .
The country pete more effectively on a global scale .
In conclusion , government spending is important for all sectors of the country's development .
However , there are limits on how much they can spend on each area .
Furthermore , new challenges and problems will arise in the future; hence because of these two reasons , I feel that government should not be too focused on the ageing population issue as there might be other more urgent issues that require their immediate attention in the future .
Personally , I do agree that spending on the aged should be limited so that more money can be channelled to other areas of the country's development .
Instead of priming the spending on the aged as one of the key focus on our annual budgeting regularly , I strongly feel that the Singapore government should remedy its focus and divert its focus to other key areas such as military , urban development and education spending .
Firstly , military spending is of paramount importance to all sovereign countries like Singapore .
The adequate spending on the military aspect not only conveys a strong deterrence message to our potential aggressors , it petent personals .
These competent people petitive edge over our competitors , it petitive edge over our neighbouring countries and also build a strong presence in the financial sector in this region !
Every country has its oe along e , they will know that their future is well-secured .
Correspondingly , people will work harder , and there is no doubt that the country will thrive by leaps .
In conclusion , caring about the country's future development is good , but we should never forget about the past , the people who are now not capable of supporting their own lives .
It is much better to have a suitable and balancing money distribution of public investment between elderly care and other aspects .
Population aging generally refers to the increase in the percentage of elderly people in a country .
According to the latest statistics reports , the current number of elderly people is increasing constantly at 8 million per year globally .
Due to this situation , many countries have spent huge amount of public spending on the aged in order to ease the various problems that came along e . This could be a huge economic burden for countries like Japan promise on the part of military spending so as to obtain a harmonious and stable society pared to the spending on the aged .
Homunity for so many years , there is definitively a moral obligation for us to provide to our seniors .
Many countries like US have set aside a large sum of money to ensure the welfare of elderly people annually .
Different healthcare policies are also implemented in different countries to allow the old people to enjoy free medical services .
All of these are done as a recognition of what they have contributed to the society for so many years .
In conclusion , although it is indeed necessary for the government to take care of the elderly people in the country with its public spending , there are many other areas of development that should be looked into in the first place such as education and military .
Without making these developments , there's no way we can ensure that the welfare of the graying generations is met .
Critics of my position say that public spending on the aged should not be limited because e less independent .

Current research and development particularly in the field of technology has in a huge way helped the elderly cope with the demands of aging .
The 2 technology that are mentioned in this essay are amongst many that facilitate the old in handling age-related decline in health , performance and productivity .
As technology continues to advance , more tasks can be done and aging will soon be considered a transition rather than a problem .
Global aging is also knoe a typical issue in these days .
The statement by Japan stated that e under pressure as groe this issue .
Firstly , elderly are encouraged to pany , the elder e people e younger .
Lastly , filial obligation is also one of the methods to decrease the negative impact of fast-aging population .
Some moral pulsory for every human being in the West .
This is so because the children do not ask to be brought into this e this situation the western country such as the United States have to learn from Asian countries like Japan and China where still carry on this 'moral responsibility' and most of the elderly people still staying with their grown children .
In long term stagnation , the increase of aging population had lower down the Gross Domestic Product  of the country .
The government has to take this issue seriously before it affects the economy growth of the country .
Before the leaders taking effective action , the ideology and engage of the practical realities have to be risen .
They must realize by lessen the impoverishment future generation and limit future public spending from expansion of retirement benefits .
For instance , The United State of America created a status of attitudes toward the elderly- Aging Population: Opposing Viewpoints to improve the treatment of demographic aging .
The government has to concern about this issue , so the further impact would not happen in the future .
However , critics of this position argue that the government should not spend time and resources to ease the aging process .
Instead they should implement more policies on the younger generation to boost the economy growth so as to move towards a knowledge based economy and also to introduce more schemes to increase the birth rate so that the government is able to meet their goals .
Moreover , it is the children's responsibility to take care of the parents instead of the government .
If the elderly well- being is not well taken care of , the younger generation may not want to reconsider giving birth since the society is unprepared for the aging population in the future and this will cause more elderly living in this society .
If the society is well-prepared , the younger generation does not have to worry about their own welfare when they turned old .
Besides that , not all children have the ability to support their parents as they might be facing financial problems and hence unable to take good care of them .
In addition , some elderly do not have any children .
Therefore the elderly need the government helps to meet their physical needs .
In conclusion , it is important for the society to be well-prepared for the aging process so that they are able to tackle the issues of aging population that the country will encountered in the future .
Most importantly , by implementing the different types of policies , it had indeed helped the elderly to meet their needs and are able to engage them in a socially and active lifestyle .
The problem of aging population has become es terrible as the elderly are drained from high medical and healthcare fee .
Thus governments' pension , subsidy and medical insurance perform a main role to help such old people .
Hoparably less pension to support them .
Their loparing to purely spending more money on the aged is to restructure the pension , subsidy and medical insurance systems to ensure the limited government's money can effectively help the aged .
Furthermore , the money petent people is to develop education .
Many countries have made different nepulsory education in urban and rural places .
The vision of this policy is to raise the civilization level of the country and give its citizens abilities to keep pace e the radical part of the aging problem .
Some people may have doubts about the productivity of elder people and argue that it is elder people's right to lead later lives of ease .
However , that is not true .
On the one hand , life today is different from the past , in part because of demographic and economic changes .
The population aged 65 to 75 is healthier and better educated than those in this age group in past generations .
Most people retired from work today are still energetic and in quite good health .
So there is no doubt that elder people are able to lead longer working lives .
On the other hand , since elder people are mostly more experienced and patient , there truly exist some certain jobs more suitable for them .
In that case , elder people are even more productive than younger workers .
It is shown that we are able to efficiently solve the problems caused by aging population with limited spending .
Through the methods of requiring people to provide in advance and encouraging longer working lives , more money can be diverted to other areas to promote the economic development .
And with sufficient economic development , there will be more choices for governments to care for the old .
It is panies or insurance companies provide a variety of investment plans pel people to save by law .
Spending a lot of money is not the most effective way to solve the aging problem .
We can also achieve the goal of easing the aging process by encouraging advance savings and providing suitable jobs for the old .
Since the money should be reduced by promoting these two policies , more money can be transferred to other more urgent areas .
In a nutshell , money spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
I agree pelled by lae back to pulsory lae .
This e for their retirement while it is possible .
Therefore the retirement age should be pushed back and elderly should be encouraged to upgrade their skills and continue working as they are a country's invaluable resources with many experience .
By tapping on the large number of elderly , the country's workforce will be increased and more people will be available to drive the country's economy to encourage growth .
With sufficient economic growth , there will be lesser needy people as well .
Healthcare Service
The cost of healthcare is on the rise , one of the challenges of the Government is to try to make healthcare services more affordable .
Healthcare service is very essential to the elderly as they are more prone to illnesses therefore by lowering the cost of healthcare , elderly can have more money to use in other areas of retirement .
As the saying goes "prevention is better than cure" - free health screening and health campaigns should be implemented .
Getting more elderly to get free health screening can ensure health problems to be treated at an early stage thus reducing cost of expensive treatments when symptoms turn serious .
The citizens should also be encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle to prevent any possible illness to ensure a smooth retirement with more money spent on other areas other than healthcare .
Vulnerable Group of Elderly
The human's life expectancy has increased over the years with the advanced technology and different living environment; more adults are better educated and well off than before , this have changed our perception towards what is healthy and what is ageing .
Despite all these improvement , it does not mean that every single one of the elderly in the country would be covered and well taken care of .
There will still be a group of vulnerable elderly like the older single elderly as mentioned by Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer  .
This means that lower educated people will be more likely to be needy of the public spending funds .
But all in all , the advantage of limiting of the public spending overall outweighs the disadvantage as the needy group of people would be minimised .
In conclusion , I agreed that public spending should be limited as citizens should not be over reliant on their Government and the focus to solve such problems should be to increase workforce and also make use of more money on lowering healthcare costs or in other areas of the country's development .
Lastly , the potential contribution of an elder would definitely be valuable for the current generation because of the knowledge and experience that they have , that would bring many great lessons to the younger generation , making use of this important factor would allow the younger generation to appreciate them so much more .
An elder is a valuable asset if we know how to make use of their strengths and not focus on their weakness .
Hence , when they are contributing to the society by giving valuable lessons to the younger generation , the best that we can repay them is in monetary value to allow them to get by in this expensive and fast-paced world that we live in .
As they grow older , we must not leave them alone instead help them get through with just a little guidance to bring them alongside the society to help , there is much that an elder would be able to give their advice on .
In conclusion , elders have so much that we can learn from and they are indeed a precious human resource in a country , instead of looking at them in a negative light and saying that they are of no use , instead let's make use of their strength in terms of experience and knowledge to help the younger generation and advice them more .
Therefore government should all the more try their best to support them not financially , that also includes , in all aspect of their life , emotionally , physically and mentally .
Aging is the accumulation of changes in an organism or object over time .
Aging process happens naturally and does not result from disease or accident .
The effects of this process differ from each person but most likely they munication .
Elderly e such problems .
In 2006 , an electronics brand , Samsung , launched its Jitterbug J , an excellent cell phone for the elderly .
This gadget provides the elderly a simple mon in elderly because the sense of smell changes as people age .
When sense of smell changes , elder people will lose the ability to detect smoke , leaking gas , or airborne pollutants and toxins .
Thus , they will need warning devices to detect smoke and carbon dioxide .
A device called The Shake-Up Alarm is a solution to this problem .
The Shake-Up Alarm contains of two parts: smoke detector and signaller .
When smoke is being detected , the smoke detector will transmit signals to two receivers which are a bed vibrator and a strobe light .
The bed vibrator can be placed under a pillow or mattress .
Thus , the vibrator will alert the owner even when he falls asleep .
The second receiver , which is a strobe light , will flashes 60 times per minute .
The other illness that usually attacks elderly is memory loss .
According to a mid-March story from HealthDay , "5 .4 million Americans over 70 have memory loss that affects their daily lives" .
One problem that occurs as an effect of memory loss is a difficulty to manage a strict schedule of numerous prescription drugs .
Many pills look similar and there are different instructions for taking each of them .
Thus , it will be a big problem for the elderly with memory loss to remember the instructions of each pill .
However , there is a device called Med-eMonitor which can help ease such burden .
Med-eMonitor is a pill organizer which functions as medication separator and system reminder .
This device also shows on-screen instructions which will help elderly take the drug with proper dosage and schedule .
Another device that can help elderly with memory loss is Mnemonic .
Mnemonic is a wrist-wrapped device that reminds the owner about important events or meetings .
It has a special feature which is built-in accelerometer which will keep the display on top no matter which direction it is rotated .
In conclusion , every people will face the aging process and as a result , various diseases such as vision and hearing loss , smell problems , and memory loss are likely to attack as they age .
After all , nowadays research and development in technology has eventually provided a variety of gadgets that suit the elderly and help them handle the aging process .
Thus , elderly will feel convenient to do their daily activities and live independently .
A research conducted by The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States shomon chronic health problems mon types of arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis .
Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many tissues and organ but mostly attacks the small joints .
The disease disables the elderly from doing their normal activities because it causes the joints to become smon in individuals mented that  "the silver rings look better than the old bulky ones .
They are also more durable and stronger ."
Heart disease makes up more than 30% of the death of American adults aged 65 and above caused by chronic disease , making it the disease es in the second place .
In the United States , Lung cancer kills the most people among the other cancers .
The traditional method to cure lung cancer on a patient is by surgery or radiotherapy mended to cure the disease depending on the patient's condition .
The problem is , most elderly patients are not as fit enough as younger patients to stand chemotherapy .
Nevertheless , some scientists from United Kingdom have found a vaccine called TroVax /releases/2008/06/080603174302 .htm/}

In conclusion , due to a development in various areas , world has to face a problem of aging population .
Awaring of this , lots of countries have applied a plenty of effective policies to adapt to a new changing world .
Although there are many developments and improvements for it , it seems that some governments still have not seriously concerned on it .
There is a robot project called Tes of these researches , the aging process has been eased to a large extent mainly in three fields: visual assistance , health monitoring and mobility support .
First , technological inventions provide solution to the vision problem that comes eter or electrocardiograph .
For example , one hospital in Qindao , China is providing a 24 hour heart electrocardiogram monitoring service to the aged .
People receiving this service plishments in three areas: vision assistance , health condition monitoring and mobility support .

A minimum balance of $15 000 are required in Medicsave for preventing premature depletion which will needed for future medical needs , more precisely during old age .
Also benefits such as national medical subsidy scheme are introduced to subsidies the medical cost for the elderly .
Elder are given a subsidy of $360 annually for chronic diseases like diabetes , hypertension and high cholesterol .
These policies made medical treatment more affordable and less taxing to the elderly .
To summarize , with the current medical research , development and polices made by the scientists and government , it have definitely slowed and eased the aging process that everyone will experience .
Although our lifespan have significantly lengthened from 60 to 65 year to 75 to 85 years in developed countries .
However ageing will remains the same for today and will not change at least in our time .

Victor Hugo , poet and novelist , once said that "Forty is the old age of youth; fifty the youth of old age" .
Old age is therefore not the end of our life but a start .
There are many physical and mental ailments that often arise from aging , such as brain degeneration , discriminations from the public , social isolation and no sense of direction in life .
To reduce the negative impact of aging process , it is therefore important to create a role model for the elderly , eliminate ageism in the society , and improve detection of depression and encouraging lifelong learning .

People today are able to ease aging process because of the current research and development .
One area of focus is on psychology .
In psychology studies , scientists analysed human mental functions and behaviours and came out petent and useless as they no long contributes to the society .
Firstly , live long learning is emphasized to help them .
They can upgrade their skills by taking up enriching courses like computer classes .
At the end of the course , a certificate munity munity service clubs like NUS CSC have gathered volunteers to visit these elderly at least once a munity activities munity centres , they can also form groups with other elderly to do morning exercises .
"People who are physically active in their leisure time aged more slowly than" people who live a sedentary life .
.
Exercise can help them to improve blood circulation , bone strength and immune systems functions .
Therefore , make them look and feel younger .
The saying goes: "You're only as old as you feel" .
Since the solutions from current research and development can help elderly to feel young and create a positive attitude towards life , hence aging is eased to a large extent .
Recently , a controversial topic has been put forplaints of the public .
Thirdly , limiting the public spending on the aged plaints of public , e . Limiting the public spending es are limited , it must arouse complaints and evokes the indignation .

By continuous self learning , the elderly is able to refresh their mind and keep up mand of computer use has become increasingly necessary for everyone .
If a grandfather knopetitive in the es more competitive in employment , it is easier for them to choose late retirement .
As a result , the aging problem can be eased .
With the population of aged getting larger in the society , a big sum of money is involved in helping the aged .
If this huge amount of spending is reduced , but in turn , spend on the other areas for the country's development , the e unbalanced and would be insufficient to spend on the other areas , for instance , education .
Let us imagine a country that has slower development in education .
In the near future , children in the country would have lower chance to be educated .
With little knowledge and skills , the country would be poor and would not grow .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited because this is part of the country's development and social

After reviepany , InterCity Expss  , had received complaints regarding the original train pany and the conductor .
Company policy stated that thorough examinations had to be done before taking necessary action .
This led to the conductor refusing to brake the train even after a passenger raised concern regarding a damaged coach .
Even after the conductor had verified the problem , he still outright refused to stop the train and insisted to adhere to company regulations .
It is shocking to realize that this unique policy that ICE complies to differs from the traditional 'stop and examine' one .
This accident could perhaps be averted if the conductor had used his personal judgment and halted the train pany by vetting the flaplaints from passengers .
Yet another point is due to a simple fault found in the train's pany .
ICE had claimed that they had conducted checks on the train on a regular basis using conventional flash lights .
This proved that checks placent and did not use more advanced technology to maintain their trains .

As much as there are many positive reasons to use nuclear power , many people still have their doubts about this source of energy , mainly due to the fact that they remembered the infamous Chernobyl incident and the atomic bombs of World War Two .
Any accidents could lead to widespread damage and nobody can afford another radioactive leakage which could signal the end of nuclear energy .
Despite a generally high security standard , accidents will , nonetheless , happen .
Technically , it is almost impossible to build a plant which is totally safe .
There is always a chance of the plant failing .

In the 21th century , energy issue becomes a serious problem that human beings are facing .

These evidences all shoe the challenge and to turn this reactor into reality .
Modern life depends on energy supply to a great extent .
All the inventions have improved our quality of life and made each human being a large consumer of electricity and fossil fuels .
With the development of technology and the increase of population , energy demand explodes .
Contrarily , the main energy supplier mercialized .
Only if it is massive built , the energy problem of human beings can be solved ultimately .
As some may argue , maintenance also needs money and may lead to the increase in the average costs .

Besides , building less reactors and longer their lifetime saves money as well as natural resources such as land .

Although it pared to fossil fuels and solar energy .
Thus , it is important to channel the funding to the R&D for Gen IV reactors as they provide the energy that will meet our future energy needs .
With rapidly rising demand for energy , scientists and big energy companies are aggressively looking for an alternative source of energy to fossil fuel pare tpared pared petitive than the SFR .
In contrast to the SFR , the VHTR is resistant to nuclear petitive than the SFR by lowering the overall cost of building , operating and maintaining .
The VHTR also has the unique feature of proliferation resistance among generation IV reactors which would prevent potential nuclear wars .
Therefore , the VHTR is the one which is the most likely to achieve the vision of "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant" nuclear power .

There are accidents happening every year , munication procedure and the training of manpomodate a large number of planes , resulting in parking congestion munication municate munication , but actually they did not .
Such as the munication as an important issue and try to find a precise and standard language for aviation communication .
Last but not least , the training of the captains and the cremunication systems and the manpower training , indirectly caused the accident to happen .
The use of psychology in the design process can help the designers to consider these issues more thoroughly and perhaps influencing his decision .
The result of any of these minor changes could perhaps have prevented the accident from ever occurring .
According to a BBC report , in Europe alone , there are 165 nuclear reactors .
On the other hand , there are also countries that are against this idea , such as Germany , who is drawing out from their nuclear programme  .
The reason for opposing is that nuclear accidents release harmful radiation that has adverse effects on humans and the environment .
This is seen in the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 followed by the Chernobyl accident in 1986 , which have reinforced fears in the people .
In addition , many are concerned that nuclear reactors are prone to being used as a weapon of mass destruction by terrorists and hostile countries .
Thus , they are against the idea of building nuclear plants .
With these concerns in mind , scientists and engineers have developed six Generation IV nuclear reactor concepts with enhanced safety features that would prevent another Chernobyl .
Furthermore , nuclear energy is a clean alternative to fossil fuel as it emits far less greenhouse gases  .
In this essay , I will discuss the benefits of the molten salt reactor  , which is one of the six Generation IV concepts , and show that it is superior to the very high temperature reactor  in terms of safety , performance and cost .
Firstly , on safety , the VHTR is said to be a relatively safe nuclear reactor because it includes a back-up emergency core cooling system .
However , the MSR operates under a much safer condition .
Unlike the VHTR , the MSR adopts a passive emergency cooling system .
The method of cooling in the MSR is more efficient than the VHTR because if the MSR coolant salt overheats and overflows , the coolant salt will be transported to various storage tanks which are installed with passive decay heat cooling systems , thus they are verified to be critically-safe .
Besides the storage tanks , freeze valves that will automatically open whenever it detects overheating of the salt are also installed .
As a result , heated fuel will be disposed of immediately without threatening an explosion or leakage  .
Therefore , the MSR is a much safer reactor than the VHTR .
Secondly , the overall performance of the MSR also surpasses the VHTR making the MSR a better nuclear reactor .
The VHTR operates at a core outlet gas temperature of more than 900 to 1000 with output power estimated to be 600MW .
On the other hand , the MSR is able to not only operate in small sizes , but also in large sizes .
Besides the varying sizes that a MSR could work in , it is also able to operate at two varying temperatures of 705 and 1000  .
At 1000 , the VHTR's overall plant efficiency is about 50% while the MSR's overall plant efficiency is about 60% .
This shows that at constant temperature , the MSR is at least 10% more efficient than the VHTR .
Therefore , countries should invest on the MSR which is more efficient than the VHTR in terms of overall plant efficiency .
Last but not least , waste recycling in the MSR allows better usage of materials as well as ensuring a lower cost of operation .
The wastes produced in VHTR go directly to the repository .
However , in the MSR system , wastes produced from generation of electricity will be recycled .
The system collects , processes the wastes according to their physical and chemical properties , and separates the residual fuel from the wastes .
During the process , plutonium and uranium would be recovered and then recycled to produce more energy .
This in turn reduces the volume of material disposed since plutonium and uranium makes up almost 97% of the entire mass of fuel used in generating nuclear energy .
This will also lead to reduction of costs since capital spent on reactants are significantly reduced  .
Therefore , adoption of the MSR as an alternative to electricity production is a wiser choice than choosing the VHTR .
In conclusion , the MSR is a much better reactor than the VHTR as the MSR is safer , has higher overall plant efficiency and more efficient recycling method .
Thus , we should invest in the MSR to produce energy efficiently .
With emission of green house gas noe these disadvantages .
Actually , GIF  has already set a R&D funding for the nepetitive with coals and gas  .
As mentioned above , the new reactors are operating at very high temperatures and have highly automatic cycle system , so they are more efficient .
For instance , the VHTR  can produce half more electricity with the same amount of resources  .
Therefore , the cost on the resources can be significantly reduced .
Also , due to the highly automatic system , the capital spent on hiring experienced operators and building offsite monitoring systems can be reduced .
Both of these make it cheaper to build nuclear plants .
The final argument advanced by the opponents is that this new generation of reactors will be more of a terrorist target , because they are more powerful  .
However , the experts say that the Generation IV reactors will be less of a terrorist target  .
The reason is that all the six concepts of Generation IV reactors contain simplified safety features that no longer depend on sophisticated operators , which means that they can cool themselves if there is anything wrong in the whole progress .
Therefore , any attempt to trigger an accident deliberately will be in vain .
The principal challenges today are sustainable development and climate change and hopetitive and proliferation-resistant .
Very High Temperature Reactor  one of the Gen IV reactors holds much potential .
Till date the nuclear industry has created a lot of problems pared to existing reactors and it can be used to produce Hydrogen petitive .
Large capital cost is required for the building of Generation IV nuclear reactors .
The Greenpeace report of 2005 says that the estimated costs for the development of the six Gen IV concepts are about 6 billion US$ CITATION Aus07 \l 1033  .
France intends to replace its ageing plants using a US$3 .5 billions generation three reactors  .
Better performance has to be ing scarcity of fissile material , the issue of proliferation and the requirement of safe repositories for nuclear waste .
Research has still to be done to work on a better cooling system and material that can withstand very high temperatures  .
Shortages in energy supply and insecurities caused due to the rising oil prices and the threat of climate change clearly show the need for the development of Nuclear power .
Due to extreme operational conditions , Gen IV systems could even turn out to be more dangerous than currently operated installations CITATION Aus09 \l 1033  .
Countries should invest in the development of VHTR to satisfy their energy demands and to decrease the dependence on fossil fuels for energy .

But if ponent for a proper assessment is defining the appropriate baseline for comparison and decision .
One of these assessment methods is to compare the GM food and their original natural species .
Moreover , scientists have come up with new method , through which they can insert a special kind of gene in to the plant cell to prevent the plant from breeding .
This new technology can eliminate people's concern about the transmission of special genes .
On 26th April 1986 , a severe reactor's meltdopared to the time pared to the old nuclear poponents in that bined pared to other type of nuclear reactors .
This is due to MSR system offers an integrated fuel cycle and embodying a breeder reactor concept . 
In conclusion , despite many people are still opposing the concept of reactor generation IV , I believe that MSR could bring the nuclear poe the main source of energy in the next decade .
Engineering is concerned plements engineering process .
As defined by Blum  , psychology in engineering is concerned ponents of the structure , it munication munication can often be a problem .
Not only do engineers have to communicate munication system can lead to disastrous consequence .
In the case of Hyatt Regency accident , the miscommunication between the engineering team and Havens Steel Company , the contractor responsible for manufacturing the rods , are very much accountable for the fatal accident .
Since the calculation for the structure was made according to the engineers' initial plan , adjustment will have to be made for a different material used .
The manufacturers are not informed of the possible effect of the change in material .
Use of psychology in engineering process is also necessary in predicting the possible dilemma faced by end users using the product and the possibility of wrong usage which can cause potential harm .
Study of behavior of man is necessary in the prediction and adjustment of the system to suit users .
In the case of Hyatt Regency accident , the failure to foresee the large crowd and hence larger workload is one great mistake made by the engineers .
As a heavily advertised project , engineers should have anticipated response from the people .
Hence , it will be utmost importance to verify the maximum load that the walkway is able to withstand .
In the event that the crowd predicted is above the maximum load the walkway can withstand , possible measures can be taken to divert the crowd , and ensure load within a safe boundary .
In the case of Hyatt Regency accident , the application of psychology would have possibly prevented the accident .
It is apparent that the negligence of the engineering teams was to be blamed for the accident .
Since the first use of nuclear reactor as electricity generator in 1957 , the public have been very concerned about its safe operation  .
Public opposition is even more intense after the accidents at Three Mile Island } and Chernobyl .
But recently , vast amount of supporters surfaced , mainly due to the urgent need in reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
One of the proponents , James Lovelock , has even stated that nuclear popared

With the fast groing an increasingly serious problem nopared bustible , it is likely for the VHTR to explode at high temperatures .
Once the accident happens , the related safety components of the reactor e safe and environmentally friendly .
Another argument advanced by opponents of SFR is that it can only produce electricity and it has shoing an economical reactor so far  .
It is true that the VHTR can produce not only electricity but also hydrogen; hopletely meet the demand of markets for electricity .
.On the other hand , the cost of the research and development of SFR is only about 610 million dollars , which is much less than that of VHTR .
All of these facts show that the SFR is more economic and flexible than VHTR .
In a nutshell , it can be seen that the arguments against the sodium cooled fast reactor are inconclusive and not valid .
On the contrary , the SFR system has more advantages over VHTR on its safety , efficiency and costs , which made the SFR a promising reactor .
Therefore , the research and development of sodium cooled fast reactor is necessary and overwhelming .

Even though many would argue on the prospects of using psychology in design processes , one can say that the use of psychology depicts an accident free future vividly .
Supercritical-e weak .
Therefore building a reactor to run under the conditions of a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could be dangerous .
I agree that under high temperature and pressure , materials generally tend to deteriorate faster and would have a lower lifespan .
However , the structure of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor is designed such that its pressure threshold rises with temperature .
CITATION Sat08 \l 1033  This makes the skeptics' worry redundant as the structure is designed to specifically operate under the high temperature and pressure .
Therefore , further research and funding in the supercritical-water-cooled reactor should take place .
Lastly , the benefits that a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could bring make it worth further researching and funding into the reactor .
The reactor is much more efficient than conventional light water reactors: the supercritical-water-cooled reactor has a thermal efficiency of 45% which is approximately one-third higher than that of conventional light water reactors CITATION Sat08 \l 1033  .
Furthermore , the supercritical-water-cooled reactor is just an improvement of the conventional water reactor , making it relatively cheap to build .
Also , nuclear power is not a source of carbon dioxide , a major greenhouse gas that causes global warming .
The high thermal efficiency and environmental friendly characteristic of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor make it attractive to build the reactor .
Therefore , there should be further research and funding into the building of supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
In conclusion , the skeptics' worries of safety are redundant with the current level of technology .
In addition , the high efficiency and environmental friendly characteristic of a supercritical-water-cooled reactor make it profitable , in the long run , to build .
Hence there should be further research and funding into the building of supercritical-water-cooled reactors to further improve on this new generation IV reactor concept .

In conclusion , the VHTR is highly feasible , safe and efficient .
Though the danger of nuclear reactors can never be completely avoided , the VHTR may offer the best solution to the increasingly sever energy shortage .

First , it won't give off carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide , which has a positive impact on our environment .
We are really worried about the Green house gases now , there is a data shows that every year the temperature globally increases 0 .2 to 0 .3 degree Celsius .
So , it is very effective to use Uranium to stop the Green house gases .
Second , the cost of purifying Uranium and getting coal which generate the same amount of energy is almost the same .
It is means that the cost is acceptable .
Pure Uranium is easy to transport , because only 1 ton of Uranium will give use the same energy as burning 5000tons of coal .
So , many countries , including U .S , China , Russia , France , U .K and Japan , begin to use Uranium .

One more argument for nuclear energy is that it is cheap .
However , the nuclear power plants are all operating at low temperatures now , rendering them inefficient , due to limitations of technologies .
The cost advantage of nuclear energy is not so obvious here .
However , if we take into account of the set up cost of the nuclear plants , which are more high-tech than coal plants , they are definitely much more expensive .
The equally expensive maintenance cost covered will in the end together contribute to the average cost of producing nuclear energy , which is now much higher than that of coal and other sources .
Optimists say that the cost will be greatly reduced when generation IV reactors are developed as they will work with much higher efficiency .
Nevertheless , the technology required is not readily attainable and it will take a long time to be realised .
Thus , nuclear energy should not be accepted .
In conclusion , nuclear energy may have some seemingly advantages , however , the problems associated with it is not negligible .
Specifically the high cost , radioactive wastes and the safety concerns .
Therefore , nuclear energy may not be a desirable alternative , we should put more of our focus on better energy sources like solar power .
Many accidents happened over the past decades , some related to design flapassed into the design process .
The Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 illustrates this notion .
On the 25th of April 1986 , reactor 4 petency requirement to the test and thus limit its handling to upper management .
In this manner , there is a high chance that the accident passes the understanding of human reaction during panic stages  .
The design of the reactor could thus include simple idiot-proof automated safety mechanisms petency .
This passing user friendly backup systems non reliant on the competency of operators .
It plexity to the appropriate management level .
As a result , the use of psychology in the design process may have prevented the Chernobyl accident thereby justifying its cost .

Chernobyl disaster mitted mitted prior to the moment that caused this incident .
The impact of human errors could be minimized mitted by the operators and recommend counter measurements .
One possible counter measurement against human errors could be to configure the system in such a promised , the system plicated for the operators to mitted might not cause such a huge impact and Chernobyl accident might not has occurred .
A report published by IAEA Nuclear Safety Advisory Group stated that the actual causes ings promise safety would be eliminated during the design process .
Therefore the use of psychology during design process would reduce design errors in the new reactor created .
Human errors are unavoidable .
Psychologist must be present to give his or her safety judgments to incorporate addition counter measurements against possible human errors .
The use of psychology could also remove all the design flaws and add in desirable mechanism to the system , thus creating a more efficient reactor for both the engineers and operators .
Therefore the use of psychology during the design process would have possibly prevented the Chernobyl incident .

Since the nuclear reactor accident at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl , it has been tmercially by 2030  .
The Generation IV International Forum  has selected six nuclear systems}
The first nuclear reactor pared to the extreme conditions such as high temperature required for the other designs .
Also , according to Butler  , at such temperatures the conversion of heat to electricity is efficient , thus producing more energy than present nuclear plants .
Thus the expenses to develop and operate the LCFR are cheaper than the other designs , increasing profit .
This relieves the considerations industries have for profits and operation stability .
Furthermore , with stability , accidents are unlikely to occur , and therefore resolves the concerns people have for safety .
Next , the LCFR enables waste recycling .
The advantage is the maximized use of uranium , the fuel for nuclear power .
As uranium is a non-renewable resource , wasting should be discouraged , as uranium reserves will deplete as rapidly as fossil fuel .
This is critical as one motive of looking for alternative energy sources is to have a long lasting source , thus this property should be prioritized .
In addition , with waste recycling , the amount of radioactive waste to be disposed is reduced .
This dispels the environmental concerns that governments and industries have .
However , waste recycling is dangerous , as plutonium is separated .
Plutonium is a key ingredient of nuclear weaponry , thus causing the government's security concerns .
Nevertheless , this can be resolved by implementing restrictions on nations , preventing nuclear weaponry development .
Hence this property should be present in the future nuclear plant .
Another property of the new nuclear plant is the production of hydrogen fuel together with electricity .
As hydrogen is capable of replacing fossil fuel as an energy source , having nuclear plants that produce hydrogen will relieve us of our dependence on the fast depleting fossil fuel for energy .
This will benefit the world , as carbon emissions will then decrease , slowing down global warming .
However , considering the large amount of space taken up by a plant and its hydrogen output , governments will debate over whether it is worthwhile to use so much land to produce enough fuel for the nation .
In addition , for small countries such as Singapore , there is no room to even construct a plant to power the country .
Nonetheless , land constraints may be resolved by situating the nuclear plant offshore , listed as one of the considerations by the government of Singapore  .
With alterations to the operating temperature , pressure , waste recycling ability and power output of present nuclear reactors , the LCFR design is able to address many concerns the world has towards the utilization of nuclear power .
In addition , with the advantages of the LCFR design heavily outweighing the possible problems it may bring , the LCFR design is arguably the most suited solution amongst the six designs to the concerns the world has towards nuclear power .
Therefore , more funding should be provided for research and development to be carried out on the LCFR design .

This is pliment the design process , by looking out in the directions plexity of modern systems means that there are more opportunities for human errors to creep in .
The resulting system is then too complex for efficient fault-finding for safety insurance .
Therefore it is necessary to apply the studies of human psyche to the design of systems so as to prevent the loss of human life by such errors .
Since the beginning of the 20th century , a number of major engineering accidents have occurred plexity of large engineering projects .
It is important to study these cases and analyze the causes in order to prevent potential accidents .

"Robotic surgery is a technique in puter that remotely controls very small instruments attached to a robot" , according to Robot  .
In fact , robotic surgery has a history of about 75 years , homunity .
Because this technology appears to be quite controversial regarding the cost , time required and safety .
Opponents of this technology argue that since this technology is still not mature enough , the cost for the surgery is high , the time required for the surgery is longer than traditional surgery , and there are many variables that pared to traditional surgery; and for some of the problems of this technology , solutions are available .
The size of the machine is too huge , making it impossible for assistant surgeons to help perform the surgery .
Moreover , the variables involved in the surgery are too many for a machine to handle .
With the development of nee those problems .
Researches in this field , increasing training of surgeons , and improvements of other significant issues are conducted to achieve better acceptance of this technology .

While the demand of energy is constantly increasing , earth is running lopared to other popared to oil , gas and coal .
In addition , if the coal-fired popound .
VHTR could recycle their coolants and requires minimal addition of helium from time to time .
In a nutshell , the opponent's reasons are debatable .
Energy generated by VHTR is abundant , inexpensive , safe and reliable .
Nuclear energy
The first nuclear power plant provided electricity to the power grid in the 1950s .
What separates the first nuclear plant from recent one is the reactor , which has undergone a series of advancements .
The reactor has evolved from Generation I to Generation III over the past five decades with Generation IV being the next prototype .
However , the one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built over the years is public opposition .
Despite the public claiming that nuclear energy is dangerous , an expensive form of energy or of poor performance , the use of molten salt reactor can address their protestations with new designs of the reactor and a cheaper , cleaner and sustainable form of energy .
Thesis statement
The major reactor meltdown happened in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and in 1986 at Chernobyl , Ukraine .
Close to a hundred people died and a few thousand people suffered from cancer due to exposure to radiation from the reactor meltdown over the decades .
Hence , the radioactive materials are contained within the chamber and if there is a reactor meltdown , the release of large amount of radiation can be prevented .
Eerkens , J . W .  .
Nuclear Facts and Fables  .
Most of the public has the misconception that nuclear energy is expensive therefore opposing it .
However , it is easy to conclude without substantiating with a proper cost analysis .
The cost of building a nuclear plant is admittedly more than other kind of power plants but the consideration should be based on performance and cost per unit energy .
According to statistics from the Nuclear Energy Institute , nuclear power plants have achieved increasingly higher capacity factors with the same or greater levels of safety over the past two decades .
In the United States , for example , the average capacity factor for nuclear plants in operation in 1980 was 56 .3 percent .
By 1990 , it had risen to 66 percent , and in 2007 to 91 .8 percent . 
Some oppositions of nuclear energy argue that coal reserves can last another 120 years and funds should be spent on researching technology for coal .
However , this is based on the assumption that coal is used solely for producing electricity .
In fact , coal is an alternative raw material to manufacture plastics in place of oil which will be depleted in 40 years , meaning that coal will last much lesser than the allegedly 120 years .
Unlike coal , nuclear energy uses the fission of atoms to generate electricity .
There are many types of elements and their isotopes available for fission like Thorium , Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 , and reprocessing is possible , resulting in at least a thousand more years for nuclear energy .
The burning of coal also produces carbon dioxide and other air pollutants , contributing to the global warming .
Thus , nuclear energy could be a long term solution and it does not contribute to global warming .
It is evident that the claims from the oppositions of nuclear energy are flawed .
In spite of them claiming that nuclear energy is unsafe , pricey and of low output , there are researches and data to show otherwise with Generation IV reactors .
In conclusion , it could be a wise decision for the public to evaluate nuclear energy as a form of energy and eventually , support further research and development funding for it .

and the critical MSR also provides a very high transmutation capability "fissioning of over 99% of the TRU fed , accounting for loss of actinides in the process of soluble FP extraction from the MS . " Moreover , the Thorium's fuel cycle in MSR resists proliferation .
The Th230 produced will contaminate the Th232 breeding material and is inseparable from it .
When Th230 decays , it emmits strong gamma-ray ,which would harm the electrons needed to process the chain reaction of U232 .
Besides , the consentration of Th232 is only 9% , which is far away from the concentrition of building weapons .
To sum up , MSR is qualified as a future nuclear reactant .
Therefore it worth more research on its development .

Introduction
The Chernobyl accident that happened on 26 April 1986 , has led everyone to realize the damages and consequences that e due to an old technology and poor management in the past .
In the next 50 years , demand for energy ponents during operation .
VHTR uses a mixed fuel composition to operate and this composition can produce improvement in fuel performance thus making it a very effective reactor in generating electricity .
This composition is a mixture of 15% carbide and 85% oxide in the fissile particles .
GCFR is a concept pare to the VTHR , therefore the materials used for construction is cheaper and there are more choices of material available .
Sustainability
GCFR is an excellent choice in terms of sustainability because it is capable in minimizing radioactive pared to the VHTR .

With regard to safety , people are usually afraid of the accident caused by the nuclear reactors .
This is because that once a nuclear reactor accident happened , it petent in this aspect of safety .
Besides safety , economy is also a very important aspect pletion time to just four or five years , and lobined-cycled natural gas-poparing ing a very reasonable alternative for us human beings to choose to replace today's fossil energy resource .
Furthermore , the lead-cooled fast reactor is competent to get further research and development funding , because it is both safe and economic .
The prospective of lead-cooled fast reactor is very promising .

According to Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary , the e first no matter hoe to emergency , the most important thing is often the individual ability to react rationally to resolve the problem .
How many people could possibly remain calm when facing a sudden emergency ?
However , this ability can be gained through intensive training .
Practice makes perfect .
The more one gets trained , the more readily he is to face an emergency .
Concisely , the approach of psychological knowledge can prevent or at least reduce the probability of accidents occurring .
Studies of human behavior , stages of an accident , investigation on industrial accident , together with some necessary and suitable psychological approach would definitely help in minimizing the occurring of severe accidents , especially those that are due to errors in human judgments .
The drastic industrial development and advancement in science and technology has led to the rising energy demand noes the main effort of the es a hot issue today due to the negative effects that e via evidences and discoveries from the research done .
We are nopensated in the long run .
Needs for energy are neither going to decrease nor are sources of energy going to increase .
Therefore , e uneconomical; on the other hand , VHTR uses half the amount of fuel to produce equal amount of energy , hence it can last longer .

There has been a debate betparing the tpared to the VHTR .
For people pared to the VHTR in our future .
By the year 2030 , many of the current operating nuclear popared .
In the case of the Very-high-temperature reactors , the cost of running the plant is lopared to Molten salt reactors .
The efficiency of the VHTR is also >50% as compared to conventional reactors .
VHTR produces hydrogen as a byproduct , thus increasing the chances of utilizing the reactors for other energy sources .
VHTR's technology is based on an upgrade to current HTR technologies .
Therefore , the estimated time to receive the technologies pared to MSR .
MSR's research requires scientists to pared to the loe .
At the turn of the millennium , the rising of Asian countries such as China and India has intensified the competition of energy .
In 2007 , China consumes a third as much oil as the United States , ing the terrorists' targets .
Acknopared to the current generation of reactors such as Boiling Water Reactors  and Pressurised Water Reactor  .
Better heat transfer also allopared parable 45% thermal efficiency , in spite being a nepared to mission facilities , e by using a t/files/folders/1654/dol}
As the world copes with the rising cost of oil , governments are investing into different energy fields to diversify their energy sources so as to increase their countries' energy independence .
Some argue that we should not be investing into nuclear energy as it is expensive to build and run and that it is not a renewable energy source , hence we should invest into renewable energies which are more sustainable .
Though renewable energy may be sustainable , their energy supplies are intermittent depending on environmental factors .
Therefore , they are unable to meet the intense energy demand of our growing economies .
Nuclear plants are more expensive to build than the other energy sources , but it is a premium that we have to pay to obtain a reliable and consistent supply of energy to drive our economic progress .
Furthermore , the VHTR concept has a high fuel burn up ratio which translates to an efficiency of 80% which is significantly higher than renewable energies which have efficiencies of 20-30%  .
The VHTR also produces hydrogen which could be used as another source of fuel for power plants or could be sold to industries which use it , hence generates a source of revenue for the state .
It is also good that we diversify our energy sources to booster our energy security .
Hence we should continue to develop nuclear energy as it is a proven tool to obtain constant steady supply of energy .
Furthermore the high energy efficiency and potential uses of hydrogen , gives it more economic advantages over the renewable energies .
Another issue that nuclear energy would address is global warming .
As we know global warming is mainly caused by greenhouse emission from the burning of fossil fuels and its impacts include climate change and the flooding of low lying area hence jeopardizing the survival of our future generations .
Nuclear energy is 'clean' as it does not release any greenhouse emissions .
Furthermore , the ability of the VHTR to produce hydrogen provides another source of clean energy which we could utilize to power our economies and cars which are the main contributors of greenhouse emissions .
By reducing the carbon emissions from these two sources , we would be able to buy us more time to develop technologies to tackle the global warming issue; therefore we should develop the VHTR to aid our cause .
The design of the VHTR has incorporated a lot of safety features which enhances the safety of operating a nuclear plant .
Coupled with that , the strict regulation of the IAEA and its frequent checks ensure that the infrastructure remains safe and intact hence safeguarding the interest of the public .
Furthermore , the high power efficiency of the VHTR makes it economical to operate and the production of hydrogen provide a source of revenue for the state as well as another alternative source of clean energy which reduces greenhouse emissions .
Since the VHTR is able to benefit us economically and environmentally , we should continue to develop it despite its risks .

The first generation of nuclear reactors has been built in 1950 .
Since then , continuous researches have been done to produce a better generation of nuclear reactors .
There are 436 active nuclear poe .
Many people mistakenly equate nuclear poparison
One of the Achilles' heels of nuclear poe environmentally hostile to human and pared to SFR .
The element sodium has a lopared to lead's higher 2023 Kelvins , es overheated and starts to boils .
In the event of an unprotected total loss of poe radioactive and therefore harmful to life during refueling e a very important criterion in the e a consideration .
The LFR's smaller core and lesser required cooling systems , such as the omission of an intermediate cooling link , saves significant building costs as compared to SFR .
In fact , the lead/bismuth-cooled SVBR-75/100 is the cheapest to build amongst other types of fast reactors .
Furthermore , it costs less per kWh of electricity compared to SFR .
Another strong advantage is the scalability of LFR that allopared to 65kW/kgHM of the SFR .
.
On the other hand , SFR does have some good points .
Sodium is four times more effective as a cooling agent than LFR , because of its better thermal hydraulic properties .
.
Furthermore , SFR has better net efficiency than LFR , 46 .2% versus 34 .6% for the latter .
SFR has been the mainstream for nuclear poplex design .
All in all , the overwhelming advantages of LFR as a future implementation of the new generation IV nuclear plant , proves that it is better than the SFR in all of the above aspects .
Therefore , we should push for development of LFR nuclear power plants .
To conclude , nuclear energy is relatively cheap , environmentally and socially responsible and safe to use .
Most of the participating nations and organizations of the Generation IV International Forum are supportive of this new technology and they have pooled US$500 million over the next 5 years to fund its further research and development  .
It is imperative for us to accept and embrace this new form of technology in order to meet the world's increasing energy demand .
An accident is often an unintended action plexity of task by providing short and efficient procedure guidelines .
The failure to do so shoe in handy to prevent accidents from happening , especially mended , plex high hazard system . 
It should be evident that psychology plays a huge role in the design process in order to ensure the safety of the system .
A serious disaster is usually caused by a series of events such as the case plexity of the system while implementing safety measures .
With that , the disaster could have been prevented .

The most common method of popared to 70% and above for non-nuclear popared to 300-400  C in current nuclear reactors .
This higher temperature translates to the extraction of 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel  .
Improved engineering and design parison is not practical .
Lastly , because of the higher temperature , it is possible to produce hydrogen gas from e a fuel for cars in the future .
Therefore , the VHTR design is superior as it produces more energy and hydrogen gas
Another objection is raised by the taxpayers; they are not convinced with the heavy investment of building a nuclear plant .TS A nuclear plant costs on average , a billion dollars and is designed with a lifespan of sixty years  .
Although the price is high , the nuclear plant will not produce any greenhouse or acidic gases .
Acid rain had caused deforestation and affected fisheries , the damages amounts to millions per year .
Global warming has been linked to the more frequent occurrence of natural disasters .
These disasters created uncountable losses in terms of damage to infrastructure , economy and lives .
In rebuttal to the "limited lifespan" of the nuclear plant , in sixty years , this nuclear plant will have produced much cheaper electricity and caused less harm to the environment .
These two advantages are definitely significant .
In conclusion , funding for research on the VHTR must be supported .
This is because the VHTR is much safer due to its superior design and "proliferation-proof" process .
The VHTR will in fact produce more and cheaper energy than existing power plants .
In addition , the VHTR produces useful hydrogen gas and is environmentally friendly .
As such , there is no doubt that this technology is superior .
On March 27 , 1977 , the ment "We are uh taking off" or "We are at takeoff" from KLM and the single channel radio munication could still happen , having the tense situation of Tenerife in mind .
Moreover , even munication still causes accidents such as the Garuda A300 Airbus crash in Sumatra  .
For takeoff regulation , it is the first officer's responsibility to obtain ATC clearance and oversee the captain .
Hopleted after the suspension of his decision by the first officer to ask for clearance .
In addition , bination of various accidental factors .
Firstly , the terrorism attack bination of the fact that the controllers were bad at English and unfamiliar with handling Boeing 747s  , there was a high chance that accident would happen even with contingency plans .
In fact , the Pan Am was told to turn at exit C-3 which was impossible for a 747 so the captain decided to turn at C-4 and collided with KLM between C-3 and C-4 exits  .
Human beings have come across severe energy problems in the 21 century .
Scientists have put in a lot effort to the development in nuclear energy petitiveness"  .
And pared to fuel or coal burning electric generating plant .
It can bring great economic benefit .
Lastly , the lack of technology to deal with the disposal of nuclear plants which are radioactive and highly toxic is the last reason prevents countries from using nuclear energy .
Officers are afraid of terrorists who acquire a substantial amount of nuclear waste could construct a so-called "dirty bomb" which may affect the country's safety .
But the truth is technology is developing every day .
Scientists have found other ways to reuse the nuclear waste in order to make more benefits  .
And if government can reinforce the management of where the nuclear waste goes after using , people do not have to worry about the attack from terrorists .

The heart is the most vital organ for every human being .
This brings no surprise to cardiovascular diseases being one of the leading causes of death in the patible heart at a short period of time .
Proving to be very difficult , the mortality rate of cardiovascular disease remains high .
As medical technology advanced , heavy amounts of research and development have been put to finding a better alternative for saving cardiovascular disease patients .
The research and development efforts gave rise to the creation of Heartmate II .
Like hopatibility and durability , there is still much to improve in terms of safety , performance and cost .
Currently Heartmate II is operating at a 70 .6% success rate plications2 .
I feel that there is much room for improvement for the design to enhance Heartmate II's safety and performance and efforts should not stop till a much higher percentage success rate is achieved .
Battery life is one of the main concerns that need to be addressed for the Heartmate II .
Currently , the external battery pack of tpromise in the size of Heartmate II .
The bulkiness of the device could reduce the mobility of a patient and in turn increase the possibility for bleeding issues internally .
Essentially , pact and less bulky battery with longer life span .
Another factor to increase the safety of Heartmate II would be the alteration of the materials used to manufacture the appliance .
Firstly , it has been reflected that users are facing problems with regard to issues surrounding water resistivity externally3 .
Being caught in a rain would prove to be fatal to a Heartmate II user .
Upgrading the material's water resistivity would make Heartmate II safer .
Furthermore , users could even enable the user to take a proper bath , instead of being restricted to just wiping themselves clean with a wet cloth .
In addition , the materials of the wall of the internal artificial ventricles and pump have to be made to have none or negligible resistance so as to ensure smoother blood flow rate .
Lastly , a lighter material should be preferable for the Heartmate II to reduce any strain whilst being attached to its users internally and externally .
All these elements are crucial to the performance and safety of the Heartmate II .
There exist many more avenues that can be explored to improve the Heartmate II and the invention of an artificial heart is still in early stages of its development .
Amidst this discussion , I feel that the cost should not be a determining factor in the construction and application for such health devices that could determines ones life and death .
Issues of security and performance hold the highest priority for medical prototype designs like the Heartmate II .
I strongly feel that the strife for more development and research should be done for the sake of creating a more durable and lightweight Heartmate III .

The parable economics .
The very high temperature reactor , belonging to the nepared putational methods can be used for simulating air ingress in the VHTR to help prevent the accident  .
Apart from safety issue , in order to implement the very high temperature reactor , people also concern about the economic factor .
Without arguing , it is more expensive to build a nepetitiveness , nuclear safety , is promising to be implemented in the future .
Firstly , people paring to that of the current nuclear reactor e by that time .
With the rapid industrialisation , the energy requirements of the ing graver everyday and threatens to eradicate life altogether on this planet .
This calls for rapid steps to be taken .
The present idea is to substitute these fuels to an extent with nuclear energy .
The problem with nuclear fuel is that it is extremely hazardous and painstaking research into effective tapping of the nuclear energy continues everyday .
After the Chernobyl disaster involving the radioactive substances escaping the nuclear reactors and killing several people , the world has realised it wants an effective  , clean and safe way to tap this dangerous energy source .
Most of the present research into the nuclear reactor designs is being directed into perfecting the series of reactors called the GENERATION IV REACTORS .
All these reactors are still in the design stage and do not have operational status .They are aimed at providing energy in a more safe and efficient way .There are 6 types of reactors amongst the Generation 4 reactors each with its own advantages and disadadvantages .However  , the type of reactor called the Very High Temperature Reactor  seems really promising and has much greater potential than the other models .
The fuel which is used in VHTR is uranium carbide pellets which are extremely heat resistant .
One of the major reasons for accidents in a nuclear power plant is the meltdown within a nuclear reactor .
With the fuel being so thermally inactive that it doesn't break down even in the event of a meltdown clearly poses as a major safety advantage .Another advantage is that the VHTR does not require frequent refuelling which extracts a heavy toll on the human labour  .
This takes care of a potential risk , human error .
Infact the refuelling in this type of reactor can be achieved when it is still running .It is so highly efficient that a single pebble can last upto three years . 
One of the major problems related to generating energy from nuclear fuel is the disposal of the spent fuel which is highly radioactive .
In the case of the VHTR the spent fuel is literally infissionable .
The energy generation is so efficient that there is almost a negligible amount of fissionable substance left .
China , Canada , France  , Japan , Euratom and the USA have already signed on the System Agreement for the VHTR under the Framework Agreement  .The total budget for the research and development of the Generation 4 reactors is estimated to be 6 Billion USD according to a GreenPeace report of 2005  .
Arguments to support further research and development funding for Very High Temperature Reactor .
Nuclear popared to other energy sources such as coal , oil and pared to gas , coal and oil which are the three main energy sources in the world .
The implicit cost of pollution that we have to pay is also essentially zero .
This is because the only emission to the environment is steam , which does not pollute the environment in any manner .
Thus , cost should not be an area of concern for the general public .
It is therefore evident that safety and security issues have been well addressed by the 'new pebble bed core' of VHTR .
The problem on disposal of nuclear waste is also solved by the ability of VHTR to consume existing nuclear waste and producing nuclear waste with shorter half-lives .
Finally , high cost of nuclear energy is not a valid argument as its cost has always been one of the lowest in terms of implicit and explicit cost .
Hence , I conclude that there must be further research and funding for the Generation IV reactors .
Ever since the first robot e in the form of robotic doctors .
With the traditional mindsets the general public has , it is no pared to conventional surgery , such as the reduction of recovery time .
Having said that , it may be too early to conclude that robotic surgery mon for people to experience a machine breakdoplications after a robot-aided operation by an inexperienced surgeon  .

4Lack of experience
Obviously , the human factors occupy a large proportion .
In fact , according to a recent study conducted at the Spelled to be the target of public criticism for a long time , feprehensive study on human factors to reveal the truth .
Actually , the e out to take the consequences .
This is unfair to engineers , the most important founders of modern world .
As it is suggested by psychology , providing favorable working conditions and environment for engineers can be an important element in preventing accidents from happening .
Yet the design of environment of workplaces is just the very process which is neglected by most of the governments and industry directors .
The glare , noise , extreme temperature , vibration , high humidity , acceleration and other physical factors can seriously affect the performance of engineers and both their physical and mental health .
Therefore , psychologists can play an irreplaceable role in designing workplaces by analyzing the structure of users' physical and mental system so as to guarantee that workers can perform in a good condition from start to finish .
Relieving fatigue and restores vitality should be the best way for engineers to prevent accidents .
Third , the public criticism upon engineers needs to be more objective when referring to the theory of possibility .
Just like what B .Wilpert have illustrated in Psychology and design processes , engineers are human and it is possible for human to make mistakes , in other words , engineers need more understanding from the society in a sense .
In theoretical speaking , everything must eventually fail to perform its given function .
The possibility is there .
That is why accidents are called "accidents" and that is why human are called "human" not "god" .
In conclusion , study of psychology regarding prevention of accidents is necessary under this people-oriented situation .
Engineers should not have been over-expected; after all , engineers are also ordinary people and have limitations of human as well .
As human , they need relaxing , they need working in sound conditions and they also need the understanding and recognition of the society as well .
Only if the key players , engineers , are concerned and given due attention can the world of engineering run in the right direction .
That is the best approach to prevent accidents .
Fortunately , a new subject named "Engineering Psychology" has already started to boom recently , which is concerned with adapting the equipment and environment to people , based upon their psychological capacities and limitations .
From the development and achievements of this subject in not-too-distant future , the choice for a better design and the way to prevent accidents can be directly obtained .
Very-high Temperature Reactor  is one of the six generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV nuclear reactor systems selected by the Generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV International Forum for further development in 2002  .
The VHTR uses graphite as the core material and helium as coolant of the reactor to generate nuclear heat e . The VHTR is a safe and profitable nuclear reactor with excellent prospect .
Thus , the VHTR is worth further research .
Hopefully , it will be widely used within a decade .
For decades surgery is operated by human force only , plicated procedures .
In 1985 , the emergence of a prototype "PUMA 560" pointed out a nees of robotic surgery also reveal that it is a safe surgery method .
In America , pared it parable to conventional one in safety and effectiveness , according to FDA . 
For the cost issue , robotic surgery indeed requires large cost on research and manufacture .
This is because extremely sensitive elements are used to capture the patients' situation during the surgery .
In addition , to train surgeons hopleted in 2008  .
According to Robin  , hospitals have been picking up the difference in costs in order to get their staff trained on the systems so far .
Some people doubt the performance of robotic surgery .
They claim that robots lack flexibility and can only perform pletely artificial intelligent robot is not available at the moment .
So patients should not be bination of the two will also make modern surgery up to a new level .
According to surgeons , patients' feedback on robotic surgery has been very positive  .
Therefore , in my opinion , robotic surgery is worth developing and trusting .
Nuclear poe up missioning , the VHTR can still discharge surplus heat and do not need additional safety systems like other types of reactors do" .
"The HTR-10 petitive in the fierce competition of today's energy market  .
Although the public is very concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors , the technological breakthrough and theory innovation shoponents are functioning .
Through these engineers can predict the impact of a possible defeated in current and farabine the reactor to the hydrogen production plant .
Hopefully , through the realization of these studies , the dangerous of nuclear reactors' operation}
Chernobyl accident happened on April 26 , 1986 .
It is knoponent , system or process to meet desired needs , and it is a decision making process .
Design is a human activity , and human may make mistakes .
Therefore , designers may make mistakes in the design process .
Psychology is the scientific investigation of humans' mental process and behavior .
Using psychology to analyze hoponents or systems under development , petence of the users .
Therefore , they give insufficient instructions to the users to equip them petence  .
Obviously , in the case of Chernobyl accident , the operator did not have a well-designed instruction manual and was not adequately trained .
If psychology was used in the design process , it would point out this flaw and advise designers to provide an adequate instruction manual including the operations in emergencies so that operators would know how to operate the reactor when facing emergencies .
In this way , Chernobyl accident may be prevented .
Medvedev  mentions in his book that the RBMK reactor in Chernobyl had a dangerously large positive void coefficient and a defect in the design of the reactor protection and control system .
The designers was aware of the defects of the reactors , however , they did not make efforts to correct them .
Some people argue that these defects caused the Chernobyl accident , psychology cannot solve them .
Technically , psychology could not solve the technical problem for engineers .
But , psychology could point out the potential danger and consequence of the problem so that engineers would search for better options .
If the designers know the severe consequence of the accident , they would try their best to prevent it .
Psychologists could also indicate the flaws in the design process and advise designers to lower the positive void coefficient and enhance the protection and control system in this case .
Thus , the disaster may be prevented .
In conclusion , Chernobyl is a result of flawed design of reactor and inappropriate operation by inadequate operators .
However , the use o f psychology in the design process would be helpful to prevent the Chernobyl disaster .
The errors in the design process and the operation process may be prevented with the help of psychology .
Noe difficulties they face during researches rather than give up half mon goal  .
Thus , the public should look forward to Generation IV reactors' performance rather than oppose it .
Given the advantages mentioned above , I believe that R&D funding should be given to Generation IV reactors .
Even though the fund is limited and by allocating funds for Generation IV reactors , we have to forgo other possible benefits such as spending the same amount of money to solve poverty or terrorism , I support to explore new and advanced technology , Generation IV reactors , to solve environmental and energy problems .
To sum up , the nuclear reactor is a necessary evil .
I feel that the Supercritical water reactor should be further researched and developed and help the whole world in the near future .
People have albustible nuclear-grade graphite , pared to the amount produced by wind so in total , the nuclear energy is a cheap kind of energy .
After all , the energy power concept like VHTR helps prevent the effects of global warming .
It is safe and efficient , so therefore can produce a lot of energy and be able to replace traditional sources of energy .
It is clear governments should fund the VHTR nuclear projects to develop it further , and nuclear energy will definitely be the energy of the future .
Some people think that nuclear reactors are not safe .
Nuclear radiation can cause mutation in human cells , cancer , and other diseases .

In conclusion , Generation IV MSR does provide the energy hungry cities with the amount of electricity needed and it reduces greenhouse effect due to the zero carbon dioxide emission , and lastly it is much safer than the previous Generation plants with the enhanced meltdown technology .
On the other hand , the danger of nuclear radiation , fear of terrorism and the high initial and running cost of a Generation IV nuclear plant , makes us consider if there are any other alternatives .
On the other hand , lead cooled fast reactors  has various safety issues es to building a safe reactor .
There are chances of corrosion of lead ponent materials pared to VHTRs , because the Gen IV's VHTR systems are built on the older generation of high temperature reactors , therefore many of the safety systems pared pared to LFRs due to the greater system performance and system safety it provides .
Hence VHTRs are , to an extent , better than LFRs .
In the last century , most of the energy paring SWCR busting hydrogen is position and capacity for breeding excess fissile material  .
Therefore , I hold the point that GFR is cheaper in an overall viees from the several nuclear accidents in the last few decades , such as the Three Mail Island one in 1979 and the Chernobyl one in 1986 .
So now , people concern most about the security of any kinds of nuclear plants .
Some think that SWCR is safer than GFR because once accident happen , the pressure of SWCR will decrease immediately , and then the plant will shut down automatically .
Actually , it is not true because safety issue is not only about pressure inside .
The major R&D gaps of SWCR include in-core materials development and demonstration of adequate safety and stability  .
I think that GFR is safer than SWCR .
The three reasons are as stated below .
First , the reaction pressure of GFR is much lower than that of SWCR , which obviously will reduce the risk of accident .
Second , the coolant of GFR is helium , a kind of inert gas , very hard to react with other reagent .
Third , the radioactive reaction waste of GFR can be recycled , while SWCR's cannot .
In a conclusion , Gas-cooled Fast Reactor is better than Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor , respectively in the field of efficiency , expend and security .
I believe that GFR is one of the most promising generation IV nuclear reactors , and its large scaled application is just around the corner .
Chernobyl , Ukraine is the location of the most fatal nuclear accident that happened on April 26 , 1986 .
The accident caused many deaths and resulted in severe health impacts due to the radiation exposed by the population  .

Therefore , plicate the VHTR system and additional cost is incurred .

Energy is one of the biggest problems around the pare tplete and pany paring to the other five protocols  .
In addition , the effectiveness of its utilization of nuclear fuel also contributes to its low cost if it is launched into production .
Therefore , SFR benefits more with its lower cost than VHTR .
The devastating damage and long-term , "chronic" consequences of the tpared to other developing kinds of energy like solar energy and paring to other kinds of energy .
Thus , a large amount of money can be saved .
Last of all , more procedures will help decrease the potential danger of nuclear energy .
Nuclear waste can also be recycled and reprocessed .
Thanks to the rapid pace of technology development nowadays , new materials for reactor construction , ways of observing and controlling process , we can be assured that past accident like Chernobyl will never happen again .
On the other hand , without nuclear disasters , no people died due to working inside nuclear power plants .
However , each year , many people all over the world die from respiratory diseases because of the burning of coal , gas , oil , etc .
In conclusion , the advantages of nuclear energy outweigh the disadvantages .
Regulatory systems will create more strict safety measures .
As global energy demands predicted to soar and soar relentlessly , nuclear energy is a prominent resource .
It will not only mitigate the consequences of global warming , but also help lessen the world's thirst of fuel in a long period .
We , human beings have to adapt to a new age of nuclear power , have to fully exploit it rather than being uneasy and in doubt of this controversial type of energy .
With increasing concerns over the impacts of global e . While oil prised of tponents: the investment and generation cost .
Typically , the investment cost of a nuclear poes only petition with the Nazis todevelop the world's first atomic bomb during the War World II .
The technology was later used to generate energy , thus it is inevitable the most countries own both nuclear weapons and plants .
With the introduction of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  , majority of the nations have adhered to it and has since concluded that it is also in their security interest to remain without nuclear weapons .
In summary , nuclear energy will continue to play an important role in meeting the world's energy demand .
However with increasing public opposition to nuclear technology due to the harmful effects of the radiation produced , in recent years more plants shut down than new ones open .
The cause is due to concerns over the cost of nuclear plants and most importantly , the safe operation of nuclear plants and the issue of nuclear proliferation .
The concerns are uncalled for as continual research and development will bring about cheaper and safer operation of nuclear plants .
Measures are also in place to keep nuclear proliferation in check .
As new reactor concepts develops  , it is no surprise that nuclear energy is the "next big thing" .

Today the principal challenges are using green resources and energy to get a radical reduction of CO2 emissions to deal with climate change and to pursue sustainable development .
The MSR can produce nuclear energy with high safety and efficiency .
Even though lots of problems still need to be solved , the benefits are far greater than disadvantages .
So further research on the MSR should be supported .
In recent years , oil has become very important to many people by providing fuels for cars and most importantly , generates electricity .

Fund the development of Generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV Nuclear Reactors
As noted in "Nuclear poprehensive national strength , or the national power , not the nuclear energy , however , they may not see the importance of nuclear energy in improving it .
According to a report made by OPEC , in 2009 , China consumed oil 8 .27 million barrels a day , which is 0 .29 million barrels more per day than 2008 .
And China will rely almost 50% of its whole energy consumption on oil .
The money for oil import is a huge number and that money can do many other infrastructure constructions .
As mentioned before , the material for nuclear energy can produce much more energy per kilogram .
Hence , China will reduce a lot of its oil import if nuclear energy is widely used and accepted by the public .
The generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors will perform very satisfying in this aspect .
If we can support and fund the nuclear energy for future development , it will enhance the speed of economy development .
In conclusion , it will be a good choice to fund the development of generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV nuclear reactors for future energy consumption .
Nuclear energy has three main advantages , its high rate of energy production , and its property of environmental friendly , and also it can enhance a country's economic development .
There are some other advantages for nuclear energy and it will be a good choice if we can fund and support its development .

Should funding be given to the Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor over the other Generation IV reactors ?
There has been much debate on pared to the other chosen reactors , and pared ponents can be recycled .
In addition , the coolant , pared with the other Generation IV reactors .
Research and development has to be done before any of the Generation IV reactors can be implemented  .
In terms of the research needed , the SCWR has the least amount of research needed .
The only areas that require more research are mainly security and safety  , which mainly require new materials that can withstand high temperature and also radiation at the same time .
Materials that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures are also required  .
To date , several suitable materials have been identified .
Materials such as ferritic-martensitic steels and lowswelling austenitic steels for parts exposed to high neutron doses , high-strength austenitic steels and nickel-based alloys parts exposed to low neutron doses were some of the materials indentified .
These materials are currently being tested for their suitability  .
As for security , all reactors have to address the same problem of preventing terrorist attacks and sabotages .
Therefore , without any other major problems , the SCWR is the more logical choice to place more emphasis on .
The SCWR is clearly the reactor to receive more funding , as it requires the least cost and research to be developed .
In addition , the SCWR is one of the two reactors that does not reprocess plutonium waste  .
This further supports the case of more funding for the SCWR .
In conclusion , the SCWR should receive more funding , as it is the most promising concept out of the six chosen concepts .
Generation IV nuclear reactor Very high Temperature Reactor versus Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor
The rapid decrease in the amount of fossil fuels is leading to development of alternative energy sources .
Nuclear popared pletely consume trans-uranium as fuel , /files/folders/1654/download .aspx>
The first nuclear reactor e to a crossroad bustion es steam and drives a turbine pletely , thereby shutting down the whole system .
This is evidenced by the test carried out on one of the VHTR prototype , HTR-10 in 2004 .
The helium coolant was cut off from the system and the reactor was able to shut down automatically without leakage of any radioactive particles  .
The second aspect lies in its economics .
Most people are aware that building a nuclear plant is expensive .
According to a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  on cost of nuclear power , the overnight cost  of building a nuclear plant is US$4000 / kwh  .
A coal-fuelled plant of the same scale only cost US$1300/ kwh .
While its initial cost is high , VHTR makes up for its efficiency and versatility .
Besides electricity , VHTR also produces heat and hydrogen which can be harnessed for other industrial applications .
For example , heat can be used for petrochemical reprocessing while hydrogen can be used as fuel in fuel cell plant to produce even more electricity .
Hence VHTR is actually more profitable to operate as electricity , heat and hydrogen can be obtained altogether .
Besides , the non monetary economics should be considered at the same time .
Traditional coal-fuelled power plants produce 20% of the world's emissions of greenhouse gases  while VHTR does not produce any of such gases .
The environmental damage done , though not measurable in dollars and cents , should also be taken into account as the cost .
In this context , VHTR is much cheaper than coal-fuelled plants .
To conclude , VHTR is not only safe , but it is also more efficient than existing reactors .
With further research , it is possible that the cost of VHTR can be lowered further and will appeal as a better alternative to existing nuclear systems .
Nuclear energy e a viable energy source in the future .
The safety measures can be improved and the hazardous by-products can be reduced petitiveness .

In addition , although human errors were also accounted for the nuclear explosion , they were not totally unpreventable .
Behind every mistake , there is a psychology leading to the mistake , and there is another psychology which could have been used to correct it .
To sum up , if psychology was applied in the design engineering stage , feedback loops would function to minimize human errors in the process .
Psychology can reduce misunderstanding between designers and processors , helping information better channeled and decreasing the probability of misunderstanding problems .
Psychologists can see through the problems in a different aspect and contribute to the solution by an integrated approach  .
In conclusion , psychology approach could prevent engineering accident , regardless of different possible mistakes which may occur in the process .
The es some controversies that the VHTR requires very complicated technologies and very high cost construction compared to the Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor .
Though many people criticize the VHTR for its great cost and immature technology , the VHTR should be popularized and the essay es out of the reactor , it still causes little effects on the environment .
We control the speed of the atoms to slopany in South Africa even has efficiency of 47% .
The heat efficiency of sodium cooled reactor is only 20% .

Also , what people worry about , like security , is actually not that bad .
Therefore , further research and development funding for nuclear reactors is necessary for our society since it is a good way to solve the energy offering problem .

Assessing Gas-cooled Fast Reactors for Generation IV Services To meet the energy demand in the 21st century , a nebined systems of both active cooling and passive cooling is applied: active systems are used to remove the decays of heat at high popetitiveness of GFR in the energy market of most industries .
To summarize , GRF can be a favorable energy supply because it can achieve wider range of industry application with minimized radioactive waste .
Moreover , it better ensures the safety during operation so that accident risk is lowered .
Hence , to make such energy supply possible in the future , the development of GFR system should be funded .
In conclusion , it should be evident that the arguments against using nuclear power are not valid .
In contrast , nuclear power can replace traditional energy resources very well .
Moreover , it can help to protect environment and is much safer than using traditional energy resources .
Hence , in my opinion , using large amount of nuclear power as an energy resource can bring human benefits .

Nopared e the difficulties on cost , safety and environment .
So , it is high time to carry out this grand engineering project .
Hope we can benefit a lot from the VHTR .
Dealing pared to the previous generation nuclear popared to those current normal water coolants being used  .
Then , another opposed argument being raised states that building of nuclear power plants will make the country more vulnerable to terrorist attack as plutonium is a key ingredient to nuclear weapon  .
Also , destruction of nuclear plant will emit radioactive substances which will be detrimental the public of the country and its neighbouring countries  .
However , research studies  shows that VHTR do not undergo waste recycling for which the waste being produced will go directly to repository and this lead to the possibility of obtaining of plutonium ingredients to make nuclear weapons to be low and in turn , increased the security of the nation .
In the point of view between opposition and the experts and supporters , the new generation nuclear reactors proved to be more effective in terms of cost , performance and its security .
With the doubts being raised by public opposition , supporters and experts believed that the nuclear hydrogen production by VHTR has the potential to meet the future's needs with the nuclear energy .
Hence , it was reiterated that VHTR , one of the generation IV reactor concepts could be supported for further research and development funding .

The consumption of electricity in the prising of health matters and the efficiency of the concept could arise before it can reach the final stage .
Hence , developing countries should first focus on dealing

Engineering psychology is defined as the analysis of homunication equipment and procedures .
Skeptics claim that the region usually sees femodate larger planes to be built .
On the contrary , the construction of the Tenerife south airport in 1978 suggests that more people , rather than less , modate larger planes such as the Boeing 747 , even municating pilation of the radio convention .
During the accident , the munication phraseology indirectly caused the accident to happen .
The use of psychology in the design process could have helped the designer to consider these issues more thoroughly and perhaps influencing his decision .
The result of any of these minor changes could perhaps have prevented the accident from ever occurring .

He calls this 'interaction of factors' the consequent of the lack in consideration of psychology during the design process .

We assert that if these factors e could have been reversed .
We es a catastrophe .
Psychologist James Reason's Smitment  , one of Bernhard's major areas of psychological consideration .
Nopliments the design of the reactor itself , imparted by the designers  to the operators , panying operating instructions .
Such monitoring and evaluation of implementations mitment , as seen from the failure to consider safety models , that had brought about the accident at TMI .
Systems are designed by humans , and for humans .
Hence , design considerations have to be constantly tied into the man-machine interface to ensure that both man and machine are at ease during operation and contingent when problems arise .
Such a list is not exhaustive , and much more detailed considerations could be introduced .
