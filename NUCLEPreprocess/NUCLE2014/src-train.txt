Topic 1: "The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
The competitive world has caused technologies to improve rapidly in the 21st century .
One of the advancement in technology would be surveillance technology .
The concerns for safety and security have increased the number of use of the surveillance systems .
Despite the proper usage of surveillance technology , there is a widespread abuse of the technology by some criminal organization .
Hence , the potential for abuse increases .
Surveillance technology has been used as a tool for illegitimate activities which in turn threatens publics' safety and security .
This issue has become a main topic in public discussion .
Thus , due to the risk of misuse of surveillance technology , I fully concur that the use of surveillance technology should be banned .
First and foremost , surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification  has been used as a tool for hackers and identity thieves to commit " 'contactless' "crime against victims without their consent  .
RFID chip is largely used in some official identification documents such as driver's license and passport in America .
Once the RFID number is intercepted , it is possible for the criminals to track the movements of their targets without their knowledge .
Additionally , it has been concluded that the use of RFID has no benefit on the achievement or national security , but it resulted in an increment in risk of personal privacy and security  .
Hence , the use of RFID should be disregarded .
Secondly , online behavioral tracking is another main issue of how surveillance technology has been misused .
It tracks users' online activities and collects their electronic information and makes the information available to parties other than their initial correspondents without their consent  .
Hence , the consumers' privacy is invaded .
The online behavioral tracking can also be used to target vulnerable consumers for deceitful advertisement .
Thus , the security of the consumers is at high risk .
Thirdly , the improper use of this surveillance technology will bring about the consequence of privacy invasion .
Different people define privacy differently .
An anonymous author once defines privacy as " 'the claim of individuals , groups , or institutions to determine for themselves how , when and to what extent information about them is communicated to others' "  . , 1999) .
Hence , everyone has the right to protect their privacy .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it has been misused by people for illegal activities .
The misuse of surveillance technology not only invades user's privacy but also increases the risk of personal and national security .
There are many types of genetic testing , such as late-onset disorders and newborn screening .
Genetic testing allows early detection of diseases which may be useful to mankind .
However , genetic testing has brought about issues if such genetic results are revealed and abused .
Thus , I agree that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Next , a further difficulty issue involves revealing of genetic results to insurance companies .
.
Applicants will be at a disadvantage when applying for insurance .
For example , if genetic results are revealed , the cost of the insurance will be expensive such that it may not be worth it .
Critics of this position claim that insurer will also be at a disadvantage if such results are not revealed to them .
.
I must admit that the insurer will be at a disadvantage if the situation is switched .
However , the cost of insurance should be on the current medical status of the applicant and should not be on the results of the genetic testing .
In conclusion , I believe that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing as it will affect both the relationship between employees and employer and issues involving insurance .
Companies do have the right to know the genetic testing results of an individual who are applying for the job offer by them .
For companies that offer jobs that require physical strength , it will be necessary to obtain the genetic testing of the individual .
For example , if one contain inherited genetic disease like muscle dystrophy , it will be dangerous for them to work in the construction site .
Accident might occur and it may also result in death .
Although many has debated that this is discrimination as companies may not employ those who has inherited disease , but companies do have the right to choose employer with concern to their profits and the safety of others .
Individual that may inherit genetically disease should choose job that are beyond their reach .
Hence companies instead of the individuals have the right to know the genetic testing of the individual .
Spouse of a couple do have the right to know the family disease of their partner .
If a couple is planning to have a child , it is best for them to go through genetic counseling if the parents are carrier of genetic disease  .
It will be unfair if the spouse kept the truth from their spouse .
The spouse does have the right to know whether the child will suffer from the genetic diseases .
This is a basic respect towards your partner in a marriage .
It is a must to say it out and thus individual do not have the final say in revealing of their genetic results to the third parties
Education sector do have the right to know the genetic testing of their student .
Those with genetic diseases like mental retardation and Down syndrome are asked to be enrolled in school like MINDS and bright sparks .
Some may debate that this is a form of discrimination and violate the human rights of these children .
However , according to the American Association for mental retardation AAMR  , revealing of genetic testing results is not a form of discrimination but it is to be fair to those children with these genetic diseases as the child will be enrolled into the school that provide a better environment for them to study in .
It is a must to provide the school with the genetic testing result .
Hence individual do not have the final say in revealing of their genetic results to the public .
All in all , in my own opinion , in the high technology society we are living in , we do not have the final say in revealing of our genetic results to the public .
It may not be disadvantage and can even benefits a lot of people based on the point mentioned above .
Thus individual requesting for genetic testing do not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of these testing .
Use of Surveillance Technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
With rapid technological advancement , myriad forms of surveillance technology have surfaced and people are using it both intensively and extensively .
From forms as high level as satellite surveillance to the common Radio Frequency Identification Device  , surveillance technology has served us well .
However , due to the improper exploit of it , surveillance technology has become more of detrimental than beneficial .
Intrusion of privacy and upsetting the various balances in society are concerns people are increasingly worried about .
Hence , with so much discomfort people are experiencing with surveillance technology , it should be banned .
Due to the immense usage of surveillance technology , the society has become relatively transparent .
On the intangible aspects , information of individuals can be easily retrieved with the ease of data mining  .
With high speed connections and data transfer rate nowadays , an enormous bulk of data can be moved around in a very short period .
Classified information like credit card , banking and medical records can get into the wrong hands , producing many repercussions .
Identity theft is fragrant and many more will suffer from financial losses .
Then , as RFID technology becomes increasingly popular with the retailers , privacy of consumers is again compromised .
The tags are usually not "killed" and this allows consumers' movement to be tracked and habits to be observed .
This thorough understanding of consumers has certainly gone overboard .
Last but not least , biometric surveillance has given checkpoints the capability to monitor people down to the skin .
Evolved surveillance here is so revealing that people appear literally naked on screens .
Furthermore , surveillance technology has created many deviants and upsets in the balance of our society .
Society will see the rise of discriminations since the entire background of an individual can be easily traced .
Dates cancelled , different standards in pricing of insurance premiums and harassment of political dissidents are just a few to mention .
Next , surveillance technology also widens the gap between the rich and the poor .
The rich can afford to encrypt and protect their data while engaging in better surveillance over the less well off .
Moreover , by selling information  , the rich will get richer .
With regards to RFID , usage mention earlier on will reduce the variety of products available in stores because retailers will only consider the better selling items .
Society will witness a smorgasbord of changes in the various balances and the birth of more deviants such as stalkers .
Therefore , with all the worrisome disadvantages of surveillance technology will bring , we ought to ban it .
It makes privacy lose its meaning and is unhealthy to our society .
Consequences will be disastrous if we do not put an end to it .
With the revelation of human's DNA structure by Watson and Crick during 1953 , it shows that there will be a totally new science and engineering related subject being brought to the world , which is genetic engineering .
By utilizing the sophisticated technology tools , together with the perseverance of researchers , many genetic related approaches have been made possible .
One of the noted breakthrough is genetic testing .
However , the advent of genetic testing does not bring unanimous consents from the public .
There are uproars regarding the moral and ethical issues which overwhelm the topic of genetic testing from time to time .
Some think that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revelation of the results .
In fact , individuals requesting genetic testing should not have the final say as they would possibly make wrong decisions .
First of all , if the individuals get diagnosed with hereditary genetic disease , they will probably be overwhelmed by guilt or anxiety , thereby making a wrong decision , which is nondisclosure of their results within families .
It is primarily caused by the desire of protecting family members from troubling information .
Conversely , siblings of the subjects should be told immediately as they may carry the same genetic disease as the subjects' .
Some diseases are treatable in the presymptomatic stage .
Therefore , the siblings must know it so that treatment could be done as soon as possible .
General practitioner , who is the one consulting them and also experienced in handling this kind of case , definitely has the final say to make a more rational decision for them .
After that , parents who request genetic testing for their children must provide the genetic information of their child to school authorities for the enrollment .
This aims to divide the group of children according to their learning skill and to ensure that every single child is provided with the most appropriate education .
Individuals requesting genetic testing usually decide not to disseminate their genetic information as discrimination may be put forth to their lives .
In fact , there is one of the federal legislation that has been applied to genetics nondiscrimination which is Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008  .
Besides forbidding the employers making adverse employment decisions , GINA also prohibits insurance companies reducing their coverage and pricing on the basis of information derived from genetic tests .
Thus , there is no fear of revealing the genetic results .
Inversely , individuals are responsible to inform employers about their genetic conditions so that a better and safer working environment could be provided .
Finally , it has been said that individuals should have the final say on not disclosing their genetic information for research purposes .
Indeed , research team should have a direct access to the genetic results so that the further genetic sequence on DNA could be unmasked in a faster pace .
As a result , individuals must provide their genetic information .
Ultimately , individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in revelation of their results .
This is because individual oneself is less capable of making a suitable decision .
It may end up with not only affecting one's life , but also influencing a few generations .
Hence , by having a must to reveal the genetic results , rational decisions will often be made in benefiting the individual as a group discussion always comes up with fruitful conclusion .
The rapid development of medical technology has made it possible to diagnose disease inheritance or determine genetic disorders by using genetic testing .
Unfortunately , there is pro and con among the public about the disclosure of the result of genetic testing , whether it should be revealed or not .
Then , who will be the one who holds the right to do it ?
On one side , some people think that the individual who requests it has the final say for the revelation .
On the other hand , others reason that the genetic inheritance is something that is quite crucial , thus it should be discussed with the family first before reaching the final decision  .Therefore , the final say does not only depend on one person but also his relatives .
In conclusion , the result of genetic testing that informs us about our hereditary disease , will not only affect us as individual but also our family .
Therefore , the final say should not be in individual but the whole family .
Genetic testing has become a common practice in the modern society .
Its general purpose is to check if one has potential to develop certain genetic diseases .
This has however , brought about many debates on some ethical issues in the society .
Some argued that individuals who request the genetic testing should have the final say about revealing their test result so as to preserve individual's rights .
However , by doing so will have a great negative impact on the society .
Thus , they should not have the final say .
Making revealing genetic testing compulsory by employers can benefit the workers .
Some may say that it is a kind of discrimination against employees who have certain genetic traits .
However , one must be reminded that there are many occupations that required the employees to work in a hazardous environment today and their welfare can be assured by revealing their genetic results .
For example , people with the thalassemia gene will be in health risk if exposed to lead  .
By revealing genetic test result to companies , employers can determine if the job applicant is suitable for the job and assign them to environment that will not have any exposure to lead .
This benefits both the employees and the companies .
On the other hand , it will be disastrous if a soldier who has genetic traits of Dissociative identity disorder  were to be deployed in the field .
Furthermore , the incident of crash of FedEx plane Florida , USA due to colour-blind of the pilot , can be prevented if he were to undergo genetic testing and reveal to the company beforehand .
Thus , the individuals should not have the final say about revealing their genetic test results .
Giving insurance companies the final say about revealing genetic test results can be proved to be beneficial than one might think .
Many will think that insurance companies used the test results as the excuse to deny them from claiming or even buying certain medical policies .
These are just myths as even proponents of federal legislation that would outlaw the acts .
However , insurance companies have the rights to judge if the declarations of the clients are truthful by comparing it with the test results .
This is to prevent abuse of policies .
Moreover , many insurance companies used the test result to encourage the clients to buy certain policies that can maximize their benefits .
Clients should not have the final say if they want to enjoy the coverage of the insurance policies .
In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say about revealing their genetic test results since it will be more beneficial to the society .
By revealing the results will benefit the collective instead .
After September 11 , 2001 , surveillance became important as it become one of the tools to prevent terrorism .
This then bought about the debates on whether surveillance technology should be banned or not as it indeed provides security , but it also invades our privacy and disturbs the society .
In my view , surveillance technology should be banned as the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantage .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it invade our privacy and disturb the society which outweighs the ability to provide security , which might not be necessary true .
The past two decades brought about huge technological advances in the areas of nano-engineering and information systems .
With the help modern technology , humans are able to create increasingly efficient devices which are able to store relevant personal information or to trace one's location .
The use of sophisticated personnel tracking devices has long been an ethical quagmire , as people with extremely polarizing views debate if such surveillance technology can be used or allowed to track people .
Proponents for the use of tracking devices on humans assert that patients can be easily identified in cases of emergency with their medical profiles easily accessible , since information is stored in a database that can be accessed via the internet  .
Administrative procedures are greatly reduced , and the patient's vital records , for example drug allergies are readily retrievable .
Patients will be able to receive immediate and proper medical attention , which in certain cases can be a matter of life and death .
Moreover , tracking devices are able to assist law enforcement personnel to monitor suspects closely  .
Unknowing crime suspects can be monitored closely by the police over a period of time .
This allows discovery of new evidences through observation of the suspects , to prove if one is innocent or guilty .
Some arguments brought forward by opponents states that tagged identities could be easily duplicated by identity thefts  .
This argument is flawed , as there is no concrete evidence showing existence of such crimes .
The argument also blatantly ignored the fact that there are additional measures being taken into preventing such crimes .
Opponents also claim that government will be able to use such devices to monitor , instil fear , and ultimately control the users  .
This assertion is a fallacy , as it is based solely on foresight , and is cynical and biased .
In conclusion , tracking devices should be allowed in tracking people , as it is able to change human lives for the better , and even prevent or reduce crime rates .
Should the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people be banned ?
Nowadays , advances in technology have made tracking people no longer an uphill task .
Due to this , many surveillance technologies have been created in order to make the tracking job efficient .
A controversy between the benefits of the surveillance technology and the impacts of the surveillance technology has aroused .
In fact , the use of it has brought along significant benefits and therefore it should not be banned .
There are two main benefits that the use of surveillance technology has brought to .
Firstly , it helps to tag "high-risk" patients  .
A microchip is implanted into the arm of patients who had heart diseases , diabetics or Alzheimer's disease .
For the Alzheimer's patients , it helps to track them in order to ensure their safety .
By using this technology , the location of the patient can be easily detect by a reader and immediate action can be taken if the patient is in risk .
This system really benefits the Alzheimer's patient who often lost due to their degrading memories .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
It benefits not only an individual but the whole world .
Surveillance technology is being widely applied in the post-9/11 world .
Above all , the use of sophisticated surveillance technology , such as RFID and GPS by the law enforcement agencies to track people has raised many eyebrows and faced criticism .
However , human tracking technology is essential in preventing terrorism and reducing crime rate , subsequently ensuring the safety of lawful citizens .
Therefore , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
There are two major advantages of using surveillance technology to track people .
Law enforcement agencies are able to identify terrorists and put a stop to their plan .
Recent happenings show that a number of terrorist plots are ceased thanks to surveillance technology  .
It consequently helps preventing major catastrophes which involve loss of human lives  .
Other than that , the technology also helps in reducing crime rates all around the world .
It is especially useful in stamping out "transnational crimes such as drug and people trafficking , money laundering , and the smuggling of things"  .
Besides that , surveillance technology also enables tracking of criminals who are on run or even kidnappers .
Once being tagged , the lawbreakers' positions can be monitored and crimes can be solved within a short period of time .
Critics argue that such surveillance technology is able to track an individual 24/7 , thus there is a compromise of one's privacy  .
Similarly , the United States has been criticized for promoting the use of human tracking technologies after the 9/11 event  , as it indicates the beginning of an Orwellian era as claimed by many privacy advocates  .
However , the unfounded argument is not adequate to outlaw the use of human tracking technology .
Jacques Ellul noted that "To be sure of apprehending criminals , it is necessary that everyone be supervised"  .
Safety of mankind is not worth being sacrificed just for the sake of their privacy .
A balance should be reached between the two extremes - the banning of human tracking technology and privacy being stripped away from innocent citizens .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing"
Genetic testing is designed specifically to detect differences in deoxyribonucleic acid  segments .
The history of genetic testing dates back to half a century ago where diseases such as PKU  , an "inborn error of metabolism" in which mental retardation is caused by an amino acid buildup in the blood , was tested on newborns  .
While genetic testing presents healthcare benefits , it could bring possible harms if misused .
Therefore , the decision to reveal the results of a genetic test should remain in the hands of the patient .
Easy access by third parties such as insurance companies or healthcare professionals to an individual's genetic information may cause invasion of privacy and discrimination .
Although medical personnel are entrusted with the ethics of genetic testing , commercialization and easy access to certain genetic testing may lead to compromising situations for members of the public  .
For instance , genetic information that falls into the hands of insurers and employers without consent will be used to prejudice against the tested individual .
Society might treat the person differently or even deny basic rights to equal job opportunities , income , education , mental well-being , housing status , health , and medical treatment .
Racial discrimination still exists today in various parts of the world despite government efforts to eradicate it .
Who can say what will happen if a patient's genetic information falls into the wrong hands ?
In conclusion , the patient of genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Until proper steps such as enactment and reinforcement of laws are taken by the governments , genetic information of individuals should be kept private and confidential to avoid exploitation by unscrupulous parties and also to avoid disintegration of family relations .
The release of genetic information of a patient has wide and lifelong implications on his or her life , and therefore this vital decision should be made after careful thought .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing"
Genetic testing include special techniques to examine the information carried by DNA which held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes .
DNA is taken from a person's blood , body fluids or tissues .
By analysing an individual's specific genes , some diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia may be detected .
An individual can prevent some diseases or get the solution after get the results of genetic testing .
However , if the result of the test can be easily access by third party , a lot of problems will be occurred .
Therefore , the patient should have the right to decide whether to reveal the result of genetic tests .
This issue will strongly affect the relationship between employees and their employer organizations .
Generally , all of these genetic results will be revealed to the employer and if the employer knows some of the employees that are prone to certain diseases , it is likely that the employee will be fired .
As it is people with disabilities are often discriminated against .
These people have to look for other alternative to earn a living .
Once the results are revealed , employees will have difficulties finding other jobs .
Hence , results should not be revealed to protect employees from environment that might harm them .
Another difficulty involves disclosure of genetic information to insurance companies .
Applicants for insurance will be under increased pressure to undergo genetic tests and those prone to diseases are less likely to be eligible to buy insurance .
In conclusion , genetic testing results are a matter that should be kept private for the benefits of the patient and should only be released on an absolute need to know basis .
Genetics plays the role in every disease .
Genetic testing informs individuals and family of their genetic status; this knowledge may enable them to take adaptive measures against a genetic disease  , if disease is treatable .
However , as technology advances , exploitation of genetic testing increases resulting in the breach of human rights to privacy .
Removing individual's control over the results will in turn lead to freely accessible genetic information , causing social issues and family dilemma .
Firstly , every human's gene is unique and personal .
Sharing of personal genetic result is akin to being exposed .
It is undeniable that one is morally obligated to inform the relatives of the genetic test results .
However , one has the rights to confidentiality and to decide what information to reveal and how to disclose it .
Moreover , relatives , being the recipients of the bad news should have their choice whether to remain ignorant or not .
Therefore , one has the rights to their genetic privacy .
Secondly , being able to access one's genetic information will reveal the list of diseases one is susceptible to , and the one who possesses the information may have ulterior interest .
This can in turn cause social issues like genetic discrimination in the terms of employment and insurance  .
For example , potential employers may want their interviewees screened to carry the ideal genes for the job; insurance companies may deny or increase their premium for carriers of certain genetic disorder  .
Thirdly , family members generally inherit the same set of genetic codes from their parents , and may be susceptible to similar diseases  .
However , one would not be able to judge their preparedness for such information .
It may not only cause unnecessary distress and anxiety to relatives , but will also unravel family secrets; namely adoptions and parentage  .
Thus , it is still up to the discretion of individual to go for genetic testing if they are at high risk .
Therefore , individuals whom requested for genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
"The individuals requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Genetic testing has made it possible to identify individuals who are at risk of having a disease , and to test the probability of passing on a disease to their offspring .
There is an ongoing debate in whether these individuals should have the final say in whether or not to reveal the results .
Since these results will affect not only the individual , but also his family , offspring , the future generations and even the society .
Thus , individuals should not have the final say in the disclosure of genetic testing results .
Secondly , individuals can receive better family support and further harm can be prevented .
If individuals do not have the final say , their family members will know their condition , and they can be more sensitive to the individual's feelings , giving them better support and encouragement .
Also , people diagnosed with chronic diseases are more prone to getting depression  .
Bottling up emotions will worsen the condition , and in severe cases , will lead to suicide  .
This will do more harm than good to the individuals .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
In modern times , there is an increase in the types of threat that can affect a nation's security .
People need to collect intelligence about the situation before it can act against it; this has led to the increasing employment of surveillance technology .
The use of surveillance technology has raised concerns over the intrusion of personal privacy  .
However , since surveillance technology can help to identify problems , a solution or preventive measure can be formulated to prevent these problems from occurring , leading to the protection of people's health and the country's socio-economic stability .
Hence , such use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
Firstly , the use of biometric surveillance in the form of a biometric passport will make it more difficult for terrorists to travel in and out of countries , due to increasing passport security and border surveillance .
Furthermore , this information which is kept in a central repository can easily be updated and shared among other government agencies by wireless internet , making biometric surveillance timely and accurate  .
This method is highly efficient compared to traditional passport controls and surveillance methods .
Consequently , not being able to track terrorist movements could allow terrorists to enter a country and possibly carry out a terrorist attack; it also makes it easier for them to escape .
Another advantage of using surveillance technology is during disease outbreaks such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  outbreak in 2002 .
An electronic card embedded with a Radio Frequency Identification  chip was used to monitor the movements of patients , healthcare workers , and visitors within a hospital  .
This system resulted in an increased efficiency of the contact tracing process and quarantine procedures when a patient was confirmed with SARS .
Contact tracing and quarantine procedures would normally take two days with the previous method; it was also more taxing on manpower .
.
Thus , if the previous method was used , more people would be at risk of contracting the virus as it would take more time to identify and quarantine an infected person .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned as it could result in a compromise of the nation's security and could pose a danger to people and their health as well as the country's socio-economic stability .
A better solution would be the introduction of a privacy act .
Over the years , there has been an increase in the use of surveillance technology .
This has brought about a wild debate on the banning of the use of surveillance technology to track person .
While most propositions agree to ban the use of surveillance technology , they have in fact overlooked the actual and potential benefits of the surveillance technology .
These benefits include disease surveillance and private surveillance on family members .
Thus , the use of surveillance technology should not be completely banned .
Surveillance technology can be used to control the outspread of acute diseases .
Firstly , the use of electronic cards allows hospitals to track the time and movement of people within the hospital .
This has helped to accelerate the tracing of contacts and implementation of quarantine procedures .
.
Next , those who were under home quarantined during the SARS period were instructed to install a camera in their isolation zone to make sure they are always visible and contactable to prevent further spread of the disease .
Also , the use of infrared fever sensing system in Changi airport and along borders allows mass surveillance of body temperature , which can detect and isolate feverish passengers .
.
The SARS outbreak in 2002 clearly demonstrated how the surveillance of patients , suspects , healthcare workers , and the general public led to the eventual containment of the outbreak and prevented it from escalating into a pandemic .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned as it can help to control the spread of diseases and also protect our family from harm .
Furthermore , the banning of this technology may cause more harm to society .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
In conclusion , individuals should have the privacy to determine whether to reveal their genetic results or not since it not only inflicts emotional distress on their family but also subjects them social discrimination .
Advancement and breakthrough in technology has now made tracking individuals using surveillance technology a reality today .
This has sparked many controversial debates on ethical and moral issues on using such technology .
Some have highlighted that usage of such technology infringes on individuals' personal privacy .
On the other hand , surveillance technology can also protect the well-being of people .
Since the advantages of surveillance technology far outweigh the disadvantages , it should not be banned .
There are many factors that support the use of surveillance technology to track individuals .
Firstly , surveillance technology such as biometrics , aids national security in areas like terrorism  .
Surveillance of terrorist focus on countering terrorist threats and allows the government body to intervene before a catastrophe takes place .
If not controlled appropriately , it may lead to chaos and instability of the state .
Arguments presented for the ban on the use of surveillance technology to track individuals are totally flawed .
For instance , the existence of surveillance technology in the virtual world helps to curb crimes against copyrights , piracy and bank frauds .
Copyright protection such as the TurnItIn Online Programme , is designed to detect unreferenced copying or plagiarism in individual's work .
In addition , illegal file distribution , sale and download are acts that tantamount to promoting piracy .
Individuals can be sued by the relevant distribution companies and authorities .
Moreover , surveillance technology helps protect against bank frauds and illegal activities , such as hacking into personal Internet banking accounts .
DBS Bank has in place security surveillance systems that regularly "monitor and detect any potential form of illegitimate activities"  .
In conclusion , the use of advanced technology to track people should not be banned , as it promotes and enhances the protection of people in many aspects , hence , contributing to a better society .
As the genetic testing is making rapid progress on providing information on the hidden DNAs which might cause diseases , the techniques have also aroused a large amount of heated debates on the ethical and moral issues surrounding the control of final say of the testing .
In terms of individual rights of privacy and long-term social influence , the one requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Secondly , social problems such as genetic discrimination tend to be implemented .
For instance , the insurance companies can require the testing result before signing for a contact with a client who may have potential carriers of diseases .
Despite taking the risks of catching a disease , the client should as well own the right to buy the insurance .
Nevertheless , insurance companies judge clients on the testing result and either refuse the healthcare coverage or even transfer this suspect diagnosis to the next generation"  .
This kind of problem will be wide-spreading .
Thus the individual should have the right to decide whether to reveal the result or not , considering his own benefits .
To conclude , the one who request genetic testing should have the final right to determine whether this result should be made public or not .
Surveillance technology was first introduced in the seventies where video tape surveillance became the global norm to watch human behaviours in a small area .
Over the years , advances in science and technology had empowered surveillance technology by introducing many forms and magnifying the scope of surveillance .
This has brought about many controversies on the ethical , health and social issues surrounding the notion of mass surveillance .
While supporters argue that surveillance technology brings benefits to the human race , the harms it causes when it is excessively misused outweigh the benefits .
Thus , due to the implications of surveillance technology , it should be banned .
Secondly , surveillance technology does not necessarily reduce the rate of terrorism .
September 11th would force world leaders to rethink their policies and implement all forms of surveillance .
Supporters suggest that surveillance technology provides a sense of security and helps to detect potential terrorist acts early by criminal profiling .
However , the truth is that surveillance technology does not prevent terrorism from occurring at all .
Surveillance technology also has loopholes and it is like a double- edged sword as anyone can use them for their own intentions which mean that terrorists might also use surveillance technology to observe their next "victim" .
Hence , it should be banned as it is redundant and a waste of resource .
Lastly , surveillance technology , such as RFID , might cause health problems in human implants .
Research shows that that implanted RFID tags are associated with tumors in rodents , mostly sarcomas  .
This result is alarming as it suggests of the possibility of a similar effect in humans  .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as the implications are menacing .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Surveillance technology such as RFID  should not be used to track people  .
Do you agree ?
Support your argument with concrete examples .
Surveillance technology has advanced rapidly over the years and is commonly seen in many places , from leisure places to workplaces and even to our lifts and homes .
This monitoring of other people's behaviour , activities , or information has brought about many debates on ethical issue , security issues as well as individual's health issue .
Though some suggest that surveillance technology benefits us but the negative implications outweigh the benefits .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned .
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology has dehumanized and violated our most basic right which is privacy .
This is because surveillance technology such as closed-circuit television  allows other to watch and track our daily activities .
We have lost our rights in leading a personal life and have to live in a constant fear that our every movement is being monitored .
Furthermore , unethical companies could easily obtain our personal information through social network and use it to manipulate us .
When we lose our privacy , we become vulnerable psychologically and easily manipulated by others .
Therefore , it is ethically wrong to invade other people's privacy and there is a need to ban surveillance technology to protect our own rights .
Secondly , surveillance technology has failed to protect us .
Many countries use surveillance technology to prevent terrorism attacks but terrorists also use surveillance technology to plan their attacks .
Terrorists are able to track down the security system in other countries using computer monitoring and then launch their attacks successfully .
As a result , surveillance technology provides minimal prevention or protection for us .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned as it poses threat to us and is ineffective in protecting us .
Lastly , surveillance technology such as implantable radiofrequency identification technology  brings about potential health hazards .
Today , the use of RFID offers important health benefits such as convenient access to patient's contact information and medical history .
However , it has also been testified that RFID brings about other health complications such as infections , especially in elderly and weak individuals .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be banned as it may do more harms than benefits .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it not only ethically wrong but also poses threat to our security and health instead of protecting us .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Surveillance technology has advanced rapidly , and it has dominated our lives .
This has brought about many debates on the ethical , security and health issues surrounding the use of surveillance technology .
While some suggest that the use of this technology brings benefits to both country and the world , it in fact not only affects the country's safety but also the citizens' privacy in the country .
Thus , due to negative implications that outweigh the benefits of using surveillance technology , it should be banned .
There are three factors that arise from the use of surveillance technology .
Firstly , surveillance technology dehumanize citizens' basic right to privacy .
Under this technology , citizens are being watched .
This resulted in the loss of personal space and constantly live in fear as they tend to be very cautious in their every movements .
An article said that in US , "there is evidence that President Bush's executive order authorizing eavesdropping on phone conversations of U .S . citizens , monitoring email and gaining access to private computers while failing to follow the law requiring court- ordered warrants may amount to criminal activity ."
.
US citizens involves in the process have to be very careful with their daily lifestyle .
Another example of an article , in Britain , there are 4 .2 million CCTV cameras on the streets , about one for every 14 citizens .
.
This is ethically wrong as , in general , humans has their basic right to privacy .
Too much intruding of privacy could also lead to the psychological factors of one's mental status .
Hence , surveillance technology should be banned because it is ethically wrong to invade other people's privacy and it is an obligation to respect other people's privacy .
Finally , critics have argued that by implanting a biochip  into a dementia people , it ease the hospital authority to locate their patients' whereabouts .
However , there is often a health issue that involves in this implantation which causes complications to patients' health . .
In late 2007 , an anti-chip activist has raised that for more than one decade it has been known that implanted RFID tags are associated with tumors in rodents , mostly sarcomas  .
This causes a controversy about possible carcinogenic effects; a substance or agent that tends to produce cancer  , that may occur in the implantation of chips on humans .
Thus , this affect patient by adding a new disease to them when they are already ill .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology should be banned as it brings negative implications not only to the citizens but also the world and thus poses a high risk of insecurity to the world .
Wellbeing of a child has been a major consideration and concern for most parents .
One of the advantages of advance surveillance technology is that it allows parents to keep track of their children regardless of where they are , and to have some ideas of what is happening in their children's lives .
Critics have argued that by this , children have lost all form of privacy and that they are under the control of their parents .
Arguments for the surveillance technology agree that although it invades the children privacy , if the child does not do anything that causes their parents to be worried about , invasion of privacy should not be a major issue .
Recently SingTel mobile launched a mobile plan called the "Permission-based location device" where it addresses the issue of invasion of privacy and at the same time gives parents and guardians a peace of mind by allowing them to know the exact location of their loved ones to have an idea of what is happening in their lives .
As shown , surveillance technology and it uses' benefits can outweigh the cons that it can bring .
To conclude , surveillance technology should not be banned as they have more positive advantages compared to its downside .
The main critic of using surveillance technology is the invasion of privacy , this is unavoidable as to safe guard a place , people or nation there are some sacrifices that need to be made .
As seen in the argument the three different areas namely national , disaster and personal security , surveillance technology should not be banned but rather to always to be improvised and improved upon .
Motion: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Over the years , genetic testing has become more available to the public .
An individual can request and afford to undergo genetic testing to find out whether or not his body houses a defective gene .
When the results of the test is given to the individual , the question of whether the results should be revealed or not arises .
Although the individual may feel that he should have the final say on the revelation of the results , in fact , having the physicians decide whether the results should be revealed would be much more beneficial to the society and the individual himself .
Therefore , the individual should not have the final say on whether the results of such testing should be revealed .
Secondly , for his own reasons , such as family disputes , the individual may choose not to act responsibly and withhold the results from family members .
In such cases , the physician would have the right to reveal the results to the family of the individual , especially if the test results indicate that the defective gene is present , there is the possibility that others in the family has the gene as well .
Also , with regards to the problem of discrimination , which is the underlying factor for the individual not wanting to reveal the results , there are laws in place in many countries that states that it is against the law to discriminate against people who have tested positive for a particular defective gene .
The physicians also have their medical code of conduct that states information about the patient is confidential unless it poses threat to others  .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say as to whether the results should be revealed or not as the benefits of revealing the results is substantial to the individual and his family , and it cannot be assumed that the individual will be able to act responsibly to his family in the face of his own interests .
Genetic testing has made possible the determination of genetic diseases .
However , the release of genetic testing results has brought about a controversy .
Due to family members having similarities in genetic background , individuals may feel the need to disclose their results .
However , being likely to face discrimination from society , individuals should also have the choice to conceal the information from others .
This freedom of choice provides respect for their basic human rights .
Thus , individual consent should be obtained before the release of genetic testing results .
It may be argued that the legalization of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act  may solve the problem of discrimination  .
However , limitations in this policy may still subject individuals to discrimination due to the exclusion of those applying for life insurance , disability insurance or military benefits  .
Thus , the ability of GINA to solve the problem of discrimination may be limited .
The failure to gain an individual's approval to release the results denies him of his basic human rights , which is "the right to determine for oneself how and to what extent information about oneself is communicated to others ."
By releasing the results without an individual's consent will subject the individual to a violation of his human rights .
Thus , it is important that each individual's approval is obtained before any circulation of the genetic testing results .
In conclusion , only the individual concerned regarding the genetic testing results may make the decision to reveal his results .
The violation of human rights and discrimination he faces may cause it to be unjust for the individual to feel compelled to reveal his results .
Therefore , it is of importance that confidentiality of the individual be preserved .
Using RFID to track people arises many issues .
Firstly , the abuse of RFID invades privacy .
It is hard to guarantee that every racking is innocent and conducted in proper ways and .
For example , overzealous employers and criminally intent people could take advantage of the RFID readers to track employees and victims' movement  .
In this case , victims may lose their privacy even without awareness .
Secondly , because a RFID embedded card is easily to be skimmed and cloned , to some extent , it is a loophole for identity theft .
Using the cloned card , anyone could pass into a restricted area through the secure and locked entrance  .
Hence , using RFID equipped card to track and control entrance is not secure and effective at all .
Thirdly , implantable RFID chips have connections with health issues .
Research showed that "implanted RFID chips caused cancer in mice and rats and may cause cancer in cats , dogs , and humans"  .
Additionally , "although an RFID chip in particular may not cause cancer , the inflammation caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object can increase the instance of tumor development"  .
According to these , there is no way to sacrifice people's health to conduct tracking for any purpose .
However , RFID advocators may declare some arguments for the purpose of alleviating the fear of privacy invasion .
For instance , the reader needs to be within about ten feet of the chip in order to extract data , so it may not handle long-range tracking  .
However , it is still highly undetectable if the reader is installed inside doors or walls .
Furthermore , within such distance , RFID readers could still function  .
Hence , people are still under the risk of being tracked and losing privacy without knowledge .
To conclude , since using RFID to track people raises the possibilities of privacy invasion and identity theft and causes health problems , the use of it should be banned .
Genetic testing is a test whereby the individual is tested for any deficiency in the genes that could indicate the presence of future diseases .
But once the result is out and the person has some defective genes , different issues starts to surface .
The person might be subjugated to discrimination and not even the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act  would be able to solve the problem .
Furthermore , the individual have his own right to decide on whether the result could be disclosed or not .
Hence , I strongly agree that the person should have the final say on whether to reveal the genetic testing result so as to avoid these problems .
Secondly , critics on the other end of the table may argue that there is the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act  in the US that was passed down by the former US president , Mr . Bush on 21 May 2008 which states that 'the genetic carriers would be protect against discrimination when it comes to work and health insurance'  .
However , these laws generally fail to offer comprehensive protection to all people at risk for genetic discrimination .
Tera Eerkes , founder of personal genetic testing company {Qtrait} states that 'this measure does not prevent genetic discrimination against people when they are applying for life insurance , or long term care and disability insurance' .
Moreover , the insurance companies will be forced to hike up the cost of their premiums and might result in healthy individuals being quoted the same rate as the genetic risk group  .
Recently , Radio Frequency Identification technology , also known as "RFID" is a hot topic for discussion .
In the past , it is used to track equipments and data and this does not create much controversy in the issue of privacy .
However , as technology improves , RFID is more frequently used to track people .
While some argue that the use of RFID to track people is unfavourable , it in fact not only ensures one's security and safety but also saves time and cuts cost for an industry .
Thus , due to the immense benefits of RFID , it should not be banned .
There are two important benefits of RFID .
Firstly , RFID is used in hospitals to keep a close watch on people for their own safety .
.
This reduces the need to hire full-time nurses to accompany the Alzheimer's patients wherever they go .
When these patients wander around and get lost in an unfamiliar place , we are able to track their whereabouts and know where they are immediately .
Secondly , RFID is used to monitor employees' movements .
.
This is especially useful in hospitals during emergency to track the whereabouts of doctors .
In life and death situation , doctors that are in the vicinity of the operation theatre can be called for help instantly , hence saving time .
Arguments put forth to ban RFID are faulty .
For instance , it has been argued that the excessive use of RFID tags result in deterioration of personal privacy .
.
However , for the group of people who requires constant attention , safety outweighs privacy issues .
Furthermore , RFID tags can be snapped in half to prevent the transmission of data when it is no longer in use .
Thus , this will not threaten individual's privacy .
Finally , there has been greater concern about RFID not only tracking the data of the patient , but also the patient's actual whereabouts .
.
On the contrary , this is a minor issue as only those with access to hospital's database can interpret the information .
Otherwise , this information is purposeless .
In conclusion , RFID should not be banned as it not only saves time and effort but also ensures one's protection from harm under close surveillance .
Advances in technology have made mass surveillance possible , even to track humans .
However , this has stirred up much controversy due to the privacy , security and health issues surrounding its use .
Supporters claim that surveillance technology can increase efficiency and effectiveness in tracking criminals and potential terrorists hence decrease crime rates and in tracking runaway or Alzheimer patients in hospitals to provide better care for every patient  .
In fact , it causes more security and health threats thus using it to track people should be banned to ensure their safety .
Threats discussed here would be with reference to Radio Frequency Identification Device  .
The main argument to support the banning is the risk of identity theft .
RFID tags and cards can be easily hacked and cloned and used immediately to get past what we presumed to be secured  .
If one had their pocket picked , he would know and can take measures to prevent .
However , if one's personal information had been stolen without one's knowledge , one is completely vulnerable .
It is against the law to steal other's identification card but not the information by "skimming"  .
The problem is worsened by the fact that these RFID tags and cards carry unlimited information and there are no regulations to include these virtual crimes .
RFID has enabled potential criminals to commit crimes more easily than ever with technology that is so readily available and surprisingly inexpensive .
Another argument to oppose the use of RFID to track people is the possibility of contracting cancer with the implantation of the chips .
"Research in the 1990s showed that implanted RFID chips caused cancer in rats and may cause cancer in humans"  .
Though rats are more likely to develop tumors regardless of the type of injection , "inflammation caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object still does increase the instance of tumor development"  .
Therefore , for the sole purpose of tracking , this sacrifice is not needed .
In conclusion , the banning of the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people would be essential to protect vulnerable civilians from security and health threats .
There are two main benefits of not having the absolute authority on revealing the results of genetic tests .
Firstly , physicians are able to carry out studies on the gene occurrence in the family , by using the samples of family members .
This would benefit both the individuals and the relatives on their own health and well-being .
It also provides understanding of specific genes occurrence to others  .
Secondly , the awareness of deleterious gene in individuals that leads to disease , like HIV , ensures their responsibility within the community .
The organization involved in genetic care has the authority to disclose the genetic information to appropriate people if harmful genes could lead to serious disease , infected individual does no effort to reveal it or little effort is made for diagnosis and treatments  .
This would prevent harm to others , like the spread of HIV to the uninfected sexual partner and the future generations .
In addition , moral support from sexual partner would be a key determinant factor in motivating infected individuals to seek help .
Finally , the potential discrimination in the society upon revealing the genetic test results is faulty .
This is because , the Insurance and Financial Services Association  in Australia have a policy that states , genetic testing or having family members at risk for certain disease , will not be required for assessment in the insurance companies  .
It has been suggested that there should be respect for individual health condition .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the results since , the advantages of revealing the genetic test results outweigh in most situations .
Radio-frequency identification , more often known as RFID in short , is one of the most pervasive technologies developed since the late 1940s .
Today , enterprises found the use of RFID chips in wide variety of places including hospital , transportation system , corporations , schools , and worryingly , human beings  .
In this paper , I would like to discuss some problems in the use of RFID chip on human .
Human implant is experimented and studied deeply over many countries .
However , this has been proved to have huge problems unfortunately .
Volunteer participated in controlled experiment on skimming has proven that a hacker is able to skim and clone an access card in a split second and using the card to get entrance to a "secure and locked" entrance  .
This absurd result puts a question on the security use on human implant .
Looking at this piece of fact closely , it is not hard for us to see the more serious problem behind it .
RFID chip is able to store much information on personal identity .
Skimming from a skilled hacker is possible for the leaking of one's personal information to unfriendly parties he or she is not willing to befriend with .
This may lead to wide ranges of problems such as blackmailing , complication of crime investigation , duplication of identity , and in some cases , it can even be used as a political weapon .
Human implant of RFID is against human right in this sense as there is a huge risk of losing one's personal privacy .
Though outlawing skimming on RFID tags can be a possible solution , no one can be sure that it would not turn out to be like the case of computer hacking .
Though RFID has proven to be useful in many places , human implant will surely brings us more problems than benefits .
No doubt , under special circumstances , example implantation on babies and mentally disabled will make it easier for us to monitor them , RFID implant on human , however , is generally inappropriate .
With the advance of technology , surveillance technology has become prevalent in the society .
Radio Frequency Identification  as one type of surveillance technology is used as a tool to track people .
Although concerns on privacy issues are raised , RFID benefits the society by ensuring safety among people .
Hence , since RFID brings about positive benefits , it should not be banned .
One area which benefits greatly from RFID technology is the health sector .
Firstly , due to RFID , the safety and security of the patients are ensured .
RFID is used to track patients' locations in order to make sure they are safe .
This is especially true for elder patients with Alzheimer .
Patients suffering from Alzheimer have the tendency to wander .
Hence , RFID will be able to lookout for these patients and ensure they do not go missing , making them safe  .
Also , RFID technology can prevent newborns from being kidnapped .
With RFID , the locations of newborns can be monitored .
Thus , if there are to be unauthorized movements , immediate action can be taken  .
With the newborns' safety being ensured , their parents will not have to worry constantly when they are not able to take care of their infants around the clock .
Thus , RFID technology is able to protect the patients and ensure a safe and secure environment in hospitals .
Proponents for banning of surveillance technology in particular RFID argue that the privacy of people is invaded as people's specific locations can be identified  .
If there are standard laws put in place , so that information from RFID tags can only be obtained by authorized people , then , there should not be privacy concerns due to RFID  .
The user can choose whether or not to give out his or her information , as an RFID tag can be broken into two so that information will not be transferred  .
Since , privacy concerns are not much of an issue , RFID should not be banned .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology particularly RFID should not be banned as it results in a safe environment and the privacy concerns regarding it are not much an issue .
The completion of Human Genome Project has contributed significantly to the rapid development of genetic tests valuable tools that aid in diagnosis and prevention of genetic diseases .
However , due to the nature of the information generated , there have been many debates over who should hold the final decisions to the disclosure of genetic test results .
While some propose that giving individuals the authority to decide curbs arising ethical implications like discrimination , this in fact stops physicians from preventing illnesses and saving more lives .
Thus , the final decision should not be made by the individuals tested .
An important reason why patients should not be empowered in making the final decision is that it prevents doctors from tending to potential patients who could be at high risk of developing a disease if disclosure is not made .
Due to the need to maintain results confidentiality , doctors will be compelled to watch patients with the defective gene fall ill when appropriate intervention can be done to avert the harm .
This is has gone against their 'proper medical and ethical practices'  of preventing harm or avoiding serious jeopardisation of the health of others  .
In considerations of these competing obligations met by physicians , the genetic care and counselling organisations have devised guidelines which accept disclosure to relatives without the consent of those tested when there is going to be a high degree and immediacy of risk faced by them  .
It has been argued that genetic discrimination will arise in the context of insurance and employment if the decision is not made by those who are tested .
However , there has been limited evidence of genetic discrimination in both areas of insurance and workplace based on recent research .
Moreover , a policy statement by Insurance and Financial Services Association  in Australia have made it mandatory that genetic testing will not be considered a requirement for policy risk assessment .
The statement also claims that the insurance industry will not utilise the genetic information of one for risk assessment of their family member  .
In conclusion , individuals requesting for genetic testing should not be given the full authority to make the final decisions in results disclosure as it coerces doctors from fulfilling their duties in promoting the wellbeing of the society .
Modern advances in genetic research have helped scientists and doctors learn more about genes and how they affect us .
This has made it possible to know whether a person has inherited a disease before the symptoms start and show if a person is a gene carrier for a certain disease through genetic testing .
This brings up several issues , should the patient who tested positive for the disease be granted autonomy ?
Lastly , should the patient be allowed to withhold the information from his/her family ?
Due to the ethical and social issues genetic testing can bring , the individual requesting the genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the results of the test but the medical professionals .
In the event in which the patient tests positive for a particular terminal illness , and refuses to receive the results , should the physician then respect his/her wishes although it violates the physician's ethics of putting patient's safety first ?
Physicians trained to deal with the emotional burdens of a positive test results , are capable of properly counselling the patient of the implications of not knowing the test result and also providing the needed medical treatment for the long run .
As the medical professionals would know what medical treatment the patient would need and also understand the encumbrance such knowledge would bring , it is best that the medical professionals decide whether or not to reveal the test results .
Lastly , patients may , upon knowing the results of the test , refuse to share the results to immediate family members who will then be at risk as there is a chance that the same gene causing the disease runs through the family .
In this situation , the patient is unduly putting others at risk as knowledge of inheriting a disease could help to save a patient if diagnosed and treated early .
Patients may also argue over the right to withhold the information as they have a right for privacy and autonomy .
Therefore medical professionals being experts in handling such situations would be able to recommend several other alternatives if the patient is insistent on withholding the test results . 
In conclusion , the medical professionals are able to appropriately handle the delicate issues of genetic testing .
Hence , they should have the right in whether or not to reveal the results of genetic testing .
Firstly the health issue poses a big threat to the usage of RFID as these chips are used in close vicinity to our body .
Patients who wish to keep their medical information might chose to have the chip implanted right under their skin .
The safety of using these chips is still uncertain even its exact position as the chips " migrate under the skin and become difficult to extract"  .
Another concerning issue is that the "RFID tags may electromagnetically interfere with electrosurgical devices"  with particular attention at {magnetic resonance imaging}  scans .
Instead of aiding the patients to recuperate , the tags might in turn cause further deterioration to the patient's health .
Secondly , consumers might be ignorant to the fact that the products they purchased could be tagged so as to provide companies with the sales data and for market research .
Customers could also be tracked with the products anywhere so long as there is a right reader that could read the frequency  Consumer privacy will no longer be existent as consumers loses freedom in choice and also consistently losing personal information to marketers .
Lastly as another information-carrying device , the RFID is also vulnerable to cyber criminals out to steal information about the users .
The attempts on hacking and spoofing the RFID tags had already been successful and so long as the frequency is replicated , the hacker would have access to the functions the RFID tag was made for  .
The user might lost his password for access to areas or monetary items and also his identity .
The possibility that the RFID technology would prove to be more of a hindrance than convenience is evident .
Therefore it should be banned in order to protect us from such vulnerabilities that the RFID would cause ,

Surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification  makes use of technical means to track individuals .
This has brought about many controversial issues on the privacy and health concerns surrounding the use of RFID .
While some argue that the adoption of RFID is a violation of human's privacy , it is indeed helps to protect the safety of family and public and identify patients .
Hence , the use of RFID should not be banned due to the uses it brings about .
There are three important uses of RFID in tracking people .
Firstly , RFID protects the safety of loved ones by tracking the movements of kin in case when they went lost or been kidnapped .
With the help of RFID tag that worn on senile elderly , the tag enables the police to identify the missing elderly and then contact their family members .
In addition , RFID tag helps to ease in assistance of police to locate the hostage and kidnappers .
Secondly , RFID ensures the safety of the public by monitoring suspicious people who might pose a danger to the society as to prevent them from causing harm to the public .
RFID is useful in combating crimes .
Thirdly , RDIF improves the speed of patient identification in hospital .
Upon admission to hospital , each patient is given a RFID wristband which reveals patient name , patient identification number and patient medication record  .
This is to prevent misidentification of patients from happening .
Human genetics has made tremendous leaps over the past years , and consequently made significant impact on many people's lives .
As such , the growth of genetic testing technology has initiated considerable debate over the privacy and confidentiality of genetic information .
In any cases , I advocate and concur that the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing or not .
This is due to the legislation polices that have been implemented for genetic testing as well as the moral aspects of genetic testing on individual or third parties involved .
Firstly , genetic information is not like any other medical information .
Basically , it is far more confidential as it may contain more enhanced personal health issues of individual such as determining whether one carries any defective genes .
Hence , it is rightful to say that genetic information should be kept confidential and could only be revealed by the individual .
In accordance with United States federal law , it states that such medical information should be kept confidential and genetic professionals or doctors do not have the right to disclose any information without seeking the consent of the patient .
Though , they may assist the patients by informing them the likelihood of their relatives contracting the same diseases , the final decision ultimately still depends on the individual .
On the other hand , critics may argue that genetic professionals can interpret the genetic testing results more accurately than the patients .
Thus , they can explain the implications of the results more precisely to the family members .
However , only the patients will understand the family members' different behavioural patterns .
This means that they are more appropriate to reveal the results by using a more desirable method .
As a result , they may help reduce the psychological stress on family members .
In conclusion , the decision of whether to reveal the results of genetic testing should lie only on the individual and not other third parties involved .
Any disclosure of results by third parties will be considered breaching the genetic privacy and confidentiality law and may cause unnecessary moral implications .
Genetic testing is generally used to test for any diseases that arise due to gene mutation .
Genetic testing is becoming more ubiquitous in recent years .
Issues that revolve around genetic testing are no longer limited to whether the individual should go for a genetic test but include the concerns of privacy and confidentiality .
I advocate the idea that the patients should have the final say to decide whether to disclose the test results to relative and families .
First , the law and human rights declaration recognizes the rights to privacy of the individuals .
A law , under any circumstances , is justified and objective .
The law , by no means , states that moral implications have to be considered by the individual .
In serious cases of diseases which are infectious , even though the doctor thinks that the family has a right to be informed of the risk , he cannot breach the confidentiality agreement between him and the patient .
Under the European Convention , article eight states clearly that "everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life ."
Unless there is mutual agreement on both sides , the final say should lie in the patients .
Second , the final say should lie in the patient as he knows what is best for their family members .
The patients know the different behavioral patterns of his family members and will know the best way to approach them regarding his genetic condition .
He can also decide not to tell his family members if he thinks that they might not be able to cope with the news emotionally .
In this way , the family members of the patient are protected from any emotional harm like stress and anxiety .
A doctor cannot determine how the family members will react to the news and hence should not have the final say in the disclosure of genetic test results .
In conclusion , the final say to the disclosure of genetic test results should lie in the patient according to the legal jurisdiction and to the fact that the patients understand the different personalities of their families and will have their best interests in mind .
The advancement in Science and Technology has lead to many possibilities , one of which is the ability to predict one's risk of contracting certain diseases , mostly hereditary , via the study of one's genes .
Called genetics testing , the test results , though not definitive , are highly accurate .
Hence this predictive power leads to one of the many controversies- should the individual have the final say in whether to reveal his/her results ?
Because the results could potentially be used to save lives , yet at the same time be misused , the individual requesting the test should not have the final say .
In fact , this authority should go to the medical professionals; basically the physician undertaking the proceedings of the test and has the part in interacting with the patients firsthand .
Genetic testing is an issue that mankind has place great emphasis on .
After test results are analyzed by physicians , there is a dilemma if the information should be made known to others or it being kept confidential by the individual .
Despite the fact that human rights exist , the physicians actually have a clearer understanding of the results and , the ethical and social issues that surfaces by withholding such information .
Hence , the proposition that genetic test results be made known to others by the medical professionals should hold .
Firstly , genetic testing has led to the ethics of medical professionals being questionable .
There are instances when a patient tested positive for a disease , but refuses to know their results  .
I must admit that the rights to privacy should hold .
Nevertheless , by not sharing this critical information , it creates more problems for themselves .
This is clearly true as test results indirectly reflect genetic information related to family members and there is a possibility of them inheriting the disease too .
In such a situation , the authority to release the result should lie with the healthcare professionals .
Secondly , genetic testing has also been deemed as a social issue .
It has been speculated that discrimination occurs during employment and the application of health insurance when genetic information lands in the hands of the employers and insurance companies  .
However , they fail to realise that there have been laws legislated to prevent discrimination of such forms  .
As a result , the employers and insurance companies should have the rights to request genetic information from their employees or clients directly , or indirectly from medical professionals who has a better interpretation of the genetic test results .
In conclusion , although on the surface there seems to be disturbing issues in sharing genetic information , but when observed in depth , the information when shared can be more of an advantage to the individual as well as those around him .
Eventually , the stand that test results should be made known to others by the medical professionals should hold .
The use of the technology such as radio frequency identification  in tracking people has been heatedly discussed recently due to privacy and security concerns .
Nevertheless , these concerns are outweighed by its pros due to the benefits it brings in ensuring safety of loved ones , public as well as identifying patients .
Hence , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people .
Firstly , RFID can ensure the safety of loved ones .
In case of kidnapping , those who had RFID implanted can be easily located by RFID readers .
For elders who suffer from memory loss , RFID can provides their identities once they are found lost their way home .
Secondly , RFID can ensure the safety of public .
By implanting RFID tags on prisoners , their movements can be monitored and their location can be easily spotted should they escape .
It can also be used on ex-convicts to track their movements and prevent them from committing crimes again .
Thirdly , RFID helps to identify patients .
A RFID tag which contains patients' complete medical history can be implanted to enable treatments by doctors according to their conditions .
Furthermore , RFID tags help to prevent wrong prescription of medicine and any delay treatments which will endanger the lives of patients  .
There are some arguments about the disadvantages of RFID .
Firstly , people argue that RFID tagging will infringe one's privacy .
However , this is not true as the existing rules and legislations are able to cope with the development of RFID and protect users' privacy .
For example , the Data Protection Directive and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive had been set up in Europe to provide security for privacy and data security .
Another argument is that RFID tag may exert negative health effects to the users .
Nevertheless , the relatively low power of RFID actually gives minimum health risk comparing to other wireless applications such as mobile communications and broadcasting .
Moreover , World Health Organization's research also shows that under certain limits , electromagnetic magnetic field from RFID will not incur any negative health effects  .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people due to its advantages in ensuring the safety of loved ones , public and also identification of patients .
Medical advances in technology have made it possible to detect if one has genetic disease through genetic testing .
Genetic testing can be defined as the analyzing of one's DNA to detect a possible risks in contracting genetic disease .
This brought about many debate on the ethical and law issues on whether the individual have the final say in revealing the genetic testing results .
Due to privacy and effects of emotional stress , the individual should have the final say .
Firstly , rights to privacy are recognized in many legal jurisdictions  , especially in regards to personal information , such as genetic testing results .
Laws have been implemented to protect the confidentiality of such personal and sensitive information .
Therefore , due to law issues , only the individual has the right to decide whether or not to reveal their personal information .
Secondly , there will be emotional stress experienced by relatives , if results are revealed unnecessarily .
For example , letting parents know about the genetic risks may cause them to have a guilty conscience , they may feel responsible for passing a genetic mutation on to their child .
However , there is a common misconception that being tested positive means that they will definitely get sick .
This is not necessarily going to happen as many other factors are needed like non-genetic risks such as smoking to occur as well .
Therefore , revealing of result could be redundant if relatives do not have non-genetic risks , but instead create undesirable emotional stress for the relative .
So , the individual could first observe for any signs of symptoms of the genetic disease the relative may have , such as deformity or behavior problems , before deciding whether or not to tell .
In this case , third parties such as doctors should not reveal , as doctors are usually more concerned of alerting the person of the possible chances of contracting the genetic disease , rather than the possible negative impacts this news may bring to the person .
In conclusion , due to the law issues and the possible undesirable emotional stress by relatives , the individual should have the final say in revealing the results , as it is their personal information , and that they understand the relatives emotionally better .
Tracking of individual's movement using RFID technology is make possible when it is used in a combination with Global Positioning System technology , as proposed by RFID vendors .
A person's movements can be tracked if the RFID tag is associated with a person .
The RFID tag could be tag in an article of clothing or under the skin in some parts of the body and it could also serve as an identifier for the person wearing it .
RFID should not be banned as it brings many benefits to our lives .
There are many advantages of using RFID technology to track people's movement .
Firstly , companies/family members could leverage on this RFID technology to locate their loved ones/employees if they were missing or working in dangerous environment .
Secondly , in hospital , a positive patient identification system uses radio frequency identification , RFID , to identify patients can led to fewer patient misidentification .
Patient misidentification has been the leading causes of medical errors and medical malpractice , posing a serious risk to patient safety .
Thirdly , monitoring of RFID tagged convicts in prison can prevent possible prison break .
In addition , RFID tagged offenders that are serving their term in the community; this can help to enforce their home curfews .
It is often argued that the implantation of RFID is a violation of privacy .
However in some cases like working in a dangerous environment , safely is prioritized over privacy violation .
Furthermore , the tags can be deactivated to prevent tracking if there's a need .
There are also worries over leaked confident information through RFID tags .
However , the tags can be encrypted and cleared of information before discarding .
Finally , there are health concerns over exposure to electromagnetic fields , EMF , from the usage of RFID .
But guidelines in recommended limits of EMF exposure have been adopted internationally to prevent any known negative health effects . 
In conclusion , tracking of people's movement using RFID technology should not be banned as its benefits heavily outweigh the downsides it might bring .
Advancements in technology have allowed the inventions of new devices that have helped improve lifestyles and bring about much convenience in our lives .
Surveillance technology such as the Radio Frequency Identification  is one example .
It has made tracking people a simpler task .
Hence , it should not be banned due its benefits .
In conclusion , RFIDs should not be banned as it can benefit us widely in many ways .
Despite the disadvantages it may pose , these can be offset with appropriate actions put in place .
Hence , we should not totally shun away from the use of RFID to track people but put in place measures to overcome the problems so as to ensure its optimal use .
Arguments against the use of RFID to track people could be the long- term health implications to the human body .
However , the World Health Organization has found out that safe use of RFID will not have any adverse effects on human's health .
.
Moreover , others oppose this as it causes invasion of privacy due to leakage of personal information to the third party .
.
Nevertheless , there has been data protection technology that is already in place to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing . 
In conclusion , we should not ban RFID technologies to track people as there are many benefits and its use as an effective measure to locate individuals during times of emergencies .
However , Critics of this position point out that there are also policies that have not helped to ease the aging process .
This is particularly the case for policies that tackle on increasing birth rate .
By increasing birth rate , there will be more productive population who can generate income to support the future aging population .
For example , the baby bonus scheme in Singapore was ineffective as the birth rate remains at 1 .28 .
The attractive financial incentives like getting cash gift of up to $4 ,000 each for the 1st and 2nd child and $6 ,000 each for having a 3rd and 4th child and also paid maternity leave of 4 months were not enough to make people wants to have more children .
This can be due to lifestyle of Singaporeans like having long working hours and high standard of living , thus they prefer not to have any children .
As long as government considers solution to these issues like encouraging working from home , the policy may be more effective .
If these policies were successful , it will definitely ease the aging process .
In conclusion , current policies have helped to ease the aging process in many different areas .
In the coming years , more countries will also be facing this problem and thus different types of research and development as well as policies should be explored to prepare for the future .
There should be a limit on public spending on the aged so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development  is a suggestion that should be implemented in order to combat the rising cost of healthcare for the elderly .
With the rapid growth of the elderly population for example in a country like Singapore , where the median age is expected to hit 41 years old from the present 36  , increasing public spending in healthcare could further strain the government's expenditure as more money need to be poured in to cater to the growing numbers of elderly in the country .
There are several factors that explains the need to limit public spending on elderly healthcare .
Secondly , public spending on elderly healthcare should only be limited to elderly who really need it to prevent abuse by other citizens .
If there are no limits implemented , the normal citizens could abuse the system by using it indiscriminately and denying the rights of healthcare to truly needy patients .
An example could be seen in the United Kingdom where healthcare is fully subsidized by the government .
People would go to the doctor for even the smallest discomfort , causing doctors to waste time on non critical care and forsaking those that need immediate attention  .
This may in turn cause a clog up of cases where there will be more patients waiting longer for their operation reducing the quality of the healthcare sector  .
Besides encouraging abuse , increased spending in healthcare for the elderly will also cause an increase in taxpayers' money to subsidize the cost , placing a heavier burden on the people .
This could probably cause a public reprisal as the current economy crisis has yet to fully subside and the government should instead focus on recovering the country's economy first .
Public spending on the elderly should therefore be limited to those with chronic conditions or need immediate attention who cannot afford the cost of healthcare to avoid abuse and increase of taxpayers' money .
Finally , the responsibility of taking care of the elderly should first rest on the children , not the government , if the elderly has any working child .
Some might argue that it is the government's duty to look after the welfare of its citizens , but if the government were to look after all of the elderly without the help of the children , it would certainly cost the government an enormous amount of time and money .
The government needs to first concentrate on more important matters regarding the country for example in issues regarding national safety , trade , education , international relations and defense to ensure that the nation's interests is safeguarded and not act as a nursery home for the old .
Public spending on elderly healthcare must not be raised to compensate for the failure of children to look after their parents .
Children should be taught the importance of filial piety since young to ensure that they do not abandon all of their responsibility of taking care of their parents when they are old .
The government could also enact a law to compel children to support their parents if the children are capable and the parents are in need .
An example would be the Maintenance of Parents Act in Singapore , where parents could lawfully demand support from their child in court .
In conclusion , there are many reasons on why and how public spending on elderly healthcare should be limited to allow government to channel the money to other areas of development .
While healthcare for the elderly is still important , however governments must ensure that other important areas will not get neglected as well .
Ageing population is a serious problem faced by many developed state .
It is mainly caused by the increased number of elderly and the drop in birth rate .
The ageing population is creating many social problems such as health problems , high government expenses and high income taxis , which are stressing the young workers and the aged people .
Many states such as the US , the UK , Japan and Singapore start to implement various policies such as increasing child birth rate , saving plans for elderly and health care policies to ease the ageing process .
However , most of these policies tend to be ineffective in easing the ageing process because they either have their limitation or fail to solve the social problems behind the ageing process .
This essay is going to examine the limitation and the problem ignored by those current policies .
Health care policies can be found in many developed countries in easing the ageing process to a very limited extent , because they creates social burden and fail to service minorities most of the time .
For example , the UK has tried to make the nation to become welfare state , but this leaves heavy tax burden to the working class and created low working incentive for the workers .
It shows that medical policies must be planned well to provide health care to people who really need it .
For example , Japan has introduced medical service , which allows its citizens to save for their personal medical account so that we can use the money when they fall sick in their old age .
Similarly , Singapore has introduced same kind of policies call Medi-save and Medi-shield .
However , these policies cannot help those people who have long term disease because these diseases requires huge amount of money to cure .
Ironically , the World Health Organization has released a report in year 2006 which showed that the number of people who have long term disease such as heart disease and cancer is increasing sharply .
The data has also showed that stressful working life is contributing to the poor health of the people .
Moreover , the minorities who do not have proper job or income do not have a medical care account will not be taken care by the health service .
They will be having nothing to rely when they fall sick .
Therefore , the health care policy in most developed countries should be improved to help those patients with long term disease and those who are neglected .
The baby bonus policy also has its limitation in easing the ageing process through increasing the birth rate to support the elderly .
Today , both two leading states such as Japan and Singapore in the area of slowing down the ageing population have implemented "Baby Bonus Policy" .
Basically , families that give birth to more than one child will get economic support from child birth rate and ease the ageing process .
This is because the fact that many elderly couples only have one child to breed them and this always puts a heavy burden to the child .
Hence , with more children , more economic support could be provided and the old parents could be taken care better .
However , the "Baby Bonus Policy" does not work well although almost everyone aware its benefit .
For example , Singapore's birth rate is 1 .28 , which is the lowest in the world .
This is because firstly , the stressful social environment that forces couples to put their time and effort in their work , so that they are unable to spend time with each other .
Secondly , getting more salary through longer working hours makes life much easier than appealing for limited economic aids after having many children .
Thus , government fails to notice the two root of the evil .
Therefore , baby bonus policy could not increase the birth rate effectively in easing ageing process .
The modern society today is fulfilled with modern values that lead to the ageing population , thus caused the some government policies to become ineffective in easing the ageing process .
Many states have introduced housing policies , which allow the young couples to live near their parents or giving priority in purchasing house to those people who have married .
This allows the couples to take care each other especially when they are old , or to take care their parents when they are still young .
However , the states fail to realize that people's value towards family is changing today .
The family bonding in most western society is very weak and the young generation does not really have a sense of filial piety in their head .
Also , the stressful working market created by capitalism today is taking away too much time and effort from people so that they cannot spend them with their family , or even cannot think of having a family .
It creates modern value that allows people of opposite sex to live together without having a family .
So , what if people do not get married ?
What if the idea of family is vanished ?
What if the young no longer care about their parents ?
If all these assumptions occurred , the housing policy therefore will not be relevant at all .
Hence , besides housing policies , the governments should also raise the awareness of having strong family bonding .
In conclusion , most of the current policies in easing ageing process have their limitation or ineffective .
The fundamental problem is because the states fail to realize the social problems behind , which contributed to the stressful ageing process .
Hence , in order to ease ageing process , the policies should be designed to solve the root of the evil rather than just focus on the surface of the problems .
Population aging , as stated in the introduction of the report World Population Aging: 1950-2050  is the process by which older individuals become a proportionally larger share of the total population .
It was at first experienced by the developed countries , but now taking place around the globe .
Why is our world aging ?
This can be explained through two main factors .
Firstly , the increased of longevity as the elderly are leading longer lives .
A special report from Economist .com  stated that average life expectancy for the whole world was only 30 years during the 1990s , and the rich countries under 50 .
However , the figures have each increased to 67 and 78 , and it has no signs of stopping .
The next factor contributing to the aging phenomenon is the declining of birth rates as people tend to have lesser kids than the previous years .
Therefore , as this phenomenon poses a certain threat to the development of a country , many governments have produced policies and initiatives to ease the aging process .
Nevertheless , the strategies taken do not seem to help ease the aging process .
Between the two significant contributing factors to this phenomenon , declining fertility is likely to hold primary responsibility for the aging global population .
As a result , new policies are now introduced to increase the birth rate .
For instance , the "Stop at two" policy that was once carried out in Singapore is now replaced by "Three , or more if you can afford it" policy , together with other incentives .
Despite these measures , the birth rate of Singapore has not increase significantly  .
The "Stop at two" policy had been so successful that couples in Singapore saw that they can have a better standard of living with a smaller family .
Educated women prefer to pursue their careers before getting married , thus women have a sense of insecurity in losing their job when they have to take maternity leave or when they are about to give birth to their child .
Other than that , educated women do not just want to be successful in their careers , but also a good mother .
Therefore , by having a small family , a woman may be able to be more attentive to each and every child , in terms of education , values , and overall well being , so that the children will be able to survive in the competitive world ahead of them .
As we grow older , our body turns weak and so , we tend to face difficulties in conducting normal activities in daily life .
The decline performance of the body limits the ability of the aged to care for themselves .
But , we are now living in a world surrounded by all sorts of advance technology .
It has improved our quality of life in many ways , especially the field of medical science .
High awareness for healthcare among elderly people allows them to seek professional help such as undergoing kneecap replacement surgery to ease the pain of arthritics .
Their children are also willing to finance the medical bill as there are government policies to cover the spending .
For instance , in Malaysia by paying your parents medical bill , you are able to claim up to RM1000 .
This is a government policy to encourage filial piety .
However , this raises an implication that the upper class and middle class people who are likely more easily to access information will use this advantage .
This , in turn will create a misguide impression that medical fees of the elderly are high , resulting in the debate between the government and policy makers whether to limit healthcare spending on the aged or not .
Thus , the welfare of those who are really in need is also neglected .
Some may argue that , the measure of increasing the retirement age should be able to reduce the negative effects of the aging population .
It is true that by letting the elderly people carry on working can increase manpower in labor markets simultaneously letting them increase their savings to support themselves during old age .
However , are employers willing to do so ?
Employers tend to hire the inexperienced young people in order to save money .
It is also a common mindset that young people have a higher level of work productivity in contrast to the elderly people .
In some cases , employers have the notion that employing the aged , the setting of the workplace might have to undergo some changes to accommodate to the needs of the elderly .
In short , life today is not similar to the past , challenges lies ahead waiting for us to overcome .
The effects of the aging population maybe exaggerated , but we should not lack foresight and neglect it .
Therefore , government and policy makers have to put more effort to ease the aging process as the elderly are still experiencing inadequate protection .
Singapore's population is the second fastest ageing in the world after Japan .
In year 2000 , 7 .2 percent of the population was aged 65 and above .
By 2030 , the figure is expected to increase to 18 .4 percent for those aged 65 and above .
By 2050 , the figure will increase to 35 percent for those aged 60 years and above  .Ageing population is a challenge for Singapore for the coming years .
Therefore public spending on the aged should not be limited and used to divert to other areas of the country's development .
Children are encouraged to take care of their parents .
For example , housing grants are given to encourage children to stay near to their parents .
The government had increased the housing grants from $30000 to $40000  .
New condominium units are built with two units on each level to encourage children to stay with their parents .
Even though government encourages children to take care of their parents , there are still cases where parents sue their children for not taking care of them .
Singapore government had passed the maintenance of parents act to make children responsible for their parents .
In cases where the elder do not have any children or saving left , money is also needed to cater for their daily expenses , housing and medical expenses .
Over the last 50 years aging population was considered as a big problem that influenced western countries economic development .
However , during the next 50 years there will be a dramatic increase in aged and it is inevitable for Asian countries to face this challenge from now on .
To date , aging population whose age is above 5 comprise 14 percent of the world .
According to the survey done by United Nations , aging population in Asia is estimated to increase by 314 percent , from 207 million to 857 million in 2050 and among those sub regions East Asia will suffer most .
Japan is still the country with largest amount of and most rapidly growing aging population .
Both china and Singapore are anticipated to become the second right after Japan in 30 years and aged above 65 will make up 20 percent of the total population .
Moreover , the rate of birth kept falling down and family will have less adult children than they had in the past , which puts more burdens together with aging population to the government to deal with .
So it has been a controversial issue that whether government shall cut public spending on the aged and divert to other areas of economic development to secure stable productivity and GDP .
It looks aging population will become a worse problem if current low-level government spending is going to be cut further .
However , taking all the advantages and disadvantages of this policy from the angle of the future into account , there will be more effective ways to handle this challenge rather than directly or indirectly giving "fish" to the elderly , so it will be necessary for the government to limit public spending on the aged .
There is not dispute that the average age is climbing up continuously as it is impossible to prevent people from getting old , which is the most outstanding but only one part of the features of aging population .
It is more important to pay attention to other trends and characteristics of aging population in order to solve this problem it in some other ways .
One of the biggest factors that the aged may causes excessive burden on economic development is the less support to the family from their adult children as a consequence of less birth rate and higher child bring-up fees .
For example , there has been a baby booming period between 1947 and 1949 in Japan but since 1949 the total fertility rate started to fall , from 4 .54 to 2 .04 per woman in less than 10 years and from 2 .14 to only 1 .29 nowadays .
The same kind of situation is also confronted by Singapore , china , Thailand , South Korean and other Asian countries .
On the other hand , the number of adult children who are willing to live with their parents fell instead of rising .
The proportion of Japanese elderly people living with their adult children fell from 80 percent in 1950 to 50 percent in 1990 , in south Korean from 78 percent in 1984 to 47 percent in 1994 .
Thus it will be more essential for the government to emphasize the responsibility that adult children bear to support the family rather than directly give financial support to the aged , which will in turn lay more tax burdens on the working group .
In other words , making the adult children actively support their parents will be better than passively pay tax .
In some relatively politically stable regions like Singapore , it is good for the government to enact the laws for the adult children to provide family support .
In addition to getting support from adult children , it is identically important to give more employment opportunities or put off the mandatory retirement ages for the elderly , which is also a good method to ease the rapid productivity downturn as people tend to live longer than before .
Similar to the problem of adult children , although the number of aging population keeps rising , the amount of old people who could get chance to work either full time or part time tends to fall due to economic and social changes that less employers want to hire old labor - from 38 percent of the population 65 and above in 1950 to 25 percent in 2000 and 22 percent in 2010 by the survey from United Nations .
This opposite direction of number of aged and working group affects the economic productivity to a great extent .
So the government's task is to make more policies concerning both the mandatory retirement age and employers' restriction .
For instance , hiring the elderly as part-time worker may be a good choice for both aged and employers so as to enable the elderly to earn more as well as enhance productivity .
This is also a good way to let the aging population take , if not all , part of the public spending by themselves .
Apart from the methods mentioned above , there are more and more effective methods to be come up with to handle aging population instead of direct public spending on the aged .
The elderly is a large part of the society that cannot be ignored and the best way to keep a sustainable economic development as well as give them a beautiful autumn is to set up a systematic methodology rather than focus on any single policy .
In conclusion , most of the policies and steps taken by the government have helped eased the aging process to a large extend .
In the areas of healthcare and financial security the government have been constantly upgrading and implementing new strategies to help ease the aging process .
Hence the measures taken by the government are effective ones and it has helped the elderly age comfortably .
Ageing is an inevitable part of life and it is often not easy at all to deal with the difficulties that old age brings .
However , with the world noticing the shift in it's demographic to a more aged society , things are becoming more accommodating for the elderly .
Indeed , developments like companies becoming more inclined to hire older workers , government policies giving the elderly more protection , and medical policies being designed to ensure the affordability of health care have helped make ageing much easier .
The difficulties in ageing are well-documented and hence have always been a source of debate for any society .
In our society , the aged have been marginalized in the struggle of the survivor of the fittest as their contributive power to society were reduced .
Yet , as society matures , one can see how ingenious and novel methods have been developed and set into place to help bring the elderly from living on the margins of society into being a part of the family structure again .
The three developments and policies highlighted are examples of the efforts made to help ease the ageing process for the elderly by helping them keep themselves relevant to society and their family .
Thus , what were once sore sticking points in the issue of ageing has been tackled largely by the methods described .
It is interesting to note , also , that in helping to ease the ageing process , society has prepared itself to adapt to the prospect of an ageing population .
Ever since the "Silver Tsunami" swept our regions , there has been much debate with regards to public spending on the aged .
Some feel that giving our full support to the elderly is of the utmost importance while others suggest limiting expenditure on the aged; drawing concerns from other sectors of the country such as economic growth and sustainability .
I agree with the latter; those concerns are very real , and if left unattended can pose a serious threat to the country's development .
Though I feel that public spending on the aged should be limited , it should be done flexibly and contextually .
The seniors have in the past , contributed to our society as well and it would be our immediate moral obligation to support them .
Suffice to say , this must be done prudently lest we should neglect the well being of other sectors in the process .
In this essay , we will be addressing these dilemmas and attempt to propose several possibilities as well as solutions that come with it .
Limiting public is something which the governments must consider seriously .
From a pragmatic stand , majority of the elderly are unable to contribute economic growth due to deteriorating health conditions which come naturally with aging .
Some common conditions such as rheumatism , failing eyesight and hearing , dementia , Parkinson's disease , all of which render them unfit for work .
Not only are the elderly hindering the country's economic growth , they are depleting it at an alarming rate as well .
Member of Parliament Paulin Tay-Straughan said that " . . .spiraling healthcare costs could potentially be a major strain on the Singapore government's resources .
If  don't have adequate coverage , there will be a tremendous strain on subsidized care which will drain revenues from the state .
"Suffice to say , limiting public spending on the elderly must be considered in order to maintain a sustainable economy .
Another reason why public spending on the elderly should be limited is so that the funds could be diverted into other sectors of the country's development .
Experts predict a financial toll in the near future stating , "East Asia may experience widespread capital shortages as funds are diverted from financing productive investments in Hong Kong and Singapore to financing pension deficits in Berlin and Washington ."
By diverting the funds into sectors such as foreign investments , it would enable us to provide for the elderly even more sufficiently with the extra capital .
Even if we had enough capital for elderly spending , recent surges of new pandemics such as the H1N1 virus , call for more funding into the medical field .
Not to mention there are others like the needy who need financial aid as well .
However , limiting public spending on the seniors should be done flexibly and contextually .
Limiting does not mean depriving them of support , but only to provide what's necessary .
Certain categories fall through the gaps of the system and are left dry and powerless , even without the basic needs .
An example could be seen in the following article which writes "Isn't the HDB's policies self-contradictory , when it's income ceiling policy 'forces' the lower-income to buy larger flats than they can afford . . . HDB's income eligibility requires a household earning more than $ 2 ,000 a month to buy a flat that is bigger than a two-room flat . . . a household earning just over $ 3 ,000 , is also not eligible to buy a three-room flat , and have to buy a four-room flat ."
This example is one that stresses for flexibility .
It doesn't necessarily mean that when one has some money , he/she doesn't need help .
Spending on the aged should also be contextualized accordingly with economic situations , such as the recent economic crisis where employers are extremely selective , making jobs all the more scarce for the elderly .
Clearly , it can be seen that though limiting public spending on the elderly might produce certain immediate difficulties , it will ease the process inevitably during the long run .
It is important that for us to maintain economic stability , we should keep our sights focused on a more macro scale .
However , the application of flexibility and context is most crucial as there are indeed too many factors and variations for the system to account for , thus it is better that humans master the system instead of the opposite case .

State of Families in Singapore , Well Being of Elderly in Singapore .
September 15 ,2009 from fcd .ecitizen .gov .sg/NR/rdonlyres/89400A6C-8621-4882-A238- 01D9067C86DB/0/Chpt7 .pdf

HDB Means Testing ? .
September 15 , 2009 from theonlinecitizen .com/2008/10/hdb-means-testing/
One of the policies introduced by the government in tackling the aging population is the Baby Bonus Scheme .
However , despite being implemented for several years , the scheme has yet to produce satisfying results .
This is because many young Singaporeans are now leading a different lifestyle and adopting different ideologies about the concept of marriage and family .
For example , some of them do not see the need of having babies and viewed it as a potential source of problem to their ever-stressful life .
Also , many feel that the scheme is not attractive enough to offset the cost of having more babies .
With the relentless rising cost of living and competition , Singaporeans now have to work harder just to meet the ends .
Thus , many are put off by the idea of having more children due to the accompanying life- time commitment of raising a child .
Therefore , due to these worries , many couples are not responding to the scheme despite the continuous efforts made by the government .
To lengthen working lifespan , the government introduced policies to reduce elder dependency by raising eligibility age for public pensions and government incentives .
However , depending entirely on legislation will not bring about substantial improvements in boosting employment prospects for the "silver population" .
For example , the employment rate for workers aged 55-64 was only 57% in 2008 , a slow increase from 38% in 1991 .
For those aged 65-69 , the employment rate was merely 27 .5% .
Thus , even if the legal retirement age was raised , it clearly produces limited results .
The main reason is that even if older workers want to work , the deciding factor still lies with the employers .
In fact , stipulating higher retirement age can have an adverse effect .
Employers now think twice before employing or retaining older workers due to the potential higher liability and costs such as retraining programs and insurance benefits .
As a result , employers tend to shut their doors to the older workers .
In line with the above efforts to tackle the graying population , the government introduced the Parents' Maintenance Act in 1996 to impose on filial piety .
However , the government cannot simply legislate filial piety .
Law alone cannot be used to solve the problems that cause some children to abandon their parents .
In fact , the Act is likely to cause even more distress among children who are already overly burdened with the ever rising cost of living in Singapore .
Family ties may be further strained since the children are not taking care of their parents out willingness .
Also , the government will be seen as shirking its responsibility towards the elderly citizens by pushing the load of parental care to their children .
Taking it from the parents' perspective , some of them may not even consider the Act as being abandoned by their children is regarded as a shameful matter .
These parents may want to protect their family's name and want their children to take care of them out of gratitude instead of legal obligations .
Therefore , while it seems that the Act is based on well intentions , it is certainly not the solution to the root of the parents' maintenance problem .
Clearly , the rise of the aging population brings about complex and multi- faceted challenges to the whole of society .
The government should first understand and address the changing mindset and values of today's society towards problems created by the fast aging population before implementing the policies .
Merely depending on legislation will not help to improve the attitudes of the society towards the elderly significantly .
Instead , this will bring about further resentment and result in a strain of relationship between the young and the old .
In all , moving beyond law to enhance the perceptions of elderly is a more practical way to increase the ability and willingness of the society to coordinate with the government in tackling the "grey tsunami" .
With the growing population and various problems that the present governments face today , the governments are finding it tedious to balance the budget to ensure that all areas of development are being met .
No country or state is able to provide unlimited funding to the providence of the aged .
Besides this , there are also other areas of the country which require more monetary spending to ensure the future of the country such as Education and Research and Development  .
However , public spending on the aged should not take a backseat .
There should be a sum of money which is set aside for the welfare of the aged .
After all , they were once a pillar of the country and helped to perpetuate growth of the country economically .
Basically , from the moral viewpoint , regardless of race or religion , filial piety is an important moral value that should be inculcated into us .
By having the government to set the standard of caring for the elderly , the public should also share the economic burden of caring for the aged .
Thus , the society should be magnanimous in spending in areas of healthcare or recreational programs .
For example , pumping money into R&D of illnesses like dementia , osteoporosis and Parkinson's disease will benefit the aged because these illnesses are more apparent as people grow old .
This prepares the medical sector to handle these illnesses .
The government could also conduct recreational programs such as medical talks on the possible health problems that could arise in the aged .
This will help the elderly to understand the causes and effects of these health problems which encourage them to adopt a healthy lifestyle that reduces the risks of contracting these illnesses .
Therefore , we should spend on the aged .
However , economic benefits will be minimal if the state decides to be a welfare state and compromises the economic development of the country .
Suppose a country were to provide full support to the elderly , other developments like education and public housing would be costly .
People will be discouraged to study and will be in a state of chaos as the standard of living is too high for people to cope .
Even though this policy largely benefits the elderly , the rest of the society will suffer .
If no money were diverted into education , the country will suffer economically as there will be insufficient "intelligent" resource to promote economic growth .
When there are few to sustain the high cost of maintaining the aged , the aged will eventually suffer .
It will be like a vicious cycle .
The situation will be made worse if the country faces declining birth rate such as Singapore .
There are lesser young people to support the aged .
This increases economic burden for them .
Therefore , unlimited spending on the aged would be clearly unthinkable .
It will be more realistic if a calculated amount of spending is being distributed to the aged .
Areas like education and R&D help to fuel the economy .
These two areas are considered to play key roles in the growth of a nation .
For example , in countries like Singapore where there is a lack of natural resources , with only human resource , it is important for most Singaporeans to be educated .
Having received education increases the probability of one being employed which helps to promote economical growth .
With economical growth , the standard of living will also increase for people living in Singapore .
Furthermore , Singapore depends largely on international trade for growth .
Exports in Singapore comprise of over 130% of Gross Domestic Product  ever since mid 1980s .
The main products being export out of Singapore are integrated circuits , computer parts and accessories .
Since export plays a significant role in contributing to the GDP of Singapore , a vast amount of finance should be diverted to R&D .
Therefore , by providing education and investment into R&D help generate capital for the country .
Economic growth leads to an increase in standard of living which benefits the whole society including the aged .
A budget should be set for the public spending on the aged .
In fact , the governments should adopt and develop appropriate systems and programs customized with respect to their cultural , economic and social context .
Furthermore , it is beneficial for governments to exchange pointers and assist one another in coping with the effects of greying population .
This help to ensure that majority will age with security .
Keeping the aged in mind , we must never neglect the future generations since they will be the ones who will support the nation .
Therefore , we should first cater the needs of the younger ones .
Public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas that are of equal , or even greater , importance .
A substantial amount is spent on the elderly annually , and this sum of money can be put to other uses .
Maintaining and sustaining a country is not just about looking after the aged , but also in developing growing sectors of our nation .
Although it is essential for the government to spend on the graying population , there are , however , ways to minimize this spending , and this amount can then be used on other areas of the country's growth and development , such as maintaining our country's defense and improving the education system .
Furthermore , lengthening the working lifespan of our citizens might be another viable solution in dealing with an aging population .
This is , however , hard to achieve in our present day society as employers , given a choice , tend to avoid hiring the elderly as they are thought to be less productive when compared to younger workers .
Therefore , there should be some government intervention with regards to employment of the elderly , as this will assist them in securing a place in the workforce .
Not only does it benefits the government as spending on the aged can be reduced , it also benefits them both economically and socially .
Longer working years will allow the elderly to accumulate more wealth for future use in times of need .
With this accumulated wealth , they will then be able to meet their basic needs and be less dependent on the government when they retire from the workforce .
Furthermore , working can help to decrease boredom in retirement , as time will then be spent engaging in productive activities at work , and not whiled away doing nothing .
These benefits of longer working lifespan can be made possible if employers are willing to hire the aged , who can then be self-sufficient with minimum , or no , help from the government .
The benefits of limiting public spending on the elderly is seen when this amount of money can be channeled to other areas of our country's development .
One such area is defense , which is exceptionally important to an island country like ours .
We have to be prepared against terrorism and external attacks by other countries , at all times .
Apart from defense , the government needs to invest in out country's development as well , and this includes improvements in our education system .
This will then ensure that our future generations will learn more and benefit from it , and it is of great importance as they are the future pillars of our society , who will lead our country to greater heights in order to be a successful and progressive nation .
There are clearly many areas that the government has to spend on annually , and the graying population is one of it .
However , other areas should not be neglected , as our nation's growth and development is of vital importance as well .
Many ways are , indeed , present to help limit public spending on the age .
It will be made possible if these are strongly enforced , and high cooperation among citizens of our society will help to deal with this issue too .
It is well-known that people's life expectancy is increasing , leading to the pressure of expenditures on the elderly who are considered to be weak and non-productive .
However , what we do not know or are still confused about is the effective way to both take care of the aged and enhance the development of other fields .
It is the matter of money usage .
There is a suggestion that the governments should limit the expenditures on the aged and therefore they will have money to spend on other areas to develop the countries .
To some extent , I agree with this statement but it should be clarified at some points .
The first point needed to be clarified is how limited the government funding on the elderly should be and what will happen if the expenditures are under the agreed limit .
-
"Because capital is a produced factor of production , a society can change the amount of capital it has .
If today the economy produces a large quantity of new capital goods , then tomorrow it will have a larger stock of capital and be able to produce more of all types of goods and services .
Thus , one way to raise future productivity is to invest more current resources in the production of capital ."

In the framework of fast-aging population and the restricted national budgets which do not allow spending generously on the elderly , this limit should be maintained at an acceptable level which ensures that the aged's basic needs such as food , clothing , housing , transportation and healthcare are met .
However , in some nations , especially developing countries , blaming for the need of investing most of their capital in other areas to push the countries forward , the governments cut down the basic expenditures on the aged .
Is it a wise choice ?
Cutting down the fiscal costs on the aging population to support other areas does not mean that those areas will receive the whole benefits .
Let's take a situation in which without sufficient support from the government , the aged become a burden to their families as an example .
In that case , if the fiscal costs on the aged are cut down to rise up the expenditures on the young generation , it can lead to the result that the money aimed to support one target in a family the youth - will be shared to partly meet two demands , the elder's and the younger's .
In other words , the purposes of investing in other areas of development by using money saved from fiscal cost on the aged cannot be fully fulfilled .
In developing countries , declining the basic expenditures on the aged can lead to a worse situation .
The aged in these nations , especially in rural areas do not merely need money to lead the rest of their lives , but also to raise their children or grandchildren .
They share with their younger generations their limited monthly retirement pensions or allowances to fulfill all the costs of living , and usually , run out of money before the pensions/allowances of the next month come to their hands .
Living in poverty , the younger generations grow up with poor opportunities to accumulate wealth to support themselves , let alone supporting their next generations when they become old .
And sadly , the circle of poverty goes on .
The second point needed to be clarified is in which areas the money saved from maintaining the fiscal costs on the aged at the satisfactory level should be invested and how to make use of the money earned from these investments to benefit the aged .
One of the productive areas to invest is economy since economic development helps to raise the national budgets and thus raise the public expenditures on the elderly .
Money earning from investigations into other areas of the economics should be partly used to support the aged not only to lessen the burden on the families or to fade away the picture of poverty from generations to generations , but also to ease the elderly's lives .
The increasing size of the economy could be relatively limited , but it does allow the government to have more choices to take care of the aged in a better way .
In other words , what the government should do is not merely concerning the economic growth but also taking action to link each increasing level of economic growth with each respectively increasing level of the elder's quality of life .
In conclusion , limiting the fiscal cost on the aged without thorough considerations could lead to unexpected results which directly affect the elderly themselves and their families , as well as indirectly impact on the society and country's development .
In cutting down the spending on the aged , the governments must ensure that their basic needs are still satisfied and the money saved from this act of limiting should be efficiently invested to partially support back to the elderly .
The gap between theory and practice could be hard to close .
However , the way of taking action will be easier if the plan is well prepared .
In addition , government should put more effort and invest on those areas that productive .
It will help on country's economic growth .
For example , Singapore casino-resort project will develop many working opportunities and it is estimated that there will be very high returns in the future .
Thus income of citizens will be rising and it leads to increased savings .
Citizens will have an easier life after their retirement .
It will reduce their reliance on others likes governments and families .
For the part of government , they will be able develop medical technology and provide more medical schemes to help the aged .
On the other hand , the rate of poverty will be smaller .
People can afford to look after their elderly .
Clearly any further expansion of financial schemes on the elderly will only impoverish future generations and limit future public spending .
Spending on elderly , especially healthcare , can continue indefinitely because of the continuous introduction of new technologies and treatments that are beneficial but expensive .
Government and policy maker have to decide on what is essential and should be supported by public sector .
In brief , leaders in government must raise all ideology and implement practical measure to cope with the problems of a fast aging population .
Education plays a very important role in a nation's development , as it is the most basic platform for a society to learn and improve .
The government should allocate more funds on a better building a better education system , leading to more educated and productive , future generations .
As the future generations are more educated and productive , they will be able to contribute more to the economy and this , in return , should get them a higher income .
A higher income will allow the younger generation to support themselves better and therefore provide for their own parents , allowing the government to spend less on caring for the old .
Another outcome of better education standards is that , both the younger and older generations will better understand what could happen to them when they grow old .
This means both the newer and older generations will be able to better plan for their old age and the problems that come with it , for example , deteriorating health .
To stay healthy , they can exercise more and have a good diet .
This makes it possible for lower health subsidies from the government as more people know how to stay healthy .
Other than concentrating on better education , the government can also build on better communication and transportation infrastructure which will then attract more investors and foreign talent to Singapore .
With an improvement in education standards , more students will pursue their academic qualifications in Singapore , creating a chance to convert these visiting students to become local citizens which will therefore increase the tax base for the future .
And with a better communication and transportation infrastructure , Singapore will be a place where global companies will start investing and opening branches or offices .
This will then increase job opportunities for the people and also the country's income .
Both the above improvements will boost Singapore's income , allowing the government to use more money on various national issues , be it economic development or social problems , in this case , the aging society .
While the idea of improving education to ease the aging problem in the future is workable , there may still be a problem of individuals who will not be able to follow this plan .
As we are still dealing with a society , there will always be different people with different backgrounds , for example , the rich and educated versus the poor and illiterate .
But the illiterate will not stay illiterate always , if they put an effort to improve and are given a chance for good education , they can still develop into a group of productive Singaporeans .
This makes the 'unproductive Singaporeans' , who cannot take care of their elderly , a minority group of the whole society , therefore , subsidies for such families to take care of the elderly will still be minimal .
By allocating more funds to education and infrastructure , governments can ensure good development in the country , therefore , increasing the standard of living .
This will also lead to more educated and self-sufficient families , where minimal subsidies are needed to help a minority of the population , therefore a limited spending for the problem of the aged or an aging population .
We all know that the elderly have devoted all their intelligence , knowledge and strength for our society from the time of theirs .
So should we abandon these people when they are not as strong and perspicacious as they were before ?
Basically , it is the moral responsibility of our society to do all its best to support the elderly even at the expense of other areas of the country's development .
There is no denying the fact that each country has its own limited set budget , so it can not afford to spend too much on the elderly because it also has to spend on other areas of the country's development .
For examples , there are also many needy people like orphans , the disabled or unemployed that want to be subsidized by the government .
They are all feeble and vulnerable people .
It is very hard for them to earn enough money for their selves .
The fact is they cannot compete with others for easy jobs but also have high salaries .
Therefore , it would be huge financial burden for their relatives to subsidize them .
Unless the government spends more money to support them and create more job opportunities for them , they will be left to fend for themselves and lead to very sad hires .
However , we should consider who should be given priority and deserve national budget the most .
The elderly usually do not have enough strength to do manual labor whereas mental work requires perspicacity and concentration that they cannot compete with other potential young candidates .
For examples , in Singapore , I have seen that almost all people who do cleaning work are the elderly .
Nevertheless , they look not strong enough to do such manual work , but they still have to do , to earn for their own livings .
Obviously , old people have fewer chances to work for their own living compared with other needy people who still have healthy physical body .
What is more , the elderly should be respected and dedicated for their contributions in the days of youth .
What we have today is partially an inheritance from previous generations .
The elderly once were hard working not only in raising children but also in devoting their strength , intelligence for a better society like today .
Now when they are old , they cannot continue to do productive work , so it is our society's responsibility to support them .
Although there is a limit to national budget and the government has to balance spending in different areas for the country's development , subsidy for the elderly should not be cut .
If each person has a sense of responsibility towards increasing the size of today's economy and tax base , then it will be not a big problem for us to spend more money on the aged .
The Ease Of The Aging Process : Through Research & Development and Government Policies
During the post World War 2  era  , there was a significant increase in the fertility rate in all parts of the world .
For example , the fertility rate in the United States of America were at an all time high which was around the range of 3 .0 - 3 .5  Hence , the name "baby boomers" was derived from increase in fertility rate globally after the World War 2 .
Fast forward 53 years later , the baby boomer generation is moving from the middle age into the senior years , issues regarding the aging process started popping up like mushrooms after the rain .
Singapore , one of the most developed countries in the South East Asian region has not taken this issue lightly .
According to the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , the elder  population in Singapore is at 8 .6%  and it is expected to grow to 18 .7% by the year of 2030  .
.
Through the research and development and social policies formed by the government , it is able to help ease the aging process of the aging population .
Other than the CPF scheme , a scheme for the aged named Eldershield was created to help ease the aged who suffer from disabilities .
The Eldershield scheme works like an insurance whereby it provides basic financial protection on a monthly basis for the aged .
The Housing Development Board has also created policies to cater for the aged such as "Granny Homes" and Lease Buy Back Scheme .
"Granny Homes" are studio apartments equipped with elder-friendly features such as non-slip toilet tiles and grab poles  .
"Granny Homes" is an economical choice for the aged when they are living alone as the "Granny Homes" are small and easy to be upkeep compared to a normal HDB flat .
In addition to that , the aged would be living in the community of people in their age group , and this provides a good platform for the aged to socialize with others .
As for the Lease Buy Back Scheme , it provides an additional option for the low income elderly Singaporeans in a 3 room or smaller flats to cash out part of the money locked up in their HDB flats for their daily expenses  .
As most elderly stay alone these days and not supported by their families , this scheme would come in handy for them especially when they do not have a stable financial security .
This two schemes created by the government would greatly relief the burden of healthcare cost for the aged and it would definitely benefit the aged .
In a nutshell , easing the aging process just doesn't stop here with our current findings in the medical sector as well as the others and policies created by the government for the aged .
We , as humans should also play a part by taking care of our well beings than be dependent on others for support .
At this moment in time , research and development still continues on to discover new findings and new medical interventions to help ease the aging process and also improve the quality of healthcare for the aged .
The government are also looking into better ways and alternatives to provide the baby boomer generation a more secure environment with lower financial burden , better health care and also , the employability of the aged .
Nowadays , nobody can deny that aging population is becoming one of the most serious problems to developed countries , including Singapore .
Recent researches have shown that the proportion of the country's residents aged 65 and above can reach the number of 18 .7% in the next 20 years .
Population aging has become a cause of concern in the realm of financial issue to the government .
It seems inevitable that we must spend more on the aged .
But what are we getting for all that money ?
Should we limit the public spending on the aged so that the money can be inverted to other areas of the country's development ?
Answers to these questions are not easy to find .
However , in my opinion , the public spending could be more productive if the government knows how to control the money spent on the aged and also how to invest for other areas of development .
Among several public spending on the aged , such as medical subsidies , public infrastructure , pension schemes , and financial aids , healthcare must be considered the most important sector .
As the healthcare costs now are getting more and more expensive , consequently , it becomes harder and harder for old poor people to fulfill their payment for the hospitals .
Based on the situation , some claim that government should automatically spend more and more on the aged , who deserve to be helped .
However , the national budget will come under pressure when growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer young persons , which leads to the question that "Can we really afford so much health care for aging population , or are we heading toward a healthcare crisis in the near future ?"
Once again , the answer is not easy to find .
Nevertheless , the budget for healthcare is not infinite , so , the government and policy makers must decide at which extent they would give healthcare cost to an individual , depending on his own financial capacity .
The government needs to know how to set limits on the healthcare budget for the elderly .
The second reason is that public spending is not the only solution to the problem of aging population .
Researchers and policy makers have made a lot of suggestions and strategies to help buffet the negative impact of aging population on our society .
Some of them are encouraging later retirement , raising more productive children , encouraging the elderly and their families to take more responsibility for their health , etc .
Therefore , instead of spending too much money on the aged , the government can think about realize some of these planning policies , or other possible policies to solve the problem .
Last but not least , Singapore must spend money on a large numbers of other essential areas of development , such as education , infrastructure , defense , investments . . .
These areas of development are all the key things that a country needs in order to become a developed one .
Without a good education system , there will not be a well-educated intellectual generation for the country .
Without good infrastructure , there will not be sufficient facility for the country to develop .
Without a good defense system , people will live in the danger of terrorism as well as of being invaded .
Therefore , these areas of development must be well invested .
Moreover , when all of these areas are well invested enough to fulfill all the requirements , the living standard of Singaporeans will increase , consequently , the aged will received more help and budget from the society , or they even earn more money to support themselves too .
In conclusion , Singapore , as well as many Europeans and North American countries , is facing the problem of aging population .
If we do not put enough effort to solve the problem right now , it will be a really big issue in the future .
As the problem is controversial and there are a lot of different opinions surrounding it , the government and the policy makers must know how to make the right decision to point out the best solution for the country .
The most essential thing is to think out of the box .
We always need to consider so many factors that affect our decision , such as do we have enough money to afford all the healthcare cost , or are there any other areas of the nation's development that really need our investment .
Therefore , setting limits on the public spending on the aged , I think , is a much better and wiser choice .
Demographic changes have recently caused many controversial issues .
Among these , the increasing number of aged people as well as the decrease in fertility rate as a new way of living is such a challenge that the world has to face in the next decades .
It is definitely not out of public concerns , especially in developed countries like Germany or Japan , where the aged population will make up a large proportion soon .
Along with modernized society , the elderly is receiving more and more supports from the government , which is a strategy in social welfare development .
Ironically , these policies not only bring benefits for the old people but also partly have a negative impact upon the socioeconomic development of the country .
In other words , the public expenditures on the aged have created barriers which limit the improvement of other fields .
Therefore , this spending should be reconsidered carefully to avoid financial shortage on other areas of the country's development .
As part of the effort to enhance the social welfare , a lot of schemes have been adopted and operated in recent years for the sake of the old population .
Truthfully , these policies are significantly beneficial to senior citizens especially with respect to health , a problem induced by the physical aging process .
Some intermediate and long-term care services like community hospitals , home medical or home nursing services and public subsidies in Singapore are perhaps good examples for supports from the government .
Some statistics have showed that the government expenditure on community development , youth and sports went up by about 57% from 2005 to 2008 while that on health rose dramatically by 128% .
In reality , these below schemes certainly accounted for not a small scale in the increased public spending .
Thus , the growth in number of projects unconsciously puts heavier pressure on the government budget , which consequently creates an imbalance in expenses of different domains .
This spending , however , is likely to increase more and more in the next years .
Also , it is not all the government's duties to take care of the elderly .
Firstly , from the personal point , the aged have to be responsible for themselves .
When they are still in the working age , they need to provide in advance for their lives after retirement .
Saving and investing more of their income , for instance , are some solutions to prepare for their old age .
Secondly , from the social point , it is also the filial obligation of the children to take care of their parents when they get old .
This will obviously help to reduce the expenditures by sharing the dependency burden between the government and its citizens .
The most appropriate reason why the government should limit spending on senior citizens is that it will constrain other fields from taking advantage of government budget .
Once the supports for them make up too much of the budget , then other spheres cannot receive adequate financial assistance .
Take education for example .
Compared with the rise in health and community development , youth , sports expenditure as mentioned below , the public investment in such a strategic scheme like education in Singapore between 2005 and 2008 has a tendency to decrease from 994 to 856 million dollars  .
There are other domains such as industry , education , transportation , information technology which also play an important role in building a solid infrastructure for the nation's development as well as require proper concerns from officials .
However , with a limited budget , government is not capable of covering all expenses .
To a certain extent , restriction on dependency spending is reasonable and necessary so that the reduced money can be used to expand many other crucial areas .
Thus , it will contribute more to the social progress than the aged's life improvement itself .
In short , the government and policy makers had better come to a reasonable decision on all projects .
In the face of limited budget , the public spending , however , should give priorities to necessary schemes and identify which cost can be reduced in order to make the best choice .
Clearly , they can cut down on excessive supports for the elderly because there are many other ways that may help sharing the budget burden .
Thus , the money saved can be transferred to more urgent and practical policies that also contribute to the nation's strength and potential .

Government Development Expenditure .
from August 13 , 2009 from {w .singstat .gov .sg/stats/themes/economy/pubfin .html}
According to the United Nations , 1 in every 5 person throughout the world would be aged 60 years or older by the year 2050 .
In the more developed regions , the number of persons aged over 60 would increase by 70% from 231 million in 2000 to395 million in 2050 .
These alarming statistics would bring about economic and societal problems to many developed countries .
One of such is that the government might need to channel more revenue to meet the demands of the elderly group .
In the long-term run , this can lead to shrinkage in the Gross Domestic Product  of the country or even affect the other sectors of development .
To prevent such situations from happening , different governments in the developed nations have come up with policies to confront the challenges of an aging population .
However , these social policies that have been implemented are not effective in easing the aging process as they do not fully cater to the demands of their targeted group .
Firstly , the means-testing policy fails to protect every citizen that requires public funding in practical realities .
In the context of Singapore , the means-testing system carried out in nursing homes assesses the financial status of the entire family .
Under this system , if the family has a high income level , the government would provide lower subsidies to the patient .
However , this is not a fair assessment because there are elderly patients that are being abandoned by their children .
The elderly patient would not be able to afford the bills .
The flaws in the execution of the mean-testing system do not only occur in Singapore .
In Australia , even though the means-testing system is deemed as an important way to help the government to redistribute the money to those who are in need , it fails to protect all the elderly .
This is because some of them might find means testing humiliating as it forces people to declare themselves in poverty .
These examples go to show that the means-testing policy has not fully catered to the demands of their targeted group .
Secondly , population growth policies do not meet the demands of married couples .
In view of the graying population , many developed nations have come up with policies to encourage childbirth .
In the case of Japan , the government introduced its Tokyo Plus One Policy to attract married couples to give birth to more babies .
The policy included measures such as increasing the number of nurseries and making new changes in the child welfare law .
Despite the government's effort in promoting childbirth , the total fertility rate of Japan remains low .
In addition , there are many considerations that married couples have when it comes to childbirth .
One of these considerations for couples is the need to strike a balance between family and work life when a new member is added into their family .
These obstacles show that population growth policies are not effective in meeting the demands of married couples .
Lastly , the policy to rise retirement age in developed nations does not serve as a long-term solution in meeting the needs of the elderly .
In Singapore , the government intends to rise the retirement age of the working group to 62 so that the elderly can continue to support themselves financially .
However , it is undeniable that age discrimination is still evident in work places .
An employer would prefer to hire a young adult as compared to an elderly as they can contribute to the company for a longer period of time .
Some might disagree that even though they cannot compete with the younger generation for jobs , the government does organize job fairs to help elderly seek jobs .
However , although these job fairs provide more working opportunities for the elderly , the success of such job fairs is largely dependent on the receptiveness of the elderly's expectations to the new job scope .
Furthermore , there should be a maximum cap to the increment on retirement age as we also need to consider the physical capabilities of the elderly .
All these obstacles show that raising retirement age does not address well to the concerns of an elderly .
Therefore , it is clear that social policies do not always meet the needs of its catered groups .
No matter how well a social policy is constructed , there is still loopholes that are often neglected by policy-makers .
This shows that much more can be done to improve the different kinds of policies .
Furthermore , it is important to note that social policies should be flexible so that they can make suitable changes to meet the demands of the society at different points of time .
Once the demands are being met , the route to easing an aging population would be much more smooth-sailing than it would have been thought .
It is common to see a society aging with the elderly population rising rapidly in the recent years .
Although society has a moral obligation to do all that it can to help the elderly , there are still limits to the expenses of the government to help the aged .
When there are limited resources , scarcity is unavoidable which lead to a situation where not everyone will benefit and there will be those who are in need who will be left out .
When policies are constraints by a budget it aim to have lesser cost that causes most strategies taken are unworkable and unpractical after they are introduce the public .
To minimize or eliminate the occurrence of this phenomenon there should not be a limit to government spending on the elderly .
One of the examples is the government plan to extent the working lifespan of the elderly .
However , this is not a practicable and long-term solution to the problem .
Firstly , to what limit should the government delay their retirement ?
A year or two or more ?
With every year passes by , they are facing the limitations of their physical and mental strength .
Physical loss in sight , hearing , mobility , continence are very common .
They also have to face the fact that they are unable to keep up with the workload they used to handle in the young old days even if they wanted to .
Although delaying retirement can help the elderly to accumulate some wealth , reality speaks differently when it comes to elderly people .
No matter how experienced or skilled an elderly is , he or she will always be in a disadvantage situation compare to those who are younger , more energetic and most importantly , more productive than them .
Therefore , spending on the elderly should not be limited to be able to support them .
Besides that , what did the Singapore government did was introduced the Baby Bonus schemes to the public with the objective of encouraging the public to have more children .
It is important , as with more youth , it will increase the productivity of the country as well as spreading the cost of development over a large population .
However , this scheme did not work as well as predicted even though the government has put efforts in promoting it .
The scheme netted only a gain in 129 citizen births last year in 2008 compared to 2003 .
Such scheme is unpractical even it may work in the long run .
The reason is that not everyone is willing to have a baby just to get the benefit from the scheme .
Having a baby is a long-term responsibility and burden not many are willing and prepared to take .
Therefore , resources used in it should have diverted directly to help the elderly to be able to cope with their problems immediately .
If we spend less on the elderly , children will have the filial obligation to take care of the elderly .
This may sound good and interesting but with the current economic status , there is less economic growth , tougher choices needed to be made to cope with the demand of the society .
Even if the economic is improving , the expenses of the elderly will just keep on getting higher , it seem to only benefit the government and not the elderly .
Furthermore , it will heavily burden those who have an elderly at home and such stress leads many of them to abandon their elderly .
Besides that , there are still a segment of people that have no job , no saving and even don't have a family that we overlook .
If expenditures on the aged were cut off how would we expect them to be able to pay for their living and supposedly it is the obligation of the government to provide shelter to these people .
As such , it is important for the government to spend more to help these people .
Although there are other areas such as education , infrastructure and defense that require our attention , it is also of equal important for us to have the same concern for the elderly .
These people are the one that have contributed themselves to the development of the country in the past .
It is their right to enjoy the privilege provided by the government after their retirement .
As such , my point of view is that the spending on the aged should not be limited .
If the expenditure towards the elderly is limited , many will left in a lurch and thus raise rage among the elderly .
Old age is a reality that we all have to face one day .
The tremendous improvement in nutrition and medication has led to life expectancy in the developed world to increase significantly .
As the elderly population soars , the demographic changes that occur will cause increased public spending on the elderly in different fields such as medical care and public infrastructures .
Thus , many national budgets and economies will come under pressure as growing numbers of elderly people outnumbered the number of younger people .
Despite all that , public spending on the elderly should not be limited and society has the moral obligation and practical to assist them in all aspect .
The elders had contributed much to the country development and public expenditure for the elderly should not be limited .
It is undeniable that the elderly have made immense contributions to the country and their sacrifices create the relative social and economics comfort we enjoy now .
The elderly have become bright example for the younger generation in various domains .
Many of them have made valuable contribution to the country in different fields such as political arena , science and technology field , economics activities and culture as well .
On top of that , most importantly , they had contributed to the nation by imparting their knowledge and experience with the younger generation .
For instance , over the years , the elderly have helped to build up the economy of Singapore by imparting several policies and they have worked hard in securing and maintaining the stability of the country .

Although many may agree that public spending on the elderly should be limited , this will however creates an impact to the society and increases societal cost .
The limitation in public spending on the elderly may cause family members and individuals shoulder a bigger responsibility in taking care of the elderly .
In addition , some of those cost on the elderly will end up getting shifted back to the public sector through less direct and more expensive means .
For example , the rising cost of health spending for the elderly has taken its toll on them and many could not afford that .
Thus , family members may need to fork out their own money to support their elderly parents .
Consequently , conflict and argument among family members may occur in this matter .
Also , many other issues related to housing and transportation cannot be resolved .
Families and local communities will have to deal with that by restructuring welfare programmes .
Furthermore , the limitation in public expenditure on the elderly people will also affect the level of physical , mental and emotional well-being of an elderly person .
With the decrease in public spending on the elderly , many elderly will come under pressure as they will have less financial dependency on others .
Subsidies on health care and treatment at community hospitals and nursing homes for the elderly for instance will be cut off hence leaving them to be self-supporting .
All this pressure occur will make them suffer from mental illness as their children do not look after them in old age .
For most of the older people , family members are the major source of social and financial support .
Without that , the elderly may start and spend time reflecting their past , remembering disappointment and that stage of life may turn into a time of despair and loneliness , with only little positive meaning in life .
All this will eventually lead to suicide and depression among the elderly .
On the whole , the government and society should support public spending for the elderly because the aged have in the past contributed to society and have made Singapore what it is today .
The elders should benefit from the government , family and community care in all aspects to help them to ease their burden after what they have done for us over the years .
The public spending on elderly constitutes a safety net for them and all parties should work hand in hand to resolve this matter .

The aging population has of late become a subject for discussion because the growing of an aging population has brought about serious health issues and social problems in the developed nations .
National budget will also come under pressure as growing number of elderly supported by relatively fewer younger people .
Thus , to deal with such challenges , researches and developments or policies have been brought out to help the elderly .
The development in the field of economics has surprisingly contributed in easing the aging population .
Researchers believe that the critical challenge of an aging society is not only about how to accommodate the older population , but is about how to ensure the productivity of future workers , regardless of age .
Thus , many have been done by the government in encouraging the economic growth in our country in order to decrease the problems that may arise from the aging process .
To encourage the economic growth of our country , our government has worked hard in developing the tourism industry in our country .
Tourism in our country had successfully created a wide range of job opportunities for our citizens , such as tour guide , airline staff , drivers , hoteliers , caterers and interpreters .
The lower barrier to elder employment which is set by the government has allowed employers to take older workers to work in the career mentioned above .
Thus , more people have the opportunity to work .
The rate of unemployment will decrease .
People can work longer , accumulate more wealth and increase the citizens' savings .
At the same time , poverty rate can be decreased .
People can also afford to look after their elderly .
After retirement , the elderly can also use the money that they have earned without depending on their families .
By improving the business condition , our country also undergo a dramatically climb of the economics .
This creates a bigger business volume for our local traders .
Thus , taxes which are collected increase and the income of our country also rises .
The money which is earned is being used in the development of medical technology to help the human being to cure the incurable , such as heart attack , tuberculosis , cornea impairment and cataract .
There are also medical facilities and systems which are being introduced lately , such as laser therapy , dialysis machines and microsurgery .
With all these modern technology , human life can be extended and people can live healthier .
The elderly can be stronger and less of them will be suffering from physical illnesses , such as stroke , diabetes , cancer and high blood pressure .
Employers who claim that elderly are ability and mobility restricted will also no longer having any excuse to reject elderly who wish to work in their organization .
The government has done hard in creating opportunities for the foreign investment to encourage foreign investment .
This has increased the foreign currency exchange and stopped the outflow of our local currency and hence , strengthened the value of our money .
As a result , there is a significant growth of economics in our country that increases the income of our country .
The income that our country has earned is then being spent on the welfare of the elderly .
The government has used the money to build more community hospital and nursing homes which are well-equipped with the elderly-friendly facilities .
They also provide a range of services to meet the needs of elderly , such as the medical care , nursing care , physiotherapy , dietary services and dental care .
The elderly can be admitted into the community hospitals or nursing home if they need daily skilled nursing care or assistance in activities of daily living if they have no caregiver to look after them at home .
Society has fewer choices on how to care for those who are least able to care for themselves when there is only little economic growth .
On the other hand , there will be more choices and fewer people in need when there is a sufficient economic growth .
The growth of the economy can solved many problems which arise from the aging population .
Abandoned and unmarried old people can stand on their own feet without relying on others .
Excuses such as high cost of living makes it hard for working adults to pay for their elderly living expenses will not exist too .
Obviously , efforts that the government put in developing the economics of our country have resulted a successfully growth and inevitably , this has contributed in easing and solving the problems of aging population .
However , critics argued that by limiting the amount spent on the aged and diverting the resources to other areas of the country's development , the essential needs of the elderly would be neglected .
One such example is the healthcare need of the elderly .
It would hardly be a surprise that healthcare cost for the elderly would continue to escalate in the decades ahead .
With the never-ending introduction of new medical technologies and the seriousness of prolonged illnesses associated with old age , medical treatments for the elderly would be increasingly expensive .
The limiting of the public spending on the aged would thereby shift more of this healthcare costs to the individuals , causing the elderly to shoulder heavier financial burden .
The elderly would therefore be at the suffering end .

Singapore faces 'silver tsunami' .

While this may indeed happen , the situation can still be remedied .
Additional profits reaped from the investment in other areas of the country's development could in turn contribute to the public spending significantly .
In fact , it is inevitable for the government to divert money to the other areas of development as aging population has affected these areas significantly .
One considerable implication of aging population is its possible impact on the country's future macro-economic performance  .
As the baby boomers , the leading edge of the coming age wave , begin to move out of the workforce , the country will face the problem of a shrinking workforce .
In Singapore , there are currently 8 .5 economically active persons to support one elderly .
By 2030 , the labour-dependency ratio will drastically drop to only 3 .5 persons supporting one elderly  .
This shrinking workforce may signal the advent of less productive workforce and financial strain on the members of the workforce as they need to produce adequate amount of outputs to support the burgeoning elderly population  .
On top of that , a shrinking and less productive workforce could have an adverse impact on the country's economic growth .
Therefore , the government should divert more resources such as increased investments in human capital to improve , or at least sustain , the productivity of the workforce and the country's economic growth .
With sufficient economic growth , it would bring prosperity to the country and in turn benefit the society as a whole .
The additional profits reaped from this investment may in turn regenerate to the public funds to help the needy ones , including the elderly .
Hence , the investments in other areas of the country's development would not be at expense of the needs of the elderly; in actual fact , it could create a win-win situation .
In addition , limiting the public spending on the aged and diverting resources to other areas may not necessarily mean that the government is neglecting the needs of the elderly .
Government is still taking care of the aged from various aspects .
One aspect is the formulating of policies with the elderly in mind .
For instance , the Singapore government has passed the Maintenance of Parents Act to allow elderly parents to file lawsuit against their children for financial support  .
This legislation would help to discourage adult children from shirking their responsibility of looking after their aged parents .
In addition , the government has long enforced individual savings through the mandatory CPF , propelling the population to save for their old age  .
This approach taken by the government would enable the individuals to accumulate wealth , and hence depend lesser on families and government financially in their twilight years .
Through these various aspects , it therefore shows that governments have taken a more well-rounded approach in taking care of the needs of the elderly; and that public spending on the aged is not and should not be used as a single depiction of how governments can express their concerns towards the elderly .
In a nutshell , limiting the public spending on the aged and diverting resources to other areas of the country's development do not necessarily mean that the government is neglecting the needs of the aged .
One should note that setting limits on the public spending on the aged is to reduce the over-dependency of the aged on the government while diverting resources to other areas of development is to allow the country to prosper and sequentially benefit the whole community , which includes the aged .
It is through this approach , pressing issues such as economic implications of aging population can be resolved and at the same time , more revenue can be generated to help the needy ones that comprise the elderly as well .

Public spending is defined as the amount of funding the government channels into the society from the monies it collects from the society .
This fund is generated through various economic activities , usually in the form of taxation .
The debate often revolves round how the government utilizes this fund , which is contributed by the citizens .
The total amount collected from an economy tends to be more or less fixed in the short term .
Therefore , if one group of people gets more , the others would get lesser .
Thus , by limiting the spending on the aged , it would mean that other sectors of the society would get more than before .
This essay will discuss on the limit that should be imposed to the amount of funds that should be budgeted for spending on the aged that would constitute as a fair distribution of government resources .
This is due to the fact that the aged is not the only dependent group in society .
If there is a tendency to spend more than necessary on the aged; other sectors of the economy might find that they lack finances to function normally .
Some might say that it is immoral to deprive the aged of the help they need .
They tend to support this argument by considering the contributions made by the aged during their hey-days and the level of their dependency in this season of their lives .
However , this school of thought focuses on only one aspect of the issues of society .
There is no doubt that some of the aged need helps .
However , they are not the only dependent group .
A country is likely to also include the poor , the uneducated , the physically disabled , the intellectually underdeveloped , and many others who require constant monetary aid from the government .
Thus , it can almost be called an ill-informed decision when one claims that the government should take care of the aged without limits .
There is no doubt that we should ensure that the aged could age with dignity .
However , not only for the aged , other citizens who are dependent on the government's help should also have the right to live with dignity too .
Thus , while the government educates the aged about their rights and campaigns about health maintenance methods , the other sectors of society in need of help should not be left out .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that other citizens of the country who are in need can also receive aid .
In conclusion , caring for the elderly is only right and necessary .
However , it should be within limits so that other parts of society would not be deprived of the help that is necessary for current support and future development .
Everyone is dependent on government aid varying degrees .
A good balance must be struck to ensure that as little people as possible are deprived of government support due to poor distribution of state monies .

This essay will discuss about the current political research and development that help to ease the aging process in the context of Singapore .
Aging process involves in physical , psychological and social changes of human being , often brings about deterioration of physical and mental health and loneliness .
These will bring about the increment of the nation's health expenses and pension fund .
To a large extent , aging process has been alleviated with the current social policies and implementation that emphasise individual responsibility , familial commitment and residual model policies- often known as government intervention .
The aging process is the process of becoming older .
More countries are facing the problems brought about by the aging process in the social as well as the economic aspects .
Over the years , the life expectancy of people increases due to factors such as better hygiene and improved healthcare .
Vaccination has prevented people from getting life-threatening diseases in the past , tuberculosis , which is no longer a big threat today .
Increased life expectancy coupled with decreasing birth rate as shown in some first world countries such as Japan , where the country's fertility rate was 1 .23 children per woman and 21% of the population 65 years old and older  , led to aging population .
Despite the perplexing issues arising in the process of aging , the government has put in much effort in developing policies and aiding in research to alleviate the negative impacts on society .
With an aging population , less people are able to work and the development of the economy is likely to decline .
Faruqee and Men  wrote that declining and aging population would cause the level of Global Domestic Product  to fall by twenty percent annually in the long run .
To increase the number of people in the workforce , countries such as Singapore encourages foreign talent to contribute to her economy .
The government also implemented baby bonus to encourage couples to procreate which would increase labour in the long run .
However , the Singapore government has increased the retirement age to 65 years old so that the elderly can continue to contribute to the economy .
Reuters  reported Singapore plans to raise the retirement age for citizens from 62 to 65 by year 2012 to account for the higher life expectancy of the population .
Despite increasing the retirement age to reduce the pressure on economic development , the children of the elderly might not be willing to let their parents continue working at such an old age .
Hence Japan invented robots to replace the lack of manpower due to the aging population .
These robots can also play a role in taking care of the elderly in the future for instance the wheelchairs that operates using buttons can replace humans pushing the wheelchair .
With technological advancements , pressure on economy can be eased .
Statistics   15 September 2009 . pand-statistics .html 
The next problem that arises in the elderly is their reduced mobility .
Elderly are less flexible and their movement is limited especially when they are facing a stage in life when they are more susceptible to suffer from movement-restricting diseases like osteoporosis .
Bone density of people would reduce overtime as the body is unable to absorb calcium with old age .
On the other hand , improved healthcare has also cured or prevented some of these diseases from plaguing the elderly , allowing them to enjoy active lifestyles .
Statistics shown that elderly still engage in exercises and the elderly who take part in tai chi are 47% less likely to fall down due to the increased balancing ability and confidence .
Moreover , this research also showed that exercises reduced hip fracture rate by 25% in postmenopausal women .
Despite some elderly being more active than others , most elderly find it difficult to move about .
Therefore the Housing Development Board  in Singapore has proposed to build lifts that stop at every storey in the Life Upgrading Programme .
In addition , more ramps and slopes are to be built to ensure the mobility of wheelchair bound elderly and also the physically disabled .
Public transport is also becoming more wheelchair-friendly with similar upgrades over the years .
Most elderly live alone as their children move out after they have a family .
The psychological needs of these elderly are not met especially when the problems of old age are catching up with them and they need someone to share their thoughts with .
To solve this problem , the government proposed to build more community hospitals .
These community hospitals focus more on the psychological well-being of the elderly rather than the physical one when they are recovering from an illness .
However , the elderly might prefer to stay at their own home or recuperate under the care of their children .
The government supports this move by issuing tax relief for sandwiched families , giving priority to these children who are buying new flats within close proximity to their elderly parents and giving subsidy to singles who buy a resale flat to live with their parents .
These singles would get $20 ,000 grant , up from the $11 ,000 subsidy .

Singapore to raise its retirement age to 65  .
Reuters .
The rise of aging population has become a major issue in most parts of the world .
According to the United Nations statistics , by 2050 , one of every five people will be 60 years old and above and the total number of people who are 60 years old and above is projected to be around 2 billion .
It is a cause for concern , as with more elderly present in the society , it will affect our economic and social development significantly .
Therefore , in most parts of the world , governments are coming up with policies and sponsoring researches to ease the aging process .
Aging process can be eased by increasing birth rates , increased workforce productivity and reduce the physical and psychological aspects of aging .
Currently , governments have helped to ease the aging process in terms of the country's economic development , social aspects and technological developments .
Moreover , with current technology advancement , we can tackle the physical barriers of aging problems such as low birth rate , increased productivity and reduced physical effects of aging , which may partly attribute to elderly low self-esteem .
With current technology , infertile couples can have a baby through In-Vitro Fertilization  .
In addition , in Japan , researchers and scientists have invented robots to replace older workers in order to increase the workforce .
With potent medicine , the aged are able to live longer and healthier .
Others may argue that the main cause of aging problem is actually longer life span itself .
However , it does prove that current technological advancement is indeed effective in prolonging the population's life span .
With longer life span , people can continue to contribute to society by imparting their knowledge and skills to the next generation .
By doing so , the aged will be more appreciated by the public and also it does help to improve the country's economy with an increased workforce .
Therefore , having longer life span does help to ease aging process .
Hence , technological advancement does help to ease the economic , social and physical aspects of aging process .

Some critics argue that limitation to public spending on aged will become a financial burden to low-income families .
Their low wages are only sufficient to afford their household expenses and children school fees .
As prices are rising acutely , family members will face difficulties to support their elder parents .
However , low-income families can still obtain financial aid from government despite limitation to public spending on aged .
Allowances and incentives are available for the needy .
Moreover , there is a tendency shows that elders themselves decide to have a longer working lives .
Although they reach the retirement age , they decide to continue working and they will be able to support themselves in the twilight years .
For example , Japanese usually continue working until 70-year-old .They will be able to ensure financially secure by themselves instead of depending on their family .
In conclusion , limitation to public spending on aged and diversion of money to other areas of development should be implemented .
Money diverted into business area will able to stimulate economic growth .
In addition , children are at disadvantages because too much money is spent on elderly .
Despite limitation to public spending on aged , the real needy will still able to obtain financial aid .
The consequences resulted by unlimited increase in public spending will become a financial burden to a country in long run .

Singapore's life expectancy at birth for males is 78 .4 , for females is 83 .2  .
Total fertility rate per female is only 1 .28 .
These statistics explain why Singapore is no doubt one of the fastest aging populations in Asia .
The problems associated with aging process can be categorized into five aspects , namely economics decline , mental agility , health , emotional and social problem .
Among all , economics and social policy aspects are widely discussed in the society .
Although it is impossible to increase the fertility rate in the short run , the problems of aging process is still alleviated by research and effective developments and policies .
Singapore social service sector have been taking care for elderly with current housing , healthcare and job support policies .
HDB encourage child live in close proximity with their parents so that child can take care of parents during emergency .
Under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme in 2008 , single Singaporeans aged 35 and above are able to apply for higher CPF grant of $20 ,000 if they want to purchase HDB resale flats to live with their parents  .
Beside , upgrading of housing lift on every floor would make elderly life easier .
The Healthcare 3Ms , Medicare , MediShield and Medifund also provide subsidies for elderly .
In order to benefit whose who needs help more , subsidy for hospitalization in public hospital has been adjusted so that 60 percent of workers are able to enjoy full subsidy for type C and B2 wards whereas those have higher earning power will receive substantial subsidies for both C and B2 class wards  .
NTUC , WDA and employers have worked on the Job Re-creation Programme  to recreate and redesign jobs targeting older workers and provide training opportunities for them to take up new job openings .
Besides , SPUR focus on retraining for older workers whereas ADVANTAGE !
encourages businesses to employ older workers .
Opponents of this position will argue that healthcare cost is still the main problem for aging population .
Medisave account may not be sufficient for many Singaporeans once they need to pay the medical bills for their parents , spouse and children .
Although most of the Singaporean have to pay for not only their own medical bills , there are other subsidy schemes which may lesser their financial burden .
Eldershield is designed for elderly who need long-term care or cannot afford the expenses on severe disability .
Elderly will receive monthly cash payout therefore their children's Medisave account can use to pay for their own bill .
Other than that , Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly  and Primary Care Partnership  are other subsidy schemes available .
To summarize , government encourage later retirement in order to reduce elderly dependency and implement social policy such as subsidy on housing medical fee .
At the same time , more and more facilities are designed to meet the needs of elderly and disability .
Therefore , current research and policies are able to cater most of the needs of Singaporean to prepare for aging problem .
Also , individual have to keep fit to reduce the probability of getting ill in order to avoid expensive medical bill at older age .
Reducing elder dependency is one way in which governments can take into consideration in tackling the worrying phenomenon of a greying population .
One possible strategy is to enhance the opportunity of elderly employment .
In the past , the elderly are often labelled as slow and inefficient .
However in recent times , such stereotypes have been shelved away as the younger generations learn to embrace the wealth of experience the elderly share , thus increasing the likelihood for elder employment .
In Singapore , the ADVANTAGE !
Scheme  is an initiation to help employers financially in hiring and retaining older workers .
This will open up more opportunities for the elderly to support themselves without burdening the tax-payers .
It also increases the labour force and tax revenue .
Therefore the elderly should not be deprived of employment by providing more incentives for employers to attract such workers and help for those seeking employment opportunities .
As such , the exchange of experience and skills will only benefit the workforce and hence reduce the effects of a greying population .
Another problem which the older generation may face is social discrimination .
Mental and physical health will inevitably deteriorate as one ages .
Such liability will only discourage the older ones and thus create an invisible segregation between the strong and the weak .
Thankfully in Singapore , such issues have been ironed out and certain measures have been carefully implemented .
Under the Main Upgrading Project  , grab- bars in the bathroom and non-slip floor tiles have been installed in upgraded sold flats .
Recently , recreational facilities such as exercise corners and elder-care centres have also been built in the neighbourhood to provide social interaction opportunities among the community .
Also , the Housing Development Board  has introduced Married Child Priority Scheme  to grant privileges to married children to live near or together with their parents .
These policies would greatly foster ties and improve communication between the young and old , in hope to eliminate the social discrimination and bolster the well being of the elderly .
On the contrary , as much as solutions are sought to reduce the effects of an ageing population , the rate of replacing the world's population is not desirable .
According to the Economist , the fertility rate in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development fell sharply from an average of 3 .2 children per female in 1960 to 1 .6 in 2009 , which is below the recommended replacement level of 2 .1  .
Women now are more career-proactive and hence delay marriages and family formations .
Additionally , the number of children in a family has been limited to two due to individual family's preference and financial ability .
However , there are many ways in which governments can compensate the falling birth rate .
Longer paid maternity leave , more child- care leave and greater incentives for working mothers are some possible corrections to the problem .
In France , such policies were implemented and were rewarded with a near replacement fertility rate  .
Although this may increase the government's expenditure , it is a necessary investment for the better future of the country .
For many decades , the world has been taking a lot of beatings .
From economic crisis in 1997 to uncontrolled viral spread such as H1N1 pandemic in 2008 , the world survived all these obstacles .
On hand , the repercussions of an ageing population are tirelessly being subdued by various helpful and effective solutions .
These are proved successful in certain countries but with a necessary cost .
Results may seem moderate and unprogressive .
Nonetheless with many support in place , the future of world may not be as bleak as before .
Aging is a difficult process as the elderly are more incline to get sick because of lower immune system and having to recuperate longer would be financially draining .
They also face difficulties in finding and retaining jobs .
Under the seniority based-wage system , it's more expensive to hire older workers and along with the perception that older workers are inefficient , it resulted in low employment rate among the elderly  .
However , policies on the aged in Singapore have significantly help to reduce the problems they faced .
In recent years , the Ministry of Manpower have been working closely with its tripartite partners to enhance employability of the older workers  .
One of the schemes that were developed was the 'Advantage !
Scheme' .
In this scheme , companies are given a grant up to $400 ,000 to encourage them to retain its mature workers .
Coming in 2012 , the government will enact the re-employment legislation to enable elderly to work beyond the retirement age of 62  .
This is preferred than increasing the retirement age because a higher retirement age might cause older workers to be less employable as they are no longer cost competitive and resulting of them being layoff even before they are 62  .
With re- employment , employers can provide jobs to their mature workers and also offer them a different job position with different salary and terms .
Here , both employer and employees can negotiate the terms and companies can remain competitive by adjusting the wages and benefits according to the value of the job .
In terms of healthcare , the government have come out with a few financial assistance schemes to ensure that the citizens are able to afford healthcare and are prepared during their old age .
Other than the basic healthcare financing schemes like Medisave , Medishield and Medifund , the government had come out with another scheme called 'Elder Scheme' .
This is an insurance scheme where those eligible pay premiums and they can claim benefits at any age of their life and receive monthly cash payout up to 72 months .
This would help support them should one day they stop working  .
Other than financial schemes , the government also provide subsidies for patients who require intermediate and long term care .
The subsidies given could be as much as 75% of the total bills depending on the family income and it's extended to community hospitals  .
This is beneficial as sick elderly require long term care and they might choose to recuperate at community hospitals .
However , even with all of these policies and subsidies , there is no guarantee that the elderly is able to pay for all of their living expenses .
Even though they have worked for many years , they might have little or no savings because they might not know how to manage their money .
It's essential that they learn how to not only manage their wealth but also expand it so that when they choose to stop working , they would have enough money to pay for their necessities and have enough for any unexpected expenses .
To ensure that its citizen will be financially prepared when they reach their retirement age , the Central Provident Fund Board  have came out with a learning portal called 'Retirement Ready @ my cpf' to help citizens to plan for their retirement  .
Here they show a step-by-step process on how to achieve the desired retirement lifestyle a person wants .
They teach from how to do basic budgeting to doing investments .
This is one of many ways to ensure that Singapore citizens will live a better life when they get older .
Clearly the government and its related agencies have been working hard to help easing the aging process through many of its policies .
Through it , the elderly not only will be able to continue working , they also need not worry much on their health expenses .
These policies along with early retirement planning would help to ensure that the elderly will be economically independent and lead a better life .
Singapore is facing a shift in distribution of population towards greater ages , where the median age of population faces an increase , and a decline in fertility rates , resulting in a rise in the number of elderly in Singapore .
Aging impacts a person's well being in many ways , with both psychological and physical changes , including chronic diseases associated with aging .
The labour age composition has thus shift towards the older workers , where implications towards the competitiveness of Singapore's economy will occur , especially if older workers do not make significant contribution to the productivity growth in the economy  .
Hence more support and care for the aged should be provided which in turn will pose a strain to the younger generation .
As of 2008 , '8 .4 economically active persons are supporting one elderly'  and 'by 2030 , only 3 .5 persons will be supporting one elderly'  .
This has reflected the importance for each individual to have the ability to support themselves through their golden years .
In order to do so , Singapore has introduced policies that worked to ease the aging process .
Facing high cost of living , Singapore has moved up from the 13th position in 2008 to the 10th in 2009 , in the worldwide cost of living ranking  , especially for the medical cost , where each household spend an increasing amount of expenditure in health care , with 3 .3% in 1998 to 5 .1% in 2003  , and is expected to further increase in the future years , with more aged citizens in Singapore .
Hence , Singapore has introduced policies to ease healthcare financing , such as Medisave , Medishield , Medifund , and Eldershield  .
Singaporeans have recognized the need to prepare for aging in terms of escalating medical costs , thus net withdrawal of Medisave scheme , including Eldershield , has dropped to 213 .6 million in 2009 , and Medishield scheme of 62 .5 million  .
A drop in withdrawal of healthcare schemes has thus reflected that more Singaporeans have felt the need for such policies .
Singapore has not only faced with aging population resulted from low fertility rates , but also longer life expectancy for individuals .
With rising life expectancy , given only 2 .5% of annual interest in the Central Provident Fund  , and with most funds in the CPF used to fund housing or tertiary education , the CPF figure left is no longer sufficient to last through retirement  .
"The best way for people to adjust to longer life spans is to continue working for as long as they can"  , as working provides a source of income , more savings can thus be build up .
Increasing the retirement age is insufficient to encourage individuals to work longer , hence the Re-employment policy will be enact in 2012 .
In order to ensure that older workers are not at disadvantage , Singapore established schemes such as smaller CPF contributions to the aged  , as well as the Advantage !
Scheme introduced in 2005  to lighten the cost of hiring the aged as well as to move away from the seniority-wage system and provide assistance in funding to re-employ mature workers .
And as of 2005 , 1 ,142 companies have benefited from this scheme .
In addition , retraining programmes were also introduced; an example would be 'Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience '  .
Through amelioration and subsidizing of healthcare and public facilities the process of aging population has been eased .
Through amelioration and subsidizing of healthcare and public facilities the process of aging population has been eased .
Over the last 5 years , Singapore government health expenditure for the citizens has increased from $1 .53 billion in year 2002 , to $1 .93 billion in year 2006 which is an average growth rate of 6% per annum  .
Through the increment on healthcare expenditure , we can see that the government is bringing in better technologies and putting the focus on the Singaporeans' health .
With advance healthcare facilities , preventing or curing of diseases are made possible .
One of the most common diseases associated with the old age is the Senile Dementia , where the patient encounters mental deterioration  .
Two major types of senile dementia are Alzheimer type and those due to vascular problems .
Studies show that of all people over 80 , 20% suffers from Alzheimer  .
Researchers have come up with several ways to improve and slow down the deterioration of elderly brain .
For instance , the researchers have invented medications such as tacrine and donepezil which are used by patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease  .
Researchers not only focus on inventing new medications , they also hope to protect people against mental decline through aerobic exercises and getting a dose of the sun - vitamin D  .
Singapore being one of the fastest aging populations in the world , with the estimation of 23% of the population to be over 65-year-olds by the year 2030 , there is a need for more hospitals to be built to meet the needs of the aging population  .
Hence , Jurong General Hospital which will be up in five years and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital which will be up next year will be linked to a community hospital next door .
This is to ensure that older people will have the right health care treatment at the right place and in return helps them to cut costs  .
It is understandable that older people often require more medical care , but they need not remain in hospital for this care .
Thus , it would be much cheaper for them to get such care from a community hospital - hence the idea of "stepping down" the care is needed .
Public transportation systems must continue to expand in order to deal with an aging population .
In June 2006 , Singapore Bus Services  transit launches Singapore's First Ever Wheelchair accessible buses - Service 21  .
In conjunction , another public transport operator Singapore Mass Rapid Transit  came up with its first wheelchair-friendly buses on June 2009  .
With these buses , the elderly and wheelchair bounded commuters could travel conveniently to hospitals and polyclinics for their medical appointments .
Even with government funding , not every Singaporean is able to luxuriate in the use of better healthcare and public facilities .
Even with government subsidies and paying through their CPF they might still find it hectic to handle hefty medical bills .
Hence , even a small family with a monthly income of $10 ,000 might also find it difficult to cope with a big hospital bill , if they have to support one or two elderly people with chronic illness  .
Hence , policy such as senior citizens' bonus the where lower-income elderly aged 55 and above with an annual income of $100 ,000 or less will receive $200 to $1000 over a period of 4 years  to lighten the burden of lower income families .
There is no need to worry as statistic shows that direct subsidies to patients have increase from $850 million in 2001 to $1 .6 billion in 2007 and it is project to increase to $2 .2 billion in 2012  .
In conclusion , amelioration and subsidizing of healthcare and public facilities has eased the aging population .
Therefore , maintaining a healthy lifestyle , saving up for the future and contribute monthly to their CPF account assist the citizen for in a better retirement and lower their economic burden .
One in five residents in Singapore will be 65 and above by the year 2030  .
Singapore society's aging process brings on numerous set of challenges for the government .
The effects of aging process in Singapore are as follows .
First , economic decline would occur as the size of the working force shrinks .
Second , decline in the citizen's health due to weaker immunity system and age related illness .
Third , social problems brought on by the living environment .
Fourth , emotional problems caused by the different mindsets of the young and old generations and connections to family and society .
Last , the decrease in mental agility affecting active aging .
Therefore , the government has embarked on reforming its older policies and implementing new ones to cater to and prepare for the trend of population aging in Singapore .
Critics might argue that the government introducing policies encouraging employability of mature workers or re-employment of older workers does not mean companies in Singapore would follow suit .
Also , not all the workers would benefit from the policies mentioned above .
However , in evident of the above policies , Singapore was the only Asian country which won the AARP International Innovative Employer Award  .
The award is given to companies in countries for showing innovative Human Resource practices that deal with matters related to the workforce , age 50 and older  .
Also by the end of 2008 , 700 unionised companies have already committed to re-employ close to 5 ,000 workers above the age of 62  .
The statistics show that the reemployment is a useful tool and the government's policies have had a positive impact on the companies .
Furthermore , workers can refresh or upgrade their skills from more than 800 SPUR courses  .
This benefit is not limited only to employed workers but unemployed workers also can turn SPUR to sharpen their skills while they search for jobs .
Moving on , Singapore wants for its seniors , even the less mobile to have a safe and accessible environment .
As such , a Barrier Free Accessibility Masterplan was executed  .
The plan is for all our public housing estates to be barrier-free by 2011  .
Also by 2014 , eligible HDB blocks would have lift access to all floors .
In the past , there was no exact emphasis on structure for all ages .
However , since July 2006 , HDB's new public housing projects are built are all people  .
For example , switches and sockets low enough to be accessible from a wheelchair and toilets being wide enough and having hand rails .
Moreover , our government is not only building barrier-free estates but also concentrating on public transportation .
By 2010 , pedestrian walkways , public roads , taxi and bus shelters and access to MRT stations would be barrier-free , using a $60 million programme started by the government  .
We can also observe that wheelchair-accessible buses are progressing gradually .
Thus , Singapore's environment and transportation services for its citizens are transforming in line with the changing needs of Singapore society .
Our government's constant review of the policies , setting up of many specified committees to head particular goals in relation to changing times , and counter measures to external and internal factors have been impressive .
It has also gained recognition in local and abroad .
In conclusion , our current policies clearly have helped to ease the aging process in Singapore .
It has enabled our society to be better prepared for the aging trend in Singapore .
When Singapore's Ministry of Finance unveiled the government budget for 2009 , it is stated that an estimated total of S$66 million or 0 .15% of the total government expenditure will be spent on establishing various programs and upgrading facilities for the elderly  .
As the problem of aging population intensifies throughout the years , there will always be a debate on how much of the public spending should be allocated to the aged .
While it is important to provide funds for implementing policies to support the elderly , it is plausible for the government to work on areas which can aid both the country's development as well as provide support towards the aged .
Firstly , it is vital to develop the country's economy .
A sustained economic growth improves the level of business activities , ensures low unemployment rate and increases government tax revenue .
More funds is thus available to finance additional projects for the needy including the aged .
Also , more people will become self-sufficient and therefore able to support themselves , even without government aid .
Hence , more funds can be directed to other economic development areas  .
Contrarily , with slower growth , more people will be unemployed and more money would have to be spent on unemployment benefits .
This will inevitably constrict the public spending on the aged due to a smaller pool of resources .
Secondly , the funding spent on the education sector cannot be compromised .
Cheney  wrote that children are the pillars of the nation .
This means that the country's progression will depend on the next generation .
If the young are not well educated , there may be social implications such as increasing crime rates and unemployment .
In a research done by Shirley  , crime rate and education have an inverse relationship .
This is due to the increased opportunity costs involved with a higher education level .
Adversely , there is a positive relationship between higher education and employment opportunities  .
This is because employers tend to link working abilities with academic qualifications .
Hence , reduction in education expenditure will put the country's progress at risk .
Critics may argue that even if the country is performing well economically , she may not be progressing socially if she fails to address the people's needs , especially the elderly's .
This is because the elderly have once contributed to the country's economy and their well-being should not be overlooked when they aged and unable to work .
Thus , it is justifiable that the society should give in return and support the old members of the workforce , on the account of their past contributions to the nation .
Furthermore , aging is a natural process and everyone will grow old one day .
When the time comes , it is man's instinct to hope that more efforts will be invested to help him .
Therefore , it is pertinent that the government does not overlook their needs .
However , it is essential to regulate the amount spent on assisting the aged .
Some fear that with government aid , some may in turn become over-reliant and fail to be self-sufficient .
Therefore , it would be better for the government to offer the basic infrastructure and introduce policies to help the aged gain independence while receiving necessary help .
For example , one feasible policy is to encourage companies to provide extra training for the older workers to stay in touch with the advancing technology , thus increasing their working lifespan disregarding health factors .
Not only will the elderly become more financially able , they will also attain a sense of belonging in the society and purpose in their lives .
Concurrently , the government can invest in other sectors , such as the research and development sector , which will indirectly aid the aged .
For instance , public facilities , such as buses , are being upgraded and improved to facilitate easier movement for the elderly and handicapped .
Also , there are ongoing medical research on senile dementia and Parkinson's disease .
All these will improve the lives of the elderly significantly .
In conclusion , public spending for the aged is a necessity but should be regulated .
In order to strike a balance and better maintain the state of the economy , the government has to prioritize the country's needs and analyze the current problems the country is facing .
Resources are always limited , thus the government has to allocate them cautiously for the continuous development of the nation .
Aging is an ongoing process .
Everybody will grow old and is bound to experience the effects of it at one point in their life .
Although we cannot escape from it , we can certainly make the process a less painful one to go through .
Indeed , current research and development/policies have greatly contributed in easing the aging process .
Apart from research and development , policies with regards to ageing population have also help to ease the ageing process .
These policies help the elderly to age with grace and dignity .
For example , HDB has been actively implementing various policies and improvement programs in making the elderly feel more comfortable .
One such program is the Lift Upgrading Program where the lifts will now land on every floor as compared to the past where not all public housing are provided with the accessibility to lifts .
This does not only benefit the elderly , but the disabled as well as families with young children  .
In addition to this program , HDB has also come up with policy which encourages children to live in close proximity to their parents .
This policy provides the children to buy resale flats with a housing subsidy of $40 ,000 higher-tier Family Grant under the CPF housing grant scheme .
For singles aged 35 years and above who wish to buy a resale flat , they will be provided with a housing subsidy of $20 ,000 higher-tier Singles Grant under the scheme  .
These policies all have the common intention of promoting the value of an extended family staying together for mutual care and support which will in turn ease the aging process of the elderly .
Research and development/policies are not the only ways in easing the aging process though .
Palliative care is now getting the recognition it deserves together with professional training and more funding .
On top of relieving a patient's pain , palliative care also lightens the emotional burden of the patient's caregiver too .
In light of the increased awareness and growing importance of palliative care , demand for it has increase .
For example there is a rose in the number of patient referrals to Dover Park Hospice from 680 in 2006 to 750 in 2008  .
By becoming more affordable , it helps to ease the financial burden of the patient and their family .
Although palliative care does not prolong life , it helps the ill to live meaningfully by helping to manage their pain and discomfort .
To conclude , research and development/policies have no doubt manage to ease the aging process but on top of that , palliative care also has a role to play in relieving suffering and improving the quality of life for people facing serious illness .
Singapore is one of the fastest ageing countries in the world .
In the year 2000 , Singapore has 7 .2% of its population aged 65 and above .
By 2030 , the ageing population in Singapore is predicted to increase to 18 .4% of the total population  .
This is a pressing issue which may lead to an economic decline as the workforce is affected .
The current research and development as well as the policies drawn are effective in alleviating the ageing process such as declining in health , economic downturn and the emotional problem of the elderly .
In this rat-raced world , everything seems to be progressing rapidly , leading to a higher standard of living .
Better medical facilities allow people to live longer but at the same time increase their cost of living as well .
As people age , their health starts to deteriorate and their savings will also decrease as the years pass .
They will not be able to afford the high medical costs and thus are unable to get proper treatment for their illness .
In this aspect , some critics argued that development in the medical field does not aid in the ageing process .
However , one of the policies in Singapore includes healthcare subsidy for the elderly .
The Singapore government will provide up to 75% subsidy for the elderly provided that they are either Singapore citizens or permanent resident and this also depends on the income of the family  .
This aid enables medical treatment to be more affordable .
Hence , the policy is able to ease the ageing process of deteriorating health of the elderly .
Current research in the medical field is conducted to find out the causes and cures for common aged illnesses such as senile dementia and Parkinson's disease .
One example is the Dementia Research Centre located at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in the United Kingdom .
It is the lead centre for finding new drugs to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease  .
When such research is successful , it will benefit humanity and better the medical treatments in the world .
This will decrease the suffering of the elderly , making them less susceptible to diseases and thus helping to abate the ageing process .
There are a few measures taken by the Singapore government to ease the ageing process .
One of the measures taken is to encourage the elderly to undergo training and upgrading of their skills .
This will enable them to enter the workforce again and increase their retirement age .
The 'ADVANTAGE !
Scheme' was implemented in 2005; some companies such as the retail and logistics have adopted it to help them recruit and retain workers aged 62 and above  .
This will increase the retirement age of the elderly and thus improve the economy and workforce in an aging population .
Another policy is the 'Central Provident Fund  Housing Grant Scheme' which is a subsidy given by the government to encourage children to live in close proximity with their parents .
They will have a disbursement of grant if they live in the same town , or 2 kilometers apart from each other if they are to stay in different towns  .
When the children live near their parents , there is a higher probability of them visiting their parents often , hence making it easier for them to take care of their parents .
Moreover , the family is able to provide emotional support for the elderly .
Hence , these development plans and policies will help to ease the ageing process of the elderly .
In conclusion , the research conducted to discover more about the illnesses of the elderly and the policies implemented which provide subsidies as well as schemes to aid the elderly , will help to ameliorate the ageing process .
An ageing population will still be a problem in time to come .
Hence , such developments and policies are vital to ease the ageing process .
Family might be a better solution to abate the process , as they are the main emotional and financial support for the elderly .
An elderly is an irreplaceable and valuable source of asset that acts like glue which holds families together .
These valuable assets are deemed to increase in numbers globally .
Being one of the fastest aging populations in Asia  , Singapore faces a huge challenge in developing infrastructures and public policies in terms of healthcare , housing , re- training , transportation and financial aid to accommodate this changing age structure .
Despite the large expenses in the various aspects for the aged , these implementations would also benefit the younger generations in due course .
Hence , the government and society would have to do everything that is possible to support and prepare for the inevitable increase in the aging population even at the expense of the country's development in other areas .
Currently , the main concern for Singapore is the overwhelming baby boomers that are progressing into the senior status .
Nevertheless , the government should prioritize its spending and not neglect this aging population .
Reports have shown that  in mid 2008 , an estimated 506 million population worldwide are above 65 years old .
However , this figure will reach 1 .3 billion by 2040 .
In context of Singapore , the aged above 65-years old are projected to represent 23% of the population by 2030 and this would be the second highest percentage in Asia after Japan  .
The repercussions following the aging population would be social and economy concerns as the younger generations would have to struggle to support their families .
Moreover , with less working population , Singapore's economy would be greatly affected .
Therefore , the society should be aware of its situation and address to this problem before it becomes a severe issue for the country .
Subsequently , public spending on the different policies and infrastructures would benefit the society and support the economy in the long run .
The different policies include financial aspects like the reinforcement of individual savings through the mandatory Central Provident Fund which help the population save for old age  .
This would ease the burden on the younger generations having to support the aged .
In relations to healthcare , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stated in his National Day Rally Speech  regarding the development of step-down care and the strengthening of 3Ms  .
The step-down care involves the government's support to the voluntary welfare organizations  and linking community hospitals , nursing homes , general practitioners and home care together to cater to the aging population .
These policies would eventually apply to all individual as aging is part of a human cycle .
Furthermore , it is recently announced that the government is spending millions to encourage more people to upgrade or learn new skills by building training centres and providing training programmes  .
The government will also introduce the legislation in re-employment by 2012  where the older workers are able to remain active in the workforce for a longer period and save more money for their retirement .
Thus , public spending in these three important aspects of finance , healthcare and employment would be beneficial to everyone .
Critics may argue that the aging ones will eventually pass on; hence the society should focus on the younger generations as they are the talent pool of the country .
To further groom and attract these young talents , spending in areas like improving educational systems  , technology , research and development would be vital .
As in the end , these young talents would be the ones supporting the economy .
Despite the importance of grooming the younger generations , one must not forget the fact that the aged population was once the pioneers that first built the economy .
Hence , it is a moral obligation to care for the aged and not forget the roots of how the country has come thus far .
This would also be considered an ethical teaching to be cultivated in each individual on the importance in being socially responsible .
All in all , it is important that the government address to the needs and issues of the aging population .
More public spending on the aged is critical as these expenditures on implementation of policies or infrastructures would be an advantage to all .
Finally , this would also ease the impact of an aging population on the economy and society to the minimum .
With a paradigm shift in many countries towards a greying population , many governments are confronted with a responsibility of implementing policies that assist the ageing process .
The elderly often face emotional , mental and physical problems and if these issues are not addressed , there will be economic and social implications for the country .
Different countries respond to this problem differently and the ease at which the elderly are living their lives is evidence of the creative policies that many governments have introduced to benefit them .
As countries face the daunting task of ensuring that the needs of their elderly population are met , Singapore is not spared .
The government estimates that by the year 2030 , 23% of its population will be over the age of 65  .
Among the various policies introduced to allow the elderly to have an easier time aging include housing , employability and healthcare which will help to ease their ageing process .
Enhancing the employability of elderly workers by improving skills and retraining elder workers ensures that they have the relevant skills to take on different jobs should the need arise .
The government has also encouraged employers to be more welcoming in employing the elderly .
One such example is the Tripartite Committee which introduced the ADVANTAGE !
scheme in 2005  .
This scheme was introduced to support companies to recruit and retain older workers as well as to re-employ them beyond age of 62 .
This ensures that companies are willing to review their work process to cater to older workers .
By introducing such policies , the government ensures that the elderly do not have to be afraid that they might face difficulties at work with rising competition from the younger generations .
Housing has always been a key issue for elderly during their years of retirement .
The government thus introduced the Lease Buy Back scheme in 2009 .
Through Singapore's successful CPF scheme , many elderly have been able to become flat owners .
They may be asset-rich but many are cash poor .
Therefore the government introduced the Lease Buy Back Scheme this year to ease cash flow .
This scheme allows the government to buy back the HDB flats of the elderly by first giving them a lump sum payment of $5000 and a monthly income for the rest of their lives  .
This eases the burden of the old as they are ensured they receive money every month .
As with old age , there is always a possibility of illness .
Therefore the government has introduced holistic affordable healthcare and eldercare .
Singapore's government introduced Singapore workforce skills qualification  to train more than 900 therapy assistants and patient service assistant over the next three years  .
These training programmes ensure that the elderly are properly cared for with upmost professionalism and efficiency to make certain that they do not face any obstacles .
Furthermore when the elderly are in good care of such trained professionals , families do not have to burden themselves with worry the of whether the safety and wellbeing of their elderly is being taken care of .
As much as government policies have been beneficial to the elderly , critics may state that by increasing the age when elderly can withdraw their CPF , the government is taking away a good few years away from the elderly which can be spent either relaxing , holidaying or purchasing something they have yearned for .
While this may be true , it is essential to remember that these retirement funds are meant to last the elderly till the end of their lives .
The earlier they receive the funds , the more the likelihood the funds may be depleted well before their actual intended duration of use .
Thus the intention of the government to increase the CPF withdrawal age has proved to be a wise decision .
In conclusion , it is of upmost importance that the government keeps coming up with new and improved policies to ensure that our elderly stay active for as long as possible and are able to fruitfully enjoy their old age .
It is only through policies such as these that the elderly will ensure that our future generations do not have to fear the process of ageing as they are certain that with continuous implementation of such policies , growing old would be a graceful process .
Singapore: The fact that the majority of the elderly is reliant on their children for financial support still remains .
In 2005 , it was 31 .9% among those aged 55 to 64 , 55 .8% for those aged 65 to 74 and 63 .7% for those aged 75 years and above .
Shockingly , the age-support ratio has declined from 10 .4 in 1998 to 8 .4 in 2008 , resulting in the challenge that the current caregiver generation has fewer or no siblings with whom to share the burden .
Furthermore , the percentage of elderly persons aged 65 and above has increased from 6 .8% in 1998 to 8 .7% in 2008 .
Thus , the government has to critically consider these worrying demographic changes and allocates a satisfactory portion of the national budget to lighten the burden of the caregiver generation .
The first approach to reduce elder dependency is to ease barriers to elder employment and encourage the elderly to work longer and retire later  .
According to the national survey conducted in 2005 , more than half  of the elderly population aged 55 and above were economically inactive .
The main reasons included retirement and a drop in their fitness and agility levels .
It is reported that the government will be raising the current retirement age of 62 to 65 by 2012 and ultimately to 67 and has also made amendments to the Retirement Age Act which increases the employability of elderly workers .
By working longer and saving more , the elderly can build up their retirement nest egg much faster than before .

Secondly , couples are encouraged to settle down early and set up families , hence , expanding the economy's size and tax base .
Meanwhile , the cost burden of providing for the elderly can be spread over a larger future generation .
However , the first barrier to starting a family among Singaporeans is the sky-high costs associated .
Just the housing policy alone affects the young couples' choices .
During the process of house-hunting , the initial excitement to starting a family among couples starts to fade .
Bigger families require bigger homes at steep prices which force couples to reconsider about the decision to have more children .
Is it possible for a couple to purchase a spacious and comfortable place at an affordable price for a family of five ?
Making matters worse , if the retirement costs and providing for aged parents are added into the equation , having children will be the last thing on the couples' minds .
Last but not least , the strategy about emphasizing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of grown children  is not an easy feat .
It is heartening to read that almost fourth-fifth of the elderly  lived with their children .
However , the children are not always the party at fault .
In fact , there are some parents who do not welcome the prospect of having unmarried children in their 30s living with them as they have a perception that living with more people under the same roof require some sacrifice of personal space and freedom .
The truth lies in the fact that singles under the age of 35 are not eligible to purchase resale flats and are not able to move out of "Hotel Mama" their parents' flat .
In any case , humans tend to be self-centred and less obliged to give of their time beyond personal pursuits .
In any event when the government cuts down or eliminate welfare benefits due to rising elderly-related expenditure , it ought to bear in mind the net effects of such actions  .
It is obvious that the daily lives of the families will be adversely affected and the living standards will deteriorate , particularly the low-income families .
Consequently , there will be a surge in family and social problems .
The children may isolate the fragile elderly , leading to higher suicide rates and psychological problems .
Bringing the issue closer to the government , the confidence level inflicted on the government by the citizens will plummet and they would rather render their support for opposition parties .
In essence , while the education and defence still remains as the government's priority , it does not simply mean that expenditure for elderly welfare can be diverted into other areas .

Nowadays , "ills of old age" is no longer a topic that "only poets and philosophers" would interest in .
"Governments and policy makers are now confronted with the unprecedented problem of a fast aging population ," claims Peter G . Peterson ,  .
Although problems related to aging population become increasingly severe , with more important priority , governments should limit the spending on aging population .
This is because of three reasons: an increasing spending in dealing with problems in regard to aging population would probably affect other objectives with higher priority; government cannot solve the "ills of old age" alone; and the cost of "unlimit" the spending on aging population cannot justify the benefits in the long run .
Secondly , the answer to the problem with regard to aging population should be the cooperation between the elders themselves and the government , not simply by given priority in terms of unlimited government spending .
For example , government could help in training elders and engaging them with more jobs .
A new welfare law with higher retirement ages could also be passed so that the elders would have more time to accumulate wealth in preparing for the future .
By doing so , government spending on aging population could be effectively reduced .
With larger part of welfare supported by elders themselves , more elder citizens would have access to limited government budget .
With a relatively higher income and a broader base of beneficiaries from the government financial support , the average elder citizen should be able to enjoy a better living quality .
Meanwhile , governments could invest more money in economic development , which is at governments' first priority , and generate more revenue to support the aging population in the future though a larger scale of economy instead of an unlimited percentage increase in government spending .
Last but not least , with an increasing aging population , the cost of easing aging-society problems through larger government spending cannot justify the benefits in the long run .
A government's first priority should be the economic development and the overall improvement of the citizens' life quality .
These goals could not be achieved with most of the budget transferred to take care of the elders in the short run .
Thus , governments should deal with objectives with first priority and limit the budget for aging population .
In conclusion , it is clear that the problems generated by aging population cannot be ignored .
However , government should limit the spending on aging population and take care of the objectives with higher priority first .
This is because , due to the limited budget , in order to make the cost justify the benefit for the whole society in the long run , governments have to ensure a growing economy through continuously invest in infrastructure and advance technology with most of its budget .
The problem in regard to aging population would eventually be eased through more financial support generated from a larger scale of economy instead of increasing percentage cost of budget and participation of the elders themselves .
Due to poor fertility rates and late marriages , the government is now confronted with the problem of an aging population .
This is a phenomenon with dire consequences , such as having to direct large amounts of money to take care of the elderly .
Examples include a need to build facilities that are elderly-friendly and heavy subsidizing of their medical fees due to their poor health and low income .
Although forking out a lump sum of money for medical fees is inevitable , the government should not neglect the economic growth of the country .
Thus funding for the elderly medical fees should be limited so as to divert funds to other areas which are more necessary for improvement .
We cannot deny the fact that what we have today is a result of the hard work of the elderly in their prime years .
It is only right that the government take care of them , and spend vast amounts of money on them with no questions asked .
Critics of this approach have argued that if the government continues spending , more tax will be imposed on each working individual and elder dependency will rise .
It would be very stressful for them , having to keep up with both the pace of work and tax expenses .
Furthermore , there are key areas such as tourism , education and technology which will produce significant results if enough resources are channeled to them .
Other than the government spending on them , there are other alternatives which can be implemented to remedy the situation .
Firstly , it is through stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow's grown children , however numerous or productive they are , to support their own elderly parents through informal and familial channels .
.
This is a social responsibility for each working individual , and it is often easier to get people to be socially responsible than to increase their tax contributions .
The government should give incentives to children that live near their parents , such as cheaper housing , or give priority to them when allocating flats .
Secondly , it is by requiring people to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency .
They should be encouraged or compelled by law to save and invest more of their income earned while they are active in the work force .
.
Minor monthly contributions made during their working years will definitely accumulate to a substantial pool of wealth for their retirement days .
Diverting funds to other more vital areas of improvements has its benefits too .
Firstly , there will be economic growth and country prosperity .
Singapore has strived hard to achieve the status as a tourism hub , and the revenue that could be generated from it alone should never be overlooked .
Therefore , if more funds are diverted to it instead of the elderly , there is no doubt that the country will experience tremendous economic growth and be prosperous .
Secondly , the future workforce of the country will be very productive .
A productive workforce is often defined as one which possesses the best qualifications , and education emphasis is the only way to go about it .
Thus , expanding the current budget on education will surely result in a larger and more affluent generation in the future .
Spending on the elderly is necessary , but it could be done on a ration basis .
We've discussed the far-reaching effects of diverting to other more vital areas of improvement and it outweighs any existing issues .
There are also other available alternatives which could be implemented to deal with the medical needs of the elderly , such as the stressing of filial obligations and the introduction of retirement schemes .
The limit , however , should be duly considered by the government in line with its current policies .
In a survey conducted by Manpower Incorporated , 40% of global leaders felt that ageing population was to be one of the most crucial problems in the future  .
Thus it comes as no surprise that governments around the world have stepped up their efforts to alleviate the effects of global aging .
The social policies adopted have greatly introduced the older population into the workforce and the volunteering sector , thus keeping them actively involved in the community and easing the aging process to a large extent .
Firstly , governments have reduced the dangers of ageing population by encouraging retirees to participate actively in volunteering  to increase their mental alertness and at the same time tap on their wisdom to aid the community .
However , critics argue that citizens are unaware of these volunteering opportunities .
Also , they contend that most would be unwilling to volunteer during their 'golden years' , thus wasting the government's efforts to increase volunteering opportunities for the elder population .
This claim is flawed as the government has been stepping up its efforts to increase awareness of elder volunteerism through public campaigns and functions .
Fairs have also been organised to encourage active ageing through volunteerism  .
As a result , there has been a rising trend of senior volunteers over the years .
The Retired and Senior Volunteers Programme  is an example of an avenue that provides opportunities for retirees to volunteer and use their skills to help others and also nurture new skills along the way .
To date , it has over 500 , 000 volunteers  , thus proving wrong the notion that people are unaware and uninterested to volunteer in their 'golden years' .
The high membership is testimony to the fact that volunteering will give the elderly spiritual fulfillment in their later years .
Secondly , governments in affected countries have introduced incentives to encourage companies to hire and retrain older workers , thus boosting the workforce and easing the aging process .
This will ensure that the huge older population can contribute effectively to the workforce .
Also , they will be able to accumulate more savings and not be over-reliant on the government for pension benefits .
This policy has been effective as surveys have proved that with the retraining and incentives to hire older workers put in place , employers have been increasingly open about hiring older workers .
According to a survey conducted by Manpower Incorporated in October 2006 , 48% and 43% of employers had strategies to hire and preserve older Singaporean workers respectively , whereas in Japan , 83% of employers had strategies to preserve older workers .
This proves that the governments' strategies to promote the hiring of older workers into the workforce have been effective .
According to the Singapore's Ministerial Committee on Ageing  , employment of Singapore citizens aged 55 to 64 increased from 53 .7% in 2006 to 56 .2% in 2007  .
This shows that the retraining of skills have indeed helped older workers to become more productive leading to the increased willingness of employers to hire them .
Lastly , the Singapore government has been encouraging citizens to retire later to accumulate more savings .
As a result , Singaporean working males aged 60 to 64 increased from 49% in 1996 to 63% in 2006 , while those of females increased from 15% to 26%  .
This proves that the government's promotion of a longer working life have effectively influenced the mindset and convinced the older population to contribute to the workforce for a longer period of time .
Fiscal cost that was previously used to distribute pension benefits to retirees could now be diverted to funding retraining programmes and monetary incentives to companies to hire and retrain older workers , thus further boosting the economy .
As seen from the above , current social policies adopted by the government have indeed alleviated the ageing process significantly .
The elder population , equipped with better skills , now has greater ability to contribute to the workforce .
Companies , with increased cash grants from the government , can now afford to retrain and hire older workers .
Also , senior volunteer opportunities are abound to effectively tap on the skills of retirees and ensure their mental well-being .
Facing an ageing population , the Singapore government had done research and development to improve the ageing process .
This is so that we will be able to harness the social possibilities , while at the same time , prepare to tackle challenges arising from the ageing population .
The ageing process brings to mind deteriorating health situation which requires lots of medical attention .
To make matters worse , social problems such as disrespectfulness and the lack of filial piety among the younger generations arises .
This would lead to emotional problems , where elderly feels like the "leftover of society" .
Gerard Ee , chairman of Council for Third Age said , we have to deal with housing , health , financial needs and accessibility before older people can be fully integrated into society .
Singapore has looked into the development of infrastructures to create a barrier free society for the elderly .
The main areas of concerns were the Housing Development Board  precincts and public transports island wide .
Firstly , the government had launched the Lift Upgrading Programme for the benefit of flat owners without direct access to lifts .
By doing so , elderly can then conveniently leave their HDB homes to access shops and services within the precinct  .
Next , new buses are now designed low-floor , step-free and wheelchair accessible .
According to the Committee of Aging Issues  , a barrier free environment is important to allow senior citizens live independently and move out into the community to participate actively in society  .
The newly designed buses complement the elder friendly Mass Rapid Transit  systems , making Singapore an accessible city for all .
Hence , today's elderly has unobstructed access from homes to public amenities , communal and recreational facilities .
In recognition of what the government had done , people begin to ask if these improvements could really ease the ageing process .
Now elderly are given more access to the public , but the ultimate choice still lies with them .
What could be hindering the decision is their children's disapproval or even themselves .
This is the case as most people will agree that elderly are not able to take care of themselves outside .
We cannot deny that they require more response time and have certain constraints in physical movements .
A little carelessness on the road could cause accidents , thus creating more burdens to their love ones .
Also , they are usually the victims of crime .
However , the government has been creating awareness on looking out for each other especially the elderly in society .
For example , from young school teaches civic and moral education to educate us on how to take care of elderly , to be patient with them , to respect them and even offer help to them .
Television programs such as Crime Watch also increases the knowledge of elderly to be vigilant to conmen and to prevent crime by not wearing excessive valuables .
The second area of research and development is on dementia .
Researchers found that people who retired later are able to avoid Alzheimer's disease longer than people who retired earlier  .
The first way of tackling this issue is to raise the retirement age to 62 years old .
It not only keeps the elderly mind active , it also helps to cope financially with rising medical costs and brings in self-satisfaction for being able to contribute to the society .
Secondly , CAI emphasizes on having strong family ties across generations to ensure that the family continues to be the first line of support .
This is essential to the elderly as they will not feel so helpless and unwanted .
Lastly , the Government have also encouraged activities and interactions by setting up elderly corners under void decks with facilities such as chess tables .
The aim is to prevent elderly from shutting themselves out of the society resulting to mind-robbing Alzheimer's disease .
In conclusion , the current research and development approaches adopted by the Singapore Government are helpful to a large extent in easing the ageing process .
With the development of infrastructure and medical field as mentioned above , these problems are better coped .
The elderly can now move around independently and conveniently , decreasing the burden on working adults .
The aging population has been an ongoing problem on the countries over the world .
It is not much of a difference in Singapore as the Strait Times  stated that there has been an increase in the aging population to about 300 ,000 people who are over the age of 65 today and this figure is expected to increase to 900 ,000 by 2030 .
This shows that more attention is required for the aging population so as to prepare the society in embracing these elderly in the near future .
Hence , the public spending on the aged should not be limited and to be spent on other areas of the country's development as the money is needed for the healthcare and financial aspect for the aged .
As one gets older , they are more vulnerable to illness which explains the need of spending on the healthcare industry .
In the CIA factbook  , the life expectancy for Singapore is 81 .98 years which is ranked fourth in the world .
This means that the aged would live longer and drain their families and their own savings as the hospital fees are costly and thus more subsidies are required  .
Moreover , money is also needed to provide the prevention and screenings programmes for the elderly and to educate them about the benefits of having a healthy lifestyle and ways to stay healthy .
These screenings can also help to identify potential health problems that they might have and get them to seek treatment before it worsens and disrupt their daily activities .
Hence , spending on elderly healthcare is necessary as it helps to educate the elderly on the importance of healthy lifestyle while reducing the burden on the elderly and their family for the costly healthcare services .
Moreover , there is a high chance that the elderly may use up their retirement savings on healthcare and daily necessities despite the implementation of Central Provident Fund  to lessen their burden .
Dr Ng  stated that CPF members would also use up their CPF account in time due to the higher standard of living in the future .
In addition , based on Statistic Singapore  , the old age support ratio has decreased from 11 .8 in 1990 to 8 .4 in 2008 .
This shows that there are fewer young working adults to support the elderly .
It also signifies that the elderly has to either prolong retirement or increase their saving in order to support themselves after retirement .
Therefore , retraining is needed for the elderly as through these retraining , they can upgrade their skills and adapt to the demanding working environment to save up for the future and contribute to the economy .
Hence , spending on pension and retraining for the elders is essential and should not be limited as it aids them in being financially independent after retirement .
On the other hand , money is also needed in the other areas of development like education .
Education plays an important part in the country development and growth as it helps in nurturing the young who are the country's future .
Thus , the expenditure on education is also important instead of focusing on the aging population .
Nevertheless , the Ministry of Finance  had stated that they are planning to provide quality education by setting aside $4 .4 billion for basic education for the young and $3 .5 billion for the higher education like the polytechnics and universities .
This is in hope of improving education sector and nurture the young better for the future of Singapore .
Moreover , the Ministry of Education  had also stated that the budget for education had increased by 5 .5% .
Hence , this shows that despite the increase in the spending for the aged , it does not mean that the other areas of development will be neglected as each development plays an important part in the growth of the country .
In conclusion , spending on the aged should not be limited due the costly healthcare expenses and limited retirement saving for the future .
These expenditures can help to improve the lifestyle of elderly and being healthy the elderly will be able to prolong their retirement which in turn helps in improving the economic .
Hence , not only the country but its people will also benefit from the economic growth .
27 .3% of Singapore's GDP  is attributed to the manufacturing sector  .
The manufacturing industry in Singapore is one of the important growth engines of the economy .
Large amount of money is diverted to the R&D  sector to give Singapore a competitive edge over its competitors .
But this has resulted in uproars from the people and they claim that more resources should be diverted into the welfare schemes for the aged instead .
So , who is defined as the aged ?
Currently there is no fixed age group where the aged is clearly defined .
Regardless of how the aged is defined , no human is able to survive without money in this current world .
Therefore in order for the aged to be better off , the Singapore economy has to be constantly growing and this can be achieved by diverting more resources into our R&D sector so the local products will be greatly differentiated and value added .
There is a common misconception that most welfare states end up being in debt and the people have a higher tendency to be over-reliant .
However there are no statistics to show that higher government expenditure on the social welfare leads to lower growth and lower productivity .
Well known welfare states such as Germany and Denmark do not necessarily do better or worse off economically than countries who have limited social expenditure such as Japan .
Denmark's welfare expenditure contributes to 37 .9% of the nation's GDP and the GDP per capita  is $37 ,265 whereas Japan's welfare expenditure contributes to 16 .9% of the nation's GDP and its GDP per capita  is $38 ,559  .
From this statistic , we can draw that it is also possible for Singapore to learn from these success stories and increase welfare expenditure while achieving economic growth at the same time .
Singapore is different from the welfare states in Europe such as Germany and Denmark .
Singapore is practicing the open market policy thus being more susceptible to external factors .
A recent example would be when the United States's economy fell during the credit crisis , Singapore was badly impacted by the recession .
One of the major growth engines in the Singapore's economy is the manufacturing sector .
Unlike China who has abundance in labour , Singapore on the other hand has little natural resources and is unable to compete with China on a large scale .
distinguishing our manufacturing goods by investing more money to invent cutting edge technology , to increase efficiency , to make our products unique and competitive in the market .
In order to finance the current schemes in Singapore , the economy has to be growing first so that it could support its schemes .
Currently Government Health Expenditure has been limited at 0 .9% from 2005 to 2007 .
Since Government Health Expenditure is capped at a percentage of GDP regardless of boom or bust in the economy , therefore the amount of money diverted to Health Expenditure in a bullish economy is higher than when it is during a bearish economy .
As the saying goes "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime" This is especially true for the senior citizens whose skills are outdated in the current society but has an able body to earn an income for themselves .
Instead of diverting resources to finance the welfare schemes , the government should instead divert resources into retraining and integrating the senior citizens back into the work force .
Senior citizens possess a large amount of experience which are valuable to the younger generation now , thus they are more of an asset than a liability .
"For every working adult in Singapore , He/She has to support 8 .4 elderly Residents aged 65 years and above  .
Therefore to ease the burden on the younger generation who has to support the post baby boomers as they approach their retirement years , it would be a win-win situation if we integrate senior citizens back into the work force .
As countries differ both ideologically and geographically , there is no one solution that solves the current situation of an aging population .
Thus with different government's goals , the solution will adjusted to suit the country .
But in Singapore's context , Singapore does not have any natural resources and  dependent on innovation and creativity to gain an advantage over its competitors .
In order to finance these welfare programs , we need to divert resources to other areas in order to have continuous growth in Singapore .
However government intervention alone is insufficient to finance the welfare schemes alone .
Thus it has included private charity organization such as National Council of Social Service  to attend to the needs of the aged and the needy together with the help of the government .
Most importantly , is the care and concern from the family which is vital to the well being of the elderly .
The aging process of the elderly is an on-going problem , as the first batch of baby boomers will reach 65 by 2012 .
"The number of elderly aged 65 and above is one out of every 12 Singaporeans .
By 2030 , it will be one out of five ."
.
In view of this growing trend , government agencies and local service providers came out with some very innovative and creative designs to ease the everyday life of elderly .
The BCA has acknowledged the aging problems in Singapore and released a series of Home improvement designs to cater to the needs of an aging population in Singapore .
Those designs include the manoeuvring space for wheel chair bound elderly , visuals and vibration door bells for elderly with hearing impairment and additional safety features like emergency bell in toilets .
All this features will enhance the life of elderly as they can perform daily duties with ease .
These also allow the elderly to be independent as they no longer need to rely on other's help with their daily life .
Bus service provider SBS transit took the lead to introduce the elderly and handicap friendly buses in 2007 .
The low floor and zero stepped bus is an initiative by the SBS to ease the travelling journey for the elderly .
"This means that the elderly and other less mobile passengers will be able to board and alight easily .
This is especially important given Singapore's ageing population ."
.
It is an important innovation by the transport company , as it showcases its determination to improve the local transport facilities to facilitate the transportation for the ones with special needs .
Land Transport Authority  did their part by introducing the new elderly- friendly traffic system in March 2009 .
Making use of the new Radio Frequency Identification  technology , "Traffic lights will open their eyes to keep a look out for elderly pedestrians"  .
With the new technology , traffic lights will detect elderly that's still crossing the roads and adjust the timing accordingly .
With this system in place , lesser traffic accidents involving slower moving elderly are expected , as it allows elderly to finish crossing before the drivers are signalled to go .
Preliminary rounds of test involving 30 elderly pedestrians shows that the new system is welcomed by the elderly .
On the other hand , as mentioned , in this economic driven world , it would be impractical to focus our finances on the people whom are no longer efficient in what they used to do .
The country will simply be burden by placing more funds into rewarding or simply sustaining the elderly .
They should have had savings in either the form of cash or CPF to sustain them , alongside with subsides from the government to helps loosen the dependency on others for help .
The rewarding of the elderly does not push the country forward , whereas it is the upbringing of our youth that will ensure a future for our country .
There is too much human factor involved when it comes to whether elders should get more funds to help them cope in their later days , which should not be part of any equation when other development sectors can benefit instead .
In sum , the limitation of public spending on the elderly and diverting them to other developments would serve well in driving the country forward .
On one hand it is only moral that they are well taken cared because of the fact that they are the ones who contributed to the society before a new generation took over , while on the other by allocating more public spending on them would hinder the growth of the country as a whole .
Trading the future for the past simply is not a practical choice .

Singapore has one of the fastest aging populations in the world , with people over 65-year-olds estimated by 2030 to make up 23% of the population , making Singapore the country with the second highest percentage in Asia just behind Japan  .
With the growing number of the aged in Singapore , the government should establish its bottom line for financing public healthcare for the elderly .
However , the government should also plan and allocate its expenditures on other areas appropriately in order to fuel the country's development .
A country cannot afford to spend too much on the elderly because of practical realities .
Some people think that the government has moral obligation to do all that it can to support the elderly .
The high standard of living in many developed countries causes greater difficulties for working adult to support their parents' medical expenses and still take care of their children's needs .
In addition , rising medical cost makes it more imperative for elderly to receive help in order to support their medical needs in the future .
However this is not a practicable solution .
Other than the elderly , there are also other groups of people equally in need of the government support to help them .
People like the handicapped , intellectually disabled and single mothers also experience great difficulty in living in Singapore where cost of living is relatively high .
The government should spread out its public spending to the various groups of people in need instead of just focusing on the elderly .
The government's moral obligation should not be supporting the elderly only .
Technology is an important area of development that will benefit everyone in the country .
Increasing public spending on technology would lead to an increased activity in Research and Development  and new advancement in technology .
Certain new innovations brought about by the rise of R&D activities would in turn help the needy people improve their living standards .
Some examples are the invention of robot that is able to do household chores and the modification of public buses that can accommodate the elderly and the handicapped .
Advancement in technology will also attract more investors and business opportunities to the country that will contribute to the country's economic growth .
Investing in technology would not just benefit the needy people but also the people as a whole in the country .
Military spending is crucial in maintaining an 'insurance policy' with no buffer zone against potential aggressors .
In 2009 , more than a quarter of the country's expenditure , or $11 .4 billion , had been directed to defence - an increase of 5 .6 per cent over previous year's budget  .
This has shown the importance the government place on the Singapore defence .
Singapore sees terrorism as one of the biggest threats to its security and economy .
Attacks in recent years in the United States and neighbouring countries such as Indonesia have prompted it to increase its vigilance against similar risks .
With the threat of terrorism intensifying , Singapore should never let its guard down but invest more on its defence in order to be more vigilant .
Military spending should strive to be one of the top priorities of the government as it concerns the safety and security of everybody in Singapore .
In summation , it is important that the government continue to provide financial assistance for the elderly due to the increasing number senior citizen .
However , this public spending should not be done at the expense of other expenditures that concern the country as a whole such as technology and defence .
Investing in technology and defence will eventually benefit everyone in Singapore including the elderly and other people in need in terms of better living condition and greater security .
Singapore government should continue to be cautious about how it allocates its expenditure such that it will bring the utmost profit to the country .

Singapore faces 'silver tsunami' .

To begin with , the current global economic climate is not helping matters much .
Therefore , firstly , money should be diverted into the economic sector , namely stimulation of the domestic economy .
For example , the $20 .5 billion resilience package announced by the government of Singapore is intended to save jobs by helping valuable companies survive the recession , prepare for the near future , increase the competitiveness of the country and prevent a further slump in the economy  .
Assistant schemes such as the 'GST' offsets , rebates , service and conservancy charge rebates serve to act as a stimulus for the country in hope that the people will spend more to keep the economy afloat .
In the face of such a situation , spending on the aged is of least priority .
The second way in which money can be diverted into the economy is through spending on infrastructure .
Banking , communication and transportation are just some examples of infrastructure that a country needs to invest in to stay ahead in the age of globalisation .
Such investments will provide stability to the country in the long-run as it increases the confidence of potential investors .
Investments in communication and transportation make the country more 'accessible' , hence promoting both local and overseas investments .
However on the other hand , critics argue that the economic growth alone does not dictate a country's development .
They claim that spending on the aged is as important .
According to Peter G . Peterson  , "demographic changes such as the increasing population of the aged will have a serious consequence on healthcare issues in developed countries" and he also goes on to advocate ways to spend on healthcare .
But if this spending can be alternatively channelled into other sectors of the country's development , such as infrastructure and domestic economy as mentioned above , the country will achieve long-run success and stability .
Hence the demographics of a country alone , does not determine its destiny .
Therefore , public spending should be spent on a country's economical development .
Another way in which money can be well spent on the country's development would be to spend on societal needs such as education and general healthcare .
As the saying goes , "knowledge is power" and rightly so .
Singapore was able to pull itself out of the rut from a third world country to a first world country in one generation due to its focus on well utilised human resource .
And the main contributor was education .
Public spending on education accounts for 19 .3% of the total budget and is second in terms of priority in spending succeeding defence  .
A well educated society will always be at an advantage and this will act as a catalyst for further growth in several other sectors in Singapore's economy .
Hence a knowledge based economy will propel the nation into societal development .
The flipside to this issue is that , sectors such as healthcare play an important role in a country's societal development too .
Public spending on aged healthcare accounts for the bulk of the spending which is precisely why it should be limited .
Children of the aged should be given more responsibility for shouldering the financial needs of their parents rather than the government .
This allows money to be spent on more pertinent sectors such as education which has been a traditional source of growth for Singapore .
Hence , public spending on the economy and aspects of society outweigh spending on the aged as money can be better utilized elsewhere for a country's development .
A failure in proper public spending would therefore cripple the country and its development .
The issue of graying population was highlighted in Mehta and Wee  that one out of four Singaporeans will be 60 years and above by 2030 .  .
In other words , there will be a significant portion of the nation's populace being a senior citizen in the near future .
To facilitate the aging process , the Singapore government has since build on existing policies as well as develops new ones that are pertinent to the current society .
First and foremost , as Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports has announced , a law was revised in 1996 for aged parents to seek maintenance from their children , who are competent of supporting them and yet unwilling to do so .
In this aspect , the government is entirely supportive of children fulfilling the filial obligations .
The law advocates for adult children to care for their aged folks instead of leaving them alone by themselves to integrate with the society and figure about survival .
This was further supported by Peterson  who has also brought up the concept of children's responsibility in sustaining elderly parents .
.
In spite of the CPF being in favour for retirees or to alleviate medical expenses incurred , not everyone in the Singapore population would stand to gain from it .
In the society , there is still a fraction who remain jobless or whose job do not have a steady contribution to the CPF .
This means to say upon retirement , there will be those who are not entitled to receive a fixed amount monthly or be subsidized partially for their health disbursement .
As age increases , chronic illnesses inevitably rise alongside and the burden of medical cost may simply be too much for one to bear .
To make things worse , treating of illnesses goes beyond long hospital stays , it stretches on to after being discharge as well as the need for rehabilitation , medication and the list goes on .
Unfortunately , amidst the other expenditures such as housing rentals and utilities bills , families usually opt to decline treatments or even ignore their chronically illed parents .
In fact , there are even cases where adult children abandon their parents in nursing homes to fend for themselves .
Therefore , in any areas which individuals require assistance be it medical affairs or retirement issues , there is always a policy or two which one can turn to for alleviation of current situation .
Indeed , the government has come up with numerous policies and measures to help smooth the process of aging .
Fast aging in population is an issue that most countries including Singapore cannot avoid .
Several problems which relate to the issue include Health , Financial and Welfare of the elderly has come under the concern of the government .
Solutions such as having different subsidy frameworks for community hospitals to help patients to cope with the expensive bills  and monthly Transport allowance for elderly who visit day-care centres  were implemented to ease the tension that fast aging has brought to the low income elderly .
A decrease in the labour force due to retired workers and providing elderly with a place to stay are the issues that the Singapore government is working on now .
Fast ageing in Singapore has certainly affected its labour market as the level of retirement rate increase .
A research report done by the Ministry of Manpower Singapore in year 1999 showed that in year 2020 the old age will be increased to 32% compared to 16% in 1998  .
This implies that there will be a labour shortage of experienced workers who are able to contribute to the labour force after they have retired .
For example , new workers who are hired to replace the vacancy of the retired workers often lack experience and knowledge .
As a result , the workers might not be able to complete the task due to their minimum knowledge and skills therefore , the functioning of the company will be affected  .
One of the solutions to minimize the impact of labour shortage could be to re-employ the retired workers and allow them to guide the new workers on the job as well as sharing their working experience that will benefit the new workers .
Providing shelters to the single or low-income elderly is one of the priorities in the housing estate development program .
Single or low-income elderly could choose to rent a flat from the Housing Development Board  or downgrade their current flat to a smaller one as this will allow the elderly to have extra cash for them to spend after their retirement .
HDB will also be building more compact and affordable 30-year lease studio apartment to cater to the demand for the elderly who aged 55 and above  .
Besides that , more HDB rental flats will also be upgraded with more Elderly-Friendly Facilities .
Facilities such as , having lifts on every floor , installing features like support handbars in the toilets and along common corridors to assist in the mobility of the elderly and installing an alert alarm system in the house when the elderly residents need to seek for any emergency help  .
No matter how many hardware facilities were installed to improve the staying environment of the elderly , they still feel empty and lonely especially if one has no family .
According to a health topic published by Changi General Hospital , elderly tends to be at a much higher risk of depression and ending one's life than the young as they are facing several changes in their life such as illnesses , losses of family member , life partners and friends as well as financial issues which include no income after retirement  .
Therefore , several voluntary programs have been implemented to serve as a helping hand to the elderly .
Program such as The Befriender Service , provided by Lions Befrienders is working closely with Central Singapore ComCare Local Networks  in the aim of easing the loneliness , isolation and boredom of the single elderly and the homebound and also providing services such as advisory and assistance to the elderly  .
Coping with fast ageing in Singaporean is a slow and tough process which requires both the government and its citizens to work closely together .
Either encouraging retired workers to return to the work force or providing a decent shelter for the low income elderly will defiantly send a positive message to the elderly that they are not being abandoned and they are still recognised by the society .
Programs such as visiting the elderly or providing assistance to the elderly will also increase their confidence and accept the society again .
The spending on the aged should be treated as a social and economic development which prepares healthcare facilities for the society as a whole and boosts healthcare spending by the tourists .
By investing in healthcare facilities and medical insurances for the elderly , this will result in a high profile; risk free , user friendly , low cost and safe healthcare solution that does not just benefit the elderly but the society as a whole  .
In times of recession , the spending on the aged would have a direct relation to employment as there will be more labour required to take care of the elderly .
This employment can help to spur economic growth and help in recession .
Singapore is seen as a medical hub due to its excellent geographical location and provision of top notch healthcare services .
Thus , the spending in a way brings in medical tourism revenues for healthcare services and tourism for the medical travellers  .
Treatments that take up to years may result in migration of the family of the sick; this eventually snowballs to a few million dollars of revenue for the tourism industry .
In contrast , public spending on the aged should be limited and routed for the less well-off section of the society .
With consumer price index  for low income groups rising to 7 .5% in June 2008 and developments in globalization , it creates vast income inequalities in Singapore  .
The Department of Statistics  commented that 14 .8% of households here earned $2 ,000 or less a month in 2008 , which explains the need for more money to be pumped into the social safety net .
However , there are initiatives such as Comcare Fund , which assists the less privileged group in Singapore .
The Comcare Fund's budget is $63 .7 million in 2008 and this amount is estimated to be $168 million in this financial year  .
MCYS would also adjust the budget according to situations such as setting aside $1million to help the needy cope with inflation  Hence , the Government has provided an effective social safety net that provides assistance yet at the same time promotes self-reliance to the needy .
It also portrays an image that the Government is concerned with other developments in Singapore other than the aged .
To sum up , the spending on the aged should not be limited as it spurs economic growth and prepares the healthcare industry to combat this pressing issue .
In the future , the effects of aging population would have a much greater impact on Singapore and all resources assigned to the developments should be prioritized based on exigency .
The policies and investments on the aged for today is the preparation by the Government to mould a better future for tomorrow .
It is an undeniable fact that our society is aging rapidly .
By 2030 , 20% of the population in Singapore will be aged 65 and above  .
Hence , several polices have been implemented by the government to help ease the aging process .
The upgrading of housing and encouraging later retirement age policies have indeed helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
Upgrading of housing by the HDB , particularly the elderly households , has helped to ease the aging process .
Facilities within the blocks were enhanced significantly to aid in the day-to-day movement of the elderly  .
These include installing lifts at every floor as well as support hand bars in the toilets .
In order to allow the elderly to receive immediate help in times of emergency , alert alarm systems are fitted in every flat .
These changes have made the lives of the elderly more convenient leading to a greater sense of security instilled in them .
Voluntary Welfare Organization  , which is located below the block , will operate a Seniors Activity Centre to provide support services for the elderly living in the block  .
It creates a cohesive community where the elderly can integrate themselves into the society through participating in various social activities .
Consequently , some of the social and emotional problems that the elderly faced have been resolved .
However , critics have argued that the elderly might not possess the essential skills that are relevant and required in the workforce today  .
This is because the society is constantly changing , hence the skills possessed by the older generation becomes obsolete and no longer applicable today .
Moreover , it has been rebutted that they may face difficulty coping with the fast-paced society and technologically advanced workforce of today  .
However , there are retraining programs available for the elderly to upgrade their skills in order to keep themselves updated and constructive in the workforce .
For an instance , a $600 million Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience  was launched by the government in November 2008 to retrain and upgrade both the employed and unemployed to prepare them for the newer and better jobs .
.
Hence , allowing the older generation to stay longer in the workforce not only promotes economic growth of the country , but also keeps them physically active , mentally alert , resilient and socially connected to the society .
Aging population is an unavoidable issue today that needs to be addressed urgently .
It is therefore important to make sure that policies implemented are useful in helping to ease the aging process .
With the current policies such as upgrading of their residences' facilities and longer working lives , the aging process has been eased to a large extend .
According to Singapore Department of Statistics , the average life expectancy for a boy and a girl born in 2006 is 78 .0 years and 82 .8 years respectively .
As compared to 2003 , it shows an increased of 1 .4 years and 1 .2 years correspondingly  .
Increasing life expectancy has inevitably led to the growth of aging population .
Aging is a complex and continuous process that begins with birth and ends with death .
Every person will experience the effect of aging process when they age .
In order to help ease the aging process , efforts have been made in the research developments and policies implementation to meet the physical and financial needs of each individual .
It is crucial to meet the physical needs of the people so as to ease their aging process .
As people become old , their physical health will deteriorate .
Moreover , their body immune system usually weakens .
Hence , efforts have been made in development to minimise the physical problems and vulnerabilities of the people .
One such effort is to make commuting more convenient for the aged and wheelchair-bound through the introduction of Wheelchair Accessible Buses .
With low-floor and steps-free design , these new transit buses have made boarding and alighting more manageable for the aged and disabled  .
Furthermore , the Lift Upgrading Programme has also aided the elderly by having lifts landing on every floor  .
These developments have created a living environment that is more barrier-free for our seniors and people with disabilities .
As such , they can fully participate in their everyday activities .
In addition , much has been done to provide the essential financial assistance for the elderly .
The inability to pay for expensive medical treatments has revealed the need to provide healthcare support for them .
For example , Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong had introduced a step-down care policy during the 2009 National Day speech .
This is to link up acute hospitals , such as Tan Tock Seng Hospital , with community hospitals , such as St Andrew's Community Hospital , to provide skilled and suitable healthcare especially for the aged  .
When patients are sick , they will go to acute hospitals for treatment and recuperate at the community hospital .
This way , proper healthcare at a reduced medical cost is made available for them .
Another example is the introduction of Medisave .
It is a national medical saving policy designed to help Singaporeans build up sufficient savings to meet their hospitalisation expenses .
.
Hence , healthcare needs can be met without increasing the financial burden faced by the people .
On the contrary , critics pointed out that the current policies and research improvements have only helped to minimise problems on a superficial level but have not fully met the emotional needs of the individuals when they grow old .
When one ages , he may be less optimistic and feel disconnected from the society .
Hence , emotional support is an important psychological factor in helping them to forget the negative aspects of their lives  .
However , we cannot deny the recent efforts that had been made to help to satisfy such needs .
For instance , Government Organisation has moved from seniority-based to performance-based wage structure .
Senior workers , with their rich working experience may be able to contribute greatly to the organisation and are encouraged to be re-hired .
This wage structure ensures employability and job security for the elder workers and it prevents them from feeling detached from the society  .
In addition , under the Central Provident Fund's Housing Grant Scheme , the government provides a grant of $10 ,000 to $40 ,000 for families buying flats near their parents' residences  .
This allows the elderly to be closed to their children and some may even undertake the responsibilities of taking care of their grandchildren .
This helps them to feel valued and thereby , aids in the re-discovery of their identities as a senior citizen .
In conclusion , in order to help ease the aging process , the Singapore government has been improving and implementing various policies and research developments to meet the physical , financial and emotional needs of the individual .
These efforts have proven to be effective .
Over the years , an aging population has become an impediment at hand as many countries have been experiencing it , especially in Singapore where statistics have shown that 11 .3% of the population will be aged fifty-five years and above in 2015  .
The younger generation is more career-oriented , which has resulted in later marriages and also lower birthrates .
This burgeoning trend ultimately leads to an aging population and the Singapore government has come up with several policies and development in different fields such as ameliorating the CPF scheme and inventing elderly-related products to cater to the elderly needs .
In light of the many policies and development that have been devised by the Singapore government to address elderly concerns , the aging process will be eased as most of their problems have been addressed .
Some would argue that policies implemented by the Singapore government might not be fully utilized as some companies find it troublesome to comply with it to employ older workers due to several factors .
Critics have claimed that some companies refrain from hiring seniors to avoid spending more time , money and effort in retraining them  .
However , this is not a plausible reason to deter the companies from hiring the elderly as the government has improvised a scheme known as the ADVANTAGE fund to encourage more companies to shift towards automation that facilitate the older populace and to re-employ the elderly by giving out incentives and subsides for retraining programmes of the elderly  .
For example , Sheng Siong Supermarket , who hires senior workers , was able to buy machinery that helps to expedite the production process from one month to ten to fifteen days and increase their productivity by using the government subsides  .
Therefore , social policies , such as the ADVANTAGE scheme , are pertinent to facilitate the elderly in working in a less physically-demanding environment and stay productive .
It is mandatory for everyone in Singapore to have a Central Provident Fund  account .
This initiative by the government helps to ensure that all elderly will have a means of income that will provide them through their golden years .
Recent adjustments made to the CPF on 3 September 2009 have played a significant role in reducing the working-age population's tax burden and also in increasing the elderly's CPF .
For instance , the interest rate of the CPF for savings in the Special , Medisave and Retirement Accounts  will be maintained at 4% floor rate instead of the current 3 .40% for the next two years  .
This eases the economic aspect of an aging population as the elderly can benefit from a higher interest rate and therefore alleviate the deterioration of the aging process .
With an increasingly aging population , many innovative companies have invented several elderly-related products such as hearing aids and automatic wheelchairs to support their large demand for health-care products .
The government has also developed property such as studio apartments with barrier-free accessibilities for the elderly .
All these helped to lessen the elderly's problems of hearing , seeing or moving properly .
For example , two students from Temasek Polytechnic have developed a wheelchair that automatically engages the safety gear whenever it slides backwards .
This helps to ease the inconvenience for those who are incapable of engaging the conventional brakes or holding on to the wheels manually  .
Such innovations ease the problem that the physically restricted are encountering in the process of aging .
In conclusion , it is true that the current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process due to the proper and effective planning adopted by the Singapore government .
Issues such as the reluctance of companies to hire older workers are ameliorated due to the ADVANTAGE scheme whereby subsides encourage them to re-employ the aged .
The changes made to the interest rate of the CPF for savings in the SMRA will provide a social safety net for the elderly , while the increase in elderly- related products and studio apartments further eases the physically restricted aspects of an elderly .
However , these policies and development can help to ease the aging process only if people abandon their social stigma on the elderly populace .
It is extremely difficult for societies to find ways to care for the needy during economic downturns when funding becomes limited  .
And in countries like Singapore and Japan , which faces an aging population , the dilemma is even greater .
With more children not being able to or refusing to provide for their parents , the government definitely has to play a bigger role .
The country's finances will be eaten up as more elderly asks for financial help from the government to cover for their medical fees and basic needs .
However this burden can be lessen if the elderly mindset is changed .
In order to change their mindset , the public spending on the aged should be limited in the future , and in turn use the money for other areas of the country's development like Education , Retraining and Healthcare .
In Singapore , it is true that government aid is important to the current generation of elderly , as the majority of them did not have or did not have enough CPF to last through their retirement .
The current generation of elderly is most probably the first batch to learn about the CPF in 1955 , and being a young scheme then , there is a high chance that they unable to fully benefit from it .
The situation is even worse when elderly is faced with illness .
Sick elderly who are single are not able to work to provide themselves , thus leaving them with no income to pay for their high medical fees .
And even though married elderly have children , the high cost of living is also putting a challenge on the children's finances , which makes it hard for them to provide for their parents .
Therefore , the elderly have to rely on the government .
But all these shall change in 20 years time; the next generation elderly then shall be equipped with sufficient money in their CPF to provide for themselves .
In order to lessen the country's finances burden , the elderly have to change their mindset .
The time has changed and the elderly should too .
First , they should change their overly dependent mindset; they should not expect the government or their children to provide for them in their golden years .
The reason being that the standard of living is rising and adult children find it difficult to provide for their parents , especially those stricken with illness .
Sociologist thinks that this is the cause of the growing trend for children to abandon their elderly parents in nursing homes  .
Next , the elderly should change their mindset towards being to old to work , when in actual fact working slows down their brains from aging .
The government will not be able to provide much as the population continue to age , and there will not be as much people in the workforce as birth rates continue to drop .
So if the elderly do not continue to work , it will put a huge strain on the country's finances .
So how do we go about in changing the elderly's mindset ?
The answer is to invest more money into aspects like Education , Retraining and Healthcare .
The best way to influence on one's thinking is one's young age , and the ideal of being independent can be taught during one's Education .
Furthermore , with higher education level it provides better job aspects , which in turn benefits individual financial prospect .
Education also equips one with better knowledge and planning skills , like the importance of health and financially planning for their golden years  .
As for Retraining , it enables both adults and elderly to improve their skills to continue working .
Lastly , Healthcare aspects like Community activities and Health awareness campaigns lead to a healthier lifestyle .
People of all ages can take lessons to maintain their health and make friends , which will provide them with a healthy mind and body .
In conclusion , the elderly have to change their mindset about being old and dependent .
Elderly should continue to work as they possessed experience that should be pass on to younger generation .
And to ensure the elderly to- be are prepared , it is important to indulge them with a healthy mindset through promoting education , retraining and community activities .
Nothing beats aging with a healthy body and mind , the golden years should be spent enjoyably .
As Singapore has been facing aging population since 1990s , there has been a shortage of skilled worker and declining birth rate .
In order for Singapore to sustain its economic development and improve the quality of life of its people , it cannot afford to spend too much on the elderly .
In a globalizing world , Singapore must stay competitive in order to be successful .
This can be achieved by managing resources efficiently in areas such as investing in foreign talents and education which are vital to its future growth .
Some critics argued that senior citizens are assets to the society since most of them possessed valuable skills , knowledge and work experience .
In addition , the government is supporting the elderly by increasing its health budget such as building new hospitals in old HDB towns   .
Other initiatives were also implemented such as the re-training effort for the elderly in workforces .
Increasing healthcare budget would be an initiative which might be seen as a necessity by the government .
However , there are other areas which are vital for consideration since they are important to Singapore's future development .
As Singapore is facing a decline in its birth rate and transiting into the knowledge based economy , attracting foreign talents could be vital to its growth .
Foreign talents would bring in specialized skills and valuable ideas to Singapore .
For example , in the area of research and development  Singapore need to develop own talent pool and technologies to create new and better products , thus we need foreign talent like accomplished researchers who can lead us into the innovation of new products with their experience and knowledge .
As a result , this could increase business and job opportunities for citizens in Singapore .
In addition , with more foreign talents bringing in different cultures around the world , Singapore would be seen as a more cosmopolitan country .
As a whole , foreign talents can help Singapore gain a competitive edge in the globalizing world .
Educating the young in their early age is essential to the country's development and growth .
This would be so as education encourages critical and creative thinking since young .
This would be supported by current schools' curriculum where children are given problem based learning activities where they have to work on their research and ideas .
This in turn trains them to be able to think independently and innovatively which would be vital to the future workforce .
Therefore , investing into the education system would help Singapore in sustaining its growth in the globalizing world .
In conclusion , a country should tap into other areas of resources in order to stay competitive in a globalizing world .
At the same time , there should also be certain amount of public spending on the aged as the senior citizens are still part of the society and they should be taken care of as so that a country can progress and prosper .
Singapore has one of the world's most rapidly aging population and currently this situation has started to put pressure on our economic growth , with increasing emphasis on health care for the elderly .
From the World Health Statistics 2009 , approximately 3 .3% of Singapore's Gross Domestic Product is spent on healthcare in the year 2006 , and this figure is projected to increase even more in the future and is definitely directly related to the fast aging population .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited to prevent over reliance on the government and that more emphasis could be made to other sectors to promote economic growth .
It is true that most of the aged people in Singapore have contributed to the building and development of Singapore up to this stage and it is time for the nation to look after them .
However , the current healthcare structure may lead to an over dependence on the government for their own health .
With the current CPF structure that part of a Singaporean's monthly wage goes into Medisave and Medishield , which is an 'untouchable' fund that can only be used for hospital and most healthcare bills , Singaporeans may get complacent thinking that they have already saved enough for their medical bills in the future .
But if one is to be diagnosed with a chronic disease or incapacitating illness , the fund in his Medisave might not be enough for the hefty bill over time .
Therefore , instead of investing money into healthcare infrastructures like new hospitals and nursing homes , it would be wiser for the government to help Singaporeans plan out their retirement more strategically .
Other than extending their retirement age , the government might consider collaborating with the insurance companies and help Singaporeans to purchase a basic insurance with their CPF to facilitate illnesses associated with old age .
In this way , not only the reliance on the government will decrease , Singaporeans will be more protected and not be at the mercy of the others when disease strikes .
With much said , it is still important to provide the basic healthcare benefit to the elderly .
However , other areas like education and welfare must not be neglected .
In year 2006 , about 6 .7% of the government expenditure was spent on healthcare and the figure will continue to increase in years to come due to the 'post war baby boomer aging' effect .
Although Singapore's education system is one of the most efficient in the world , there are still many people not able to get a proper education due to financial limitations .
This might result in a multiplier effect of people with less education earning less and being less healthy in a way .
Also , this group of people might not be able to earn enough to sustain their own medical fees when they grow old thus the burden will again be borne by the government .
Therefore , by paying more attention to education and making sure that all if not most Singaporeans can get a proper education , it ensures that most people will be literate enough to get a proper paying job and thus increasing the working adult is to elderly ratio .
With the increase in the ratio , it will without doubt , relieve the government in financing for the aged healthcare .
On top of it , a case by case basis might be a more plausible way of giving healthcare subsidy rather than just applying healthcare subsidy to the general elderly as a whole .
This will really improve the allocations of funds to those who really need it from people who still can afford the healthcare in Singapore .
Even though healthcare expenditure is inevitable in any country , money does not solve all the problems and it is still very important to educate the people on the importance of retirement planning .
Therefore , instead of encouraging people to rely on the government with subsidized healthcare services , the money should be put into better use like education or other aspect of the nation's development .
With the issue of an ageing society escalating in many countries within these few years , governments have been showing an increased concern towards this unprecedented problem of an ageing population with extremely low reproduction rates .
Singapore is definitely not alone in handling this challenge , as in 2005 , both Germany and Japan saw for the first time; their death rates out-number their birth rates .
Currently , there are no clear explanations as to why the phenomenon of low fertility rates has increased in recent years .
Studies , however , suggested that it might be due to the rise in educated citizens and with that , they were taught the importance of family building and hence , would only plan to have a child when they are financially and emotionally ready for one .
This calls for some social policies to be put in place by the governments , to encourage citizens to be more willing to reproduce .
Social policies such as incentives being given out to encourage procreation and increasing the influx of immigrants would help to ease the ageing process to a great extent .
However , they might introduce some new problems , as would be explored in-depth later .
Recognising the problem of a possible financial burden that might be incurred by families with a new child , the governments of developed nations are providing generous incentives with the birth of each new child , in the hope to encourage their citizens to reproduce by helping to ease their financial burden .
In Singapore , we have the "Baby Bonus" scheme , which citizens will get to enjoy a cash gift of up to S$4 ,000 each for their first and second child and S$6000 each for their third and fourth child .
Similarly , the Australia's baby bonus pays their citizens with AUD$5 ,185 per eligible child in 13 fortnightly instalments , as of 1 July 2009 .
One may argue that this is just a narrow viewpoint .
Nowadays , people bred on notions of free choice .
They do not like to be bribed into the government's "propaganda" of procreation .
Also , being more educated , they do not see the need for many children , as time and much money is needed to raise the child in the future .
However , this is definitely not true as firstly , it is the citizens' role to procreate , and not the government's .
Hence , it cannot be conveniently stated that such policy is"propaganda" of the government .
Furthermore , there is evidence of an increased replacement rate .
In Australia , its total fertility rates rose from 1 .76 in 2004 to 1 .82 in 2006 .
As for Singapore , we will have to observe carefully for the next few years to see if its policies will nudge her past the subreplacement zone .
Another social policy that governments seem to turn towards to is the encouragement of the inflow of immigrants into our society .
This is to ensure that the workforce will remain sufficient and efficient , as a shrinking society will only face the threats of declining economic vitality .
Singapore , for instance , welcome talented immigrants to 1"help us reach our goals" .
However , critics argued that though this social policy is feasible to ease the ageing process in Singapore , it does not take into account of the issue of increased competition for jobs in Singapore , due to the high influx of foreign talents .
This might mean that Singaporeans will have to compete for jobs with the foreigners , and might stand chances of losing their jobs to them .
In addition , it also does not take into account of the fact that attracting more immigrants might mean a threat to the culture and identity of a country .
For example , in Europe , 2it is estimated that a quarter of her inhabitants will be non-European in origin , character and beliefs , if she continues to depend on importing immigrants to ease her ageing problems .
This reasoning might be flaw as it is inevitable that the locals have to upgrade their skills to ensure high employability in the fast and highly competitive society .
Also , in this increasingly globalised society , it is even more imperative that one keeps one updated , so as not to be outdated , or they will risk losing their jobs to someone more capable , either a local or a foreigner .
In conclusion , I agree to a great extent that social policies such as the implementation of the baby bonuses and the introduction of immigrants into our society will help to ease the ageing process .
However , the government might wish to monitor the situation closely so as not to welcome too many immigrants such that the nation's culture and identity will be at risk .
Also , they must ensure that the country's employment rate is healthy before encouraging more foreign talents to the workforce .
This way , citizens might not complain and the society will see a more productive workforce and more birth rates , hence helping to reduce the problem of excessive ageing in a society .
It is a fact that we are experiencing an aging population problem throughout the world , especially in the developed countries such as Singapore .
Due to the fast advancement of medications , we are having a longer life span compared to the past .
Thus , many countries are spending more efforts and money to aging population problem .
However , there are many ways which can help the elderly to take care of themselves and public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Elder dependency should be reduced by encouraging later retirement , longer working lives , and lower barriers to elder employment  .
By increasing the eligibility age for public pensions , we are forced to retire at a later age and we will be able to accumulate more money as we grow older .
But in order to achieve that , employers should learn the importance and benefits of employing older employees .
Older employees have more working experiences and better knowledge than the younger ones and these are the crucial factors that will contribute to the company growths .
Government should encourage their citizens to have more children so that that the cost burden of taking care of the elderly is spread over a larger and more affluent future generation  .
Some of the children feel that they are having financial problems and they are not capable of taking care of their parents' expenses .
However , their burdens can be reduced if they have other siblings to share the cost of their parents' expenses .
Government is also increasing their incentives to parents with more children as a mean to increase fertility rate .
The fiscal cost of elder dependency can be further reduced by stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow's grown children to support their own elderly parents through informal and familiar channels  .
This is very important as having more children do not assure that the parents are having higher chances being taken care of by their children than the parents with fewer children .
Thus , it is necessary to educate the children in their early age on filial obligation .
Parents definitely play a critical role by showing a positive role model to their children .
For example , they can show more of their care and concern on their children needs rather than just focusing on their jobs .
Children will be grateful to their parents and increase their willingness to support their parents in future .
Lastly , the fiscal and economic cost of elder dependency can be reduced by requiring people to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency  .
This is like a form of long term saving plan where people are compelled by law to save a portion of their monthly income if they start to work .
The amounts that they have saved can only be withdrawn at a certain age and those savings will be a form of support for them when they reach older age and are not capable of working anymore .
This is especially useful for those people who do not have the habit of saving up .
Nevertheless , we also shouldn't completely ignore the aging population .
Although there are plans to reduce elder dependency , there will still be a small partial of elders that are not capable of taking care themselves .
They may not be physically able to work and at the same time their children have abandoned the task of taking of them .
In some of the worst situation , elders do not even have any children that they can be depended on .
As such , government can be more lenient to these groups of elders by providing financial cares and giving them public pension benefits whenever possible .
Clearly , as many counties are experiencing aging population problems , the importance of solving this problem in the long term period is rather crucial .
Government can offer many public pensions and financial helps to the needy elders , but when will this end ?
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited and people should be educated since young on the ways to prevent aging population problems rather than to find a solution for it .
Public spending for the elderly , is it insufficient still ? .
In an expenditure overview of this year's budget 2009  , the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports has set aside $42 .1 million to fund the community and residential based care programmes for the elderly  , $15 .1 million for projects under the GO !
and Council for Third Age  , which advocates the elderly to lead healthier and more active lives .
Another $3 .2 million will be set aside to pilot the Wellness Programme to promote active and healthy ageing in the community .
12 constituencies will set up the Wellness Programme in this pilot phase  .Given the countless funds being channeled to them and given that most of the aged nowadays are capable of supporting themselves , the government expenditure on the elderly exceeds what they need .
Whereas the other sectors of the country's development such as education and healthcare , are still underdeveloped .
Therefore , the public spending on the aged should be limited and more funds should be invested in these areas in order to secure the future of the county and maintain its competitiveness in this fast-paced world .
People would argue that more money should be spent by the government to the elderly , given that the elderly are the more disadvantaged group of the society .
Moreover , the government spending is only beneficial towards the active and healthy elderly , with lesser concern towards those who are unwell and not permitted to work .
And as old age is often associated with deteriorating health , the elderly will have trouble coping with the high medical costs .
Based on a text entitles "Doomsday Predictions about Population are Exaggerated" , writers Robert B Friedland and Laura Summer stated that large and long-term healthcare expenses will become a burden to the elderly , especially those who have not been able to save when they were young .
This would give even a larger burden to the working adults and taxes will definitely increase .
However , as we all know , the elderly only constitutes a smaller part of the society , and the younger ones in the social group must be taken care of the same way or more so than the elderly since they are the determinants of the country's future .
More money should not be invested on the healthcare of the elderly who are unwell and not fit for work since they do not have any other means to spend on with that much money given by the government , except for their medical fees .
Instead investing more money in education will increase the likeability of the younger people to secure better jobs , and enabling them to provide their elderly parents financial support , no matter in what condition their parents are in .
Based on the statistics obtained from a government statistical website , The level of education attainment among resident non-students aged 25-39 , despite increasing rapidly in the past few years , is still low at 70 percent in 2008   .This means that the government must set aside more money in instilling awareness of the importance of education towards the young .
This can be done by organizing campaigns , and through media such as advertisements and short documentaries .
The Global Campaign for Education for example , has campaigned in many countries in order to instill awareness towards the importance of education .
Therefore , by succeeding in education and secured better jobs , the working adults will ease the burden of the government from having to invest a lot of money to the welfare of the elderly .
In conclusion , the government has shown much concern to the elderly by investing a lot of money in their cause .
However , the amount of money invested way exceeds the amount they need .
Therefore , the amount of money that the government has obtained should be invested on the other important areas of development , such as education and healthcare .
A country needs to progress , and this would never be achieved by solving one part of the problem only , but all the parts that lead to the problem .
In developed countries such as the United States , Japan and Singapore , the aging population has been an important issue .
The Singapore government has implemented policies which have helped to solve problems arising from the aging process to a large extent .
The problems include a need for more health care services , increase in elder dependency on the government and draining the country's resources .
However , due to the growing aging population , further research is necessary in order to cater to this growing segment .
I will explore in-depth in the policies implemented by the Singapore government in the social aspect .
Another social problem will be elderly parents being abandoned at nursing homes or children living overseas and there is no one looking after their parents in Singapore .
However , recent study has found that "seniors here are generally well cared for by their children" .
Moreover , "two in three respondents pay for their senior's medical bills and keep them company" .
On the other hand , there is also a setback such that there will be another generation of elderly who are not prepared for their own retirement .
The reason being their income will be used to support elderly parents , to cover family expenses and provide for their children .
However , with the CPF scheme in place , there should be savings when they reach retirement age , but I will suggest that research has to be conducted to find out how much people will need to save for their retirement and whether the current CPF contribution rate is sufficient .
Moreover , compulsory insurance scheme can be introduced to ensure more savings .
The government is also "committing to a substantial expansion of the healthcare sector by investing $4 billion to restructure the heath care system to handle the aging population such as the development of community hospitals" .
Patients can then recuperate at these community hospitals which generate savings and increase efficiency on treatment of more acute cases .
In evaluating the government policies , I do agree that these are workable solutions to a large extent .
However , more research has to be done in order to keep elder dependency low and provide cost effective and affordable healthcare .
In 1950 , there were 205 million persons aged 60 or over throughout the world .
Fifty years later , the number of persons aged 60 or over increased about three times to 606 million .
Over the first half of the current century , the global population 60 or over is projected to expand by more than three times to reach nearly 2 billion in 2050 .
Aging population is defined as any person who is age 60 and above .
Hence , there is a lot of concern with whether the government is going to spend more money to help the aging population or otherwise .
If the money spent is not planned properly , there may be disastrous consequences .
The aged can still contribute to our society economically and socially , hence there is a need to allocate more money for them .
The aged can still help to develop and push the economy to greater heights since they still have the capability to work .
Public policies are put in place to motivate them to work harder .
One example would be the Central Providence Fund  in Singapore .
It is a savings account that the working class will put a certain percentage of their monthly salaries into .
This money can be used for themselves or their descendants .
Awards and money incentives are also given to those who have performed outstandingly in their fields of work .
The government should spent more money to come up with new awards as a form of motivation .
They are also the ones who will do all the "dirty" work like collecting garbage and sweeping the floor .
No degree holder will want to exchange their air-conditioned room for standing under the hot scorching sun .
Others may argue that the aged work and learn slower compared to a working adult , however , we must also consider the difference in their salary and job scope .
They may be slower but they do not complain .
No matter how much they earn , be it a little or a lot , they still contribute to the economy .
The aged have a lot of invaluable experiences which cannot be brought in terms of money .
We can still learn a lot from them .
It helps us to plan better , not making the mistakes that they have made in the past , as in the case of World War 2 .
The British thought that the Japanese will not attack through the forest; as a result , we were caught by surprise when they actually came in through the forest .
It is these experiences and mistakes that we learnt from and thus improving ourselves .
The government should spend more money on them for talks and teachings so that they are able to share their experiences with younger generation .
They can also publish self-improvement books .
People may argue that action speaks louder than words , since all the aged do is to talk , it will definitely sound easy .
Yet , it is through this life experiences that we are able to better plan and think of our future .
Hence , I believe that the government should spend more money to subside talks by the elderly .
With aging , the physical and mental parts of the human body will start to deteriorate with time .
As a result , there is a need for the government to spend more on elderly healthcare and rehabilitation centres .
Life expectancy across the world is increasing .
People are living longer and tend to fall sick more compared to the past .
What if they do not have enough money to see the doctor ?
Do we let them die on the streets ?
As the standard of living increases , a minor operation will cost at least a whopping $10 000 .
The medicine and the appointments to see the doctors are normally for a lifetime , which would mean more necessary costs .
Some of the elderly may not be eligible for the government policies because they do not fulfil certain requirements .
There are people who believed that the aged should fend for themselves .
However , if we take a closer look , we will see a vicious cycle where the problem will eventually fall back on the children and back to the economy since they will have a keep a portion of their salary for the medical bills .
In conclusion , the government must plan properly to allocate sufficient resources for the aged , yet not forgetting other aspects of the country .
As policies makers decide on how much resources to allocate , they must remember that these policies will be subjected to changes as everything else changes .
Hence , we must be flexible and focused to know which direction our country is heading towards and plan adequate resources properly .
Nowadays , the aging population has been one of the most worrying problems .
The percentage of people who are 65 years old and above in Singapore in 2008 was 8 .67%  .
For this reason , the government has been placing much emphasis on spending the budget for the aged .
However , in my opinion , the funding for the senior citizens should be cut back so that we could take full advantage of this amount of money to develop other fields to contribute to the country's growth .
Moreover , science should be appreciated more .
With more esteem , new technology is possible to be invented to help ease the aged .
From that point , old age is not appalling anymore .
People are more likely to work longer , and it is not necessary for the government to help them .
For example , studies have proved that insomnia in the elderly is probable to easily cure by non-drug therapies  .
This can be seen as a step forward to what we want to achieve .
Suppose that the science is properly concerned , no one knows whether it might create something which makes people ever young .
This thing , if happens , could be the most marvelous one that has ever happened in the world .
At that time , everybody , irrespective of age , is capable of increasing the productivity of their own country in particular and of the global village in general .
Then , aging population does not exist anymore , and this word would come out of the dictionary .
With the expansion of science , nothing seems hard to imagine and we have the right of hoping such world would become into existence .
Last but not least , opponents of this position would argue that senior citizens are also our own citizens , they need care from the government and the strategies above take many times to complete when the senior citizens cannot wait anymore .
However , based on what I have argued above , the government's concern to the aged still exist but should be limited to some extent to take care of the other's areas .
If the government continues to excessively worry about the senior citizens , it will be a good example to rely on the government .
They do not need to worry for their future during their early times because sooner or later they will be provided with help by the government .
This thing must be a disaster to a society .
Furthermore , to place more emphasis on other's areas such as education , science , etc .
is considered to be a visionary step to see to our aging population of our near of far future .
And as far as I am concerned , to run a country , we need to take interest in far view more than near view .
In short , "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to the other areas of the country's development" .
Two areas that can be invested more are education and science , which will make some differences in our aging population so that this problem would no longer be an awesome matter , but one of the proudest ones to be mentioned .
Aging population is now the uprising enigma that alarms the nation of its increasing elderly dependency and diminution of productivity .
The proportion of elderly Singapore residents aged 65 and above had increased from 7 .4% in 2003 to 8 .5% in 2006 .
The number shall increase further as the proportion of children below 15 years has steadily declined from 28% in 1980 to 19 .3% in 2006 .
It is undeniable that Singapore is facing the emerging healthcare ramifications due to the aging process .
Thus , the healthcare medical advancement indubitably has a pivotal role in easing the aging progression .
Additional healthcare facilities and services are to be provided in line with the aging process .
The escalating figure of aging population will certainly increase the numbers of patients afflicted to intricate diseases such as Ischaemic heart diseases .
With aging population , the likelihood of patients suffering from multiple organ failure will start to augment too .
Nonetheless , the number of hospitalizations due to such medical conditions may amplify as well .
In order to rectify the homeward bound predicament , not only more elderly friendly facilities have to be constructed , but the critical care medical treatment and surgery is chiefly required too .
However , this could point out to be a major hitch as there is an emerging need for critical care programmes .
Various medical institutions should offer trainings and preparations to medical professional personnel to equip them with the necessity to countenance the upcoming crisis .
In addition , with the robust production of supplementary healthcare products nowadays , the level of personal healthiness of the elderly can be much maintained .
Taking healthcare products such as natural vitamins and mineral salts is able to build up one's immunity system against viral and bacterial infections .
It is often said that prevention is better than cure .
These supplementary products not only can fortify one's immunity system , but also improve one's mind alertness and body vigor .
Elderly should be taking complementary healthcare products to strengthen their body against diseases as we well as retaining their mental alertness .
At this point one may wonder that whether the manufactured supplementary healthcare products are safe to be consumed as there are cases that the products are proven to be potentially health hazardous .
However , numerous measures have been imposed by authorities such as the Health Sciences Authority to insure that the merchandises are secured to be utilised .
Nonetheless , consumer themselves have to prudent when selecting the varieties of healthcare products .
In conclusion , progress of development in healthcare needs have to always be maintained at a high pace as the tempo of aging progression hastens .
More funds should be provided to increase more research and development in the pharmaceutical and medical sciences fields as well as importing more advance technologies .
This would largely aid in resolving the predicaments of declining personal health system that an aging population will encounter .
Peter G . Peterson concludes that global aging may still impose unsustainable fiscal and economic burden unless the developed countries confront the daunting problem of rising healtcare cost and how to set limits on healthcare .
Yet , insufficient healthcare development spending may degenerate the health standards of the nation and so , in turn reduces productivity even more significantly .
Public spending should therefore be more focus on providing excellent healthcare facilities and services which would benefits and eases the growing health crisis amidst the aging population .
"As Singapore becomes accustomed to being an affluent and rapidly ageing society , the issue of financing the aged has become more pressing requiring reassessment of the existing arrangements ."
Should the Singapore government spend more on the aged or should the money be diverted to other areas of the country's development ?
By generating economic growth for the country , the aged would also benefit .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Many argue that limiting public spending on the elderly would only leave individuals and their families to face issues pertaining to education , housing , social services and transportation .
By cutting expenditure on welfare programs for the elderly , individuals and families are more responsible for a larger share of the elderly costs .
They would need to provide the cost for their own old age dependency , according to Robert B . and Laura S . in Doomsday .
Besides , such costs may even be bigger than the original cost of running welfare programs for the elderly .
In addition , limiting public spending on the aged would mean that individuals have to provide the cost for their own old age dependency .
This is a beneficial for the country as people learn to depend on themselves .
They would be able to able to work better , attain higher income so as to help support education , housing , social services and rising cost of transportation for themselves .
It would be more practical in a case when there is economic downturn and the government is not able to spend on the aged .
"An aging population will push up pension and healthcare costs , forcing major increases in public spending that could slow economic growth in rich and poor countries ."
Clearly , as Singapore experiences the problem of ageing population , it is important to generate economic growth for the country and benefit the aged .
Higher expenditure on areas like infrastructure and education , allows the country to achieve greater economic growth which this in turn solve the problems of aging population .
With better economic and social condition in the country , people would become richer and affluent .
This would then reduce the worries of individuals and their families about issues pertaining to education , housing , social services and transportation .
But even though there are schemes to make people save for their aged now , the older generation who have little or no education , are not able to comprehend what these schemes are about and what benefits do they get .
Therefore they need the aid of the government to help them cope with their medical issues and their daily lives .
More elderly friendly facilities along neighbourhood should be built and good values such as giving up seats to the elderly should be taught to the public to help the elderly get along with their daily lives .
Like in Singapore , there are priority seats for elderly so that they do not have to stand for long distances .
If money were to be diverted to other area of developments , the problem of ageing population will still persists , the situation might worsen as they may not know how to support themselves and cause even more social problems .
Therefore public spending is essential , it should not be limited to assist the developments of other areas of development and neglect the major problem of ageing population that many countries face .
However , many social problems caused by the elderly are mainly due to the lack of education .
More resources should be allocated to develop the country's education system so as to ensure the continuous supply of good labour and also to educate the public the importance of self-reliance .
With more people receiving education , they will understand the importance of planning for their future and develop the culture of taking care of themselves and their elderly .
Therefore , funding for the aged should be limited so as to allow the other areas of development such as the education sector which have a greater impact on society to thrive .
"Over the past two decades , journalists and scholars have periodically commented on how rising public spending for older people is expected to threaten if not erode public commitments to other deserving groups ."
said Paul W . Newacheck  .
Public spending is money expended from the government to pay for the country's expenses  .
The money can come from different sources , with the majority coming from taxation .
For instance , the tax policy in Singapore is drawn out based on the notion of guiding desirable behaviour towards different economic and social goals .
Therefore , public spending should not emphasize only social , but also economic development of the country .
However , there are many emerging concerns about the ageing society in many developed countries .
Limiting public spending for the aged may in turn bring about social problems; major issues regarding family responsibilities and dignity .
As the percentage of the aged increases , the percentage of people generating income in the country diminishes .
Without the government to shoulder part of the burden , most immediate families of the elderly will find it financially taxing on their part .
In worse cases , cash-strapped children will be unwilling to take care of them due to the high standards of living and healthcare costs increasing each year .
This problem falls back on society , as abandoned parents will be left to fend for themselves  .
A research in Singapore shows that the Geylang East Home for the Aged , a shelter for elderly abandoned by their family , said that its 37-bed home is always full .
In many cases , the families of these abandoned aged just passed their responsibility to another institution .
Also , I feel that most elderly people have a strong sense of dignity and self worth , considering their lifelong achievements and efforts throughout the years  .
These people are most probably not going to turn to government's aid even if their own families reject them .
Without the government's initiatives , the elderly people are going to go through a hard time coping in the society .
Secondly , education and learning are important factors attributing to one country's success .
With the society changing constantly , the monetary support which the government can provide is only temporary .
Often , people need to improve themselves to keep up with the demands and needs of their surrounding milieu .
For example , investing on current employees to advance their expertise in the workplace can land them with better promotion prospects and job security .
Equipping the younger generation with relevant skills can also allow them higher chances of securing better jobs of their preferences in the future .
Also , the government can educate these people about their responsibilities by emphasizing the role of the family in caring for the elderly  .
With better jobs and increase in income , they can help the families in coping with the high standards of living and spiraling healthcare costs for the aged .
As a result , social stability can be fulfilled while economic growth is being spurred .
All in all , limiting public spending on the aged and directing on other areas of development such as businesses , education and healthcare is more rewarding then just focusing on the needy groups .
Although the help is theoretically superficial , it is indirectly helping the society to deal with the ageing society more effectively than using the monetary support , which is a temporary solution .
This solution is made much easier when we understand the bigger picture .
If we do not pay attention to the long term effects the problem is going to cause , we will risk the possibility of allocating the limited resources for the wrong usage .
The aged might have devoted their youth and even their whole life to serving the society , public spending on the aged is therefore necessary .
In fact , every one of us either doing mental or physical work , have made a significant contribution towards the development of society .
One's life to go through a juvenile , youth , middle-aged and older period is an irresistible law of nature .
Hence , as long as a person has sacrificed for the social development , then , when he is old and no longer contribute his own force in his area of work , the state government should give him his deserved rewards by taking care of their future .
Clearly , the public spending on the aged should be conserved to protect the rights and benefits of the aged .
The aged have dedicated so much to the development of country that they should be thanked .
Reduced public spending will increase the burden of the children and furthermore , poor people will become poorer .
We should care for the aged despite only considering for the sake of economic interests .
In fact , we all grow old one day .
According to Singapore Department of Statistic , the life expectancy of Singaporean has increased noticeably to 78 .0 for male and to 82 .8 for female  .
Although that is good news proving for Singapore's success; as other developed nations , it also leads to some unpleasant consequences for Singapore such as raising the financial burden for elderly-caring .
From my perspective , economic development is not only the key factor easing the aging but also is the key solution for some serious problems caused by this process .
First of all , judging this issue from one particular angle , it is commonly believed that well-funded life which rises from economic success will help people to be able to purchase sufficient food for their own demands .
At the same time , there are more facilities supplying for human needs on physical exercise , such as pools for swimming , courts for playing tennis , indoor gyms for various kind of sports .
With the financial sufficiency , people can ease their life and avoid dangerous work by using some helpful equipment .
For instance , living in air-conditioning building helps us confront with hot summer and cold winter or using remote robots reduces the cost of lives in some high-risk jobs .
In the other words , as a result of the spreading of economic , we have been enjoyed a better physically-healthy life .
At the second point , economic development also encourages the improvement of services which support human life .
Among of them , entertainment industry should be mentioned as the most noticing one .
Together with its urging , more and more entertainment parks , visual and virtual products such as films and games come into our life .
Moreover , the expansion of consultation services and the growth of tourism have considerably contributed to satisfying our mental demands .
For example , a typical citizen in a globalised city , such as Tokyo or London , now can enjoy the weekend-time in a hundred destinations for recreation and some of them are world-wide known .
Alternatively , they can stay at home and choose among tens of local and international channels to watch or can surf internet to visit millions of websites .
Indeed , it is no doubt that they all have been enriched the human mental life .
What is more , a prosperous economy can also foster further technological invention , medical innovation as well as educational improvement which all are considered as important factors alleviating the aging process .
Once government sufficiently finances medical research , more diseases can be cured or prevented more effectively .
In the same pattern , once the educational level is raised , people can be more aware of how to take care of themselves as well as to live long and healthily .
At last , the rapid development of nation's economy not only makes the aging slow down but also partially solves its annoying consequences .
Among of its consequences , Peter G . Peterson on the article "A Gray World" raised his concern on the huge expenses for elderly caring services  .
To my way of thinking , economic factors should be the most considerable solution .
As discussed above , financial sufficiency can urge the improvement of the other factors .
Accordingly , people enjoy and better health with a longer age which enables them to stay in work for a longer time .
Since they are also healthy , they can contribute to society as long as they intend to .
In addition , financial factors are also incentives for long-life working , as they can support the current life and save more for the rest of life if they decide to keep working .
There is a citation from Frank Field , British chairman of the all-party committee: "If you look at life expectancy in 1948 , when the state pension was introduced , and take that as a reasonable length of time to receive a pension , you would have a retirement age of 74 today ."
.
In conclusion , today developed countries have been increasingly confronted with the aging process and its consequences .
In the common thought , all economics , science , social policy contribute to easing this process but economic factor attracts most of our concerns as it should be viewed as the most important one .
All things are considered , a prosperous economy not only lengthens the life expectancy but also make people live more healthily and lighten social burden on elderly-caring .
While the population is shifting towards a greying one , many would start to worry about the ease of aging in the current society , especially amidst the time of financial crisis and difficulty .
Current research and development such as medical advancement and barrier free housing estates are examples that have helped ease the aging process .
However , more emphasis should be placed on the development of social policy helping to alleviate and address concerns such as the lack of financial support and social care , as it affects the elderly more directly .
Meanwhile , there are already policies in place , such as the Central Provident Fund  , Lease Buy Back Scheme  and housing grants for married children staying near parents , which are all structured to aid the aged in terms of financial and healthcare issues .
Central Provident Fund is a savings account for all workers in Singapore to set aside a sum of 33 percent of their wages for retirement purposes while working .
This sum of money will serve as a source of income when one cannot work in the future due to old age .
On top of that , a subset of the CPF called the Medisave account , will serve as a backup sum to pay for any medical bills should the need arises .
Thereby , they would not have to strain their pockets to pay for healthcare when they have already stopped working .
At this juncture , one may wonder how could the Medisave account be sufficient when medical fees these days are so steep .
Common illnesses such as stroke would already chalk up thousands for treatment and things could be a lot worse , should there be more than one illness to treat .
However , this could be solved by purchasing Medishield or third party healthcare insurance using the Medisave itself .
The insurance will serve to cover most of the medical expenses , if not all .
In the event that an individual is not able to pay the minimum amount , they can apply for the Medifund , which is an endowment plan funded by the nation's economic growth , targeted to help those who still cannot afford to pay the bills despite already being heavily subsided .
With these in place , the aged will be well taken care of and have a peace of mind , in monetary aspect , living in a more comfortable environment during old age .
For those elderly who have funds but are locked in the area of housing assets , have a solution too .
Just recently in March 2009 , the government has introduced the Lease Buy Back Scheme  for elderly to sell off their tail end thirty years lease of their flats in return for life-long monthly retirement income .
These elderly will stand to enjoy a supplement to their retirement income on top of what they are receiving from CPF payout .
Depending on the age group , an amount ranging from $500 to $800 will be issued to them monthly after an upfront sum of $5000 .
Again , we can see how public policy has shaped to help the elderly have a less financial taxing aging process .
Opponents of this position may argue that the opposite may take place instead .
Rather than having the married couple to look after their parents , it might be the children exploiting the convenience of their parents , living off them or even increasing the burden on them such as treating them as babysitters for their own children .
Nevertheless , taking this situation from another point of view actually aligns with the government's aim: fostering mutual care between the young and elderly .
By housing them in vicinity , it actually adds livelihood and purpose to the lives of the elderly as well .
"That's why fitness facilities , children's playground and elderly exercise equipment are put together" quoted Mr Mah BT  in a housing speech .
All this contributes to making the aging process a more fruitful and meaningful one .
In the presence of these numerous social policies , many aspects of the aging process have been well covered by the government and this has served to mitigate some of the most common concerns among the elderly .
These policies have benefited the elderly and will continue to provide assistance to them in the future .
Therefore , it is evident that current research and policies have helped to ease the aging process and make retirement a less burdensome one .
To a large extent , I strongly agree that medical advancement have helped to ease the aging process .
In Singapore context , it states that 8% of the Singapore's population is over the age of 65 and by 2035 it will increase to 20% .
Hence , medical advancement will prove to be beneficial for the aging population in Singapore .
Despite the above mentioned , I would like to stress that not the entire aging population can access to the medical advancement .
The reason is because medical advancement is too costly in Singapore .
As such , a lot of aging population in Singapore will not be able to afford the high fees for medical advancement that includes the use of advance technology in medicine and treatments .
This might also lead to the sign of withdrawal from part of the population who would choose not to seek any medical help due to their affordability of the fees for medical advancement .
On the other hand , this arising problem has alerted the government to offer financial aids for the needy aging population in Singapore .
The Singapore government has been actively promoting awareness of health care issues among the elderly population in general .
The Ministry of Health  has recently launched insurance financial plans for elder care .
The names of the insurance plans were called Eldershield and Eldershield Supplements  .
These programs will help provide helping hands for all needy aging population in Singapore .
This also encourage all the needy aging population in Singapore to sign up this insurance plan for them .
The reason for doing this is because the needy aging population in Singapore will be covered by this insurance plan .
Thus , when they want to use this insurance plan for any emergency uses , they can use it anytime .
Premiums for this insurance plan can also be made from Medisave .
Thus , all the needy aging population in Singapore will be taken care of by the Singapore government .
As such , families from aging population can also go to the respective hospitals to seek for financial aids for the medical advancement .
The Singapore government will be providing subsidy for all the elderly when they seek for medical advancement .
Thus , with the solutions given by the Singapore government , it will help all the aging population to gain an equal entitlement to the medical advancement .
Last but not least , I strongly agree that medical advancement have eased through the aging process with the help of the Singapore government .
Thus , this also shows that all the aging population in Singapore is being well taken care of by the Singapore government .
With the budget given by the government , the aging population in Singapore will be given an equal entitlement to the medical advancement so as to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
Do you agree ?
Introduction
It is always a thorny issue when it comes to allocation of the budget pie for the country's development .
Whether is it for educational , economical , societal or military advancement , it is of paramount importance that policy makers make suitable decisions in the best interests of the country and its people .
In my opinion , channeling too much government funds to taking care of the aged can have detrimental effects on the country's development .
Therefore , I am for the statement that public spending on the aged should be limited .
Uncontrolled government spending on healthcare or infrastructure for the aged could result in other groups of needy people not getting their share of the government's financial aid .
These include the handicapped , juvenile delinquents and low income families .
These less privileged groups of people are also members of the society who require our assistance .
Not attending to their needs may have serious impact on the society .
People from low income families struggling to make ends meet may be desperate and might resort to robbery and burglary to ease their financial burden .
Teenagers who engage in unlawful behaviours that defy established criminal codes or deviate from societal norms may continue with their misbehaviours such as running away from school or home , or even petty crimes , if they fail to receive help from respective government bodies and the community .
These are complex social problems that might significantly impact other members of the society , and hence , development of the country , if not handled appropriately .
Public funding is also required in the development of our education sector as Singapore continue to establish herself as an education hub .
In Singapore , the importance of education cannot be over emphasized .
Large amount of funds are pumped into the education sector so that the younger generation can receive the best education .
These could be in the form of better school sports and laboratory facilities , more funding for enrichment courses or even upgrading of school compound to accommodate more students .
On the hindsight , funding could also imply subsidies for needy students .
Students under Finance Assistant Scheme  could be provided with school uniforms , school shoes and basic school materials .
Merit bursaries and scholarships can be awarded to students who excelled in their academic and exhibit positive traits and qualities in other aspects of their life .
Singapore also has a mandatory six years Primary Education for all Singaporean .
Financial aid will be needed to ensure that poor families , who cannot afford to send their children to school , could do so .
The ministry stands by the notion that no deserving student should be deprived of education .
As former president of the United State of America once said , "Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education .
The human mind is our fundamental resource ."
It is clear that education is one of the key aspects for the progress of a nation .
Without sufficient funds from the government , these plans cannot be implemented to the fullest extent .
People often mention that Singapore only have got human resource .
Not developing our resources' full potential through education will indeed impede our country's development .
If significant amount of funds are needed in the education sector , there is then a need to limit expenditure on the aged .
It is difficult to draw the line as to who should be given how much of government's budget .
But it is important to realize that , channeling funds into the education sector for example may bring about more productive future generation who would in turn help to support the old aged in time to come .
In comparison , diverting funds to support the aged would appear to have no returns .
Diverting funds to other areas can be regarded as a better "investment" by policy makers and would aid in the country's development .
In conclusion , the government has to carry out careful planning on public spending .
Channeling excessive budget or limiting any one of the areas is not beneficial to the country's development .
The Government has to make critical decisions , reviewing their decisions regularly , so as to determine which aspects of the country's development should be the main focus at different period of time .
In the long run , the government must seek to make aging more secure for the older generation , at the same time less burdensome for the younger generation .
Perhaps government should introduce policies which could add value to the aged workers , in turn increasing their productivity .
Not try to accommodate the aging issue while limiting public spending on the aged .
With their vast knowledge and rich experience from the many years of contributing to the society , the aged would definitely be an important resource the country could tap on .
In the highly modernized world , most democratic countries depend on their government for support in an array of areas , usually in the form of monetary support .
Such financial supports by the government are termed as public spending .
A principal source of income for public spending comes from taxation .
As widely known , taxation is very limited and thus public spending has to be circumscribed .
Hence the efficient allocation of funds on public spending is deemed important as there public spending is definitely not able to cover the amount of funds required by the entire society .
Hence , the question as to how much we should spend on an area compared to another emanates .
Public spending are funds that are used on the society and the aged certainly has a share of it as well .
Diverting much of the public spending to different areas of the country's development is certainly abominable as we would be leaving the defenseless aged to fend themselves against the numerous problems that surface while aging .
Hence , we should limit the spending on the elderly , but only to a small extent so as not to create another problem to the elderly which adds on to their already heavy burden .
In a pragmatic view , channeling large amounts of funds to the developments of the country such as research and development and education would in the long run benefit the country's economic growth .
However , it would be morally wrong to leave the elderly who are part of the society alone .
The elderly did contribute much to the country in their younger age and the society should be obliged to look after them when they are older and not cast them aside .
Furthermore , public spending is made for everyone in the society to enjoy and seek help from and we cannot limit the funds for the elderly just because they are not able to produce any returns after enjoying the funds .
Therefore we should not limit public spending to a large extent .
With changing values in the developed countries , people are giving birth to fewer children .
This change in mindset changes the percentage of young against the old .
As a result , the percentage of old is certainly rising rapidly .
With increasing amount of people turning into old age , the portion of the public spending on the aged should not be decreasing instead .
Nonetheless , the focus of a country is to grow and prosper and developments on other areas are seemingly more important .
Therefore , the society has to maintain a high standard of living as a developed world and since elderly is the bulk of the society; we should spend more to help improve their live so as not to lower our overall standard of living .
Hence we should spend on other developments but not to the expense of forgoing that for the elderly .
The aging process is an inevitable part of life .
It brings about physical , emotional and social changes that affect individuals significantly .
Following developments and advancements around the world , governments of developed nations are faced with the challenge of a fast aging population .
For example , in Singapore , it was reported that by the year 2030 , one in five residents will be 65 years or older , a significant shift compared to one in twelve residents in the year 2005 .
CITATION The04 \l 1033  .
As Singapore has limited resources , there is much concern about how much of the resources the government should spend on the aged .
However , public spending on the aged should not be sacrificed even in the face of practical realities as society has a moral duty to take care of the elderly .
The significance of limiting public spending on the aged is the shift of financial burden to the individuals and their families .
When government spending on the aged is cut down , it leaves the individuals and their families to shoulder a larger portion of the costs involved .
The financial allocation for the different usages and needs in the family have to be reconsidered as a result .
Adult children face with the dilemma between providing for their aged parents or supporting their young children education .
In most cases , the aged would be neglected or a few may even be abandoned in nursing homes .
CITATION Sal09 \l 1033  .
This gives rise to the social implications like the issue of filial piety that would have a negative impact on society .
The elderly had commendable contribution to the society when they were younger and active in the workforce .
Being an active part of the workforce in their earlier days , the elderly had contributed to the country's economy in a way .
They had played their part in the economy by being a tax payer in the country and bringing investment to Singapore by being productive and efficient members of the workforce .
Furthermore , the elderly had undergone experiences that differed significantly from the younger generations .
The lessons , skills and knowledge learnt through these experiences could be important and useful to the younger generations in dealing with the present and future challenges .
Hence , the elderly has significant contribution to the country even as they aged , which provides a strong background for the government and society to provide for the elderly .
The Asian moral values provides for individuals to help and respect their elders .
The elder population is seen to be knowledgeable with the ability to impart valuable lessons and experiences to the younger generation .
Furthermore , the elderly had worked in bringing up the younger generation .
Hence , in Asian culture , there is moral obligation to care and provide for the elderly .
While there is strong presence of moral obligation to care for the elderly , it cannot be denied that there are other groups of people who are similarly in need of government financial help .
For instance , the physically impaired population requires extensive medical needs which require government funding .
However , the elderly make up a large part of the population and is estimated to be on the rise as the years progress .
CITATION The04 \l 1033  .
Whereas , the physically impaired make up a relatively small part of the population in comparison and is present in different cluster of people .
It would thus , be more feasible for the physically impaired to turn to communal help from charitable organization than for the elder to turn to these organization for aids .
Hence , it would be a wiser choice for the government to provide for the elderly population as the huge population will require a significantly large amount of funding .
The challenges of an aging population will continue to increase as the years progress , and the issues arising from it are multifaceted .
However , this does not mean that we should limit public spending on the aged on the basis of their decreased efficiency and productivity to society .
Instead , moral responsibilities should be taken into consideration in policy planning , in order for planners to make acceptable policies for the community .

Report on the Ageing Population  .
Allocation of the state's budget has to be justifiable .
With competing interests that necessitate public spending , public spending on the aged would most likely be restricted .
Our government needs to be pragmatic in its allocation of financial resources .
Areas of country's developments such as expanding on economic capability through business investment , allocating financial resources on infrastructure and technology , and investing on human capital place greater importance than providing to the financial needs of aged .
In fact , a more prosper economy should provide the economic means to support the public spending on the aged .
Thus , managing the economy should come first .
A pragmatic government would rather channel resources to other areas of country's developments .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should and will be limited .
Economic growth is the basis to substantiate the monetary and social welfare benefits for the aged people .
In most countries , a large fiscal budget is on the engines of economic growth .
In Singapore , the engines of growth are from the tourism sector and knowledge and research intensive industries .
In tourism sector , the focus is on two integrated resorts which are currently being developed .
It is critical for such investments to establish as it provides employment opportunities .
Increase in tourism arrivals and the attraction of high end consumers will result in generation of high tourism revenues and revenues from high end retail shops .
On the other hand , knowledge and capital intensive industries have started up quite recently in Singapore .
Fusionpolis , Biopolis and business hubs are set up in various parts of Singapore .
With all these economic developments , our economy can be expanded and sustained .
A stronger economy leads to higher household income .
Consequently , a larger tax base should then sufficiently provide a larger portion of public finances for the aged .
History reminds us of the contributions by our forefathers .
It is thus the responsibility of the society to look after them .
In countries such as United Kingdom , welfare system and pension scheme are in place .
In contrast , public spending for the aged is limited in Singapore .
We can increase public spending on aged , but it will compromise financial resources allocated for the general population .
In fact , investment should be on nurturing of our people as they are contributors to the economy .
Through training , re-training and investing on quality education , it nurtures the people .
Educational institutions provide quality teaching while re-training centres impart new skills so that skills do not become obsolete .
More public finance on aged will compromise the investments on human capital .
In addition , it only satisfies the social and moral obligations to the aged .
Being pragmatic , we should look towards creating a future for ourselves and the future generation .
In addition , the aged are not the only ones who require monetary support , other needy groups , such as handicaps , also require monetary support to fund their healthcare needs .
Therefore , the emphasis is not just on the aged .
Nonetheless , the aged will also benefit monetarily when the economy prospers and tax payment has increased .
Most countries have embraced the wonders of technology .
Like the rest of the countries , Singapore has infused huge financial resources on investment for technological upgrades and infrastructural developments .
The installation of an islandwide wireless broadband service is one of the recent technological upgrades .
With this service provision , it enables everyone to stay connected .
Apart from the improvement in telecommunication , our transport network has recently been extended , with an addition of Circle Line route , which doubles the MRT stations by 2020 .
With greater accessibility on public transport system , it improves efficiency and reduces travelling time for most people .
Although these projects have huge cost borne by the government , the benefits still outweigh the cost .
Society benefits as these developments can be accessed by the public .
In addition , both of these long term provisions will reap in profits .
In comparison to public funds on aged , government only serves the social responsibility of looking after the aged .
In conclusion , aged people cannot rely on government to take full responsibility for their needs since there are other priorities in country's developments which will create job opportunities , greater economic revenues , convenience and efficiency .Though Government has a social responsibility to look after the aged , families should take up the bulk of responsibility for caring and providing essential needs .
With more competing interests for financial resources , public finance on aged is least of a concern .
it will definitely put a strain on the economic budget and reaps no economic returns if public spending on aged has no limits .
In many countries , there is a common similarity , a baby-boomer period .
Now , another similarity that most nations are facing is the ageing population .
Countries are aware that this issue is pervasive and it will have profound implications to the facets of the society if they are not responding fast to it .
However , the question is , how much of a focus should a country place in it when there are other important areas to look at as well ?
With the stiff competition amongst nations , public spending on the aged should be spend only if necessary , but more focus should be place in other aspects like for example , education , tourism and security which are the key factors to a country's economy and thus the survival of it .
Funds placed in these aspects can help ease the ageing process in the long run , critically looking at minimizing the dependency of the aged on the governments .
I believe that measures to ease ageing issues can be done at low cost and effective at the same time .
There are several viable methods .
Strong emphasis of family support and educating the aged about taking responsibility of themselves for example like filial obligation , insurance , healthy lifestyle , financial planning and ensuring they have enough retirement fund .
There are more private sectors dealing in health and nutrition , financial consultants to help in the management of assets .
More support could be given to all these sectors from the government .
It is more of a one time method , when inculcated to become a habit and trend .
To those who are not educated , information may not reach out to them; funds still has to be allocated to help them .
These are necessary spending that is unavoidable .
The aged should not be forgotten but spending on them needs to be limited , spend only if needed .
However , this will require the whole community's effort to make sure that cultivation of moral values; virtues are deeply rooted in them .
This is to ensure that the future batch of elderly are well-prepared for their own ageing process and not just wait for the government to take care of them .
Public spending on aged can then be reduce much more and more must be placed in other developments that can bring prosperity to the nation and minimize social issues .
With much credit to swift medical advancements , average life span of a human being in America has shot up by 5 years in just a decade to 82 years today .
Such increase in longevity and the reduce in birth rates , will no doubt lead to an inevitable rise to the problems of aging , as there are fewer and fewer young people to support the rising number of elderly , whether financially or socially .
Aging is a big issue , governments from all over the world are pushing forward policies and Research and Developments to stem its economical and social impacts to a country .
The number one killer of elderly is heart failure .
For instance , in Australia , 5% of all the people aged 65 and above suffers from heart failure .
Although some elderly who suffers gentle heart failure could still maintain a relatively normal life , those who suffer to a severe extent have their day-to-day activities affected .
They no longer have the ability to pursue a normal and perhaps happy life .
However with R&D in the area of heart-related diseases , led to the developments of new drugs and treatments to control and reduce the effects of heart failures to their everyday life .
Hence our current R&Ds have no doubt helped elderly by increasing their quality of life .
All in all , aging is part of the natural life cycle of an organism .
Everyone has a role to play to solve the persisting aging problem in many developed societies .
Policies to upgrade housing in Singapore have improved the living conditions of the elderly , together with the setting up of the senior citizens' corners , I am convinced that the elderly can now participate more actively in the society and live off with a higher social well being .
As for the improvements in current R&D , we can all anticipate more ground-breaking inventions to relief elderly of pains from illness .
Also , having the elderly joining into the workforce can increase the total productivity and reduce the burden piled on family members .
Nonetheless , I am convicted to feel that current research and developments/ policies do play an important role to help ease the arduous aging process .
In this ever competitive world , the idea of the weak being more susceptible to elimination and the strong emerging victorious is not unfounded .
Indeed , this concept is applicable to a real life context in our society - the old versus the young workers .
The society now has this notion that the old would eventually become obsolete , exhausted and unproductive .
However , the aged has come a long way before they hit the supposed end of their economic lifespan .
Without their contributions , the modern society might not even exist .
The State has a certain responsibility to provide for the old .
To simply cut back funds on the grounds that the elderly could no longer yield any economic profits is an irresponsible act .
The old is worthy of every resources spent on them as they are still important assets to the nation .
In Singapore , much emphasis has been placed on providing a holistic education .
Children are spoilt for choices when it comes to choosing their desired education route and with a fourth university in the planning , learning has never been easier .
Nevertheless , no matter how refined the education system is , it could never instil moral values in children which are critical in tackling the ageing problem .
The State only has a partial duty in alleviating the situation of the elderly; the rest would belong to their closest kin .
Changing norms and mindsets coupled with an increasingly high standard of living though , is driving children to abandon their parents .
With no one to rely on or any proper financial aid , the elderly would be unable to fend for themselves and perhaps left homeless .
This would result in a degrading of the society as the wandering aged would eventually resort to desperate measures such as begging , stealing and possibly dying on the streets .
The increase in life expectancy would indicate a growing pool of aged workers .
As this segment of the population becomes more significant , spending is unavoidable .
In fact , the resources allocated do not have to be solely for the old as other sectors could also seek betterment from it .
For instance , the Lift Upgrading Programme  benefits the old as well as the disabled and the general citizens .
The society must avoid the pitfalls of classifying and relating old age to low productivity .
Ageing does not equate to redundancy .
The elderly have had accumulated a considerable amount of refined expertise that are still of societal use .
Instead of seeing them as a sector that would yield no returns , the old should be considered as an investment where providing them opportunities to share their experiences would enable the young to gain precious knowledge and learn from past mistakes .
This would pave the way for a more meaningful future for the subsequent ageing generation .
For countries with small population such as that of Singapore , there exists the need to recruit foreign talents to fuel their economy .
Reduced tax rates , solid infrastructure and business-tailored policies are some of strategies utilized by the local government .
However , this would not sustain the interest in foreigners if the country lacks an appealing living condition .
One way to retain these foreigners is to improve on the welfare system for the aged .
This is not a totally farfetched approach based on the previous case where Singapore established a comprehensive child care system that resulted in many expatriates moving their family over to work and dwell here .
We could similarly use an impeccable retirement scheme to entice them to settle down permanently .
By making Singapore a better place for old age , it could resolve the issue of a diminutive pool of human resources as well as boost the State's economy .
All in all , the elderly should not be viewed as incapable of providing any further services to the nation .
Rather than condemning their low productivity , we should incorporate the old into our community for they had garnered experiences which are of practical use to the young .
The State share a part in supporting the elderly for these are the people who had have a hand in nation building and morphing the society which we lived in now .
Spending on the old does not denote an economic dead end .
To the contrary , the old has the potential to open new doors and bring about more opportunities both within and into the country .
Taking care of the aged is now a global issue that no country can steer clear of .
Some people might think that we should take a pragmatic approach and ignore the needs of the elderly as they can no longer serve the society .
However , who can deny that our older generations have contributed immensely to our society ?
No one can also be sure that all the aged people can lead good lives without any federal help .
Therefore , no matter whether it is due to moral obligation or for fulfilling one's responsibility , compromising public spending on other areas of the country's development for the aged is unavoidable .
It is true that by doing so , a country's development and productivity will suffer .
Nevertheless , I believe that as long as the government is able to obtain a balance in the areas of public spending , the country's development can still progress without limiting public spending on the aged .
It is only right for us to take care of the aged as they contributed a great deal to what we have now .
Without the hard work of the older generation , we would not have the fundamental of our society .
We can only prosper with a strong foundation , which the elderly had given us .
As a result , when they become feeble and require assistance , we should lend them a helping hand .
Not to mention , it is also a moral value to take care of the elderly .
However , spending money on them could have disadvantaged other groups of needy people .
For instance , it could have deprived the children in low income families from education .
Therefore , there is a need to organize strong branches of organizations , like Community Development Councils  , to decide who to help in extreme cases .
The government should also engage in long term solution , like Research and Development , to save money .
This would ensure the welfare fund is being distributed evenly .
To add on , Declining spending on the aged could have roused social problems .
Cases of conflicts over money problems at home; elderly loitering in void decks and parks; lonely elderly died and only discovered after a few days had passed , are not unheard of .
Reducing funds on this growing age group could cause these problems as the attention paid towards them would then be cut .
Some mentioned that it should be the children's responsibility to take care of elderly and some of the problems are inevitable .
Nonetheless , Government intervention can minimize the possibility of having these problems .
The Maintenance of Parents Act is one good example of government intervention to make taking care of elderly mandatory when necessary .
Under CPF Hosing Grant , there is now an incentive to live near parents too .
Thus , there is more likelihood for the younger generation to take care of their parents .
If the government can put in enough funds for the elderly and handle the aging problem holistically , this would benefit the country in the long run .
Working class Singaporean would be motivated to work hard as they know government would contribute in taking care of them as they aged .
This could stimulate economic growth .
Foreign talents would also be attracted to migrate here when we establish a welfare state image .
There is a worry that the diversion of spending could also result in a country's slow growth and low productivity .
Nevertheless , countries with more limited expenditure do no better or worse economically than countries with high social expenditure .
Taking Denmark for example , it is a welfare state , but yet , it is one of the top countries in income ranking  It is also important to implement measures that require people to rely on oneself rather than government .
On the whole , a country's public spending requires very delicate planning .
Since the aging population is one big issue now , necessary spending on the aged cannot be stingily kept away .
Not only is it due to moral obligation , ignoring the aging population would also result in other social problems that might be even more difficult to solve .
As the government wants to maintain a country's development , public spending on the aged should be limited but not to the minimal .
It should be at the maximum limit where the government can still withstand so as to help as many elderly as possible .
A nation's success does not solely depend on economic growth but the welfare aspect too .
Therefore with careful planning of expenditure , solving aging problem generously would benefit the country in long run .
One of the many important points to take note for an aging society is the fact that the elders' physical ability , such as walking and bathing , would tend to deteriorate over time .
Therefore attention needs to be paid , to ensure a safe environment for the elders to live in .
The Singapore government acknowledged this requirement by introducing the studio apartments and the HDB lift-upgrading projects .
In January 09 , HDB stated that they would be building more studio apartments for the elderly .
These studio apartments were equipped with elderly-friendly features such as non- slip toilet tiles , grab poles and they are small , easy to upkeep while being offered at an affordable price .
The upgrading of lifts in the older flats , so that the lifts stops at every floor of the HDB flats also helped to ensure barrier-free accessibility for the elders .
However , some problems cropped up for the lift-upgrading projects .
Mainly due to the fact that not every flat was suitable to undergo lift-upgrading project and money were needed from the elderly in order for the projects to take place .
To minimize these problems , subsidies were given out for the projects .
Overall , all these facilities would help to create a safer environment for the elders to live in .
During the aging process , it is easier for the elders to fall sick as we can see from the statistics shown by the Hospital Admission Rates by Age and Sex in 2007 .
The government have thus planned healthcare subsidies and benefits for the elderly .
This is important as not every elderly is able to pay for the heavy medical bills .
These healthcare subsidies would help to offload certain percentage of the community hospital's fees .
There is one problem with this policy that is there are quite a few criteria that need to be fulfilled before an elderly could enjoy the healthcare subsidies and benefits .
However , these criteria were meant to sieve out the elders who truly needed help as compared to those who were actually able to afford their own medical bills .
The Singapore government had inputted many measures to help ease the aging process .
The construction of the studio apartment , lift-upgrading project , extension of the retirement age and the implementation of healthcare subsidies and medical benefits have all gone a long way to help ease the aging process .
All these developments and policies have helped to ensure that Singapore will be prepared in both the short run and long run against the problems of an aging population .
However as the aging population in Singapore becomes bigger in size , more research and development/ policies will need to be carried out to slow down the rapid growth of the aging population instead of easing the aging process .

An increase in emphasis on filial obligation can promote closer relationship within a family through policies such as rebates given to those living within certain proximity of their parents .
However , it does not cause the elderly to feel happier or even help to relieve the financial needs for medical treatment or basic necessities .
Firstly , working adults have a high cost of living which makes it difficult for them to pay for their parents' living expenses and at the same time afford their children's enrichment classes .
Moreover , working adults have very little time for themselves in this fast pace society , let alone for their parents .
As a result , the elderly often feel lonely as there is little or no interaction with their children .
They have no one to turn to when they need help , causing them to feel more negative .
Encouraging greater productivity among the non-elderly can increase the size of the economy and tax base .
This helps facilitate the public spending on the elderly .
For example , working more for the working-age citizens and attracting more foreign talents .
While these may seem to be plausible policies , they still cause the elderly to feel uneasy in the society .
Firstly , people would be pressured to accomplish more tasks in a given period which can lead to mental problems such as depression .
Elderly parents may end up looking after such working adults instead , imposing a heavier burden onto the elderly and government .
Furthermore , more elderly would be unemployed as they are unable to work as efficient as the working-age adults which cause their social circle to shrink .
They will feel out cast by the society as they have the mentality that they are useless , and unable to contribute to the society .
There is an improvement of the medical and science research to cure illnesses which are usually associated to old age such as research on heart diseases and invention of the artificial pancreas to replace any which fails with age .
However , these breakthroughs hardly ease the lives of the elderly .
Firstly , many low and middle income group elderly are unable to enjoy such medicines and healthcare treatments because such treatments tend to be long term care which can be very expensive for them to afford .
In addition , Operations/ drugs have side effects which the elderly might not be able to recover from due to their failing health .
As a result , they might end up having more illnesses that can cause health to deteriorate .
Medical cost will be much higher than before .
In conclusion , the current research and development/policies has not quite fulfilled its aim of helping the elderly cope with their aging process .
The government is helping the general population of the elderly in terms of providing subsidies on research and development such as emphasizing on the importance of filial obligation , finding cures for illnesses that plague the elderly , and encouraging greater productivity .
All these ideas are good but in today's world , it is actually not feasible in helping the elderly to cope with aging process .
Very often , the elderly would be left feeling sad , weak and even outcast even with these current research and development .
The new research and development/policies in the future should be well thought so that they will provide aids for the elderly instead of hindrances for them to go through the last phase of their life .
Aging has been an issue in many countries and especially developed countries .
The declining workforce not only causes problems to the countries' economy but also brings along social problems as well .
Therefore , the governments shoulder the heavy responsibility of easing the aging process through helping individuals and in turn helping the public as a whole .
However , policies implemented by the Singapore government have mostly been unable to relieve the aging problems faced by the country due to their impracticality .
The Parent Maintenance Act is one of the many policies aimed at helping the elderly with their financial needs .
However , this policy does not solve the root of the problem , which is the erosion of filial piety value amongst the younger generation .
Being in an Asian country , many of the older generation have traditional views which hold that it is a family shame for an aged to be abandoned by their own children .
Furthermore , it would be emotionally traumatic to the old if they had to bring their children to court .
Thus , many would choose to suffer in silence than to sue their children .
In addition , implementing the Parent Maintenance Act does not benefit many of the illiterate aged as they have insufficient knowledge about it , yet they are the ones most in need of financial assistance as they would have little savings with their low-income due to their low education level .
A recent survey shows that the median annual income rises with the level of education of individuals  .
Also , the needs of an elderly are not only limited to financial ones but also emotional and physical ones as well .
Older people are more prone to having health problems .
Thus , care and concern from their family is just as important as money in order for them to survive .
The biggest issue is the willingness of the elderly in taking up the help rendered by the government .
Therefore , the policy is unfeasible and unable to fulfill the needs of the elderly .
Policies aimed at improving the employability of older workers may prove to be ineffective , thus creating economical problems apart from the existing social issues .
Retirement age of all Singaporeans was raised from 55 to 62 with effect from 1 January 1999 , as announced by the Ministry of Manpower .
Employers are also allowed to reduce the wages of employees beyond the age of 60 by up to ten percent .
Furthermore , the Central Provident Fund contribution by employers decreases with the age of the workers .
Some would argue that this policy would help older workers retain their job and get employment as the cost to employers is lowered .
However , employers may still not be willing to accept older workers due to their lower productivity .
As workers grow older , their health deteriorates and becomes less agile and thus less productive .
In the event where a company needs to lay off several staff , the older workers would usually be the ones retrenched as they would most likely draw the highest salaries .
Therefore , unemployment amongst elderly would be a common sight , increasing the number of financially dependent elderly .
Government would have to tap into its budget to support the needy aged , resulting in a heavy burden on the working class .
Thus , these policies are ineffective without first changing the mindset of employers and would eventually cause social and economical problems in the society .
Evidently , the policies aimed at easing the aging process of a country have various aspects to fulfill in order for it to be effective .
Governments have to look into the economical and societal impacts an aging population brings along .
Apart from that , they have to satisfy the three different needs; i .e .
the financial , social and emotional needs of the elderly .
If any one of these aspects is compromised , Singapore would risk losing her foothold in this competitive world .
Scholars argue that it is more worthwhile to spend on other areas of development in a country such as defense , education , tourism and technology .
In Singapore , as well , emphasis is placed on these other areas .
For instance , in a recent Business Times article , it was mentioned that "government spending on Infocomm technology is set to rise 8%" .
The Business Times .
Such development is indispensable for a country to survive in a rapidly advancing world .
If the government has to spend on the aged , fewer funds will be channeled into these areas , which is a cause for concern .
It may be a better decision to spend on the young as there are higher odds of return in this investment .
The young are more productive and equipped with updated skills .
The elderly are deemed to be less valuable to the society as they are weak and dependent on others .
An ageing population may cause a low productivity rate as seen by the Annual Growth in Labour Productivity figure; currently at: -7 .8% . 
It is also our duty to take care of the aged before acknowledging our society as an ethical one .
In fact , counsellors have observed an increasing trend of the elderly living alone or being left under the care of charities or old folks' homes by their families  .
In such situations , the government has to play a part to provide for and protect the aged .
Also considering that the elderly had contributed to society during their working years , there is a moral responsibility on the government to pay them back .
It is not always necessary to measure everything in dollars and cents , and we must recognize that the aging process is not a simple one and accentuate on the development of 'elderly-friendly' facilities to ease the aging process for them .
An aging population may prove costly to the society and economy if the country fails to prepare for the situation .
Public spending on the aged is therefore deemed necessary to avoid such a crisis .
Despite the drawbacks , an aging population is linked closely to the development of Singapore .
The issue is also set to worsen in the future considering the low birth rate .
Nevertheless with proper planning , Singapore is currently handling the situation very well without compromising on the other areas of development .
Furthermore , with an increasing emphasis on filial piety , the government is able to ensure that the aged are taken care of even as they concentrate on defense , education , tourism and even the needy who require aid and are all in all vital to the growth of Singapore as a nation .
Thomas Love Peacock  once said , "The waste of plenty is the resource of scarcity" .
This quotation implies to everyone , including the government to make wise decision when allocating limited resources in order to reduce further , unnecessary wastage .
There is much concern about the governmental decision to allot a huge sum of the national budget on the elderly as it is uncertain on whether the investment on the aged will attribute or detrimental to the country's development .
The best alternative is therefore to make a more sizeable investment by limiting the spending on the aged and diverts the budget to other areas of the country's development .
The present paradigm of care for the elderly is a partnership between the government , community and family .
However , children often forgo their responsibilities to care for their parents and often point the thrust to the government because they believe their parents had gotten everything from the government .
Besides , children tend to abuse their parents' privileges allotted by the government by maximizing the usage of those privileges even though it is unnecessary .
For an example , elderly with little ailment often seek the best treatment as they are provided with either free or subsidized treatments .
Thus , those with chronic ailments were unable to seek the proper treatment they are supposed to get .
If the public spending is limited , children will have to send their parents to the appropriate level of the treatment and this will reduce wastage and increases efficiency in quality of care at the same time .
Thus , judging from the explanation , it is convincing to limit the public spending on the elderly .
Government should divert the budget initially allocated for elderly to the Research and Development  sector instead .
Investment especially in enhancing the medical research will make everyone better off and also indirectly helps the elderly in a way .
Since elderly are prone to chronic ailments such as renal disease or heart failure , medical research will be able to produce new drugs and more flexible treatments for them .
This will eventually increase the life span not only for the elderly , but also to the other generations .
Besides , investment in R&D will be able to develop new technologies and new sectors will be introduced to collaborate with the usage of the technologies .
More job opportunities will be provided and everyone will be able to live a higher standard of living .
Thus , diverting the budget from the elderly to R&D will provide mutual advantage for both the elderly and the economic development .
Government should invest more in the current education of the youth instead of investing the budget in the elderly .
This is mainly because youth are more progressive towards economic development in comparison to the elderly .
Thus , the opportunity cost to invest in the education is lower than to invest on the elderly .
Besides , moral value especially to make the children beholden to their parents can be inculcated by introducing the appropriate modules in their education .
This will help the elderly indirectly as the children are trained to embrace the Eastern value to respect and taking care of their parents .
Investment in education will also lead to development in the country as education serves as a platform for further development in all other sectors such as R&D and Health .
Thus , such investment will definitely pay off in the future economic growth .
In view of providing mutual advantage to both elderly and economic development , it is best for the government to revise on its budget allocation so that the right proportion of budget is divided wisely among the ministries in the country .
Elderly should not be granted a lump sum but instead divert the fund to other areas which will lead to future economic growth .
This is because administrating the budget to the elderly is only one-way benefit but if the budget is allocated to other areas such as Education and R&D , everyone including the elderly can enjoy the advantage .
What are therefore needed are a wise policy planning and a closer look at how the allocation will influence our future and society as a whole .
Many may argue that public spending on the aged should not be restricted .
Restriction on the public spending may raise ethical debates; after all we have the responsibility of taking care of the aged to credit them for past contributions to society .
Although we have the obligation to look after the elderly , we have to limit the public spending on the elderly .
This is because it might result in detrimental social problems in the long run as other more beneficial developments might inevitably be neglected in the process .
Public funds could be channeled into education , military and other vital sectors of the economy , instead of to the aged .
These sectors may be critical to the nation's progress .
Hence with society's interest in mind , we should limit public spending on the aged so as to not impede the country's economic growth .
The changing demography of the population has led to many concerns regarding the large health expenses on the aged .
We tend to need more health care as we age , in addition to that , medical advancement has led to a rising health care cost , these has led to an increased pressure on the nation's budget .
The government cannot afford to bear the huge cost of public spending on the aged , as it would drain the government resources .
If we fail to limit the public spending on the aged , the pressure is likely to have an effect on public spending for other priorities , and also affect economic growth .
Moreover , from a pragmatic point of view , public spending on the aged would yield little or no returns .
Public spendings on the aged may be beneficial for the society's welfare in the short run; however , it might incur a huge cost on the economy in the future .
If we reasonably limit the spendings on the elderly , we could divert it to other investments , such as education and development of infrastructure , which improve the nation's competitiveness and global position , it would yield long-term returns and even generate revenue .
The products of the investment could then be used as public spending for the aged .
Public spending could be diverted to other areas , which could in turn sustain the aged in the future .
Therefore it is critical that we limit government spending on the aged now .
In conclusion , public spendings on the elderly should be limited due to the social problems which may arise from the lack of limitation , the huge cost of the these public spending and the sustainability of the spendings .
We should not shortchange other groups of society and other developments of the nation , for the needs of the elderly .
Nonetheless , we must not fail to help the aged , but we could prioritize the expenditure such that other developments are not shortchanged in this process .
The community should do its part to help the elderly as well , after all the well being of the aged is our responsibility .
Charities such as the Community Chest can help to reach out to the elderly and hence lightening the financial load of the aged .
Individuals should fulfill their filial obligations and take care of their elderly parents or relatives .
No doubt , country is working on policies that can help to ease the aging process .
However , for policy makers their main objectives are to think of policies and developments which can help the country in expansion or to ensure that it will not hinders economic growth .
In order for country expansion , policy makers are working on developments that can provide a valuable "public product" such as education and infrastructure .
The development on education sector will enable the further generations to be more educated and to possess a higher level of skills .
Next , development on the infrastructure will attract more foreign investors to set up companies in the country .
With development in both education and infrastructure , foreign investors will choose to set up their companies in a country with a pool of talents and with great infrastructure with this it can boost up the country economics .
Lastly , research in life science areas has show ways to prolong human life and to prevent illness .
A recent research that lighter meals may prolong human life by having calories-restricted diets .
Calories restricted diets can induce a slowdown of the aging process and showing increased survival , resistance to diseases , prevent brain deterioration and lastly on less muscle loss .
In additional research states , that oxidative stress may help prolong life as oxidative stress has link with aging , cancer and other disease .
Researchers have suggests minimum exposure to oxidative conditions actually offer protection from acute doses .
With the research and advancement in life sciences to prolong human life and prevention of illness can help to reduce the fiscal costs on heath care .
In conclusion , research , development and policies help to ease the aging process is relative important .
For instance , increase and raising productive children not only can reduce the cost burden spread but also to attract foreign investors to invest in the country with pool of talent .
Secondly , technology advancement will enable the aged to live independently even they suffered with chronic diseases and their children can spend more time to focus on their work .
Lastly , research in life sciences to prolong life can help to reduce the fiscal costs on heath care and prevent illness .
Therefore , we must pay attention to focus on current research , development and policies to ease the aging process .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited although the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Tremendous demographic changes in aging will create many unprecedented problems .
Population aging does not cause problems only in wealth and developed countries such as USA , Japan and Singapore , but is also faced by developing countries such as China and Thailand as well .
Therefore , solutions that will help to ease the aging process are much needed .
If the public spending on the solutions are limited , thus effects of these solutions will not be able to meet our expectations .
First of all , we must understand that a country is built by its people's hard work and effort .
The significant contributions of the aged on a country's infrastructure , economics , and many other things should not be forgotten .
The young generation should be grateful to their senior citizen's contribution because the prosperity of today's country is built by the older generation when they are young .
Although now the people who strive for our country are aging and could hardly contribute to the country , still , we should always remember their contributions and take good care of them when they need help .
Senior citizens should be regarded as an asset rather than a liability to a country .
Frequently , we will need to heed advice from them because they have more experience than us .
For example , Mr Lee Kuan Yew , the Minister Mentor of Singapore , who always gives advice to Singaporean Government .
Hence , the welfare of the aged must be assured .
Public spending on the aged such as health spending should not be limited .
In fact , the aged are more vulnerable to fall sick than young people as their immune system are degenerating .
Peterson  has mentioned that healthcare was once meant an occasional visit to the doctor , but it has today become a lifelong process .
Furthermore , their declining productivity has also lessened their income .
So government should aid them .
For instance , government can subsidize their medical expense so that the aged can have lower rates on health care spending .
This will definitely benefit the aged because with the current increasing health care cost , the medical bills are always shocking .
As a result , the aged with low income are usually reluctant to see doctor whey they are not feeling well .
As a consequence , an illness may not be discovered in early stage and will only be discovered when it becomes severe .
However , if the illness has became too severe , it might lead to life danger and it will be much more expensive to cure it .
Next , public spending on pension should not be decreased .
As we all know , the senior citizen is one of the groups with lowest income .
More than that , some senior citizens are retired or unable to work .
Even if they work , their meager income is insufficient to support themselves , especially with the high inflation rates now .
It follows that we often heard the aged living in poverty .
Therefore , if they are in need of help , why not just help them ?
After all , they are the ones who brought our country to prosperity .
It is perfectly right that we ought to ensure their living quality in return .
On the contrary , the increasing in public spending on the aged by the government will increase the fiscal budget .
This will inevitably increase the government's load .
Therefore , the spending in other essential areas such as infrastructure , financial , and education will have to cut down .
The cut downs of spending in these essential areas might hinder the growth of a country .
Considering these important factors , many people will eventually support that public spending on the aged should be limited .
However , in my opinion , every choice we made definitely has an opportunity cost which means something has to be given up in order to attain the objective we want .
So , I think with proper planning on the spending by the government , we should be able to meet the balance between public spending on the aged and other essential spending .
In conclusion , the public spending on the aged should not be limited because it is as important as other areas of the country's development .
The country's budget is generated through taxpayers' contributions and returns on investments made .
At present , a substantial amount is spent on the elderly every year through direct and indirect ways , such as giving out subsidies or building elderly-friendly infrastructure .
This compromises the opportunity cost that this amount can be used on , namely on education , health care and creating economic growth .
Public spending on the aged , should thus be limited in a country , for the money can be used to further enhance societal growth as a whole , and not just focused solely on this particular age group .
Health care should be one of the government's top priority as well .
As people get wealthier , their waistlines get bigger as well .
Obesity , high cholesterol levels and diabetes are diseases that shot up in the last century due to greater wealth and easier access to unhealthy diets and lifestyles .
These health problems will inevitably affect the productivity of these workers , and the time and resources spent to remedy them are costly , both to the individual and the country .
Thus , it is more cost-effective and sensible that we should divert our budget towards prevention and treatment of patients .
Money can be spent on educational messages and guidelines on prevention of contracting diseases , coupled with subsidies for health care providers and medication .
Certainly , such spending will benefit the elderly , but it should not be exclusive to them , for there are other age groups who require assistance in this sector as well .
Economic growth is crucial to any country .
It ensures the majority of the population finds employment and inflation stays under control .
A country with a flourishing economy finds investors more readily to invest there and the people stand to enjoy the range and variety of material comforts that a thriving market economy is able to provide .
The government can attract foreign investment ventures and increase the competitive edge of firms by reducing tax and rent abatement .
The government can also create a more competitive labour force without compromising their wage level .
This can be done through upgrading the skills of our workforce .
For instance , the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience  programme introduced in Singapore enhances its workforce's abilities to compete in the global market , Another option is to allocate part of the budget to Research and Development for local institutes to attract and develop the best talents .
This can be exemplified by the efforts the Singapore government had been making to finance the Agency for Science , Technology and Research  .
All these evidence show how money can be effectively diverted towards generating greater economic growth .
Proponents of substantial public spending on the greying population issue will argue that the problem will escalate due to a declining birth rate , resulting in a proportionately larger population of elderly in the world .
Thus , we should solve the problem we are facing now , rather than allocating resources in other areas .
However , is it not short-sighted if we are to solve only the problems we can see now , rather than investing in and conceiving possibilities to solve the problem fully ?
We definitely have to allocate resources towards this growing issue of greying population , but we should limit the spending to only what is sufficiently necessary , and not to the extent that it handicap the society with a large financial burden .
Instead , we should allocate use of the resources towards betterment of the society , bringing up ideas and opportunities that can possibly solve this problem subsequently .
Recently , studies can be shown that Singapore is becoming to have the fastest aging populations in the world  .
The elderly people are already taking around a quarter of the population in Singapore .
Therefore , the rapidly aging population is a problem that the government needs to address .
There is a concern regarding the rising health and living costs which will become a risk to economic growth and social security .
What is then needed is the public expenditure towards the needs of the aging population should be carefully looked into instead of diverting it to the country's development .
Firstly , slow population growth results in an increased of burden for the young population to take care of their parent  .
For example , when the families have an average of one child instead of two or three children , the only child will have a very huge task and burden to take care of his or her family in the future .
Elderly people always tend to depend a lot on their children and it results in a strain in family relationship .
The rising health care costs make it even tough for the child to cope with it and some are not willing to support their parent .
The elderly people will then need to support themselves which is impossible without the government's help .
Secondly , there is a scheme called Central Provident Fund  , which is to make Singaporeans start saving when they are young , but it is not enough for them to survive with having CPF alone .
Although the government enforced individual saving through CPF , not every people will benefit from it .
Self-employed people do not have CPF as they are not working under any employers , so the employees and employers do not contribute part of the employees' salary to the CPF .
Many elderly people do not have much CPF left as they have used it to pay for their house or child's education .
This makes them to have not much savings when they grow old .
Lastly , elderly people tend to have different needs and behaviours than younger people .
Older people tend to work and save less and also require more health care .
In many countries , they depend on retirement pension to live through their remaining years .
Therefore , it is difficult to cut down on health or retirement benefits , as the aging population is becoming so serious .
Those people aged 70 and above have even weaker health than people of aged 50 to 70 .
They need money to support their increased health care costs because they have already used up their savings .
As so , they will place further demand on government funds .
At this point , one may wonder that aging population is a very important issue to take note .
However , country's development is also one of the matters that Singapore needs to be concerned of .
The country's trade , finance , transport , sports and education are key factors to drive a country's economy which cannot be neglected .
Having to maintain good trade relationship with the other countries such as having free tax and levy on imports and exports will help to grow the economy and benefit the people in Singapore .
Spending on education will help to nurture the people to have a good education from young and make Singapore a good place to seek education .
Development in sports such as hosting the Youth Olympic Games will be a great boost to the tourism sector as the Games is expected to generate a minimum of more than 150 ,000 visitors per night for Singapore  .
All of these will boost the county's economy .
Singapore is moving through a transformation to an aging society .
The challenge is to encourage healthy and productive life of the aging population and find ways for them to contribute more to the society so that they can play a valuable role for the country .
The government should not use aging population as a reason to limit public spending as they always encourage productive and healthy living for the elderly people .
They are still very important to the country and the government must play a part to take care of them .
Demography is shifting today .
People are having fewer children and living longer .
By 2050 , our median age would increase from 36 years to 56 .
Singapore would be among the demographically oldest countries in the world and there will be fewer working adults looking after more aged dependents .
The issue of aging population should be taken seriously , and more has to be put in place in addressing the issue .
As such , judging from Singapore's current demography , the aging population will be a long term situation .
Despite the government's constant effort in introducing and crafting attractive policies and benefits to her people , the bid to boost child bearing still remains bleak .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as Education and Architecture , so as to focus on the long term situation .
First of all , money can be diverted to Singapore's education system so as to increase the productivity of the younger generation to acquire sufficient wealth for future financial burden  .
It is essential to build on the development of the country's future - the younger generation - since the aged rely on the young and the young rely on the younger when old .
Clearly , a cycle is formed .
Raising the productivity of children via education can take place in the form of meeting the different needs and learning capabilities of them .
This includes reducing the ratio of the number of students to a single teacher , allowing the teacher to better focus his attention on the students .
Also , the government can direct more technological resources to school so as to better equip the younger generation in the technological-edged world , improving their economical worth .
In addition , the government can instill filial obligation  or family values and encouraging early marriage by diverting money in crafting new programmes via the education system .
These ensure while the younger generation is able to contribute economically , they do not neglect the filial obligation towards the aged and at the same time hope to raise fertility .
Economically , by raising the productivity of the children via diverting more money to the education system , it increases the younger generation's opportunity to increase their economic worth , and hence their future income .
Since the government's ability to provide social and welfare services for the aged is based on the tax revenue gained , diverting money to Singapore's education system would indirectly aid the aged and improve the aging population in the long run .
Secondly , money can be diverted to Singapore's architecture developments in terms of increasing the accessibility of physical facilities for the aged .
By improvising on Singapore's physical infrastructure , it not only benefits the current generation of the elderly , but also future generations in time to come .
This is considered a long term investment by the government .
One of the most significant improvisations is the lift upgrading programme .
New lifts are being installed in both new and old public housing blocks so that it now stops on every floor instead of the old , which only stops on every third or fourth floor .
Other than the lift upgrading programme , the Singapore government can direct more money into enabling housing estates to be barrier-free .
The refurbishment is clearly beneficial as recently residents at Nee Soon South were rejoicing about the fully equipped barrier-free access they are enjoying at Khatib MRT station .
Before work on the two new ramps began , it was a chore for the estate's elderly folks to climb the stairs to get to the station .
Drawing from these two examples , money should be diverted to Singapore's architecture developments as it acts as a long term investment the government has towards the issue of aging population .
However some may argue that public spending should not be limited .
This is because it does not address the current and impending situation of the aging population , and at the same time the aged are the most vulnerable in the society .
Hence the government should do more to help , instead of cutting down on the resources .
The aged not only require financial support , because of their inability to sustain themselves , but they also require emotional and social support .
Many social agencies in Singapore run on the basis of government and public funding .
If the government is to cut back on his funding , social agencies will face difficulties in sustaining their operation , not to mention the support they are able to provide for the aged .
In contrast , I feel that in Singapore's context , limiting public spending and diverting money to the country's Education & Architecture in order to address the long term aging population issue is viable .
This is due to the policies that the Singapore's government has put in place , before the aging population surfaced .
The two most significant polices are , the Central Provident Fund  and home ownership .
CPF has required people to save up for their retirement , and hence old age , while home ownership has allowed at least a basic shelter and home sanitations for the aged .
Thus , the Singapore government has provided a safety-net in which the aged can fall back on while diverting money to other areas of development .
In conclusion , in Singapore , limiting public spending to divert money to other areas of the country's development is a feasible option to address the long term aging population issue .
This is largely due to the compulsory legislations that are enforced upon by the government .
At the same time , cutting back on public spending does not equate to cutting off public spending , with careful planning and considerations , there can still be efficient allocation of money in aiding the aged .
Diverting money to Education and Architecture developments will prove to be beneficial for the aged and the generations to come .
Since the aging population will be a long-standing issue , it is time the government put in place long term measures .
Therefore , public spending should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , some argued that public spending should not be limited to the aged .
Some aging issues included economic reduction and workforce inefficiency  .
With these rising issues , there is an urgent need to pump in more money for this group of needy people .
For instance , Singapore should consider subsidizing more of the costly medical bills for the aged .
When one gets old , one tends to have poorer health .
This results in the need to undergo several medical treatments .
Consequently , majority of the savings will be directed to the payment of their medical treatments .
This further strains their financial burden if they still have children who are depending on them .
Furthermore , elder people tend to be less efficient than the younger working adults .
As a result , companies are not willing to offer a higher salary rate even if they manage to secure a job .
Hence , it is vital that government does its part by diverting more of its spending to help the aged .
Although these issues can be address by not limiting the public spending , there are still other ways to resolve them by diverting the money to another area - improvement in the education system .
Education prepares the younger generations for the future workforce , making them more affluent and teaching them to achieve success .
In addition , it emphasizes the importance of filial piety which encourages children to have the full responsibilities to take care of their aged parents when they grow up .
The provision of a higher standard of education also encourages the children to be more independent for their own survival in the future .
It also creates a "work more and save more" mindset so as to reduce government dependency .
Most importantly , improving the education system helps in developing the country socially and economically , so diverting the money to this area is a more effective and efficient way to help the aged indirectly .
Secondly , creating more job opportunities is another area whereby money should be diverted to .
In order to reduce the needs of the aged to fully depend on the government , the government should encourage the aged to support themselves instead .
It is impossible to support them in the long- run as there are many other areas of concerns which the government needs to look into as well .
Hence , with the creation of more jobs , the government can assist the aged to secure a job and allow them to support themselves , with the condition that they are still in healthy conditions .
It also allows the younger generations to easily secure a job and support their aged parents independently .
All these promote social and economic developments of a country too .
Looking ahead , jobs creation is a more resourceful way in developing a country with its public spending .
With regards to all the points mentioned , it is concluded that public spending on the aged should be limited .
The idea of limiting the spending on the aged and diverting the money to the improving of education system and creating of more job opportunities is to prevent the over-reliance of the aged on the government , eliminating the wrong perception of "I will still survive with this 'free' money from the government" .
Therefore , since the improvement of education system and creation of more jobs bring about more long-term benefits than having an unlimited public spending on the aged , money should be diverted to these areas as part of the country's developments which eventually , will impact the aged positively .
* "To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
Do you agree ?
Discuss this statement in relation to your particular field of study or interest  .
N .B You can draw examples from more than one field of study or interest .
However , your essay should demonstrate in-depth analysis .
As a result of a growing aging population , public spending on the aged has increased in an attempt to minimize the negative impacts of a fast aging population .
Such strategy translates to increasing pressure on national budgets and economies which can be used in other areas of the country's development .
Some have argued that public spending on the aged is redundant as the productivity and contributions of the aged to the nation is questioned .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be diverted to other areas of the country's development due to the potential fruitful returns from these investments .
However , the assumption that the aged is non productive is untrue due to the increasing emphasis on healthcare .
This allowed the aged to remain healthy and continue working hence they are able to remain productive despite their age .
Therefore , public spending on the aged is crucial in ensuring the continuance productivity of the aged which in turn benefits the country .
Firstly , the high medical and healthcare services fees can "substantially drain the resources of many elderly"  .
Without healthcare benefits for the aged such as subsidized medical fees , most elderly are unlikely to afford the high medical expenses incurred .
Despite having insurance coverage , it is still possible that the medical bills are insufficiently covered .
As a result , the health of the elderly can deteriorate as they may not seek treatment due to the inability to pay the medical bills .
The economy in turn suffers due to the threats on the productivity of the aged .
Therefore , the government should not neglect the healthcare benefits for the aged as the consequence is undesirable .
Secondly , a fast aging population would mean that "growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer younger persons"  .
This indicates a lack of resource , whether monetary or non monetary to support the large numbers of elderly .
Moreover , the younger generations will come under heavy pressure due to the disparity ratio support of the aged .
To lighten this pressure , public spending such as healthcare benefits can help lighten the financial burden faced by the younger generation .
Besides , it brings us back to the aspect of high medical expenditures where the younger generations are probably unable to afford as well .
An example would be an only son having to support his aging parents and elderly grandparents .
He is likely to face financial constraints due to the high medical expenditures .
To solve this problem , public spending on the aged can provide an alternative resource to support the aged which therefore lighten the burden of the younger generations .
In addition , the additional healthcare resource can improve the health of the elderly hence , enhancing the productivity of the aged .
Thirdly , the shrinking ratio of younger generations in the future indicates the importance of elderly to remain productive to the economy .
Generally , it is assumed that the young should support the elderly .
The younger generation should remain in the workforce while the elderly tend to retire at a stipulated age .
However , this scenario may change in the future due to the lack of human resource in the job market .
To prevent the disruption of labour market , elderly are likely to remain in the work force in the near future .
Thus , an elderly friendly environment is essential to enhance the efficiency of the work force .
As the country ultimately benefits from the productivity of the aged , it is rational for the government to utilise public spending on the aged .
Therefore , the public spending on the aged is as crucial as other areas of country's development .
The aging process has indeed become a phenomenon in Singapore .
This is mainly due to a shift in the country's population .
The government has responded to this issue by establishing policies and programs to manage the aging process .
Most of the policies aim to reduce the problems associated with an aging population .
One crucial is problem the increase in government expenditure for the aging population which in turn strains the future working population .
Although some policies do facilitate in reducing the expenditure towards the elderly to a certain extent , it may still prove to be insufficient in easing the aging process .
One segment of policies that the government has implemented is to increase the total fertility rate of Singapore .
These policies aim to produce a higher rate of productive children for the future workforce .
They will be the ones to support the large number of the future aging population .
However , the policies have proven to be ineffective  .
For example , the Baby Bonus Scheme which was introduced in April 1 , 2001 , was established to reduce the financial costs of raising children by providing cash grants .
The cash grants can be used to pay for child care , preschool and healthcare expenses .
The scheme caused an adverse effect as it only focuses on the explicit costs .
The government failed to include the implicit costs of raising children .
Some of which includes giving up one's career to take care of their children .
Therefore , with the progressive economy , many prefer to establish their careers before having children .
The cost of raising children has also risen in the past years due to the need to enroll them in numerous programs .
Parents in this modern society want their children to be equipped with numerous amount of skill to prepare them for the future workforce .
Another policy implemented by the government involves providing for oneself through life-long savings .
This policy is implemented through the Central Provident Fund , CPF scheme .
The CPF scheme is a compulsory savings meant to meet one's basic living needs upon retirement .
Under the CPF scheme , the Medisave scheme is developed to lessen the impact of medical and hospitalization expenses .
However , the Medisave scheme have proven to be insufficient because medical expenses for the elderly are simply too high that one's Medisave savings can be used up within one week  .
Moreover , with longer life expectancy , the Medisave savings may not be adequate .
This problem becomes worst if the elderly does not have any children or children who choose to neglect their responsibilities to support their elder's healthcare finances .
Thus the National Housing policies were introduced to encourage filial responsibilities of the adult children .
However , it has been proven to be unsuccessful .
This may be due to the change in culture and values of the modern adult generation since they prefer to live further from their parents .
On the other hand , housing policies may have an opposite effect as some couples may misuse the policy by using the grant for their own benefit .
One example of a housing policy that has proven to be unsuccessful is the Multi-Tier Family Housing Scheme which encourages parents and married children to live together  .
Nevertheless , some developments that the government has implemented do ease the aging process .
The current development of new community hospitals which links up with the main hospitals is an example of a measure that will ease the aging process .
Community hospitals are built to allow the elderly patients , usually with chronic illnesses , to recover with the assistance of a professional medical team but at a lower cost .
This will reduce medical expenses for the elderly .
In addition to that , community hospitals will free up beds in the main hospitals for acute illnesses .
Easing the aging process by establishing policies that solves explicit problems has proved to be inadequate .
These policies may be useful only as a short-term solution .
The government may need to consider the social changes and needs of the younger population to improve the aging process on a long-term basis .
This may include the impact of the rise in living expenses and the influences of the western culture .
Without considering these social changes , the aging process may increase government expenditure and the burden of the future workforce generation .
The baby boom period did not happen without reason .
It was a worldwide phenomenon that took place as a quick solution for population growth .
However , many countries now , are experiencing its consequences .
As Peterson  has aptly titled his analysis , we are in a "Graying World"  .
Singapore is no exception , but to quite a large extent , many policies and community services have been developed over the years to help ease the weight of an aging population .
Singapore has noticed the growing pressure of an aging population .
Our population pyramid  is one that is constrictive , with "fewer people in the younger age categories"  .
As reported by SDS  , we have a decreasing old age support ratio , with 17 residents aged 15 64 years old supporting one senior citizen aged 65 and above in 1970 , reduced to just 8 .4 in 2008 .
According to the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  , in 20 years' time , "one in five residents in Singapore will be aged 65 and above" , which would make us "one of the fastest ageing populations in Asia" .
At this rate , sustaining our country's silver generation cannot just be the duty of the children , but as far as possible , a great work of cooperation , with the help of policies .
Instead of just 'feeding' , the government aims to get senior citizens to learn a new way of fishing emphasizing self-reliance unless impossible .
To oversee the progress of how the nation can ease the aging process , the Ministerial Committee on Ageing was set up to ensure "an inter-ministry approach to prepare for rapid population ageing"  .
For starters , the elderly can approach their district's Community Development Council , which can help in job-matching , recommending government assistance schemes , applying for skills upgrading workshops and assisting in healthcare issues .
To encourage job security , they can receive the Chinese Development Assisting Council  Skills Training Award when they successfully complete their skill upgrading courses  .
These initiatives are supported by the fact that it was reported four years ago , "63 .1 per cent of senior citizens aged 55 and above had their own source of income"  .
Another example is that many districts also hold regular free health screenings for the elderly .
While the country has to bear the initial costs , it helps seniors pick up telling signs of illnesses in order to be treated early .
In 2005 , "more than half  of senior citizens above the age of 55 went for regular health screening"  .
If majority of our senior citizens are able to be as independent and pro-active , it helps to ease the dependency on our younger working population .
Even with the plethora of schemes , policies and aid , there will always be some who are unable to be as independent .
It can be a range of reasons , such as disability , health , old age and even their mentality towards post-retirement work .
In many traditional families , it is a social expectation for children to support their elderly parents after retirement .
This obligatory gesture is seen as filial piety .
Based on the findings from 2005 , it was found that inevitably , "dependence on financial support from children increased with age of senior citizens" .
It was reported by MCYS that more than half of those aged 55 to 64 years old were given help by their children .
As expected , percentage "increased to 77 .9% for those aged 75 and above"  .
At the same time , it could be the mindset of some senior citizens , who feel the government should be footing their bills , as a right being the country's eldest .
An aging population is a reality that cannot be postponed and it is happening now .
With the foresight of our country's leaders , sociologists and policy makers , Singapore has many solutions to help alleviate the problems and hopefully , work towards sustaining the country better .
However , policies and solutions can only work if they are tried and feedback is given to continuously improve them .
Everyone has a part to play , regardless as a working adult , a retiree , an elderly or more importantly , as a citizen .
Another problem we have to address is people's compliance to the proposed strategies .
Peterson suggested "to increase the size of today's and the future's economy and tax base by encouraging greater productivity among the non-elderly" , the workforce and children  .
He believes that through the upgrading of the people , they can contribute more to the society with the newly imparted skills .
In contrast , by creating policies to boost productivity of the workforce , the government would firstly have to set aside resources for upgrading and incentive , posing more potential of cutting welfare programs of the aged to fund the new regime .
Since the intended result is also not substantial , imposing these policies may then cause aggravation to the people as most may prefer our resources to be put into more beneficial and tangible use like funding welfare programs .
The people may not work more despite the fact that they became more qualified in multiple professions .
Thus , in order for such policies to ease the issue of a greying population , the paradigm of aiding the country must be observed by the society .
I would also like to highlight that in the National Day's Rally 09' speech made by PM Lee , he has also re-emphasised on the significance of social responsibility .
He mentioned that though Singapore is on the way of new hospitals and strategies of saving cost in the recovery of the economical downturn , the community themselves should be obliged to maintain a healthy lifestyle  .
The aged have to acknowledge that community hospitals are recommended for rehabilitation while the general hospitals are meant for acute problems .
Families and communities should also supervise the wellness of these people through regular medical checks or even maintaining a healthy social network .
There are many existing initiatives that the society can play in the absence of such policies to ease the ageing process .
Obviously , the notion of reimburse the elderly with financial aid for their contributions to the country is naive .
There are plenty of methods that we can provide to aid the elderly .
Elder dependency should be reduced by encouraging later retirement  .
This is an example of alternatives that can be used to reduce the spending on the elderly .
So reducing the spending on the elderly for the sake of country development is a wise act .
While public spending on the aged is vital , it should not comprise the other aspects of the country's growth and development .
As mentioned by Friedland and Summer  , "With little economic growth , society faces fewer choices on how to care for those who are least able to care for themselves .
On the other hand , with sufficient economic growth , there are more choices and fewer persons in need" .
This underlines the importance of economic development in the country to neutralize the implications of an aging population .
Thus , instead of spending excessively on the aged , resources of the country should be diverted to other areas like healthcare , education , and infrastructure , which will in turn benefit the country economically .
Despite the above said , it may be objected that as the elderly had contributed significantly to the country's development in their younger days , in view of their long term hard work , they should be entitled with more benefits than the rest of the population .
Governments should also set aside sufficient funds to assist them in coping with their old age life , be it in terms of financial or social assistance .
For instance , as people age , there is an increased need for more healthcare resources , hence leading to an inevitable spending in healthcare arena .
However , for the old-aged with low or no income , they may face difficulties and restrictions in seeking appropriate medical treatment due to financial problems .
It is therefore crucial for governments to extend assistance to the elderly in the form of medical subsidies , allowances , rebates and other kinds of financial aids to ensure that the needs of the elderly are met and protected .
In contrast to the above , although public spending on the aged is essential , there is also a need for investment of resources in the educational sector to provide better education for the younger generation .
As the common saying goes , "Children are the future pillar of the nation" .
They should be given every right to receive education under any circumstances .
Resources of the country should be diverted into this aspect to provide scholarships and bursaries for the needy children who are keen to further their studies and allow them to be exposed to better working opportunities in the future .
Not only that , an educated population will also mean a more productive workforce for the country , which will allow them to have an edge over others .
Moreover , as mentioned by Friedland and Summer  , "Public policies that encourage and facilitate education , basic research , and the application of promising technologies can enhance the well-being of current and future generations of older people" .
This further suggests that with education , future older people will be more affluent and will have a lesser tendency to rely on the government for their well-being .
In turn , the government will not need to set aside huge resources for the aged , and will be able to divert these resources into other areas of the country's development .
In addition to education , infrastructure of a country also plays a crucial role in drawing in investments and potential profits for the country .
With a pro-business infrastructure , not only will Meetings , Incentives , Conventions and Exhibitions  groups will be enticed to make more frequent visits to the country , there will also be a rapid increase of Small and Medium Enterprises  within the country as local entrepreneurs will be more willing to venture and establish businesses in a pro-business climate .
Moreover , foreign investors may also seek the opportunity to invest in the country which generally contributes to the overall economic growth of the country as a whole .
To summarise , governments should also recognize the fact that unlimited spending on the aged will not be viable in the long run as individuals will only grow to be more reliant on the government to provide for them in their old age .
In all , a better suggestion will be for countries to place more emphasis on its economical development , as with economic growth , people are generally more affluent and hence will possess the financial capabilities of providing for themselves in old age .
Even though there will also be minority who are less capable of doing that , they will only comprise of the few who requires assistance from the government .
In today's context , ever changing societies frequently face a plethora of issues .
Likewise , most countries are currently tackling the main perplex issue of an increasing ageing population .
Since today's silver population of 65 years and above is 15 percent and is estimated to grow phenomenally to around 25 percent by the year 2030  , thus , governments are deeply concerned with the implementation of fiscal and welfare policies that would directly impact the aged .
A component of fiscal policy , public spending , should be limited so that self-reliance can be inculcated into the aged through forced savings and , the economy can function better by shifting monetary inputs to facilitate trade and investments in infrastructure .
Another point in case is that since the elderly can be self-sufficient to support themselves in old age , public spending in this area is thus limited , and may eventually result in a shift of state funds and capital to boost other sectors of the country's economy .
As such , there may be a huge concentration of growth in the area of trade because when more capital is used to invest in trade , it reaps substantial rewards in the form of revenue and , higher growth and stability of the economy will ensue .
Besides that , state funds and capital can be used to improve on the infrastructure of the country; e .g .
public transport systems , telecommunications sector , energy and water resource divisions and etc , so that the country may possibly advance and prosper with the advent of new technologies and infrastructure .
Therefore , when the economic growth is stable , this will lead to avenues of vast opportunities to further develop the country , and also result in fewer elderly in dire needs  .
As a whole , the notion of public spending can be viewed as akin to a coin which has two sides .
One aspect is that of favouring the elderly to the extent of fulfilling their needs to the best the state can provide because of their esteemed position as 'forefathers' of the country .
Whereas , the other aspect is seen as benefitting the whole community at large since such capital and funds are diverted to improve the economy .
Henceforth , the problems associated with an aging society is one such situation which cannot be dismissed lightly as having a definite solution , as often there are severe repercussions that occur with it .
By 2030 , senior citizens will comprise about 19% of the Singapore population .
.
In view of this , the Singapore government has been actively engaged in formulating elderly-friendly policies .
It is even more vital for a small city-state like Singapore , to deal with its ageing society because the consequences of not taking into account the ageing population could bring several adverse implications on the country .
For instance , the demand for welfare benefits and healthcare subsidies will rise as the population ages .
The problems that come with the ageing process can be resolved by implementing targeted policies for the elderly .
Hence , to prevent the ageing process from becoming a burden on the country , it will require policy treatments to cushion the adverse impact of the demands of an ageing population .
With an effective government leading the way , Singapore has made much headway dealing with an ageing population .
Singapore's HDB has been making our public housing estates more elderly-friendly through initiatives like the Lift Upgrading Programme and Home Ownership Scheme .
The Home Ownership Policy ensures that Singaporeans have something set aside for their old age .
.
First , HDB has introduced studio apartments with a shorter lease of 30 years .
Elderly homeowners can sell their flats and move into a more affordable studio apartment .
Secondly , it has also introduced a Lease Buyback Scheme .
Under this scheme , HDB will buy back the tail end of the lease on the flat and leave the elderly homeowner with a short lease of 30 years on the same flat .
This means that the elderly can continue to stay in their flat without having to move out .
Additionally , they will receive a lump-sum payout as well as a monthly payment in the form of a lifelong annuity .
The schemes offered by HDB have certainly helped to ensure that the elderly in Singapore can continue to provide for themselves in their old age .
In the area of healthcare , Singapore has maintained a high level of quality and accessibility for every Singaporean .
In addition to granting government subsidies , individuals are also expected to shoulder a portion of their own healthcare costs .
They have put in place the highly effective 3Ms framework - which refers to Medisave , Medishield and Medifund - which is Singapore's healthcare financing approach .
.
Over the years , various policy changes have further been made to improve the existing system .
This has shown that the government is committed to address the needs of an ageing population in its policies .
The changes have also included the extension of Medisave to cover more outpatient treatments and the enhancement of Medishield to improve the payout for larger hospital bills .
Even though the policy frameworks to contain rising costs and to raise effectiveness are already in place , future policy amendments will still be needed as the society evolves .
These healthcare policies will ensure that the elderly will be adequately self-sufficient in their golden years .
Even in the face of success , it is important to periodically review the economic and social impact of housing and healthcare policies , as they will remain the key concerns in Singaporeans' lives .
Our public housing policies will have to adapt and respond to the changing needs and aspirations of Singaporeans .
With the rising standard of living , the housing needs in Singapore will change as well .
HDB will also have to do rigorous planning on its housing policies .
As Singapore has limited land constraints , it will have to think of ways to increase land usability and rejuvenate the old estates .
Pressures to spend on healthcare will also rise with an ageing population .
Public request for subsidies to cover the latest medical treatments , the improvement of service quality , and the reduction of fees for subsidized specialist consultants are becoming more common .
With such pressures , the need to prevent healthcare costs from escalating remains a key challenge .
Policy makers will have to ensure that the best feasible outcome is achieved .
All in all , Singapore has been largely successful in accommodating the rising proportion of elderly in its society .
By providing support in the areas of housing and healthcare , the country has prepared well for the ageing process .
To conclude , Singapore has constantly adapted and adopted policy reforms to ease the impact of its growing number of senior citizens .
More importantly , the country has also ensured the well-being of its citizens .
"To a large extent , current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
I strongly agree with this agreement .
Nowadays , lots of researchers and developments have been carried out and many policies have been implemented in order to ease the aging process .
The three main policies that I will be discussing are filial obligation , later retirement and government subsidies .
Firstly , the main problem of aging population is that the children do not want to take care of their parents when they are old , because they think that parents are troubles for them , since they are old and unable to contribute .
One of the methods to resolve this problem may be through legislation .
For example , the Singapore government has implemented the Maintenance of Parents Act since 1996 , and a Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents has been established .
Under this act , parents who are above age of 60 and are unable to support themselves can claim maintenance from children .
Children who are failed to do so may be fined up to $5000 or jailed up to 6 months .
According to the statistics made by a government organization , in the first 3 years that this act was implemented , 400 parents sought for aid under this act .
Some may argue that filial obligation should be by their own will and shall not restricted by law .
But , if the children are still failed to do so after much education , legislation will be a must in solving this problem .
If children are bounded by such filial obligation , they will then take care of their own parents , and hence , the elderly dependency on government subsidies or the public may be reduced .
Secondly , some of the senior citizen who do not have any children will have no support at all .
Thus , it is crucial that they have their own jobs , own income , in order to support themselves .
As a result , later retirement is encouraged by government from many countries .
After retirement , elderly always stay at home and have less activities .
Eventually , they will become weaker , more forgetful , slower in reaction and less agile .
Not only that , the biggest problem is they will have no income to support themselves .
Hence , later retirement will be a good option for them .
The reason is , with a job , the aged can keep themselves busy and do more thinking in order to complete their work .
So , it keeps them healthy .
At the same time , they may have stable income to support themselves .
For example , the Singapore government has extended the retirement age of Singaporeans from 60 to 62 , and at the same time , provides them with trainings and courses , such as the Ling Kwang Home and Seniors@eCitizen , in order to meet the requirements of the employers .
Some may argue that later retirement is too burdening for elderly , but it is actually optional for them , depending on their own abilities and desire .
In short , later retirement can help the elderly to accumulate more wealth to support themselves , maintain healthy bodies and find new purpose of life so that they are less dependent on the others .
Lastly , it is undeniable that , some of the elderly have no children , and they are unable to work , especially those who are too old or uneducated .
Hence , the government and the public will play an important role in order to curb this problem .
For example , the Singapore government has implemented lots of policies and provided much subsidies to help those elderly .
One of the subsidies will be Home Medical and Home Nursing Subsidy provided by the Ministry of Health  .
MOH targets to fund 50% of the elderly population requiring home care services .
With the subsidy , the elderly can stay in their own houses as they do not have to stay in hospitals .
As a result , the lonely elderly can also stay healthy in a community .
With the growth of aging population , public spending on healthcare costs will be exorbitant .
Each working individual will have to contribute more taxes due to the decline of economically-productive people .
Nevertheless , it is important for the government to implement feasible policies to assist the aging population .
Measures to ease the aging process include architecture upgrades and restructuring of healthcare system .
The first measure consists of building innovative features like small bumps on the ground to lead the visually-impaired .
In addition to escalators , lifts are constructed at train stations to allow the wheelchair-bound to traverse between different levels .
The latter consists of building more community hospitals for the elderly as well as extending the services of community hospitals to homes to save costs  .
However , government should also ascertain the limit of healthcare finances based on individual's capability .
On the other hand , cutting of elderly welfare finances may increase the financial burden of the family members .
Therefore , it is essential for the government to focus its resources on developing various areas , especially on those that are important to the sovereign interests like defense , education and economy .
A nation military spending always takes up a substantial proportion of its fiscal budget due to the importance of having a strong defense force to defend itself against aggressors should diplomatic negotiations failed .
For example , the proliferation of nuclear weapons by North Korea has sparked off a regional arm race , causing neighboring countries like South Korea to purchase more sophisticated weaponry from America .
In addition , since the '911' incident , the world has came to see the threat of terrorism as very real .
Terrorists are able to conduct their operations anywhere around the globe due to their extensive network of terror cells worldwide .
Given the rapid technological advancement today , conflicts between countries can also exist in 'virtual' form like hacking into sensitive websites to disrupt the country's economic activities .
Therefore , it is inevitable for countries to increase more of their military budget to upgrade their defensive capabilities against various sophisticated forms of external threats .
Education is the key to sustain economic livelihood .
A proper educational structure will nurture more knowledgeable and capable people in the future to run the country .
Educated people will also be more inclined to be independent and make financial planning for themselves during their economically-active years .
They will also have better quality of life when they grow older due to their healthy lifestyles .
Therefore , this would incur lesser healthcare costs as they remain fit and productive in their golden years .
A nation's economy is the main source of country's income as it is an indicator of a country's wealth .
People living in well-developed countries have high standard of living due to their affluence brought about by the stable economy .
As a result , they remain fit and robust despite the rise in their life expectancies .
This also means that lesser healthcare spending is required to sustain these affluence groups of elderly .
The lower-income group will also benefit from a well-developed economy as higher economic growth enables government to provide more healthcare finances to support the elderly .
This would thus reduce the financial burden of these group of people based on their income ceilings .
Despite the volatility of the country's economy due to the global market , it is imperative for government to implement feasible economic policies to facilitate trade and growth .
Therefore , having a sturdy economy will also incur lesser financial costs on elderly welfare .
In retrospect , countries around the world face challenges with global aging .
Governments need to strike a delicate balance in allocating scarce resources to develop other crucial areas as they are indirectly related to healthcare costs incurred by the aged .
Likewise , they need to forecast future demographic trends and be flexible in changing and implementing new fiscal measures to deal with the graying population .
Aging is no doubt , one of the most pressing issues that many developed countries are facing today .
Japan and Singapore have been battling the aging society for many years where the birth rates are at depressing levels and better healthcare facilities are available .
Because of this aging process , there is a need for research and development to come out with ideas to counteract it .
Thus , to a large extent , I agree that current research and development is the solution to this aging process .
The process can be eased through economical , social and architectural means .
Firstly , through economical means , elderly people are becoming increasingly part of the working community , working past retirement age .
Singapore for example has a minimum retirement age of 62 years .
Elderly people can continuously upgrade themselves through job retraining to acquire relevant skills required for the job .
There are subsidies from government to employers to send workers aged 40 and above to upgrade their skills .
An example is SDF course fee subsidy of up to 90% for workers aged above 40 with 'A' levels and below qualifications .
However , critics may argue that employers may hire younger workers due to their lower wages and higher working efficiency as compared to the older workers .
This is not always the case as companies are less likely to waste time and effort to train the newcomers over a period and may not have the satisfied results at the end of the training .
Instead , they may want to retain the more experienced and skilled older workers to maintain a consistent working standard .
As for wages , people aged above 50 will contribute lesser to their CPF accounts and this includes the employer's CPF contribution .
This will in turn lighten the cost of employing older workers and the company would prefer to hire the more experienced older workers over the less experienced younger workers .
Thus , economically , elderly people will be able to work longer and be more independent by supporting themselves for their retirement .
Secondly , through social policy , there are increasing entertainment activities to keep the elderly personnel occupied .
To cope with the increasing loneliness in elderly people , there are activities that can bond the elders together and engage them in fun-learning and enriching activities according to their interests .
Take for example , the Wellness Programme in Singapore provides companionship with the other seniors through activities like brisk walking , dancing , gardening or cycling .
However , not all elderly people are willing to participate in such events .
Although there are a lot of activities set up for elderly people , it is optimally up to them to decide whether or not to join the activities .
We cannot force but encourage them to take up the relevant activities that may interest them .
They should also make an effort to keep a healthy lifestyle .
Take for example , in China , it is common to see many elderly people practising Taiji in the morning in public parks and dancing along the streets at night .
It is thus important to maintain a healthy , yet entertaining lifestyle especially at an old age .
Last but not least , through architectural means , there are many infrastructure and facilities put in place for the convenience of the elderly .
For the safety of the elderly , ramps and slip resistant footpaths are being set up in residential estates .
An example would be at Macpherson Gardens in Singapore where such features are being put in place , creating an elderly-friendly estate .
The flats built in the past in Singapore were not accessible at every floor as the lifts are built in a way where they stop only at specific levels .
Today , to improve the convenience of the residents , especially the elderly , upgrading works are being carried out at various locations , ensuring that lifts will stop at every level .
All these upgrading works are carried out to ensure that the place is made suitable for the elderly to live in .
In conclusion , as many developed countries are facing a fast aging population , proper research and development have to be carried out in order to ease the aging process .
Through economical , social and architectural means , we are thinking ahead for the future and creating an elderly- friendly environment for the elderly people to live in .

For the past few years , the issue of aging population has been debated widely across the globe as it took our world by storm .
As our economy develops , the sign of aging population worsen .
Facts of such can be seen in developed countries like Germany and Japan , where the median age of citizen in the country is pushing towards 53 and 54 respectively  .
As an older population will directly result in lower productivity and higher social and welfare cost in a nation , many sociologist of today are attending and bringing forth strategies , hoping that the issue of elder dependency will be taken care of without threatening a nation's economy .
While majority of the solutions were revolving around increasing public spending on the aged , many think that such proposal is not viable and well balanced , as the economic aspect of a country has not been taken into account .
People at this opposing end , on the other hand , believe that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development , indirectly solving the aging matter effectively .
In the midst of such controversy , I personally agree that the problem of elder dependency will be better taken care of if a nation limits its spending on the elderly .
For the first reason of my standpoint , it is believed that the root of the elder dependency problem can only be solved if the country invests in other specific areas that would indirectly relief the situation .
By spending directly on the aged , the government is only trying to deal with the consequences and not the source of the problem .
On the other hand , if the country invests in other specific areas like education , the burden of responsibility in taking care the elderly will literately shift from the government to the younger generation .
This is due to the better inculcation and cultivation of morale values among the youth as a result of better education system , thus increasing their responsibility in taking care of their immediate elderly family members .
A country could also focus its spending on developing its financial economy , as the result of such action would be that the working population would be financially better off to take care their immediate elderly family members , reducing the burden on government spending .
Given my above two reasons , one may argue that the ideology of such approach in dealing with aging population is too long-term oriented .
As such , it is impractical and it lacks of ability to deal with the problem in the short run .
As the benefit of the approach can only be seen in the long run , reducing and limiting the public funding amount immediately will result in shortage of funds to deal with current demand .
This will then result in a sudden vulnerable position , where many elder needy will not get the medical and financial attention that they need .
In my opinion , such an opposing view is incorrect .
By reducing the public funding , the government seeks to be more stringent in their subsidization criteria .
This will ensure that those who really need help will still get the attention needed , while those who can still afford to look after themselves will receive lesser in contrast .
Instead of ignoring those who demand help , this approach simply re-evaluates the subsidizing criteria , enforcing the practice of self responsibility for those who can and asking the public to play a fair share in taking care of themselves or their immediate family members .
All in all , in order to tackle the root of the elder dependency problem , corresponding nation should not focus on dealing with the current tangible problems .
Instead , more attention should be placed on the intangible source .
This will eventually result in a smoothen path in securing the aging process , and lessen the burden of the nation's economy .
____________________________
The speed of aging process around the world is being hastened due to the high life expectancy and low fertility rate .
Most countries have poured a great deal of resources into this increasing population .
However , if this trend of spending has been continuing in the future time , it will be destructive to a country's financial structure .
Therefore , spending on the aged should be limited in order to transfer valuable resources to other sectors which also require the country's attention .
Another area that Singapore should also spend more money on developing is the economy .
It is where the country's wealth can continue to grow when the economy is stable .
We should spend more money to attract talents from all over the world and transform Singapore into a world class financial and medical hub .
Coupled with better education , it will not be surprising that the disposable income of Singapore would also increase .
This will improve the standard of living for Singaporean and will eventually contribute to better healthcare system in Singapore .
As Singaporeans become more well off , it will lead to research for innovative products to tap on the sliver industry  .
Similarly on the other end , the users of the innovative products will be in a better position , financially , to afford it .
With that , the sliver industry will becomes lucrative market and more companies will be willing to invest time and money into developing innovative products for the elderly .
The government should also encourage companies to tap on these markets .
Recently , 5 companies have received 500k grant from the government to develop elderly friendly products for the silver industry .

Besides focusing all her resources on education and economy , Singapore should also be spending some of her resources on the aged .
There is an immediate problem here and we cannot ignore that these 50 to 60 years old elders as they did contribute to the success of Singapore in many ways .
Even if Singapore successfully brings Singapore education and economy to greater heights , there will still be people who fall through the cracks .
These people will need even more help in this highly competitive society .
Beyond that , solutions like nursing those elderly in other countries like Malaysia where expenses will be lower are not well received by the elders .
Therefore , we still need to spend on maintaining the welfare of these people .
In conclusion , by spending more on both economy and education , we will be able to decrease effects of the aging problem .
By investing in education and economy , Singaporean will be able to generate more disposable income and hence , less reliance on the government funding when they grow old .
Still , we should not forget to leave some for the aged as they have contributed in many ways to the country .
We should still be a responsible country which will take care of its citizens .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Being a firm believer of 'Prevention is better than cure' , I agree to a certain extent .
In year 2000 , seven percent of Singapore's total population is over the age of sixty-five , however , by 2030 this will increase to nineteen percent  .
Singapore can limit public spending on the aged , using the savings and indirectly alleviate or even reduce the total expenditure catered on the aged in terms of healthcare and accommodation .
By three methods that tackles the problem in a long run .
Thirdly , there should be an increase in fund on the healthcare sector .
One primary concern for providing healthcare for the aged is the cost .
Although some might argue that increasing the fund just targets at providing for the aged , by looking at the bigger picture , the improved healthcare system provides for all .
By treating and preventing more problems to arise before one gets old , detecting early symptoms of diseases , etc . , a person can be healthier especially when coupled by good social-policy planning by the government .
It is well known that depression is more destructive than any sickness the aged will have , having a fit mind is essential for having a fit body .
"To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
It is true to say that as it states with different improvements from different field , we can face the challenge and solve the problems of arising aging population .
As we know , if this problem is not solved , the median age on many first-world countries will reach 51 by 2050 .
During aging process , the elderly will face financial problems and be abandoned by their children .
Although this problem is unlikely to be solved in the short run , many ways were carried out to ease the aging process , particularly in social policy and science research .
Singapore government improves returns on CPF Savings to help the retirees .
Some of the people claimed that it was everyone's responsibility to plan financially for old-age to reduce dependency on children However , for those who are physically disabled and suffering from sicknesses , they do not have the ability to work and look after themselves .
Improving returns on CPF savings will ensure the savings can last for the lifetime of CPF members .
Older CPF members who volunteer to defer the draw-down of their savings to the age of 65 will receive a Voluntary Deferment Bonus .
This policy is used to encourage them to accumulate more wealth to support themselves during the old age .
The government is considering implementing a longevity insurance scheme that provides basic and affordable plans to ensure long-life income .
Hence , with the effort of Singapore government to improve returns on CPF Savings has buffered the impact of aging problem .
Besides Singapore , countries around the world also put in efforts to ease the aging process .
Silver jobs fair , established to find jobs for people aged 60 and over , is part of a government effort in South Korea to assist a rapidly growing population of older Koreans .
This jobs fair has mushroomed across South Korea in the past year .
In the past , it was a tradition that adult children should take primary responsibility for the good care of their aging parents .
However , the phenomenon we notice today is that the elderly are dismayed to find themselves dependent on children .
Children often expect their parents to contribute to household chores when they move in not because of the responsibility to look after them .
Therefore , most of them need to work themselves and master new technologies in order to earn their living after retirement .
Though some said that the elderly are not well performed , this group of people can actually bring improvement to the sectors they involved by contributing their own experiences .
This silver jobs fair has helped many older and unprepared Koreans to enter the last stages of their lives more easily in a culture transformed by longer life .
Viewing from healthcare prospective , researchers have taken a big step toward discovering that human hearts can grow new cells .
This is a significant research to help to ease the aging process as we know heart diseases are common among the elderly .
There are some people who claim that this breakthrough is only in the realm of basic science research but it is a good start for future use .
It was previously thought that human heart was unable to grow new cells after birth .
However there is a study can disprove it .
The scientists announced the evidence that new heart cells are made through one person's life .
This study could help doctors to design treatments for the damage caused by heart attacks , which was previously thought to be irreversible .
Now , it is possible to say that we can regenerate heart muscle after having heart attack .
Therefore , it is a new hope for the elderly who are suffering from heart diseases .
In conclusion , aging problem is concerned all over the world .
The older population is growing at a considerably faster rate than the world's population .
It is a complex issue but not insurmountable .
It is important to understand the problems faced by the elderly before taking further actions so that leaders can implement practical measures to cope with this problem .
With the current policies and development in science study , aging process will be solved in a long run .
Challenge for the future is to ensure people with different ages can continue to participate in the societies as citizens with full human rights .
Hence , I hope that the relationship between the generations can be nurtured and the children will take the responsibility to take care of their parents .

To the large extent , current researches , developments and policies have help easing the aging process ?
Fast growing number of aged population has been occurring all over the world .
As people aged , their income drops but their medical expenses are actually increasing .
Hence , every research , development and policy that will help them to reduce their burden is a gospel to them .
To the large extent , current researches , developments and policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Medical expenses are most likely to be the burden of aged population .
As human aged , metabolism rate and immunity will start to drop , limbs and body organ such as kidneys , livers , hearts , and other organ will start to fail due to long years of usage .
That is when all the medical expenses start to rise as a result of health problems .
To ensure that the aged population is able to pay large amount of medical expenses which could arise due to their old age , the government has set up a few policies to assist them .
Take for examples , Medisave helps people to save money for their future medical expenses during their younger age , Medishield allows more people to be able buy an affordable insurance since the premium of the Medishield can be deducted from their Medisave accounts , while Central Provident Funds allows people to be less worried about their silver age expenses , include medical expenses .
These policies have helped to ensure that people will be more able to pay for their future medical expenses .
Although some people might think that the government forces them to contribute part of their income as CPF is against their will , they fail to realize that this 'forcing save' can be good as it prevent them from squandering it on other less important merchandise .
Therefore , when they aged , they will not be so dependent on the government thus the government can divert the fund to other important development plan .
Other than the expenses , the science and medical discovery is one of most important factor that will help easing the aging process .
Since the risen of consciousness of balance diet , people have been consuming less salt , sugar or high fat food , and , it thus reduced the chances of suffer from chronic diseases like hypertension , diabetes , or cardiovascular diseases .
Although statistics have shown that people have become more vulnerable to these kinds of diseases , their chance of survival has been increasing as medical technology become more advance .
In additional , medicines that use to counter hypertension , diabetes have been popularized .
Thus , it enables hypertension sufferer and diabetic to work and live as normal after taken the medicine .
What will happen if older people need these medicines but these medicines is not affordable to them ?
The medisave and medishield they bought will help them pay for their expenses , although not fully pay , it would still reduce significantly .
Besides those , architectural improvement has helped aged people both with and without disability to be able to travel by themselves .
For instances , SMRT company has installed lift at every MRT station and provide bus services that is able to carry wheelchair users .
With those little extra efforts provided by the company , it would be more convenient for those aged people to ride MRT or public bus .
A decade ago , most Singapore HDB apartment lifts are not accessible on every floor , thus it was very inconvenient for older people as they still have to take the stairs which may imposed more danger to them .
Seeing this problem , the government decided to upgrade the lift systems , so we can see most HDB apartment lift is accessible on every floor now .
These cost of architectural improvement required a large amount of fund , but what driven SMRT , SBS Transit and the government to spend so much money on those upgrades even though those upgrades may not affect their profits or themselves much ?
It was because they had seen a future benefits from the upgrades as the improvements will not only benefit aged or disabled people , they will also reduce people travel time thus increase their productivity .
Hence , we can find government policies has help people to be more able to meet their medical expenses , the science discovery has help improving aged people health condition , and architectural improvement has made aged people life easier .
Combined all points mentioned above , we can conclude that current researched , developments and policies has not only been easing the aging process but also brought a lot of other benefits as well .
By the year 2030 , one in five people in Singapore will aged 65 and above .
If there is a limit to the budget , the quality of life that the government provides for the elderly will be affected .
Lacks of family support , unemployment due to lower education level , social and political impact on the country are some of the factors why public spending on the aged should not be limited .
It should instead be increasing gradually over the years .
Traditionally , the family has been the main source of support for the elderly but over the years , due to the effects of massive migration of young adults and higher cost of living in Singapore , more elderly are being deprived of such support .
Many of the young adults are leaving Singapore because of the stifling atmosphere of the country and the political and intellectual lock step enforced by the government .
Some are also attracted by the job offers overseas .
With them leaving the country , elderly are the ones who suffer because they are being left alone and most of the time , their children do not have the intention of coming back .
Tribunal cases of elderly demanding financial assistance from their children in Singapore has increased over the years .
Although the government is studying the best way to use the Maintenance of Parents Act to get such children to do their filial duty , they should also set aside more budgets each year so as to act as a cushion in case the children themselves have difficulty financing their own family .
Most of the elderly do not have proper education that is needed in today's society in order to meet ends needs .
With age catching up with time , their productivity is decreasing and eventually companies will hire new employee to replace them .
If the government were to limit our spending on them , they will face lots of potential problems such as unemployment or retrenchment , which will have a spillover effect on their children supporting them financially .
However some companies do retain their older workers because of loyalty but if there is a crisis , they will still be the first one to get laid off .
The government has done well by providing handouts to the elderly but this could only satisfy a percentage of the elderly population .
There are still many families who need the government's aid in order to meet their needs .
Our population is aging and by spending more on the aged , people can be assured that when they aged , the government will be there to support them .
With this in mind , they will be spurred to work harder and contribute more to society .
On the other hand , if there is a limit spending on the aged , people will tend towards individualism .
This will over time causes them to be more focus on their individual interests without taking the interests of society into consideration .
This will greatly affect Singapore since we are a multi racial society and working together towards a common goal is important for us .
Besides social impact to the country , political impact will be another factor to take into consideration .
By not limiting the budget for the aged , the government can be assured of support from the elderly during a political election which may be critical for winning since Singapore is turning into an aging population .
According to Singapore statistics the percentage of elderly in Singapore is 8 .7% of the entire population and this number is increasing slowly every year .
It may not be the bulk of the population but it might be a significant percentage of votes .
Singapore has done well over the years by implementing projects helping the poor and it had gained the trust and support of the citizens .
It is therefore crucial to maintain or improve its image of doing so .
In summary , having a limit to the budget will eventually have long-term implications to the country's process and growth .
The government should increase the limit gradually every year in pace with economic growth .
Instead of treating the elderly in society as an expense , the government can think of ways to harness the knowledge and experience from them so that they can contribute back more into society .
In the recent years , along with the decline in birth rate , the proportion of the aged in our population has also increased .
This leads us to a major problem of our time , known as ageing population .
Governments around the world have been actively seeking measures to cope with the problem , one of which is to increase the public spending on the aged .
Even though public spending on the elderly is essential for a country to deal with an ageing population , it should be limited because of the underlying negative implications .
Instead , more of the expenditure should go towards other forms of development .
Though many may claim that the bulk of the amount needed to support the aged should come from the government who has the greatest financial power in supporting them , however , this public spending should be limited .
The reason is , the government is not the only form of support for the aged .
The elderly's children are also another form of support .
If large expenditure were to be dedicated in helping the elderly , the children may in turn over rely on the government to support their aged family members instead of both parties playing a part in sharing the burden of supporting them .
In Singapore for instance , the government is not the sole party that is responsible in supporting the ageing population .
The government only contributes through the distribution of subsidies to help the aged while their children carry the responsibility in supporting them .
Therefore , to prevent over dependence on the government by the children , public spending should be limited and be diverted to other areas for better use .
Alternatively , limited public spending may not be ideal .
In the event that the government's expenditure on the aged is restricted while the number of elderly is surging , the needs of the elderly may not be completely attended .
Such a circumstance will affect a country's development .
This is because since the aged's basic needs are not attended , they have to work in order to fulfill them .
With the presence of the aged in the workforce , the latter will not be competitive .
Hence , since the workforce is the main sector that drives the economy , an ageing workforce which is inefficient will slow down economic growth and hinders the country's progress .
However , this usually assumes that there are no measures which prepare the people for old age .
Currently , many governments have implemented measures which enforce compulsory savings for old age , such as the Singapore government which implemented Medisave .
Hence , even though if public expenditure on the aged were to be limited , people have these savings in which when combined with the government aid , are more than sufficient to attend to their needs .
Hence , limitation of public expenditure is still feasible and should be encouraged so that money can be diverted into other areas of the country's development .
In conclusion , it is inevitable for countries to deal with an ageing population .
However , apart from coping with the latter , a country must not neglect other parts of developments which are crucial to the country as well .
Therefore , it is advisable for public expenditure on the aged to be limited so that , no other sectors are being sacrificed at the expense of dealing with the aged .

In the year 2040-1 .3 billion senior citizens by Maggie fox w .canada .com/health/seniors/year+2040+billion+senior+citizens/18088 30/story .html
As we know , the aged , which also known as gray population , is increasing rapidly nowadays .
Growing gray population means more things to be sacrificed; one of them is public money that is spent to fund the aged , or usually known as public spending for the aged .
In Indonesia , the budget on it is not so clear that government can spend much money for them without any limitation .
However , the infrastructure of Indonesia is not well constructed yet .
We can see it from many evidences that present , such as the currency of Indonesian rupiah which is very weak compared to other currencies .
Therefore , we can say that limitation on spending for the aged is a good idea since in Indonesia , there is still many areas that are not well developed yet especially in economic area .
Thirdly , limitation on public spending for the aged is not as bad as it is heard .
For example , the government makes a policy which says that only 2% from Nett National Product should be spent on older people .
If Nett National product of Indonesia is about 10 billion Rupiah per month , it means that 200 million Rupiah should be allocated to be spent on the aged .
Then , the government uses the rest of Nett National Product to improve Indonesia's economy .
After one year , due to economical improvement , Indonesia's Nett National Product raises up to 20 billion per month .
Then Indonesia should allocate 400 million Rupiah to fund the elderly .
This example reflects that spending on the aged will be raised together with the raising of Nett National Product which is earned from the improvement of the economic sector in Indonesia .
To sum up , government of Indonesia should limit its spending on the aged and improve other areas of the country , especially economic area .
In fact , limitation on it does not always mean bad .
We can us percentage system for the policy on it which means that the amount of spending for the aged will raise altogether with the improvement of economy sector .
Now , the challenge for the government is to look for the best way to improve the economic situation in Indonesia .
As the proportion of the world's population in the older ages continues to increase , many observers are concerned that an ageing population will accelerate growth in health care spending as individuals tend to use more healthcare facilities when they age .
In the case of Australia , government spending on health rose by $6 .1 billion or $267 per person in 2003 to 2004 .
Increased health care spending results in a smaller ratio of the government's spending on other areas like infrastructure and defend , leading to economical impacts .
I do not agree that public spending on the aged should be limited because spending money on the aged such as facilities and equipment is something that is definitely necessary for a society to be able to advance with no one left behind .
Rather than it being limited , public spending on the aged should be referred to as being controlled .
As long as needs are fulfilled , spending within a budget allows sufficient funds to be disturbed to other areas as well .
Society might find it difficult to advance if the aged population is being left behind as the mindsets , cultures and values of these different age groups would not be able to shift together with time .
This will result in the clashes of opinions and thinking , especially during the process of implementation of policies .
These clashes will slow down the progress of administrative work , causing possible long term impacts to be felt by the economy .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited because the impacts caused by the limited spending will lead to long run negative impacts on the country's economy .
By 2040 , the number of over-65s will top 1 .3 billion people and account for some 14% of the world's population .
Therefore , by encouraging the older workforce to go for retraining , it will increase the productivity of these workers and hence their employability .
This will reduce the burden on the government as the government is no longer required to look after the basic necessities of the aged if they were able to be independent and self-reliant in meeting the needs of their daily lives .

There always have been numerous on-going researches , development or policies to help the easing of the process of aging .
How exactly do we define "easing of the aging process" ?
In the simplest terms , it refers to helping the elderly to age with convenience , to age with ease , and to age with grace .
Personally , I agree to a large extent that current research , development or policies in the architecture , economics and medical fields have help to ease the aging process .
There will be three reasons to be elaborated in the following paragraphs .
Secondly , the Singapore government has employed initiatives to help elderly to extend their working lives .
This is to achieve reduced financial and emotional dependency on the younger generation by the elderly .
This is especially important for any aging population just like Singapore .
The news articles also have been reportedly quoting that the government hopes to reduce the impacts of an aging population by extending working lives .
As such , they came up with initiatives like Skills Program for Upgrading and Resilience  , for the elderly who wish to work longer .
This program will enable the elderly to upscale their skills so that they can be retained in employability by their employers  .
Another initiative is the Lifelong Income For the Elderly under the Central Provident Funds Scheme  , whereby there is a fixed amount of income for elderly who is aged 65 years old and above .
This will then ensure financial protection for the elderly when they reach the age  .
On the contrary , people often question the effectiveness of these initiatives .
They may have doubts about is the fund enough to achieve a high percentage of elderly to work longer or can the companies cope with re-employment of older workers ?
With regards to this , the Prime Minister of Singapore , Mr . Lee Hsien Loong had reassured the public that the government will continue to revise the initiatives to make sure that the elderly can work longer with ease .
With regards to the ability of the companies to cope with re-employment of older workers , the government has introduced another program know as the ADVANTAGE !
Scheme; which offer grants up to $400 ,000 to companies who are interested to re- employ older workers  .
This is to help them to deal with changes in areas such as wage restructuring and the cost to re-train the older workers .
As such , with these initiatives , the public should be rest assured that the minimum of initiatives will be carried out to guarantee that the elderly can extend their working lives with least problems .
In this way , they can then work to occupy themselves and age with ease that they can at least contribute to the economy .
In conclusion , current research and development have indeed helped the elderly in their aging process in the ways as mentioned above .
Despite the fact that we do not know the exact measurements of how well these developments have helped the elderly , it is for sure these developments are done to make sure our aging population can be well taken care of .
Furthermore , the most important thing here is that we can see everyone to age with ease , grace and happiness so that there will be lesser aging issues to be addressed .
Expenditure by government , health , education , infrastructure , industrial and socials are examples of government public spending .
Today , government emphasizes more on the aged and spends a high sum of money to assist them .
Quoted from the NHS Community Care Statistics in year 2009 , 1221000 older people are receiving some local authority supported care services which use  5 .9 billion .
This amount of money can be use for further development .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be reduced so that more spending can be diverted to other sector of the country's development .
Furthermore , infrastructure development requires a higher percentage of spending compare to spending on aged because infrastructure plays an important role in ameliorating the standard of living of a country .
Transportation is very important in Singapore because almost all will need to travel .
Singapore transportation consist Mass Rapid Transit  , Singapore Changi Airport and others .
Government should spend more on transportation by providing more facilities for the disable and poor .
Other than that , improvement in waste management is required as pollution is a big issue till today .
More recycle bin or "Saving the Earth" event should be carried out by the government .
On the other hand , renewable energy usage such as solar energy , wind energy and water energy should be used more frequently in order to reduce the usage of nonrenewable resources .
For example , wind power generation has a significant share in total electricity generation in Denmark  , Spain  and Germany  .
Hence , government should pay more attention into saving natural resources .
Each and every sector of a country is undeniably important to make the country a better place .
However , each sector should have priority depends on the level of importance .
Government should think wisely and choose the sector which has more privileges .
In conclusion , government must pay more attention to other important sectors because every sector plays an important role for the sake of the country .
Therefore , government should not focus too much of their spending on the aged .
Public spending is the government's expenditure on various sectors , which includes funding for the aged , defence , education and health .
Public expenditure is usually funded by taxing the working class .
In most countries , the government funds the elderly population .
Public spending should be limited , as it cannot be used as a long-term solution to help the aged .
Funds should be diverted to other areas of the country's development which are equally , if not more important .
It is the government's responsibility to take care of the people's welfare and support them financially .
Hence , it is only right that there are funds allocated to helping the aged .
Many countries have allocated part of the country's annual budget to helping the older generation .
Take for example in Singapore , the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , often works closely with voluntary welfare organisations to provide community-based programmes and residential care for the aged .
This includes elderly homes and activity centres .
However , public spending on the aged should be limited as the people should be self-reliant .
Compulsory savings implemented in certain countries such as Britain , Australia and Singapore help ensure that the people have enough savings to meet their retirement needs .
Britain has introduced a compulsory pension scheme in 2006 where the employees have to contribute 4 percent of their monthly pay while their employers have to contribute 3 percent .
Australia's compulsory superannuation system also prepares the people for their old age .
These saving schemes in different countries would help ensure that the people have a minimum amount of savings after they have retired .
Hence they would most likely be more self-sufficient and public spending on the aged should be limited .
Public spending on the aged is the expenditure by the government covering on health , infrastructure and projects aimed at improving the lives of the elderly .
A large amount of the expenditure used is contributed by government taxation on the working citizens .
The other areas of a country's development include investing in education , military , economic and infrastructure .
Funding for the aged is necessary as there is a growing trend in the ageing population but more importantly resources should be allocated away from just the aged itself to other country's development that will indirectly aid the ageing population .
Furthermore , the money that is spent on the aged ultimately comes from the pocket of the working population .
Hence , more time and effort should be placed on the other areas of the country's development which will in turn reduce the negative effects of an ageing population .
Secondly , it is important for the government to spend on education .
Education should be provided for every person since young because one will become more knowledgeable about the things around him or her .
Better education leads to more job opportunities and increases one's ability to earn more money and think critically .
By having a good education system , more jobs will be created and this in turn leads to development in a country .
Thirdly , we must note that public spending on the aged turns out to be the healthy and the working population who are forking out the money .
If the working population were to pay entirely for the healthcare of the aged , then individuals will not take responsibility to keep themselves self-sufficient and healthy during their old age .
This would not be a fair arrangement .
The individual must be made to be accountable for his or her own health and not relying totally on the public spending by the government .
However , we must note that certain public spending on the aged cannot be compromised and must be put in place by the government in order for the aged to stay healthy and not be a burden to the society .
Instead of spending money on treating the illnesses of the elderly , money should be allocated to promote healthy lifestyle in the elderly .
For example , lessons in gymnasia and fitness centres can be conducted specially for the aged to encourage them to exercise and keep a healthy lifestyle .
In Singapore , we have the Wellness Programme to encourage healthy living through medical check-ups , regular exercise and social networking .
In the matter of medical care , the government should also take responsibility to ensure that doctors remain professionally competent , and that hospitals and polyclinics have the best available facilities .
In addition , the costs for medical care should be subsidised as some treatments can really be expensive and most of the people will not be able to afford .
Therefore public spending on healthcare and activities to promote healthy lifestyle are still necessary .
All in all , public spending on the aged should be limited because putting more effort and money into other sectors of development will turn out to be a better solution to help ease the negative effects of an ageing population .
However , public spending on certain areas of the aged cannot be compromised because they are necessary to maintain a healthy ageing population .
Therefore it is important to strike a balance on the allocation of public spending in order for the country to develop favourably .
Singapore is facing a fast growth of aging population .
Without immediate actions from both the government and the society , it might create problems for the country and elderly themselves in the future .
Singapore's economy might be in danger due to lack of productivity , and the elderly might find difficulties in coping with the aging process .
Realizing this impending danger , the government has been taking some new policies in economy and social policy .To a large extent , current research and policies have helped to ease aging process .
In economy  , the government has helped older workers to be economically productive by encouraging employers to hire , re-hire , and retain more mature workers .
The older workers themselves are encouraged to grow and develop their skills to meet the companies' standards .
The government also lengthened the retirement age to be 65 years-old instead of 62 years-old .
All procedures of this program are arranged under the new law , Re-employment law , which will come into effect in January 2012 .
It is hoped that the longer the workers work , the more money they can save for their life after retirement .However , some people think that the policy is ineffective .
The Re-employment Law will take into effect in 2012 .
Meanwhile there is an urgent need to protect older workers nowadays since many employers still have the mindset that mature workers have outlived their productivity .
As a result , many older workers are not guarranted to secure their job after 62 years-old at this moment .
Realizing this challenge , the government has encouraged companies which are willing to apply the new policy before 2012 by giving grants to companies and prepared the older worker to be more productive by giving workshops and courses .
In social policy , the government has tried to improve the awareness of young generation to care more about the elderly .
The Ministry of Community Development , Youth , and Sports held a Young- Old Forum in Singapore Polytechnics recently .
In this forum , the young generation is expected to spend more time and be more understanding towards the elderly .The government also encourage the elderly to run a healhty lifesyle , such as not smoking , consuming a healthy diet , and exercising regularly .
Healthy body is important because when the eldery is healthy , they will not feel useless or abandoned .
In addition , the governement has also increased its subsidies for day care , nursing home , and hospital to give the elderly a better quality of servies .
Nontheless , some people are concerned about the government's spending on providing various subsidies for the elderly .
Since everything provided by the government is considered as a right of people , the more subsidies for the elderly , the more demand will be created .
Hence , there is a worry that the government will neglect the subsidies to other important sectors , such as education and defence .However , People should not worry about this because increasing subsidies for elderly can increase the new opportunity for the young generation .
There will be more people hired in hospital , daycare , and nursing home .
It will also stimulate young generation to create new products to ease the aging process .
In other words , it creates new business opportunity .
The more business in the country , the richer the country since its economy will grow .
Therefore , the government can increase its tax base and the other fields , such as eduacation and defence , will not be neglected .
Needless to say , the current research and policies are not perfect yet .
However , to a large extent , they have helped the elderly to ease the aging process .
The existence of the new policies for helping the elderly in many fields , such as economy , social , and technology , shows that both the government and society cares about the elderly .
This will benefit both the country and the elderly .
In the long run , Singapore still can keep its global competitiveness level eventhough it has a big portion of aging population .
The golden generation itself will be happier since they will not feel to be useless or abandoned .
By the year 2050 , the projected median age of many first-world countries will reach 51 if the current situation of low fertility rates does not improve  .
With that situation on hand , many policies makers and governments are debating on the amount of public spending that should be allocated for the aged .
In my opinion , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
The governments should stress the importance of filial piety to deal with the current situation and plan well ahead to pave path for the future generations in order to minimize the impact of aging population which can be done by investing in certain areas in the country's development .
Children of the aged should be responsible for their own parents .
It is only reasonable and sensible for the children to take care of their parents as they are the ones that painstakingly brought them up , providing them with education and nurturing them into adults .
Unlike in the Asian countries , this culture is not very prominent in the western countries; the governments should encourage its citizens to take up the responsibility that is looking after their aged parents .
Doing so will not only lighten the burden on government agencies to use excessive amount of public spending on the aged , but the awareness of the importance of filial piety will be increased as well .
Reduced public spending and filial piety campaigns will have an effect that 'forces' the children to take up the responsibility for the parents .
By investing the money on areas such as healthcare and education , the future aging population will be better prepared .
The logical explanation of this claim is that when a person receives higher education , chances that he will be able to earn a much more substantial income as compared to those who are deprived from education is relatively higher .
What we could conclude from this is that he will be able to save more for his retirement and thus the need to depend on others such as government agencies or family members will be reduced .
Besides that , investing in the areas of healthcare will suggest that in the near future to come , the aged population will be healthier and thus less prone to illnesses that are associated with aging .
This is important as the problem faced by most of the aged population is the capability to cope with the high medical costs when illnesses such as strokes or heart diseases strike .
Therefore , instead of just focusing on solving the current situation by pumping excessive amount of money into the aged population , the governments should use the money that is saved from limiting the amount of public spending on the aged to prepare the current generation of adults for their future retirements .
Even though public spending on the aged population should be limited , assistance should be made readily available to those who are under privileged .
The respective governments must take into consideration that within the aged population there are people whom are childless , single or even deserted by their own children .
These are the people that will really need help from the government agencies .
If the public spending were to be over constrained , it will deprive those who are genuinely in need of help from getting sufficient assistance .
This will only add on to the social implications , such as senior citizens going around begging for money , which most countries are already facing .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged population should be limited but not to such a large extent that it will deprive those who are really in need of assistance from getting aids .
Also , filial piety should be heavily emphasized by the government bodies in concurrent with the implementation of limiting the budget on aged population .
The implications that come with changes tend to be too much for most governments to handle yet only through changes that the possibilities of a better future will emerge .
Therefore , with great foresight and careful planning , the governments could better prepare themselves for the up surging numbers of aging population by implementing the right policies and investing in the areas of country's development that will benefit both the aged population and the general society .
Aging issues have gained substantial attentions from the public recently .
Along with it , we have also observed a huge increase in public spending for elderly housing , healthcare and retirement welfare .
Every policymaker needs to consider the effects of their proposed policies on this issue thoroughly before implementing .
Based on the possible future benefit brought by various policy options , it is reasonable for us to limit the financial budget for the aged and channel it to other economic perspectives despite the pressing calls for increasing public pensions for the elderly .
Some people argue that limiting public pensions for the aged will bring detrimental effects to their livings .
I acknowledge the importance of essential healthcare , housing and retirement living expenses being subsidised by public pensions .
However , limiting public pensions does not equal to removing it .
The key concept here is effective management of limited resources to achieve maximum benefit for the aged .
Increase in public spending may not solve the problems from core unless we utilise the funds in appropriate ways .
We still have room to improve for our current welfare system .
If we can modify our system to be more efficient and effective without much increase the governments' financial budget , we are able to make room for better use of public funds in other important aspects to aid our economic development .
This will in return bring back more funds for the aged in the future .
As mentioned above , country's development will determine its future financial capacity to solve various social problems including aging .
Funds pumped into elderly welfare will be exhausted with minor future economic benefits for the entire country .
In contrast , if we channel our funds to other economic activities such as developing infrastructure and tax incentives for entrepreneurships , we are likely to have a good yield for our future economy .
Most developed nations have their population rapidly aging .
Definitely , there will be an increase in public spending on the aged .
However , we should not place our focus in financing the aged .
Instead , the society is able to afford this growing aging population only when we can assure that growth rate of our economy is able to match that of aging population .
Thus , economic development is a critical indicator of our capability to deal with aging problem in the future .
Moreover , an aging population also presses heavily on our current working structure and environment .
We must deal with problems such as labour force shortage and low productivity to ensure the sustainable development of our economy before we could proceed to handle the costly expenses such as the healthcare , housing and retirement benefits of the aged .
Governments have wasted significant amount of public pensions on the aged due to inaccurate estimations and inefficient uses of funds .
Firstly , they failed to recognise the fact that the daily living expenses of the elderly would be less than an ordinary working person and established the retirement benefits system according to the average personal monthly spending of the working force .
A slight deviation of a few hundred dollars for each individual will sum up to a huge amount for the entire state .
Secondly , most countries do not target the needy people effectively .
Taking an example , the Retirement Insurance Benefits are issued according to the amount of social security payroll taxes paid into the Social Security Trust Fund in the USA .
With less contribution to the fund in their early working days , they will obtain less after they retire .
However , the low income group is the neediest group for retirement benefits and yet the least contributing group to the social security payroll taxes at the same time .
This retirement scheme further worsens the income inequality problem .
It is recommended that governments could conduct various assessments to distribute public pensions to those who really need it .
For example , Australia has implemented means-testing scheme for the Age pension .
The means tests begin to reduce the pension at fixed levels of income and/or wealth and the pension declines linearly to zero as income and/or wealth increases .1
In conclusion , for the future of the country , public spending on the aged should be carefully examined , and more focus should be placed on economic development instead .
We also need to note that it is important not just to cut the budget but come out with a detailed alternative plan to support the aged .
Careful management of current expenses along with expanding economy will be our only feasible cure to aging problems .
However , there is still an increase in the number of elderly suicide cases despite many psychological help from social groups such as The Singapore Action Group for Elderly and many others .
This is supported by the news report in The Sunday Times on 12 August 2008 which stated an increase in the number of suicide cases of elderly aged 65 and above from 69 cases in 2006 to 87 cases in 2008 .
From the statistic above , it has shown that the current research and development or policies may not be successful in helping the elderly to cope with the aging process such as becoming physically disabled or less worthy in the society due to loss of working ability .
Hence , the elderly become depressed over the problems they faced in the aging process which leads them to commit sucide .
Although there is an increase in the number of elderly committing suicides , it is only a small number of elderly committing suicides in Singapore which stand less than a percent of the total aging population .
The increase of number of suicide cases may also be simply due to the increase in population size .
In general , the current research and development or policies may have helped almost all the elderly to cope with the problems in aging process .
Therefore , the number of elderly suicide cases is not significant .
Currently , there have been many upgrading projects carried out in the older estate where the population there consists of mainly elderly .
In these upgrading projects , there are lifts upgrading to make the lift stop at every floor of the flat and paths made even with gentle slopes around the estate .
These improvements in the infrasuture of the older estate make the estate more accessible for the elderly .
This is because in the aging process of the elderly , physical health deterioration is one of the problems they faced .
They usually will have diffculty travelling around their estate as many of them may have problems climbing stairs and walking on uneven roads .
Some of elderly are also wheel chair bounded which adds on to the diffculty to travel .
Thus , with the lifts upgade and even paths , they can take the can the lifts just outside their doors and move around the estate with no constraint due to unaccessible paths .
This help to solve the problem they faced during their aging process , allowing them to travel and socialise without being bounded by physical restriction .
Elderly in Singapore is enjoying a better quality of life under the current research and development or policies for them .
The current research and development in technological products and architecture improvement have helped the elderly to cope with the diffculties they may face at old age .
Thus , this eases their aging process through providing them a more comfortable and easier life compared to the past when there is no such research and development or policies available .
A new paradigm shift and various strategies are required to enable the elderly to be more physically independent since much could be done to forestall some of the negative impact of a fast aging population .
According to the National Institute on Aging  , in the last two decades , the rate of disability among older people has been reduced dramatically .
Progressive research and development have eased the aging population to a great extent by reducing the rate of physical illness and disabilities among them .
Practically , with the recent invention of electric wheelchair , disabled elderly can manoeuvre and are more physically independent .
Electric wheelchairs are extremely useful especially to those elderly who suffer from upper body weakness that prevents them from using a manual wheelchair .
This merchandise encourages the golden generation who spend most of their time on bed or chair to move around with the controls provided eventually brightening up their lives .
Regardless , electric wheelchairs are too expensive for most elderly to afford even though it helps them a lot in terms of independence .
Besides , entrusting an elderly who is not well versed with technology with such contraptions might be dangerous should accidents happen .
Even so , Medicare has been giving assistance to elderly who need wheelchairs as long as the elderly provides a written prescription from the doctor stating the need of having such wheelchair .
According to Oxford University Press  most elderly feel satisfied with the use of wheelchairs and even use it for shopping , visiting parks and socialising which proves that it is safe .
Apart from that , the British government policies on human equality , age discrimination and employment have helped the aged improve their lives drastically .
Most elderly face discrimination in employment and training opportunities to develop themselves and earn a living .
With the equality policy being implemented , elderly have the opportunity to be treated fairly especially by the employers .
Thus , they are able to accumulate more wealth and reduce their dependency on their children's monthly support .
Britain even implemented the policy on community service such as better transport link in order to provide the elderly with independent lives .
On the other hand , most employers unwilling to hire the older people as they are not as productive as the younger generation and might cause more liabilities to the company if they claim a large sum of money on their medical purposes .
Furthermore , a better transportation link means more money needed to be allocated by the government on this sector .
Well , improvement on the transportation not only helps the elderly , it also encourages the public to use the public transport which reduce pollution as well as traffic jams and older people are wiser in the sense that they are more experienced compare to the na ve and impatient younger generation .
It is also not necessary that elderly will claim more money on medical since chronic diseases attack humans without the age barrier .
In the progress of developing mortality in old age , Natural Institute of Aging has done a lot of research to reduce the disabilities and burden suffered by the elderly through studies on the alteration of genes and hormones .
Information from the fields of biochemistry , genetics and physiology has been applied in research to repair tissues and replace injured cells by using stem cells .
Researchers have been furiously expanding their understanding on these pathology changes and identifying the parts of the brain to improve human memory abilities .
At the same time , scientists explore methods to replace dysfunctional cells and develop a protective brain cell into the brain to prevent Alzheimer .
However , these researches do not guarantee that the hormones they produce are useful and it costs a large sum of money to maintain such experiments .
Furthermore , not many people can afford to undergo such gene alter operations .
In spite of that , the government has allocated a large sum of money towards research in the annual budget to encourage new findings on hormones and genetics which could protect aging people in the future .
Subsidies are provided to the elderly to help them with their necessities which indirectly gives them the opportunity to undergo genetic and hormones exchanges .
In conclusion , research and development is the best method to help the elderly survive several conditions that compromise the quality of their health and independence .
Thus , to a large extent , current research and development as well as policies have helped to reduce the effects of aging process in many aspects .
Nowadays , balancing public spending is a big concern to most of governments since they need to carefully evaluate the most suitable spending areas for short and long-term plan .
Failure to make decision in government budget will affect whole countries' systems including economy , education , or environment , etc .
This essay argues that public spending on the aged , one of the most major categories almost governments recently invest in , should be limited for developing other countries' important areas , promoting their sustainable growths , and forming people's responsibilities .

Secondly , what I want to emphasize is that the governments only limit the public expense , which does not mean that they totally abandon the aged .
There are still activities carried out to help the elder such as providing free travel on public transportation in cities or subsidizing old people's homes , etc .
Opponents of this position argue that the elder should be paid attention with more and more subsidies because they are the predecessors with a lot of commitment to societies .
However , limiting expenditure on the elder enables countries to invest more in another aspects like economy , education , environment or infrastructure .
Then the countries are stronger and stronger , supporting the aged with large amount of money .
We agree with Chan  , who concluded: The government has played a strong and pivotal role in developing policies for the aged that both protect the rights of older members in society and , at the same time , reinforce values believed to be important for the society .
Thirdly , less spending on the aged helps decrease the proportion of dependence rate .
In 2009 , 11% is the percentage of Asia older dependency , which is anticipated to reach 28% in 2040 .
Similarly , the older dependency ratio of Western Europe is projected to increase by approximately 50% from 27% to 53% .
It goes on to reinstate the elder do count more on the state; subsequently , more resources must be diverted into caring for them .
Hence , the government should limit the aged subsidies in order to stimulate their responsibilities .
In addition , requiring people to save money in advance can be the incentives for their independence .
"They should be encouraged or compelled by law to save and invest more of their income earned while they are active in workforce" .
.
Peterson also adds that governments and policy makers need to take in to careful consideration what is essentially supported by the public sector and what should depend on their own financial capacities .
All in all , every country has to formulate and implement the long-term public spending strategy , which mainly depends on different countries' economic , social and education backgrounds .
And restricting the cost on the aged in order to advance other necessary areas is a difficult decision for them .
Nevertheless , it is a critical and ultimate path to their full developments .

A graying world .
Harvard International Review
"Aging" , the fact that human life expectancy is extending longer and longer whilst the fertility rate is reducing gradually , "is a continuous , complex , and dynamic process that begins with birth and ends with death ."
Aging populations imply there are pressures stressing on fewer young workers in the workforce who have to support increasing old populations .
Obviously , aging population refers to one of the most difficult challenges that policy makers worldwide are facing currently - how to fund for the elderly in the society .
Although contradict opinions related to this topic , more and more people agree upon the point that public spending on the aged should be limited based on arguments that other areas such as education need more public financial resources , other social security welfare systems have proven to achieve reasonable successes and old people still can possess independent lifestyles .
In order to avoid the risky consequences of fully-funded social security system foregoing , some countries opt to go with another manner , including Pay-as-you-go system .
Singapore government is among one of the authorities implementing the system via their Central Provident Fund  Scheme .
CPF requires employees to save for their retirement years whilst they are still working .
Social responsibility stands in the fact that employers also contribute to their employees' saving accounts at the rate of 14 .5% .
However , detractors usually argue that the effect of inflation rate increases costs of living steadily over the time; as a result , old generations who retired in the 80s or 90s are likely to suffer in the current situation where prices are highly inflated .
Therefore , a co-residence model which appears to be a complement factor helps to reduce stresses on public funds .
It works with the logic of letting children take care of their own parents , which considerably effective under Asian cultures and contexts .
Thus , there is no denying the fact that the good performance in Singapore herself is a convincing illustration for limiting public expenses on the elderly and investing in other fields such as education and research .
Adding more strength to ideas of restricting funds for the old generations , many people point out that the word "old" does not link to disability , institutionalization .
Recent researches have shown that only four or five percent of our older friends or relatives are institutionalized at any one time .
In other words , majority of old populations can live independently .
Moreover , they are capable of obtaining a healthy lifestyle via doing exercises and maintaining proper nutrition plan .
For examples , in 2008 , the Stanford University Medical center team found that elderly joggers are less likely to be killed by diseases like cancer , neurological diseases and infections .
It is to re-confirm that regular exercises provide the elderly with mobile and independent lives , stronger hearts and fewer healthcares required .
Ultimately , it is important to consider specific needs of the elderly rather than distributing funds in general without careful allocation .
By doing that , the remaining public fund would be used more efficiently and effectively in other investment and reinforcement activities and the country would be benefited subsequently .
In Singapore today , our median age is 36 years and life expectancy is 80 years .
This number has significantly increased from 24 years since 1980 , and predicted to reach 54 years within the next 40 years , similar to that of Japan and Italy now .
There will be increased burden for the working adult population to provide for the aged dependents , be it healthcare or finances .
This is made worse with the shrinking workforce that we are now experiencing .
However , current research and developments , and polices have effectively help eased the aging process .
This is done through technological advances in medical care , policies to encourage financial independency among the elderly , and adopting a foreign talent policy .
Firstly , recent research and developments have resulted in higher levels of medical care .
For example , new and better treatment methods like open heart surgery or radiotherapy help increase the chances of recovery and decrease time required for recovery from illnesses .
New vaccines and immunizations site are constantly developed to help prevent diseases at an early stage too .
In 2008 , a team of researchers from Wayne State University successfully developed a breast cancer vaccine that is able to treat women with treatment-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer , and prevent cancer from occurring again .
This creates two benefits pertaining to aging population .
One , the population will be generally healthier , with a smaller tendency to fall sick , which otherwise disrupts productivity of the economy and increases the need for medical services and facilities .
Next , by reducing the recovery period for illnesses , people who are ill , especially the elderly population who are more prone to sickness , will require less treatment sessions or usage of hospital facilities and thus incur less medical expenses too .
One may argue that the latest medical treatment methods tend to be very costly and the average elderly in Singapore may not be able to afford them .
This problem is solved with the use of subsides for elderly by the government , to keep medical fees for these new treatment methods within an affordable range .
This would also be just considered as a short term measure , taking into account future medical advances .
More cost efficient methods for the same treatment would be developed which lower treatment costs to a point where only minimal subsides is required .
Secondly , policies to encourage financial independency among the elderly , for instance CPF  , Medishield and the extended retirement age from 60 to 62 years in 1999 .
By increasing the retirement age , it creates a motivating effect on people to work till at later age , so as to enjoy benefits like pensions and government incentives after retirement .
They would also be able to obtain more wealth which they could use to support themselves in old age .
This helps lessen the government's burden to provide for the elderly , and the effects of a shrinking workforce brought by aging population .
Companies would also be able to benefit more from the experience and expertise of their more elder employees .
In addition , elderly workers tend to have lower turnover rates for employment , which is beneficial to the company .
For example Wal-mart , the world's largest public corporation by revenue , actively hires elderly workers for her operations  close to 20% of Wal- mart's workforce is at least 55 years old .
One may argue that this in a sense forces later retirement , especially for people with insufficient savings to depend on without a job .
However it also emphasizes a greater need to be financially independent and help create more elderly involvement in the society which contributes to the economy .
Thirdly , foreign talent policy , of which the government embraces , also played an important role in easing the aging process .
Foreign talents help increase the workforce in the economy , which helps to solve the problem of shrinking workforce brought about by aging population .
Effective use of their expertise also helps create a more productive economy and generate more economic income which could be diverted to helping the elderly population .
More importantly , they create greater diversity and especially vibrancy in the country , of which lack of it is evidently seen in some countries in Europe due to a decreasing proportion of youths brought about by aging population .
A recent study also indicated a 170 percentage increase in Singapore's non-resident workforce over the last decade , from 248 ,000 in 1990 to 670 ,000 in 2006 .
One of the most common arguments against the policy would be that the increased competitiveness of employment which results in loss of jobs for the local population , even with the implementation of foreign employment quota ratios by the government .
However , from a different viewpoint , the increased competition results in greater competitiveness of our firms not only within Singapore's economy but globally as well .
This policy would also be vital for Singapore to sustain strong economic growth and competitiveness in the global market in the future .
All in all , current research and development , and policies have been successful in easing the aging process , through advancements in healthcare , encouraging financial interdependency and embracing foreign talent .
In the years to come , we will face greater challenges as we gradually experience the full impact of the aging population , of which new strategies will have to be integrated along with the current ones to meet the changing circumstances that we might face .
According to Administration of Aging  in America , the figure of the older population which refer to persons 65 years or older is 37 .3 million in 2006  and this statistics is anticipated to grow more than double by the year 2030 .Concern about aged has surfaced with such dramatic force and recognition by so many nations .
Aging populations present considerable challenges to serious fiscal consequences for welfare states .
It is important that the publicly-financed health and welfare packages on the older people who tend to be the principal beneficiaries are implemented effectively .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to divert the money to other areas of the country's development .
Limiting the public spending on the aged may impose financial burden on the future generations simultaneously as the main resource for financial support of elderly is family .
Children of the aged have to undertake the higher proportion of expenses especially in the aspect of medical .
In the other hand , Peterson  had suggested that societies in weak extended family , high elder poverty and quick-rising of long term care costs should learn from Japan where most elderly people still living with their adult children .
Filial obligation and willingness of grown children to take care their aged parents are needed indeed .
However , adult nowadays are stressful enough in facing the competitive dynamic world and high living expenses .
S . Banthin  , Cunningham and M . Bernard said that "financial burdens of health care have increased to the point at which private insurance is no longer able to provide financial protection for an increasing number of families ."
Elderly would suffer more financial hardship if limit the public spending on them especially for those who are single , less educated , less savings or neglected by their own children .
Homelessness , hunger and higher proportion of unmet health care needs could happen on them .
The Centre for Disease Control  has introduced with their "State of Aging and Health in America" report with the statistics "88% of those over 65 years of age have at least one chronic health condition" .
It is quite a shocking statistics for elderly diseases .
Aged people may unable to seek for medical assistance when they suffer from sickness such as heart attack , high blood pressure and etc .
They need to work in order to support themselves .
Elderly who collecting old newspaper and soft drink cans along the street can be seen frequently .
Peterson  suggested aged people should be encouraged to plan for their future old age life by saving and investing part of their income earned in their young working life .
For example , Singapore main retirement's scheme , the Central Provident Fund system , is one of the way of funded retirement saving .
However , high living and medical expenses could make them have not enough funds to support themselves in their old age .
In addition , some of the elderly may spend all their savings for their children education but in vain because they are neglected by their children .
Wide array of aging issues are complex and inevitable but not insurmountable .
Flexibility in implementing policies should be maintained when facing unpredictable challenges in the future .
As Friedland and Summer  said , "Reducing the share of public support is merely leaves the individuals and their families responsible for larger proportion and some of the costs are shifting back to the public sector through other means .
"Therefore , wise policy planning in diverting the public spending to all areas of the country's development is more effective instead of limiting the public spending on the aged .

The populations of many countries are rapidly ageing as a result of declining fertility and increasing longevity .
The group of 60 years or over is expected almost to triple , increasing from 673 million in 2005 and 2 billion by 2050 and the share of the elderly is also predicted to rise from 64 percent to nearly 80 percent in 2050 especially in developing countries  .
As the aging problems are getting seriously nowadays , it should not be invariably neglected by the society but to face the problem that the elderly may suffer financial hardships in their golden age after they retired .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to help the elderly to overcome the difficulties by providing various financial supports .
The elderly will face financial hardship and an excess of stress in their lives if they have no sufficient money to survive in high price era .
Financial hardship will affect the elderly living condition such as housing condition and food security as the elderly reported that their apartments were always cold in winter and they suffered malnutrition and insufficient food due to financial difficulties .
In the other hand , a huge amount of stress which may cause high blood pressure , heart disease and cancer will affect both their emotional and physical health and reduces their ability to live to the full .
However , critics of this point out that most of the elderly may not face any real financial hardship as they should have CPF savings which is sufficient for their old age needs .
In fact , it is very hard to be ensured that the money saved by the elderly for the future needs will definitely sufficient as there are lot of large unexpected expenditure such as medical fees .
Besides that , if the public spending on the aged is limited it may drastically increase the burden of future generations as they have to undertake so many responsibilities by limited income .
Burden of responsibilities of taking care of their aged parents , taking care of their children , rising cost of living and at the same time worrying about job security makes the future generations live so stressful every day in life in competitive society .
Although stress is so common and has become a part of modern life , but when their lives are full of frustrations and demands , both their body and mind pay the price .
Another argument against this statement is there is not a single doubt in society that filial piety is a value which future generations are taken for granted to uphold and they should undertake their responsibilities to take care of their old parents by financial support .
In contrast , no one would escape from the basic responsibility of taking care of their beloved family if health and financial state permit and public spending play an important role here in order to solve the problem effectively .
The elderly participate and contribute themselves in social development using their professional knowledge , skill , and experience in the types of work which they can engage in within their capacity when they were young .
The elderly have made a valuable contribution to society as they have supported economic activities as consumers , have acted actively as volunteer , have provided financial help for their children and grandchildren .
In the other words , they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness and also receive practical support in the form of money when they face difficulties in their old age but not a burden to society .
For example in Europe , Europeans strongly acknowledge the contribution of the elderly to society and the vast majority of Europeans have a generally positive image of older people and only 14% of them consider the elderly as a burden to society  .
At this point , one may wonder it is true that the elderly contribute all the enthusiasm and time in society when they are working , but they have already received salaries as their rewards and they are supposed to plan and for their old age lives instead of depending on public support .
However , their spirit of creating a better world for future generations cannot be measured by money and unfortunately if they suffer financial hardship we should help them genuinely as they are our pioneers to improve country development .
Aging problems affect both developed and developing countries in every part of the world and change the social and economic nature and present difficult challenges that public spending on the aged is increasing .
However , the participation of the elderly in social development is an integral part of country efforts to improve the scientific , literature and quality levels of population and their contribution far more to the community than you could ever imagine .
In conclusion , public spending should not be limited and divert to other areas of the country's development in order to make their old age into golden age .
Aging population nowadays has become the topic for a lot of discussion .
"As early as 1979 , the Institute for Research on Public Policy issued a report which spoke of population aging as an increasingly difficult political problem and a continuing drain upon public resource ."
.
Thus , the old are now commonly assumed as "a burden to society" .
This essay also wants to argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development because there are strategies that government can supplement to reduce that burden , and the money invested to other areas could be a big support to society .
According to "A graying world"  , there are basic strategies , which policy makers and government can consider implementing to lessen the burdensome of older generations to the younger .
These strategies prove that instead of spending much money on supporting the aged , government can seek for another alternatives to reduce the burden .
The most considerable strategy is that stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow's grown children to support their own elderly parents through informal and family channels .
Originated from Asian cultures , family obligation is the most precious thing , which characterizes the parents-children relationship .
Parents have brought their children up , and in return the children will have the responsibilities to take care of parents when they get old .
It continues for the next generation , who are their little kids .
It is the culture of family-oriented and gratitude for their parents' giving birth and a settled position to them .
Filial responsibilities might be understood in many ways , such as obligation to help elderly parents , or to keep in close contact with them , or to live near them , etc .
Societies in which the extended family is weak and high long-term care costs such as the United States should learn from Asian countries , where most elderly people still live with their adult children .
Diverting money to other areas of the country's development does not mean government will take less responsibility to this social problem .
In contrast , it should be thought as one way to help reduce the burden of aging population .
By investing to other areas such as technology , economics , service , health care , etc .
society can developed dramatically , which is in return , contributing back to lessen the burdensome of the country's development .
Hence , elder dependency could be reduced when the elder can support themselves for their own daily expense .
For instance , in Singapore , young working people who are dynamic , active , creative can take a role as main contributors to the country's budget , while the elder can work in food court or any service jobs .
That is a good classification of working labors in the society that take good advantage of the scarce labor force .
Moreover , by doing so , the elder can earn for their living , have a savings for future need on health care , and have less dependency on their younger generation .
In conclusion , this essay shows a favorable view of social spending on the aged should be limited , and money can be diverted to other areas of the development of the country .
Although it is a controversial issue to talk about aging population and its burden to the society , this essay indicates alternatives government can do besides spending too much on the aged to adapt to the challenge for the future , which is "to ensure that people everywhere will be enabled to age with security and dignity and continue to participate in their societies as citizens with full rights" . 
Countries with a fast aging population now are confronted with problems like a shrinking productivity and a heavy financial burden to support the welfare program for the elderly .
Fortunately , good news is that to a large extent , current research and development  , and government policies have taken actions to help ease the aging process .
Before going into further investigation , it is important to bear this in mind that aging process is not as simple as longevity , but associated with one's ability to contribute to the society and participate in various social activities .
To narrow down the topic , this essay is mainly to test current R&D , as well as government policies in China dealing with the aging process .
Opponents may say current clinical R&D cause an increase in longevity , which substantially raises the average age of the population .
This is true , but as mentioned , aging process does not simply mean longevity .
Clinical R&D continuously introduce people with healthier living styles , bring in more efficacious , safer and cheaper medical treatments , which allows people to look young and stay healthy so that they are still able to work actively in middle or even old age .
Furthermore , Chinese government pursues the policy of fundamental medical insurance system for urban residents .
The system gives out subsidies to refund people's medical expenditure , aiming to improve health standard .
According to official statistics , the prevalence rate of the elderly people above the age of 65 has steadily decline from 60 .2% in 1994 to 48 .4% in 2009 .
Thanks to the clinical R&D and government policies , more and more elderly are able to keep healthy , so that they can continuously contribute to the society and also participate in social activities .
In this manner , the aging process is eased .

Most people agree that the 21st century is a period when everything changes in an unprecedented high-speed .
Along with the development of technology , it's often questioned that the knowledge an elderly has is out-of-date , and may no longer be suitable in today's workplace .
To cope with it , Chinese government has made and implemented several policies like building up colleges of continuing education for the aged .
More and more skill competitions are conducted , aiming to motivating the elderly to reacquire new knowledge , as well as reforming social attitudes towards the elderly .
Recognizing the needs from continuing education , current educational R&D in China have designed and published special textbooks and guidelines to facilitate continuing education of the elderly .
Furthermore , some elderly advisory committees have been established in schools , communities , corporate , and government .
The various advisory committees stand out as a platform for the elderly to share their rich experience , which sometimes is quite precious to the young generation .
To sum up , the working barrier of the elderly has been lower and they have found different ways to enrich their lives and contribute to society .
One child policy is often a debatable topic .
It's widely acknowledged that aging population is mainly due to the low fertility rate .
Hence some criticize one child policy intensify the aging process in China .
However , some unique characteristics of Chinese society should be taken in to consideration .
China has the largest population in the world .
The census of the population in 2008 shown the fertility rate was positive 5 .2 , or 8 million per year .
In other words , the population kept growing in a large number , which was different with those countries with low or even negative fertility rates like Australia , and some other European countries .
By controlling the size of population , one child policy indirectly shifts the governmental funds from the young to the elderly , so that the government has more flexible budget to help the elderly .
In this manner , one child policy helps to ease the aging process as well .
The aging population is an inevitable trend along with social and economical developments .
China is the only developing country among the countries facing aging population , which brings about more serious problems .
Fortunately , current R&D and policies in China are in the right direction , and have significantly helped to ease the aging process .

As societies continue to develop , the problem of aging seems to be inevitable .
Issues such as high elderly dependency ratio , shrinking workforce and increasing healthcare problems resulting from an aging population are apparent in many countries of today .
In response to the aging process , policy makers have introduced sophisticated policies to ease the situation .
However , they also are aware that devising a policy that can eliminate this trend is close to impossible in the short run as the two main sources of an aging population , higher live expectancy and lower birth rate  , are unable to be affected by any policy .
Fortunately , much can be done as current research and development/policies have shown hope of easing the aging process by dealing with the consequences directly instead of the sources .
One of the problems arising from an aging population is the increase in elderly dependency ratio .
The growth of elderly dependency ratio signifies a state where an escalating numbers of beneficiaries of health and pension funds are sustained by relatively smaller number of contributors  .
By means of requiring citizens to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency , policy makers were able to ease the above mentioned situation .
Some of the countries such as Australia , British , Chile and Singapore have gained much through encouraging and means of law to convince citizen to save and invest a portion of their income earned while they are still in the workforce  .
Unfortunately , a fraction of citizens still feels that government should not intervene the way they spend or save their income .
After all they believe that they have every right to the money they earned .
However they need to understand that compulsory saving and investment are comparatively safer and more reliable than other market options .
Furthermore , not many individual has the discipline to maintain a healthy bank balance given the materialistic world of today .
Thus , compulsory saving can help guarantee a sizable amount of saving for their future and is a practical and effective way to ensure old age dependency is kept to the minimum .
Shrinking workforce is another problem arising from an aging population .
The manpower resources of many developed countries are predicted to shrink as a hefty portion of the workforce is edging towards retirement .
The resulting situation is an increase amount of stress falling onto the shoulder of the remaining working adults as they struggle to provide for their older counterpart .
In an attempt to ease the shrinking workforce , governments are attempting to utilize all available resources to the fullest .
For example , retirement age is often being raise to encourage elder workers to retire later and to accumulate more wealth to support themselves when they eventually retire  .
The solution inevitably invited criticism as many found themselves being victims of ageism , a situation where younger workers are preferred over retaining or hiring the old .
However , the situation has been improving for some countries such as Singapore .
Over the years more and more elderly are being retained or employed as a result of increased median of education among the elderly and higher live expectancy  .
This give much hope to the elderly world as they are still employable and the problem of dependency on the shrinking workforce can be lessen .
Another major issue caused by aging population is the increasing healthcare problem associated with elderly .
Governments all around the world has to make provision for improved healthcare as live expectancy of their citizens and medical technological advancement are improving by the years .
Adding on to the misery , the cost associated with healthcare is also growing with the combined effect of rising standard of living and high cost of advanced medical development .
Fortunately , policies are introduced to minimize such unavoidable cost associated with aging .
For example in Singapore , a compulsory saving program is put in place to allow elderly to save in advance during their working years and set aside money for healthcare in the future  .
Such policy can give securities for the elderly if they find themselves trapped with the high cost of healthcare .

"The speed of aging is crucial to understand because it is during the period of the fastest change when adjustments will be the most difficult ," said Warren Sanderson  , Professor and Co-Chairman of the Department of Economics , Stony Brook University .
In fact , leaders and policymakers particularly from the developed countries have proactively implemented a series of researches and policies in an effort to confront this unprecedented phenomenon .
In this context , current development has gradually helped to ease the aging process .
Aging-related problem is no longer an imminent issue that concerns a particular region but it happens to be disquieted and discussed in every country all over the world .
For instance , Germany is currently facing an acute problem of aging in Europe and this prompted the government to generate flexible jobs for elderly and discourage early retirement by cutting the pension entitlement by 3 .6 percent for each year spent in retirement before the age of 65 .
In a nutshell , current development on policy reforms and researches has been carried out simultaneously over the past decades to help cope with both societal and physical impact .
Healthcare issue has to be taken into consideration because elderly are prone to suffer from several chronic diseases as they grow older .
As a result , government has begun providing adequate medical incentives and healthcare insurance coverage to cater for the elderly .
Furthermore , advances in healthcare quality can be attributed to new medical technologies and diagnostic tools .
For example , since the mid 90's , the common usage of wire mesh stents for treatment of artery blockages are partly gained from economic returns and survival rates in the treatment of heart diseases .
However , spending more on new medical devices does not always equate to better health conditions .
In addition , increase spending on new medical technologies may restrict society's ability to expand healthcare coverage to more elderly .
Nonetheless , if the spending on healthcare is limited , the burden will increasingly fall on low-income individuals as well as their families .
Yet , policy makers and healthcare systems must seek a moderate measurement and use the best information available to evaluate cost-effectiveness and assess the economic returns of new treatments .
It is imperative for public and private sectors to optimize health status by offering preventive healthcare services across the population within a given level of outlay .
Elderly are encouraged to work longer and contribute to the growth of economy , thereby reducing elder dependency of fiscal cost .
Later retirement not only secures a better pension entitlement for the future , but also a direct mean whereby people can supplement their income in later life , thus helping them to maintain their standard of living during retirement .
Singapore , for example , has an official retirement age of 62 , but employers are now required to offer re-employment for an additional three years .
Therefore , providing opportunities for prolonged working age can essentially alleviate labor shortages and help bolster personal retirement savings .
However , older workers are usually less productive than imported foreign talents whereas employers may compromise on a small portion of existing aged employees .
If employers have the flexibility to hire older employees on a part-time basis , to vary responsibilities as the capabilities of older workers change , they will be much less reluctant to hire and retain older workers .
Alternatively , the government should encourage employment of elderly by offering privileges and incentives to private sectors .
On top of that , policies that create economic security for the elderly and remove barriers faced by them should always be a priority in this rising life expectancy .
Governments and policymakers have largely undertaken a basic nationwide infrastructure in which provides comfortable and elderly-friendly communities .
Current development on communities has created convenience to meet the needs of elderly such as barrier-free facilities , security systems , housing , transportation , and so forth .
These physical community's assets help to provide elderly a good quality of life and ease their mental health in the long run .
Hopefully , governments aim to get all elderly in communities fully engaged in social activities and involve them in lifelong learning .
Yet , some elderly are still facing a problem of being left out or discrimination in their old age .
Societies are responsible for stressing filial obligation among public to look after their elderly parents .
In the other words , it is a public consciousness of protecting elderly rights , eliminating elderly people's negative self-image , and increasing their capacity to influence policy-making .
Aging process in this changing world could have resulted significantly in politic and society with respect to acute financial problem .
In order to ease the current predicament , governments have to emphasize on distribution of their budgets and either modify ways or reallocate funds to reduce the cost of public spending .
This will compel agencies to change the way they service , especially to the elderly .
On the other hand , it is plausible to reward families for having children and enable more young people to work .
The drastic rise in numbers among the elderly will force policymakers and governments to anticipate the resultant demand for healthcare and a host of related infrastructural needs .
The future elderly will be more professional and better educated than current cohorts in many countries .
It means that they are likely to be more effective and decisive in possessing their gains and evaluating on costly or sophisticated services .
Thus , decision-makers must carry on fashioning programs to further ease the aging process nowadays without getting them locked into policies and approaches that may not be suitable for the changing composition of tomorrow's elderly .

.POPULATION AGING IS A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM - IT HAS MANY POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES AND IT COULD GET A LOT WORSE .
September 20 , 2009 , from healthfullife .umdnj .edu/archives/age_archive .htm
In addition , the technological invention segment has played apart in easing the aging process .
As Schoeni , Freedman and Martin  suggests , R&D segment has been expanding rapidly .
With the advance medical technologies , illnesses such as cardiovascular and cataract diseases have lesser occurrence .
Medical technologies are still advancing and treatments are being catered to a wide array of medical fields .
Some of which include the knee and joint replacements , treatments for arthritis and rheumatism , and vision impairment , diabetic and stem cell research .
However , the presence of R&D does come with a hefty price tag .
Medical expenses are costly and patients , especially , the elderly need to seek for welfare assistance when necessary .
Sadly , for the elderly who do not seek medical attention , they either suffer bitterly or are possibly cared for by organizations like Peace Connect Neighborhood Link in Singapore .
Countries like United States and Singapore are insured with Medicare and Medishield respectively .
We are insured despite of the high medical expenses and expenditure towards new inventions in the medical fields .
It gives a well-balance medical segment , an advance health security cycle as we reach our retirement age despite the cost .
Moreover , with the growing number of well-educated people around , there is a high probability that people do purchase private insurance to care for their own well-being .
Manpower is essential in every organization .
From Malul  findings , the elderly are counted as part of the workforce if considered age appropriate and with technology so advanced these days , the elderly in the workface may be faced with hiccups as they are not well skilled in certain aspects of technology .
This is where , training and re-training of employees is crucial .
Furthermore , organizations offering subsidies to the elderly workforce helps to minimize unemployment rates and high turnovers .
At the same time , this allows the elderly to stay active for a longer period of time in the workforce .
As to reinstate , the policies that each Country provides and the current R&D have assisted and benefited the aging process in today's society .
With the economy fluctuating , having on-going medical research and technology inventions , and people becoming more educated , there is definitely room for restructuring and improving the policies and R&D segment in the future .
Longevity has always been believed as a blessing , especially in Asia , since old days .
Chinese emperor even sent people , which in turn become the founder of Japan , to search for elixir of life that was believed to make anyone who drinks it live eternally .
We can also see that up until now , people are still wishing for health and long age .
Sadly , this creates a downturn in many developed countries .
Fast aging population has taken the spotlight of a world crisis and many governments are increasing their spending for this group as the aging population keep increasing .
For example , in 2008 , Singapore Government introduced new incentive called LIFE Bonus and provided tax relief for Central Provident Fund  members  .
More portion of national budget may later be allocated to the incentives for the old .
However , the increase of public spending on the elderly may not effective as it can be diverted to other sectors that need it .
Secondly , young generation also plays an important part in the future of a country itself , but many of first-world countries have low birth rate and keep decreasing .
Past studies  showed that Singapore's population growth is very minimum and even had reached 0% in the 1986 due to the past government policy and high education cost .
Now , the Singapore government is trying to raising the population growth by giving out incentives through Children Development Account  and building cheap and easily accessible child care centre for working parents .
But since the living cost in Singapore has been so high that it is even called as the 10th most expensive city  , government may consider increasing incentives to increase the population of new generation therefore , increasing the total number of work force and reducing the percentage of total aging population .
In the future it may also reduce the number of single elderly that in turn will provide them family that will take care of them .
In this part , education is also important as it shape future leaders for the nation itself .
Increasing education quality also means increasing quality of future's work force that should boost the nation in every sector .
Education also plays a large role in shaping the students' character and moral to prevent them from neglecting their elderly parents when they become adults .
A good academic and moral education should probably increase the quality of Singaporeans both in terms of working capabilities and also filial piety .
Providing a qualified and affordable education should also be in government consideration on allocating budgets .

Aging Process .
Sept . 16 , 2009 , from {en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Aging_process}
Workfare scheme is also been implemented recently to cater to the aging process , especially for elderly who are less educated that results in low-income level .
It is also known as Workfare Income Suppplement Scheme .
This scheme is specially implement for middle and old age people .
This scheme encourages the elderly to work even though their pay is low .
In addition , it promotes active oldsters lifestyle by involving them in the workforce .
This scheme might solved the gerontological issue; If the oldsters are working , the youngsters would not view them as useless people as they are contributing to the society as well as economically to the country .
Not only do the encouraging , but also plan financially for their old age such as retirement and medical  On the other hand , this scheme is not a great factor in easing the aging process due that the net payout  is low .
Since it is a complement to CPF contribution scheme , there is an obligation to contribute about 71 percent of the total workfare payout to CPF .
Particularly , this scheme is only applicable to those who have worked for 3 months and above .
Additionally , the payout is only carried out once in about 6 months .
Hence , the net payout is relatively helpless due to high living expenses in Singapore .
In conclusion , Singapore government has implement policies and development that are relatively effective in easing the aging process .
However , there are still some areas that required their attention such as the 2 sub-groups , namely older single women , elderly who never save during his young days .
As in terms of all the policies and development mentioned above , especially about the workfare scheme , the government should increase the net payout amount  and reduce the percentage contributing to the CPF .
As for the increasing retirement age , the government should encourage more voluntarily organizations by giving them financial supports to set up oldsters' welfare and workfare to help them look for suitable jobs in accordance to their abilities and capabilities .
For the CPF contribution , the government might set up a regulation that individuals reach a certain age should start working and contribute to their CPF , which might comes handy in future .

Demography Is Not Destiny , Revisited .
Georgetown University: National Academy on Ageing Society .
In many developed countries , aging population is rising and Singapore is no exception .
The first batch of baby boomers  will reach the age of 65 in the year 2012  .
By 2030 , the number of elderly will reach 18 .7% which means for every 5 residents , there will be a senior among them  .
Thus , the government has come out with policies and has invested in research and development to help ease the aging process .
Policies like raising the retirement age and baby bonus scheme are introduced .
Health care system has been improved through research and development to create a better living environment for the elderly .
In conclusion , a fast aging population is a critical issue in Singapore .
It has to be tackled through a holistic approach which needs the involvement of the Government , community agencies and private sectors .
Many policies have been implemented and research and development have been improved in the last several years but more remains are to be done .
With all the efforts put in through the public , government and the people , Singapore will continue to strive and achieve a "Successful Aging Nation" .
In conclusion , the current government policies are confined , ineffectual and incomprehensive .
Since the problems that tag along with an ageing population is imminent , much more should be done by the Singapore Government to wrestle with the toughness associated with the ageing process .
If more effective policies are formulated and implemented , in will indirectly lower the burden imposed on the young population and society as a whole .
Only then , Singapore will be a successful "civilization" .
In 2009 , the median age of Singaporeans is 36 years .
By 2050 , the same figure is expected to increase to 54 years  , as a result of lower birth fertility and higher life expectancies .
The predicament of an aging population plagues not only Singapore , but also different countries , ranging from the richer and developed nations , such as Japan and Italy , to the relatively poorer and developing nations like China  , especially as a result of the one-child policy .
While the issues of an aging population are relevant and dynamic , it must be noted that countries at different stages of development will place emphasis on different developmental goals and adapt policies that caters to the needs of the nation .
This paper , henceforth , aims to discuss the impact of resources allocation in the context of developed nations , countries with stable economic basis and decent standards in the various aspects pertaining to a nation's progress , such as infrastructures and amenities .
Therefore , there is no heavy emphasis on developing the economic , educational and political systems .
Some may point to the fact that providing for the aged drains a nation of its resources and reduces resources for future generations , but the whole idea is fundamentally flawed .
As a fellow human being , compassion for others necessitates to care for them .
As the younger generation , ethics bound to provide for them .
As a country progressing towards a gracious society and thus development , rationality leads towards addressing these aging issues .
With that said , it is important to address the need of an aging population and not be overly concerned with the fiscal costs of an aging population . 
Critics of this position argue that the burden of the fiscal and economic costs associated with an aging population is so large and substantial that it is unsustainable , and therefore , should be limited .
Indeed , the funding allocated to the aging population will place a heavier burden on the shrinking workforce .
Tax increase is likely to significantly increase over the next two decades , affecting a firm's labour costs and indirectly , consumers' income .
Although the fall in productivity labour force is likely to influence economic growth as well , there are other means a firm can employ to stay competitive and sustain or even increase productivity .
These may include researching and developing better methodologies or exploiting greater economic of scales , eventually sustaining the fiscal policies associated with an aging population .
Countries are also raising the retirement age .
For example , Japan expects to raise the retirement age to 65 by 2013 .
This implies that older people are still able to contribute to the workforce .
It also indicates that medical advances has helped people stay healthy , meaning to say that healthcare costs for the aged may not end up being astronomical .
On the contrary , if issues related to the aging population are not dealt with appropriately , the social impact on a nation's development may be hindered .
Every individual should have compassion for a fellow human being to care and provide for the aged .
The amount of public spending should not be an object .
The elderly population is still part of mankind , part of the society and part of the nation .
It is a gracious society to care for who are unable to provide for themselves .
Sights of a forsaken aged population are heart wrenching and affects the manner external parties , for example , trading partners , view the nation .
Furthermore , an established welfare system will reflect the societal values that are attributes of a first class nation .
Hence , in order to ensure that the aged are adequately provided for , that the nation will be able to develop the nation as a gracious society , public spending in these areas must be sufficient .
Furthermore , the younger generation has to fulfil a moral obligation towards the older generation , and capping public spending limits their abilities to do so .
It is important to sufficiently provide for the older generation , for they were the ones who toiled and contributed to shape the progress of the nation today .
Therefore , it is only ethical that their efforts are reciprocated .
One exemplary example is the samsui women .
They were the ones who had toiled in the sun to build infrastructure during Singapore's early developing days .
They are older single women who are uneducated and had been unable to save , whom the government should especially provide help for .
It would be simply inhumane to cast them aside and overlook the fact that they have been vital in the developmental process .
By setting a limit on public spending , many other areas of developments in a nation are not explored .
The aged are a great asset to the nation , in terms of their expertise and experience .
In addition to their past contributions , the aged are likely to be able to continue contributing to the society , by simply passing on their wealth of experience or adding diversity and vibrancy to a nation .
They can also serve as the pillar of a family , binding family units and improving social cohesiveness .
In view of their past and potential contributions in developing the nations , limiting public spending on the aged may actually impede the progress of the nation .
Moreover , inadequate policies will lead to political and social instabilities for moral and ethical issues so , by not setting a limit on public spending on the aged , it indirectly helps to sustain and even improve on the social cohesiveness and development in this aspect .
Limiting public spending will instead create unintended costs , such as unhappiness amongst people .
Otherwise , like Friedland & Summer  mentioned , cutting back on public spending on welfare programmes have an impact on local families and communities .
Based on the above discussed , the aged should be well taken care of .
It is understood that there will be a cost in providing for the aged .
However , to limit the public spending on policies to deal with an aging population effectively translates to inadequacy in catering to an aging population .
Nowadays aging of population has become a global problem , especially in developed country .
In terms of the Population Division of the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs , the number of population over 60 years is expected to triple in 2050 and at the same time , the rate of the elderly in developing countries is predicted to increase from 64 percent to almost 80 percent in 2050  .
To ease the aging process , many countries' public spending rises steadily as a share of GDP , leaving these countries a great financial burden  .
In this case , only focusing on public spending seems not to be the best way to solve the aging problem .
Instead , government should limit the public spending on the aged so that more money can be invested to other areas of the country's development .
Expanding the economy is a more effective strategy to ease the aging process compared to simply giving out public pension to the elderly .
For those countries with aging process , the biggest problem they have to face is the number of labors who can work and create values keeps on shrinking  .
And at the same time , World Bank economists estimated that for developed countries , public pension , which is only one term of the public spending on the aging problem , will increase from 9 percent of GDP in 1990 to 16 percent in 2040  .
Consequently , government may not be able to provide enough pension and health care to help improve the old citizens' life as a result of lack of finance .
In this case , countries should invest more on the economy development or other areas to increase the financial ability so that old people can benefit more from the economic growth .
Despite of the above two reasons , some people still argue that public should help the elderly as much as possible since they have once contributed to the society .
But the problem is limiting on the public spending does not mean cutting off the spending .
This limitation is based on the fact that enough public spending has been put in to guarantee the basic life standard for the elderly , such as age pension and health care .
Under such circumstance , government should make a more effective spending scheme to solve the aging problem rather than without any plan or restriction .
To sum up , it is necessary for government to limit the spending on the elderly so that the economy of the country can be developed more quickly and the effectiveness of the public pensions can be increased .
Limitation does not equal to cutting off but will lead to further development and better solution of the aging problem .
Firstly , spending too much money on the aged will not bring much return profit .
In an aging population , the elderly count for a high percent in the workforce , so increase in the budget for them seems to be rational but in the long term , it will make the aging process more serious .
Most elderly stopped working or will stop working in the next few years , so bumping money into them is just a short-term investment .
Moreover , the elderly usually demand high salary in exchange for their experience but they cannot work as hard as when they was young , whereas the young lack experience and find difficulty in seeking jobs .
According to Gastroenterologic Surgery: Encyclopedia of Surgery , the elderly account for approximately 60% of health care expenditures .
However , with the continuous development of technologies and treatments , the government will not be able to pay in full the health care cost for the aged .
Public spending on the elderly should be limited and individuals should pay for their health care cost within their capacities; so young people will strive to save for their own lives , which will improve the economics and reduce the elderly dependency on the government .
"To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
Do you agree ?
Discuss this statement in relation to your particular field of study or interest  .
"Population aging is likely to become a dominant feature of social change around the world .
This poses a number of serious challenges that range from the social security of the elderly to increasing needs for health care , changing consumer behavior , and possibly changes inproductivity ," says Wolfgang Lutz , leader of the World Population Program of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis  . "
In this modern world where decisions are made based on most available technology and rational choices , the negative impact of aging process has been eased and negated .
Also , there is more focus on the importance of family ties and bonds .
"Strong family ties are the cornerstone of social cohesion .
Strong family ties bind families together and families shape individuals - their character , their instincts , and their values .
Strong families help build a connected community which is integral in nation building ."
Lui T . Y , 2009) .Children are encouraged to take care of their parents when they are old through various publicity and schemes , such as the case in Singapore , whereby people are given housing grants for choosing to stay near their parents and also providing tax relief for individuals taking care of their parents .
It is also by law in Singapore that children have to support their parents if the parents could not support themselves financially .
Such schemes and laws would protect the elderly from mistreatment from their family members .
Family members in return are more inclined to care for the aged themselves .
The elderly would hence feel happier and joyful and not feel left out and demoralized , easing the problems that they face .
However , since this only applies to the elderly with families , the general public and governments will still need to set up voluntary organizations to interact with the aged in homes or community centers .
In conclusion , through the various available health polices , government policies , social policies and technological advancements , the elderly now is able to lead a better more comfortable and more fulfilling life .
Despite the systems and policies being imperfect , it has definitely brought about benefits to both the aged and general public as a whole .
Yet , by further improving current technology and policies , the aging problem might eventually be resolved .
Thirdly , governments from various countries have provided retirement pension , medical scheme and policies to cure the aging population .
Singapore has implemented the retirement pension scheme Central Provident Fund that allow elderly to fund for their retirement right from the start of their working life .
This policy has been effective as the compulsory contribution to the fund will be allocated to both medical account and general account , which does not only ensure financial but also healthcare stability .
Government could also save the budget on state pension at the same time .
In addition , the Housing Development Board of Singapore introduced studio apartments that were catered for the elderly .
The forty square meter apartments include facilities like lifts on every floor , hand railings and alarm systems that were specially designed for elderly .
Government has also promised to build more studio apartments in the upcoming projects .
.
Overall , the governments have done well in helped to ease aging process in a large extent with the above policies .
In conclusion , countries have used various means in ensure a better aging process for the elderly .
This will be further improved as the country is developing on other aspects like technology , education and economy .
However more attention should also be paid as the speed of aging population may exceed the speed of solving curbing aging policies .
In these days , scientific researchers , media reporters and politicians have reached a consensus that the world is ageing .
The argument over public expenditure on the elderly population has been put on the agenda of the congress or parliament meetings very often .
In recent years , not only the developed countries , but also the developing ones such as China are facing the problem of an ageing population .
According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China   , 160 million Chinese people , or 12% of the population , are above 60 .
Furthermore , 109 million people are above 65 , which is 8 .3% of the population .
The public spending on the aged in China is also climbing rapidly .
However , the necessity of these spending should be studied carefully .
As Thomas Jefferson , the 3rd president of the United States , once said , "Never spend your money before you have earned it ."
This quotation is particularly applicable in China's context .
Public expenditure in China should be limited and diverted to other areas due to its negative impacts on the country's economic growth , the living standard of the younger generation and other sectors of the economy .
It will be burdensome to China's next generation , especially the tax payers , if the expenditures on medical and welfare programs are not held in check .
The extra burden of the medical and welfare programs expenses falls on the next generation .
The tax payers have to finance the medical expenses of their own parents and at the same time , pay for other elderly people's medical bills .
The negative impacts will be even worse in China due to its one-child policy since 1970s .
In the near future , a couple has to support four parents .
If the government raises tax to finance the expenses on aged , the younger generation would even face difficulties making a living .
Some sociologists argued that if the expenditure on public health is to be limited , the younger generation has to pay more .
The expenditure just shifts from public expenditure to private expenditure .
While it may sound true , someone in the society have to sacrifice in order to solve the current ageing problem .
If we continue increasing this expenditure and ignore the negative impact it has on the economy , Japan's present will be China's future .
Thus , it is reasonable for the Chinese government to limit the spending on the aged in order to improve the long-term well being of its citizens .
In summary , it is unwise for the government and policy makers to solve the aging problems in China by simply increasing public expenditure on the old .
Long-term effects of these policies must be carefully taken into account and the government should be more concerned about how to sustain the economic growth in the long run .
In conclusion , less of China's wealth should be spent on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Growing old is now easier as compared to the last decade with more developments and policies put in place by the government .
Previously , the aging have been a tough process having to deal with the many problems faced .
However , with the introduction of policies pertaining to three major problems faced by the elderly , namely economic , inadequate living conditions for the elderly and health issues , the changes have become easier to manage .
The elderly should be encouraged to return to the work force and adopt a later retirement age .
By doing so , it can partially relief the society of the increasing financial burden of an aging population .
However , for this initiative to work , they have to first address the issue of their skills obsolescence .
Nowadays , with the rapid change in technology , the current skills sets that the elderly possess are mostly obsolete .
Hence , skills upgrade and training program like those offered by Workforce Development Agency should reach out to more elderly and make it easier for them to upgrade themselves to reduce their barriers to entry into the workforce .
With the elderly returning to the workforce they will be able to accumulate more wealth and save more so that they will be able to be self sufficient when they are older .
Besides , returning to the workforce means that they will continue to contribute taxes , thus helping to reduce the burden on the society .
As they continue to work , they will maintain their Central Provident Fund  account which acts as a social security savings plan for them in the future .
The CPF account prevents the elderly from depleting their savings and allows them to be financially independent even when they finally stop working .
Therefore , it is essential to provide skills upgrades for the elderly and by doing so it will reduce their barriers to entry so that they can continue to work and reduce the impact of aging on the economy .
The government are aware of the challenges faced by the aging population due to inadequate facilities and living conditions and have influenced the change in the environment so as to make life easier for the elderly .
This is evident in the way the new Housing Development Board flats are built , especially the one room flats that are meant for the elderly .
For example , there are customized to contain various elderly friendly features such as the alarm system that automatically request for help through a pull of a lever in case of emergency .
Besides , feature such as the building of lift leading to every storey and the residence corners for the elderly to interact are also implemented .
In addition , to the housing conditions , ease of transport usage have also been give focus and have tremendously improved .
With the public transport system such as buses and trains installed with more seats dedicated to the elderly and customised for the ease of boarding and alighting especially for the wheel chair bounded .
Furthermore , road signs are displayed in 4 major languages to resolve the problem that there are some old folks who are unable to understand other language besides their mother tongue .
Although this much have been done to improve the living conditions of the elderly , the full benefits cannot be reaped if the plans are not widespread enough .
For example , not all apartment flats are equipped with a lift that serves every storey and not all buses are designed for the ease of boarding for the elderly .
Therefore , despite the fact that the changes are indeed useful , there is still a major pitfall here which is if the implementation is not island-wide , the full benefits cannot be realised .
The improving medical care and subsidies are helping the aging population cope with health problems which are inherent in growing old .
According to the Ministry of Health , government subsidies for the elderly are provided based on the assessment of the patient's total family income and can go up to 75% of the total fees .
With this subsidy , the more elderly will be able to afford the medical care as compared to before .
Furthermore , with the constantly improving technology in medical field , many medical procedures have been simplified from surgery that requires hospitalisation to an outpatient procedure .
To quote an example , just 10 years ago , cataract surgery required a hospital stay of several days .
Now , the surgery can sometimes be done in less than 30 minutes on an outpatient basis .
With the improvement , not only the cost of hospitalisation is eliminated , many previously complicated surgeries have also become simplified as a result .
Nevertheless , these measures are only methods which make it more affordable and easier to seek treatment but it does not solve the problem .
The elderly have to be convinced to adopting of a healthy and balanced lifestyle .
Therefore , besides providing subsidies , they have to be more proactive in reaching out to the elderly who are not likely to seek out information on staying healthy .
With the measures such as better economic situation for the elderly by encouraging later retirement , improving the housing and transport conditions and better health care for the elderly have tremendously change the way aging takes place .
While it is inevitable to avoid the aging process , with such measures in place , it will make the growing old much easier than before .
With the overly successful "Stop at Two" campaign to curb the overpopulation in 1960s , Singapore has since faced an ageing population as birth rate dipped tremendously .
Coupled with high-quality healthcare , life expectancy has also increased .
These result in a decline of the proportion of economically productive people .
In 2008 , Singapore is reportedly one of the Asian economies to be worst hit by an ageing population  .
Our long-term economic growth is estimated to cut by 3 percent , while support for the elderly could cost the country more than 7 percent of our gross domestic product  .
With such bleak outlook of our economy , our nation should be spending more wisely .
By making the responsibility of taking care of the elders to everyone in the society , public spending on the elders could and should then be limited .
Firstly , grown children should take care of their elderly parents .
By stressing on filial obligations and their duty to the aged , we can reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency .
However , the higher cost of living today makes such obligations quite impossible .
With high average inflation rate of 5 .83% globally  , it is very difficult for grown children to support both their family and parents .
Even so , it should not be an excuse as it actually does not take much to support the aged financially .
Young adults need to make an effort to save .
Also , especially in Asian societies , such as Singapore , older people are traditionally supported by their own families .
So , the grown children should continue with such tradition .
Nonetheless , in view of this dying tradition , the Maintenance of Parents Act is in place to tackle such issues .
Parents above sixty , who could not support themselves , can approach the tribunal for an order to claim maintenance from their children , delegating responsibility to the children .
Hence , with children supporting their parents , the government could save on the extra national budget .
Secondly , there are policies made to help the aged remain self reliant after retirement such as the mandatory saving scheme known as Central Provident Fund  .
Nonetheless , the policies may not benefit all the aged .
For example , the CPF is not beneficial to the self employed unless they made an effort to deposit money into their CPF account .
Hence , the government has made several , not just one , policies .
For example , the lack of land in Singapore makes housing a valuable asset for Singaporeans .
To ensure all Singaporeans own their homes , the government gives generous subsidies for public housing .
As the nation prospers , these homes will appreciate in value , and Singaporeans may draw on this nest egg when they are old .
With such policies , the aged are ensured that they would have enough assets to remain self reliant and not depend on the government .
Hence , the government is then able to divert spending to the national growth .
Lastly , an ageing population places pressure on the entire nation and everyone should play a part to take care of the aged .
Retirement age is to be pushed back to 65 by 2012 .
The best way to be all right in old age is to have enough savings by working longer  .
Hence , companies can contribute by employing them .
Nonetheless , many elders lack skills .
Yet , they are more expensive to employ .
However , it must not be overlooked that these elders are experienced and could contribute in a different way .
Employers could also offer other kinds of employment , not necessarily to be the same job or pay as of their previous employment .
The government has also several programs to retrain older workers and upgrade their skills , ultimately , increasing their employability .
With jobs , the elders could then be self reliant .
Hence , spending on the aged population could then be limited .
An ageing population is an issue that many developed countries are facing .
While it may seem daunting to the economy , all it takes is a lot of planning ahead and the unity of the entire nation .
As our Prime Minister said , by preparing well and early , the present generation of Singaporeans will be able to enjoy healthy and fulfilling lives into their sunset years , without putting a heavy burden on their children and grandchildren .
The aging population is becoming a problem that many people worry about .
As the population gets older , retired elderly will require healthcare reimbursement , building of elderly friendly infrastructure and domestic helpers .
As a result , this will become very costly to the working generations , and also it will be a hindrance to the economic growth .
To aid in this situation , the elderly should be influenced to be more financially responsible , and public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
The elderly population needs a huge amount of money for healthcare expenses .
Many elderly has deteriorated health with common illnesses like diabetes , eye cataracts , bone and joint problems , and heart problems .
These problems need continuous attention and therefore incur repetitive and expensive expenditures .
There is also a need to build elderly friendly environment like railings , lifts that goes to every floor of the buildings , and slopes .
In addition , there will be a need to have domestic helpers or day-care-centers to take care of the elderly when there is nobody else to look after them .
These can incur huge government expenses which can slow down the economy .
The elderly should be educated about the aging population , because the economy may be severely implicated if they are no longer able to support themselves financially .
Being financially responsible , the elderly should save up as much money as possible while they were young so that they can pay for their daily expenses .
In this manner , the working population will have more funds left over to stimulate economic growth , or even pay for their own retirement .
There will be an adverse impact on the economy if government spending on the aged is not limited .
Due to the need of raising taxes to provide for the elderly , local consumptions of goods may reduce significantly and foreign investors will consider relocating their investments .
If consumption of goods reduces significantly , there will be low credit flow in the economy , which will result in sluggish economic growth .
Also , when foreign investors relocate their investments , jobs will also be relocated to other geographic places , this result in fewer jobs for the population .
Spending to develop the country can generate extra revenue to the country , creating a more affluent society .
This will be beneficial for the elderly and also the working population , as the more affluent society will be able to pay for the healthcare expenses of the elderly .
For the benefit of the whole society , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
As aging population in some aspect has been linked with the negative social impact , thus a social policy plays an important part to reduce the effect which will otherwise cause social disintegration of a country .
One important example would be the issue on Parents Maintenance Act of Singapore , which governs specifically the social relationship between parents and children .
One may argue that the social policy is not needed as it has already been perceived in the society itself .
However , the current economic situation and the decreasing fertility rate have left the young adults , who have no siblings to share costs , with no choice but to give up on their parents .
Furthermore , we should also consider the fact that society is changing over time and so does the social and cultural value of our tradition .
Particularly in Singapore , as a multiracial country , where many different cultures converge , the traditional Asian value of filial piety will continuously fade off .
Thus , the social policy plays an important part to maintain this relationship and also to reiterate the importance of filial piety into the mind of the young adults .
As people get older , they tend to be more dependent on others in their daily activities .
This dependency may hinder the activity of the people around them which may otherwise be productive in other way .
With this in mind , countries start to provide elder friendly architectural design to assist elderly in their daily activities as the aging population increases from time to time .
For instance , in Singapore , more housing and transportation modes are designed to provide elderly friendly design such as: rubber flooring , alarm system and supporting hand rails .
With the implementation of the elderly friendly design , elderly will be able demonstrate some level of independence .
Reduced dependency of the elderly would also result in better allocation of the country's resources , as young adults would be able to concentrate on their career and social organizations would be able to direct their attention to the more needy ones .
In conclusion , aging population problems are likely to continue or even worsen over the coming years .
Including economic , social and architectural aspects , there are many other implementations that can be done to ease the aging issues .
With the success of the implementations , I believe the world can shift the paradigm of the aging phenomenon to a sustainable positive impact .
Yes , I agree that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
In Singapore , the government and society have come out with various policies and strategies to assist the aging population .
For example , there are some organizations that help the elderly in their daily necessities; the government plan in making a more elderly friendly environment and the Active Aging Festival .
One might object here that the government and society have not really done much for them .
For instance , there are still elderly who are living alone with no children caring for them .
This group of elderly usually lives in small apartment with little contact to the outside world and they fall sick easily .
It is also quite inconvenience for them to move about , thus they prefer to stay at home and watch television , rest and not doing anything much .
They just watch as life passes by .
There were even cases of elderly dying at home without anybody knowing it .
Many view that the government is negating the older generation .
There is a lack in government policies and regulation in ensuring that the elderly are well taken care of .
However , it only reflects on the minority .
The government and the public have actually done a lot in helping the elderly in Singapore .
The TOUCH Community Services  , a non-profit organization that provides TOUCH Home Care  to help this group of elderly who are living alone and have mobility difficulties .
Volunteers from THC will visit this group of elderly daily to provide meals and if necessary , services such as escort and transportation to their medical appointment .
TCS also provides the TOUCH Seniors Activity Centre a place for the elderly to be active and have fun when they participate in events and activities .
Through this , the elderly get to mix around with people of their age and keep their mind active .
There are also many other organizations that provide all kinds of assistant to the elderly in their daily life .
Another program by the government is the 'Enable Ageing-in-Place' plan to make places more accessible for the elderly .
This plan focuses on how elderly can travel safer and easier in public area using public transport .
We can see that some buses are now made with platform accessible for people who are on wheelchair; Mass Rapid Transit  stations with lifts and fare gates which allow them to travel just like many other commuters; Older HDB flats being upgraded to lifts that stops at each level and car parking area now comes with wheelchair bounded slots .
These are just examples of the many strategies that the government has come out with to ease the aging process in Singapore .
The government and the public have done so much over the past few years in helping the elderly in their aging process .
Policies and developments are in place to ensure that aging will not become a problem to the society but just a natural process in Singapore .
Aging population is one of the issues that Singapore is facing today .
The Singapore Department of Statistics  mentioned in its Population Trend 2008 report that senior citizens aged 65 years and above make up of 8 .5% of the population and it will continue to rise .
Having an aging population is a challenge and there is a need for public spending to assist the aged throughout their aging process .
However , the amount of public spending on the aged should nonetheless be limited so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Critics of this position point out that it is only right for the government to spend on the aged to recognize their contributions made to the country's economy .
However , doing so and not limiting the public spending on them would have dire consequences on Singapore itself .
Firstly , the national budget will come under pressure .
Having an aging population meant that there will be lesser people in the workforce and this will have an impact on the country's economy size .
And if public spending on the aged is not limited despite the decrease in the size of the workforce , the country's economy will be negatively affected .
Secondly , the public money comes from taxing the workforce .
If public spending is not limited , this meant that the workforce may be further taxed to provide sufficient funds for the aged .
Not only that this would pressurize the workforce , it would also cause them to spend less as they have lesser discretionary income .
This action will ultimately affect the country's economy .
Thus , it is necessary to limit public spending on the aged due to the negative consequences that would arise from doing the otherwise .
One may argue that the high cost of living calls the need for public spending on the aged .
However , measures have been taken by the government beforehand to help the aged ease their aging process .
One measure , linked through the Central Provident Fund  , is the CPF Life .
There may be a portion of the senior citizens who find it difficult to cope with the cost of living after retirement as they no longer have an income to support them .
Thus , in order to meet their needs , the government has came up with the CPF Life designed such that the elders will be able to receive a continuous steady stream of income base on their CPF contributions made during their working life .
Another measure that the government had taken was to include a Medisave account in the CPF Savings .
The money in the Medisave account was formed by a percentage of their income and could be for hospitalization expenses .
As the senior citizens are more prone to health sickness , having this Medisave account would greatly benefit them .
Thus , public spending on the aged could and should be limited as the government had came up with several approaches to help deal with the aging process .
Aging population should not be the only issue that is given most attention to as there are other areas of the country's development that would require the public money .
For instance , the government should spend part of the national budget in trying to increase the fertility rate .
Singstat mentioned that despite the slight increase in fertility rate , the fertility rate is still considered low .
Having a low fertility rate would impact Singapore in the long run .
The government could probably use the national budget to provide incentives to encourage Singaporeans to do their part in increasing the fertility rate .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas of the development that would require the national budget .
In conclusion , though there should be public spending on the aged , it should nevertheless be limited .
This is because of the consequences related to doing the otherwise such as pressurizing the national budget as well as the workforce itself .
In addition , the government had already done his part in preparing its citizens for old through the CPF Life and Medisave Account .
Furthermore , there are other areas of development that would require the national budget .
I agree to a large extent that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The aging process means as time passes , the people will undergo a process of physical , psychological and social change .
In order to help the society and people to cope with the changes , current research and development such as new technological inventions and employment schemes are being put in place .
One argument against the large extent of current research and development/policies that helped to ease the aging process is the availability of jobs for the elderly .
Most of the companies are likely to avoid elderly employment as the elderly are often perceived to have lack of relevant knowledge and expertise for them to work or continue to work in the company .
However , it is not true as the government has implemented several schemes to help in the elderly employment .
For example , in Singapore , the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience  is an enhanced funding support scheme that will help both the companies and individuals to build stronger manpower capabilities and more enhanced skills .
Thus , with the encouragement and funding from the government , the companies will be more motivated to provide enhanced training for the existing employee or relevant training for the elderly to enter the company .
This will help in relieving the aging process .
Clearly , as the aging process continues , the importance of adapting to the changes brought forth by an aging population becomes greater .
With the help of current research and development/policies , the society and the people will be more prepared in adapting to an aging population .
If there are no measures taken to ease the aging process , the probability of the society and the people being overwhelmed by the problems might be greater .

Being one of the fastest aging populations in the Asia region , Singapore faces many challenges in trying to overcome this aging problem .
Ever since the last 30 years , the young population in Singapore has shrunk tremendously .
Accounting for less than 4% of the total population back in the 1960s , elderly aged 65 and above today constitute 7 .3% of the total population based on the Singapore Census of Population 2000 .
This projected a significant growth in the aging population through these years .
To accommodate to this current changing age structure , on-going development of government policies , covering areas like economics , social and architecture , have been carried out aggressively through these years .
However , government initiated policies are not as inefficient after all .
One of the main causes of growing aging population is the low fertility rate in Singapore .
In today's society , many couples choose to have fewer children due to the high living expenses and financial burden .
Due to that , Singapore is facing a serious declining fertility rate that resulted in huge difference between the aged and the young .
To overcome this problem , government policy is implemented to encourage Singaporean couples to have three or more children if family finances permit .
This includes the implementation of financial incentive schemes , such as the Baby Bonus scheme , to parents who are having their second or third child .
Under this scheme , a Children Development Account  will be opened .
For parents having their second child , the government will contribute S$500 per year into the CDA account and up to another S$1000 each year to match the combinations from their parents .
For parents having their third child , the amount contributed will be doubled .
Purpose of this financial scheme is to assist parents in the payment of the development and education of their children .
Through these implemented policies , it will help facilitate the growth of the fertility rate , while at the same time solve the issue of aging process .
To further tackle the rising trend , government also implemented different housing schemes so as to better allow the families to look after their aged parents rather than putting them in old folks' homes or leaving them to look after themselves .
Examples of housing schemes include the Joint Selection scheme , which helps the parents and their children in their application for separate flats but in the same block or housing estate .
Multi-Tier Family Housing scheme is another scheme which allows preferential treatment in flat application , lower-down payment and also maximum loans for those who opt for it .
The applicants can request for flats that are larger in size with enough space for two independent households .
Through this policy , it helps to create responsibility awareness of the younger generation to look after their aged parents .
Furthermore , it also enables the aged to continue living in the environment that they are familiar with .
Supporting services and subsidies are provided to families with aged dependents so as to assist them and at the same time , help the aged to remain physically and socially active .
Catering to the upward trend of the aging population , initiated programs such as free health check for the elderly are implemented to encourage these elderly to constantly conduct full body checkup to ensure that they are in good health condition and also advise them on the dos and don'ts in their everyday life so as to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Besides that , incentives are also catered for the elderly to further motivate them in conducting health checks .
With these , it will help to ensure that the elderly are physically and mentally healthy and thus more productive in their old age .
As we can see , the aging process is not slowing down .
All the policies implemented were to facilitate the process smoothly so as to reduce the impact of aging towards the society .
I could say that these implemented policies do help a lot in easing the aging process .
Perhaps what we can hope for is the constant innovation and improvement so as to serve the aging process better .

Modern science and medicine has brought many benefits to mankind .
Disease like Parkinson disease which is known as an incurable disease is now largely controllable due to research have been done to discover the cause of this disorder .
Of all the neurodegenerative disorders , Parkinson's disease is second to Alzheimer's disease in number of cases , with more than 1 .3 million patients suffering from it in major countries .
The Parkinson's disease usually develops after the age of 65 .
Currently , research and development portfolio of neurology projects of Solvay Pharmaceuticals Asia is progressing well on working with newly invented therapy of SLV308 and SLV318 to improve symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease .
With the acquisition of the Swedish company Neopharma in 2005 , they were also able to enrich their product portfolio with the Parkinson's medication Duodopa .
Duodopa is intended for people suffering from late stage Parkinson's disease , while SLV308 is for the less advanced stages .
Together the products are expected to fit well alongside each other .
If the medications are successfully improved , Parkinson's disease will be highly in control .
Research are also done on other elderly illnesses to find out the most efficient medications .
Compared to before , the research and newly invented medicine have helped to ease certain aging process to certain extent .
Many people claim that government's spending on easing the aging process is a waste .
However , every one of us will get old and we should think twice before giving such an offensive comments .
According to the AsiaOne Business of The New Paper  , CPF retirement plans will be simplified .
The scheme , introduced last year , is a key piece in a comprehensive plan to tackle the problem of an aging population , with people's retirement savings not keeping pace with longer life spans .
For example , some of the CPF members will receive up to $4000 depending on their income level and annual value of their home .
By this , the member will not need to worry about the retirement life later .
The dependency of the elderly on the young can be reduced and government's spending on the elderly can also be minimized in long-run .
Technological inventions should also be taking into account as they are also essential in easing the aging process .
According to Science Daily , computer scientists have designed technologies to help the elderly maintain their independence .
One device uses optical sensors to oversee people as they pick up and use items .
Another device invented uses radio frequency identification technology to track which medications have been take and when .
Besides , a team of researchers from UGR has created a system with Artificial Intelligence techniques which notifies elderly people or people with special needs of the forgetting of the certain everyday tasks .
These technological inventions enable the elderly to live independently and with these helpful inventions , they will no longer be classified as burdens .
Moreover , the inventions of wheelchair controlled by a magnet on the tongue also enable some elderly who are unable to move freely move easily to wherever and whenever they want .
These inventions have indeed help a lot in easing the aging process .
In a nutshell , it is undeniable that in this globalization era , research , development and policies have been doing their parts in easing the aging process .
With these inventions , people nowadays are leading comfortable lifestyle and aging process are no longer tough for both the elderly and the young ones .
Hence , everyone should appreciate these innovative inventions instead of abusing them .

Globally , there is a rising concern on the rapidly aging of population , especially in the developed countries , for example , the U .S . Census Bureau projects the number of elderly Americans will nearly double to 71 million by 2030 .
Many countries are starting to pump in money into research and introducing policies to ease the aging process as it will lead to problems like widening of tax base and healthcare shortage .
While current research and policies have helped to ease the aging process , there are limitations to these policies that make these policies not as effective as a result .
The policies that the government introduced and the current research have indeed helped to buffer the aging process .
The government has introduced effective economic policies to ease the aging process .
These economic policies are important as they will help to promote economic growth for the country .
Without growth , a country will not have the financial ability to be able to provide welfare benefits and to support the needy , usually the elderly .
One of the economic policies introduced is encouraging longer working lives .
For example , the Singapore government extended the CPF Minimum Sum withdrawal age from 62 to 65 , which in turn delayed the age of retirement .
This policy is effective in the sense that it not only increases the size of the working population so that the government will not have to increase the tax base , but also helps the elderly to save up more money for their future need after they retire .
Therefore , this economic policy helps to promote growth for the country and also helps the elderly to prepare for their old age .
Medical research is one crucial element in easing the aging process .
In view of an aging population , the government knew that healthcare is one major sector that they cannot neglect .
As people are having longer life expectancy now and the aging population is going to make up a quarter of the population by year 2030 in country like Singapore , more people will be demanding for better healthcare as they grow older .
This is because as people grow older , most are bound to suffer from age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease .
Thus , the government is investing large amount of money into medical research on age-related diseases and bringing in new medical technology .
These research and technology will be used in finding new cures for certain disease , developing of new treatment and increasing the success rate of surgery .
For example , in the United States , there is federal funding of $1 .4 billion annually in research that is crucial to finding ways to treat and prevent Alzheimer's .
Therefore , these investments on medical research will definitely be very useful in the near future .
However , there are limitations as to how effective the research and policies will be .
The research and technologies brought in are very expensive which makes it available only for the people who can afford it and the poor , who can barely make their ends meet , will not be the beneficiaries .
Some argue that the government has given a reasonable subsidy in healthcare , especially for the poor .
In addition , in the case of Singapore , the people can fully utilise their Medisave funds , which they have saved up from their working lives , to pay for their medical bills .
However , these are really not enough to cover the high medical bills for most people , especially those who suffered from illness that require long- term treatment .
For the low income earners , they may have depleted their Medisave funds after one surgery , and for the subsequent treatment , they will have to either fork out their own savings or , for the most of the time , they will refuse to seek treatment , which thus aggravate their illness .
So , more efforts from the government is needed in this area such that affordable healthcare will be accessible to everyone who needs it .
Aging population is a problem that no country can escape , so what we can do is to reduce this aging process with the help of the research and policies .
However , there are limitations in the policies , thus the government can look into alternative methods so that the people will truly benefit from these research and policies .

In the recent years , the changing demographic of Singapore has cause the government and policymakers to channel more resources and revise public policies for the elderly .
If the government still does not intervene , the working-age population will come under more pressure as the elderly persons are mostly taken care by them .
Furthermore , if it is not properly handled , more issues relating to aging population will arise causing serious consequences to the growth of the country .
To deal with the challenges ahead , the government has implemented a few measures in terms of health care services , retirement policy and provision of housing to help the elderly .
With the help from voluntary welfare organization , there is a range of health care services available to help the older people in the community .
These health care services provided are such as day care centres , senior citizens club and residential care .
However , at times these services are not fully utilized as it lack of publicity and the location may not be accessible to some of the elderly who do not stay near the health care centres .
Therefore , mostly these health care centres are located to the places where a high proportion of older people are staying .
These services are a great support and assistance to the working age people who are taking care of the elderly while they are busy working .
Moreover , Social activities such as games , keep fit exercises and karaoke sessions are organized to engage the elderly in a healthy sociable lifestyle .
With more of these health care services around , the elderly can remain physically and socially active , and it also help to lighten the burden of the working age population .
Currently , Government is encouraging more healthy and able elderly to work longer by lowering barriers of elder employment policy .
It may be objected that having older employees will also mean higher cost in term of healthcare benefits and insurances .
In such case , companies will find them as a huge financial burden slowing the growth of the companies .
But , on the other hand , companies do save up a lot in their training costs as these employees are more experienced , and retaining them will cut down on the recruitment costs .
By working longer , there is more time to ensure that the valuable experience and knowledge are passed on to the younger members of the workforce .
Countries such as Japan and United States are also encouraging more people to work longer by extending the retirement age up to sixty-five .
In addition , with still a good medical condition and good working performance , these people can be a great asset in contributing to the economy .
Hence , encouraging later retirement will benefit the elderly in saving up more for their old age and the economy of the country .
After World War II , we saw a rapid increase in the birth rate across the globe and Singapore too , faces the same problem .
With an increase in the fertility rate accompanied with an increase in the life expectancy of the population , Singapore was soon faced with an overcrowded population .
In order to prevent the situation from deteriorating , the government imposed strict policies in an attempt to reduce the birth rate .
For instance , civil servants are not entitled for paid maternity leave for the third and subsequent child .
In addition , public hospitals charge increasingly higher sum for each additional birth .
This move was proven to be effective as the fertility rate in Singapore dropped from 3 .0 in 1970 to 1 .7 in 1980 .
However , by 1986 , the Singapore government became aware of the low birth rate problem within the country and hence decided to come out with the "Have Three or More , if You Can Afford It" policy .
Monetary incentives are given to both the parent and the third and subsequent child .
Nonetheless , the policy did not work due to the rising cost of living and additional responsibility for each additional child .
With improved medical facilities these days , the life expectancy of the population has increased .
With low birth rate and longer life expectancy , aging population become a long term problem for Singapore .
Knowing the difficulties in encouraging Singaporeans to have more children , the government and related organizations decided to carry out research studies and have implemented policies to ease the aging process in different areas such as the medical field .
In order to combat the shrinking workforce , caused by the rapid ageing population and a declining fertility rate , the Health authorities must first gear up their medical field and prepare for an aging population .
Due to the fact that older patients are more prone to hospital admittances than the other age groups , providing better medical care facilities and services not only helps to reduce the chance of re-admission , it will also facilitate better chances of making a full recovery .
With less frequent visits to the hospital , the amount of money spent on medical bills would decrease .
Hence , the elderly would be able live longer with his retirement funds .
However , to develop the medical sector , huge sum of funds has to be involved which may in turn hamper the development of other sectors .
Moreover , the drugs have to be tested so as to ensure the effectiveness of the medicine and are safe for consumption .
On the other hand , with the rise in aging population , it is inevitable to invest heavily in the medical sector as poor medical facilities will lead to more health problems within the country .
This will then result in an increase in the amount spent on medications , thus adding greater financial burden to the shrinking workforce .
With the constant rise in cost of living , families can no longer rely on a sole breadwinner as they need to support both their parents as well as their children in terms of food , shelter and education .
Hence , it would be a wise decision for both adults to work in order to ease the financial burden of the family .
However , by easing the financial burden of the family , it may result in neglecting their obligations to look after their parents .
Furthermore , if either of their parents contracts a long term disease which requires significant amount of care , both the adults will be in a dilemma whether to look after their parents or carry on with their job so as to ease the financial burden that is added on because of the medical bills .
Either decision requires one party to sacrifice , thus the Singapore government decided to offer more step-down care services which provides basic medical care to the elderly after the patient have been stabilized .
With these services , working adults can still fulfill their filial obligation as children and maintain a manageable financial burden .
In the recent rally speech by the Prime Minister Lee Lee Hsien Loong , he mentioned that "the best way to keep health care costs down is to maintain healthy lifestyles" such as going for regular checkups and exercising regularly .
To ensure that the elderly maintain a healthy lifestyle , the government starts to build elderly fitness corners around the neighborhood .
Occasionally , the neighborhood polyclinics would also provide free medical checkups for the elderly .
Then again , even though it is the health authorities who are responsible in providing a better medical care to the citizens , senior citizens have to also play a part in ensuring their own well being .
It is their responsibility to go for regular checkups and seek proper medical treatment instead of self medicating if one is not feeling well .
This would then allow them to identify the possible illness and seek proper treatment early so as to reduce the chance of it developing into a terminal disease which would then in turn reduce the amount of money spent on treatment .
Hence , even though the government and health authorities offer facilities to ease the aging effect , the people must also take the initiative to utilize them and be more proactive in keeping a healthy lifestyle .
In a nutshell , the medical sector played a significant role in easing the aging process by providing high level of medical care and wellbeing to the senior citizens .
However , the elderly themselves are also responsible for their own wellbeing by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and going for regular checkups .
Thus , if the elderly are able to take advantage of the advanced medical facilities offered to them , it will certainly play a big role in helping the society to ease the aging process .
The first policy development is in medial field .
There is an increased demand for health care services by the aging population .
Having quality health care services at affordable prices is viewed as one of the most important need for the aging population .
The first strategy implemented by Singapore is to have a seamless community-based health care system .
This strategy calls for having private clinics to be within a hundred metres from the homes .
The polyclinics , community hospitals , long term care centres and regional hospitals should be located within two to six kilometres .
The aim is to minimize the number of hospital trips made .
It has already been carried out in the northern and western parts of Singapore .
The second strategy devised is the implementation of mean- testing .
This strategy calls for graduated levels of subsidies that are based on either the patient's income or the house type .
The subsidies can be up to eighty percent of the total bill .
It is supported by reducing the subsidies of financially well-off .
Thus , the two policies have helped to ease the aging process by cushioning the impact on the health care services .
The second policy development is in economic field .
Three main factors have caused the total fiscal cost to be increasing at an increased rate .
Firstly , more subsidized health care treatments are being sought .
Secondly , treatment costs have increased in relation to the tremendous advancements made in medical science technologies .
Thirdly , more financial help are being sought from the government .
The first strategy implemented is the setup of Central Provident Fund  .
The purpose is to provide a compulsory and comprehensive saving plan for Singaporeans .
In response to the changing economic landscape , several major changes have been made .
Some of the changes are the increase of CPF minimum sum and the partial withdrawal of the retirement savings upon reaching retirement age .
The second strategy implemented is the raise of the retirement age to sixty two years old .
The original retirement age was set at fifty five years old .
As people are living longer and healthier , there is an increased need to save up for future expenditures .
Allowing later retirement will allow wealth accumulation .
Another benefit is that valuable working experience can be retained and imparted to the inexperienced .
This will lead to a higher productivity rate .
Thus , these two policies have helped to ease the aging process by cushioning the impact on the economy .
However , critics have pointed out that it is the motivation of individuals , instead of policies , helped to ease the aging process .
Having a quality and affordable health care system will be ineffective if individuals do not take care of themselves .
Without the determination of individuals to work past their prime and increase their wealth accumulation , implementing good economic policies will also be ineffective .
However , the critics failed to point out that even though individuals may be unwilling to save up; the economic policies implemented have actually helped indirectly in wealth accumulation .
Unless the individuals are self-employed , part of their monthly salary will go towards CPF and special interest rates are given for the amount held .
They also have not point out that Singapore has taken basic measures to ensure the general well-being of its citizens .
For example , it is compulsory for newly-born to take BCG vaccination against Tuberculosis .
The integration of the health care service providers through the medical policies will result in higher quality and more affordable health care system .
For economic policies , having CPF and raising the retirement age will allow additional wealth accumulation .
Thus , the development of these policies has helped to ease aging process to a large extent .
Ageing has always been a concern of many as no one can escape the ageing process and it has never been an easy task going through it .
However , with the likes of current medical research and policies , the ageing process has been eased to a large extent as compared to decades ago .
It is norm that ageing are often associated with illnesses such as Parkinson and dementia as a result , it is a concern of many .
Thus , medical breakthrough by University of Nottingham in the research with regards to slowing down and preventing of Parkinson and dementia from has definitely relieved many .
Although , some may argued that breakthrough in the research do not severed the root of the problem as those who are down with the diseases still could not be cured .
However , one must realized that the breakthrough can help the aged to be better prepared or even prevent being contract with the diseases .
Additionally , since there is a breakthrough , the possibility of a cured cannot be rule out as well .
Besides , if more are able to slow down or even prevent themselves from getting the diseases , the aged can lessen their medical cost which will lead to a reduced cost of living .
Therefore , medical research greatly enhances the confident of aged to face the eventual ageing process .
Clearly , the current research and policies have help to ease the ageing process tremendously .
The breakthrough in the medical research field , not only provide a cushion for the aged with regards to old age illnesses but also help to reduce their future medical expenditure .
Similarly , the CPF policy , put into operation by government , lessens the worries of ageing as medical and life expenses aspects are already well planned for .
Finally the HDB grant policy decreases the worries of the aged living with their children .
It is relatively hard to deny how much ageing had been made much easier .
Aging is a continuous , complex , and dynamic process .
Aging process as defined by Wikipedia is the process of physical , psychological , and social change .
Physical change means that one's health will be likely to deteriorate as one aged .
While psychological change in general refers to the change in mental abilities and behaviors .
Social change in general points to the change in attitudes towards life .
The rate of aging differs from person to person .
However , everyone will have to go through it eventually .
Fortunately , advancement in technology , economic policies and social policies implemented by the government has helped to ease this process .
Although elderly individuals can realize tremendous benefits from the advancement in technology , nevertheless , technology brings with it problems too .
Some elderly individuals may feel being left behind by the pace of technological change .
In today's modern world , most information is digitalized .
Elderly individuals , who lack access and training needed to familiarize with modern technology like the internet , may find themselves at a disadvantage .
This is because they will miss out the opportunities to access to the large database of information , goods and services online .
However , efforts have been made to help these elderly individuals .
For example in Singapore , the government has launched the Wireless@SG initiative to provide citizens with free internet access .
Hence , elderly individuals will also have the opportunity to use the internet .
Moreover , the government is also providing subsidies to help these elderly individuals to purchase a computer .
In addition , there will also be concentrated efforts towards educating the elderly individuals to use the internet .
Therefore , they too can also enjoy the ease of getting information , goods and services online just by a click .
The internet also provides a platform for elderly individuals to network and socialize with one another without stepping out of their house .
These provide great convenience especially to elderly individuals who have difficulties moving around .
Apart from that , advancement in technology also brings about the inventions of new gadgets that have significantly improved the lives of the elderly individuals .
For example in Japan , mobile phone manufacturer has come up with mobile phone that has large key pad so that the elderly can use it without straining their eyes .
Similarly , wheelchairs are being made automated , so that elderly individuals , who are too weak to walk , will still be able to move around freely and independently .
Economic policies implemented by the government have also helped to ease the process of aging .
For example in Singapore , the government has implemented the Central Provident Fund  LIFE scheme that will provide lifelong income for the elderly in their retirement .
Under this scheme , they can get around $360 to $440 per month upon reaching the age of 62 .
As a result , elderly individuals can enjoy their retirement without having much financial worries .
Elderly individuals are generally more prone to illnesses as their immune system would have weakened due to aging .
In addition to that , they are more likely to be plagued with old age diseases like Parkinson or dementia .
The government foreseeing that personal medical expenses would rise as one aged , implemented the Medisave scheme to meet their healthcare needs .
Basically , this scheme helps individuals to put aside part of their income into their Medisave account to meet their future personal medical expenses .
Therefore , they do not have to worry for medical expenses when they are old .
Besides that , the government also provides financial assistance to needy elderly individuals who do not have the means to pay their medical expenses .
Social policies are also implemented to ease the process of aging .
For example in Singapore , the government has set up a $10million Golden Opportunities Fund to create more programmes , activities and learning opportunities for the elderly individuals .
This fund will be used to construct more elder-friendly facilities in all sports centre and within housing estates .
Therefore , through this policy , they can pursue the lifestyle of their choice , be it sports , learning , or contributing through volunteering in non-profit organizations .
In conclusion , advancement in technology , economic policies and social policies implemented by the government has helped to ease the process of aging .
Elderly individuals are able to live freely , independently and fruitfully while pursuing their choice of life after retirement . 
Currently 7% of Singapore's population is over the age of 65 , however , by 2030 this will increase to 20%  Thus ageing population is one of the challenges Singapore will face in the near .
There has been much attention placed on this issue and its implications .
Yes it is undeniable that there have been many policies implemented to ease the aging process .
However , the extent in which these policies help to ease the ageing process remains rather small due to the limitations of the policies .
Firstly , the Parents Maintenance Act can now address the recent concern of increasing neglected and unwanted parents .
It may be successful in getting children to pay for their dependent parents maintenance but by enforcing such law , but it is a question between achieving ideal economic situation verse morals .
The act ensures that the child or children support their parents since they will face serious consequences if they do not , but it is a question whether if they did it willingly .
Filial piety was supposed to be one of the virtues held above all else , a respect for parents and ancestors yet now we need a law to be enforce to make sure everyone holds that .
Is this implying morals are being eroded in this society ?
Thus we are forgoing our morals when we are trying to achieve the best economic way to ensure that dependency still lies within the family and not rely it on the government .
Furthermore , Parents Maintenance Act may not be entirely successful in getting the children to pay for their dependent parent maintenance .
This is because the act is only applicable if parents go forward to report against their children and this is applicable only if parents are aware of such an act as well as they bear to do that to their children .
And children can only abide to the obligations if they are financially stable .
Therefore this act is rather ineffective in solving the problems of unwanted old parents , and in the context of social well being , it is unsuccessful .
In conclusion , the two policies have shown the ineffectiveness in easing the problems of ageing population .
Rather than a one policy to cater the whole country , there can be different policies implemented to cater to different income level group .
I agree to a certain extend that the current architectural development in Singapore has help in the aging process .
Aging process causes difficulties in movement , which when link to the architecture aspect will be the accessibility of the building and the public spaces .
The current scheme the Singapore government is using is called the Barrier-Free Accessibility  .
"This BFA Code requires all new buildings , as well as existing ones undergoing major retrofitting works , to meet certain barrier-free requirements ."
From the quote , the key words are 'new' and 'certain' .
New , refers to any building that comes after BFA had been implemented .
Certain , means that it is not 100% .
The statement highlights that the architecture development in Singapore was not to a large extend .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country development ."
I agree to this statement to a large extent .
National budget has always been something that most taxpayers pay much attention to and the planning of annual expenditure is always a big challenge in order to meet the ever changing needs of the country .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted into more important areas of the country development , mainly health , education and defense .
Emphasis should also be place on the education sector as it is crucial to the country's development .
Education is fundamental for the nation as it builds the nation's foundation since young .
It is necessary and cannot be cut down even at the current stage of economic downturn .
Singapore has spent a large amount of budget on education , roughly rounding to about $8701 million in Financial Year 2009 CITATION Hea09 \l 1033   .Some people might advise on educating the elderly as being one important aspect of the nation's development as it promotes lifelong learning .
However , educating the old will spend a considerate amount of money as most of their minds are not as active as the young and they will take a longer time to absorb new knowledge .
The focus at the current stage should be setting a strong foundation on the young and the working class rather than spending money on the elderly .
In this economic downturn , it will be more efficient if we set a strong base through education so that our workforce will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to tackle problems and future challenges in life and work when the economy picks up .
Defence is also a major component that we have to place focus in when we talk about the country's development .
The country's aim is to enhance peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy; when these fail , it will ensure a swift victory over the aggressor .
In Singapore , defense has the highest percentage of the budget allocated in Financial Year 2009 , rounding to about $11 .45 billion , which is about 26 .4% of the national budget CITATION Hea09 \l 1033   .Some people might dispute that the aged is a valuable asset as we can tap into their vast experience when it comes to defense .
However , in this fast paced and ever changing society , the experiences of the aged will get more irrelevant and money will be better used if the public spending on the aged can be diverted into defense to maintain peace so that social and economical aspect of the nation can flourish .
In conclusion , I believe that there is indeed a need for there to be public spending on the aged as the aged are still able to contribute much when it comes to the nation's development , more through their experiences in life .
However , there have to be a limitation on how much we spend on them so that the money can be diverted into areas like health , education and defense which are much more important areas and crucial to the country's development .

Due to the ageing of the baby-boomers and the lower fertility rates in the first-world countries , the unprecedented problem of a fast ageing population has become governments' and policy markers' concern in the developed world .
And Singapore , as one of the developed countries having one of the fastest elderly populations in the world , which had around 235 ,000 elderly population aged 65 year old and above  in 1999 while this figure being going to reach 796 ,000  by the year 2030  , needs to face this serious challenge and ease the negative impact on society .
The final objective of "Successful Ageing for Singapore"  , which has been brought up by Committee on Ageing Issues  established in Dec 2004 and representing from the various sectors in Singapore like the people , private and government , is to ensure that at the individual level , elder Singaporeans should be healthy , active and secure , as well as that all levels of society are well prepared to face an ageing Singapore with challenges and opportunities .
With approaching this goal , current research and development/ policies , to a large extent , have helped to ease the aging process in different fields , like psychology , medicine , etc .
On the other hand , the situation of the fast ageing population in Singapore is still rigorous , even with various research and development/ policies .
However , there is one thing , which should be faced , that although such tend of a fast ageing population is unlikely to be reversed in a short term; much can still be done to buffer its negative impact on society .
In the area of psychology , the effort refers to the individuals' and society's values , perceptions , together with attitudes of ageing and the elder person .
Positive orientations , ones which will encourage society to maximize the great potential and resource that senior citizens stand for , will be adopted .
Furthermore , in order to bring out a brainstorm and change mindsets of elderly , a systematic year-round public education  program  should be conducted , instead of a week-long activity driven by a citizen-led committee , to infuse a culture of personal responsibility and lifelong planning for old age .
Public spending on the aged has been rising rapidly due to the ageing population , because people need more health care as they grow older .
This has been a major concern for the government because such massive yet increasing spending on the aged would mean a high possibility of economic and fiscal crisis for the near future  .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited to a certain extent , not only to avoid the high possibility of economic crisis in the near future , but also to divert the attention to other areas such as education and infrastructure development , which are essential for the economic growth of a country .
However , education also plays a crucial role for the wealth and future development of a country .
For instance , education teaches us the correct attitude and courtesy , thus making us civilized .
In addition , it assists us in the development of our virtues and values , and it also cultivates us into mature individuals , who are able of planning for our futures and taking the correct steps .
When the people are well-educated , the advancement of a country's economy will be promised  .
Education at the secondary and tertiary level will prepare the students to be efficient when they enter the working society , by equipping them with the necessary knowledge and essential skills .
When the efficiency of the workforce is high , it will benefit the economic growth of the country greatly .
Therefore , public spending on education should not be compromised due to the ageing population .
In conclusion , public spending on the elderly should be limited , so as to divert the money into other areas such as education and infrastructure which are essential for the country's economy .
Public spending on the aged can be reduced by increasing the retirement age , or stressing filial obligation .
The government should divert the money into education to equip the people with the right attitude and working skills , so as to ensure a stable economy growth for the country .
Government should spend sufficiently in infrastructure development , because public infrastructure deficit will cause the economy to be less efficient .
On the other hand , public spending in infrastructure development attracts more private investment , hence generates greater income .
If a country neglects other aspects such as education and infrastructure development , but overly focus on public spending on the aged , its economy will suffer drastically .
Another form of way through financial policy is the ElderShield .
It is a new strategy which was implemented by the government in September 2002 .
"It is an affordable severe disability insurance scheme which provides basic financial protection to those who need long term care , especially in old age .
It provides monthly cash out to help pay the out-of-pocket expenses for the care of a severely-disabled person" CITATION Hea09 \l 1033  .
ElderShield is viewing at the lengthening life expectancy of Singaporeans where people tend to live longer compared to past years , and thus one should be able to deposit some savings in the productive years for old age disabilities .
A certain people may think that the government has nothing else better to do to set up this scheme which is not needed and is a waste of money as they already have MediShield in CPF account and assumed that they will never get severe disabilities in the future .
This concept is wrong .
Firstly , "ElderShield and MediShield both provide different types of coverage .
ElderShield will pay you monthly cash payouts if you become severely disabled for any reason , whereas MediShield helps you pay hospitalization expenses , only if you are admitted to a hospital" CITATION FAQ09 \l 1033  .
Looking at this health aspect , we can know that the government is really trying to ease the aging process in the population .
All in all , though in other people's view , the government policies in economic have some flaws , the policies have still done a big part in trying to make the lives of elderly citizens of Singapore easier and more comfortable .
Hence , the government financial policies are still considered as successful means .

"Between now and 2030 , Singapore will witness an unprecedented profound age shift .
The number of residents aged 65 years or older will multiply threefold from current 300 ,000 to 900 ,000 in 2030 .
By then , one out of every five residents will be a senior ."
Thus , an outcry of more spending on the aged is rising in Singapore .
However , government should limit the spending on the aged due to the ageing issues requires help and also largely depended on other areas of the country .
The ageing issues will not be able to be solved in a short period of time .
And the public should not always demand the government to take all the responsibilities .
The ability of the government is limited , and the focus of the government should be placed on the future of the country instead of just one group of people .
Instead , the public itself should take a major role in ageing issues and work together to solve this long term difficulties .
In the context of Singapore , ageing population is a major issue that the nation has to deal with , citing that 315 ,800 of the population is at the age of 65 and above in 2008  , and that figure will only continue to increase , judging from the constant increment in the median age of our population since 1998 till 2008 .
From there , there is clear understanding that public spending on the ageing population is essential .
However , the argument is that there cannot be unlimited public spending directly targeted at the aged because there are other major concerns with the economy and society that the government of Singapore has to deal with .

"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
In my opinion , I do not totally agree with the statement .
An all-rounded country's development is crucial and important but it should not be achieved at the expense of the health care for the elderly in the society .
First and foremost , the elderly remain financially vulnerable in the society and need the public funding for their health care .
Though Peterson in The Graying World  maintains that the elderly could depend less on the public spending by seeking employment or depending more on their family , such a notion at reducing and limiting elder dependency is not feasible .
Being old does not come with the loss of health but there is a social prejudice against the elderly when they seek employment at their age .
In this competitive age , employers will tend to favour the non-elderly over the elderly as the latter is nearly retirement and often associated with old diseases .
In addition , people are having less , if not , no children these days .
In 2008 , Singapore's birth rate was 1 .28 , well below the 2 .1 mark which is needed to meet the future requirements of the Singapore's development .
Such a societal trend reduces the possibility of the elderly tapping on filial obligation for support in the future .
Therefore , such unfavourable factors continue to place the elderly in need of the public support for their health care .
Public support for the health of the aged is for a real cause , for the elderly who have difficulties in affording it .
Hence , the public spending on the healthcare of the aged should be practised flexibly and should not be viewed as a hindrance to the development and progress of a nation .
Public spending on the aged has been the topic of argument in parliaments across the world as it occupies a significant sum of a developed society's annual budget .
It is mainly a question of how much healthcare provision , grants and subsidies , regardless medical or other forms , should be given to help the poor aged to survive .
It interferes with the sum of money allocated to develop the country in other ways .
Should public spending on the aged make way for the country's development on all other areas ?
However , regardless how much the economy is growing , not every people are going to accumulate enough wealth for their old life .
There is a gap between the rich and the poor .
The rich is going to have a wealthy and comfortable life in their post-retirement but the poor is going to struggle with their daily lives- to pay the necessary service bills , medical bills and for food .
Poor elderly who have no children or whose children have deserted them are only going to live on their depleting savings .
If their savings runs out , they would face difficulty acquiring income as their abated bodies limit them in finding a job .
They would end up living on the streets if no help is given to them .
Furthermore , poor elderly cannot afford expensive medical bills , but they should not be disqualified to receive medical treatment as it is needed to sustain their lives .
Hence , help is heavily needed from the government to keep the poor aged to survive .
Grants and subsidies should be given for health check-ups and medical treatments .
Everyday provision of living facilities and food is also needed for those very poor as we should not leave them on the streets .
Hence spending on the aged should not be severely limited .
The aged have work very hard to develop our country in all ways and they deserve a well rest for the rest of their lives .
It's ethically not right to leave them on the streets or not to relieve them from the unaffordable medical fees just because they have turned incapable of contributing to the society , especially those who are not well educated to begin with .
It is also against human rights to leave a helpless person to be tortured by illnesses and die .
Selfishness and cruelly will develop when we decide to leave the aged on their own .
Selfishness undermines unity and cooperation which ultimately leads to failure of a society .
Cruelty leads to insensitivity towards death and violence , which links to crime rates .
Hence , if we focus too much on pushing too much forward our economy and progress and neglect taking care of our aged , we might just lose the ethic and moral values that keep us living in a community and we would eventually fall .
By limiting public spending on the aged , there is most likely to be poor elderly lying on the streets and more old people struggling with medical fees .
It is ethically not right and impractical to lift off public spending on the aged to spend on other areas of development .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
As each year passes , there seems to be an increase on public spending towards the aged .
This seems to be a very popular trend , as a lot of developed countries , such as Spain and the United States of America , tend to increase the public spending on the elderly .
Public spending is very essential to a country's development , and should be divided sensibly .
The spending on the aged should be limited so that the money can be diverted to other sectors of the country's development like public transportation or the army .

"Air Pollution/Transportation ."
Singapore .
1996 .

<w .colby .edu/personal/t/thtieten/air-sing .html> .
Public transportation is one area that could be improved if the country limits its spending on the elderly and raises its spending to the former .
The major problem with public transportation in this country is that it is privately owned and the fares are ridiculously high .
"The privatization of public transport has not delivered the improved service standards nor shorter arrival times , while fares have been increasing based on the justification that being private transport operator , they are not charity and need to make profit for their shareholders ."
.
According to a Singapore census made in 2000 , around 52% of Singaporeans go to work using public transportation .
That is staggering , over half the population uses public transportation , yet the conditions are still poor and fares are high , which seems very unreasonable .
The Government can play a major in creating a solution to this problem .
If they limit the amount being spent on the elderly , they can use their money to better effect through buying back the public transportation , and give reasonable fares to the public who deserve it .
Another thing they can do is improve the conditions of the busses .
Pollution is a growing concern to the environment , "small land area of the central business district led to severe traffic conditions including congestion , reduced traffic speeds , and environmental problems ."
.
Some of the busses used outside the city are fairly old , and unless they are disposed and substituted by less polluting busses , then the environment is in danger .
These are some reasons why limiting public spending on the aged could contribute to the development of the country .
To conclude , it would be very wise of the government to limit its spending on the aging , and to divert the money to other areas of the country's development .
There are a lot of sectors more deserving of the money , and could be beneficiary to both the young and old , like improving the public transportation in the country .

In the recent years , global aging issues are an uprising concern .
The population in many developed countries is aging , and Singapore is no exception .
If fertility rate does not increase , these issues will worsen , as the average age of the population will increase .
If this maintains , by 2030 , the ratio of one out of every five Singaporeans will be aged 65 or above .
The aging population will definitely cause a great impact on the society .
Thus over the years , the new researches , developments and policies in Singapore have definitely helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
And as far as these developments and policies are concern , ageing workforce and the cost for elderly healthcare are the important factors that the government has looked into .
By looking into these factors , the country can greatly decrease the impact of the liabilities these elderly has on the country .
To prevent older generations to be a burden to younger generations , the Singapore government has come up with several policies and acts which allows the elderly to stay in the workforce for a longer period .
One of the acts enforced is the Retirement Act .
Under this act , the minimum retirement age in Singapore is 62 years , thus allowing them to stay longer in the workforce .
This can be beneficial to them in several ways .
Firstly , they can accumulate more wealth through their work , which they can then use to support themselves in their old age .
Secondly , working provides them a good environment to maintain and even build up their physical and mental health .
This is possible through communication with their colleagues , which can help them to stay optimistic .
Thirdly , by working longer , they also help to ease the financial stress of their family members .
Another worry arising is the cost for health matters .
An ageing population with higher life expectancy is also associated with higher numbers of chronic and other medical conditions .
To help families in Singapore cope with the extensive treatment cost , the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  , has come up with services and programmes that provides affordable healthcare and eldercare services .
MCYS have both intermediate and long-term healthcare facilities .
Intermediate healthcare facilities include community hospitals , day rehabilitation centres for the elderly , and long-term healthcare facilities include hospices , home medical , nursing or therapy services and nursing homes .
These facilities mostly cater for families who have financial difficulties .
On the contrary , some Singaporeans have the mind set that these services and programmes are not of utmost importance to them as they each have their own medisave account to pay for their hospitalization bills .
Apart from this , some other Singaporeans might not think that later retirement is a good idea .
For example , companies might think that it is a more of a burden to hire an elderly worker , as they might not be able to cope with the stress and workload five .
There are also worries about the elderly workers' health status .
Therefore , they would rather hire a worker with higher qualifications , who is more competent , and most importantly , younger .
However , little did they know that medisave account might be exhausted after a week .
Associate Professor Paulin Straughan said "One hospitalization , for example , a stroke can set you back at tens of thousands of dollars .
Where are you going to get that money ?"
.
Therefore , without the help and support from welfare organizations such as MCYS , majority of Singaporeans might not be able to handle high cost incurred for taking care of the elderly .
Also , when companies hire a worker , have they ever taken into consideration that experience does play a part in the working society ?
Without the past contributions from these elderly workers , these companies might not be able to stand wherever they are today .
Therefore , it is important that companies try to retain elderly workers , especially when the Singapore government do provide incentives for them when they do so .
Infrastructure is one of the areas that the government can develop on .
More railway lines can be built to allow easy accessibility of people from one location to another .
Expanding the railway line will allow the reducing of time spent on traveling and to be more convenient .
It focuses on the general public as a whole , ranging from the young to the elderly and handicapped rather than mainly on the aged .
However , as constructing is in progress , it often causes high pollution level and is unsightly .
But , the ultimate aim of investing expenditure on such a large scale project was to increase the standard of living of people .
Another instance could be the upgrading of roads to cater to the increasing amount of vehicles , to reduce road congestion .
It also facilitates the driving within Singapore by making it smoother and providing alternatives road which were lesser as compared to the past .
We may also have notice that our buildings are often undergoing maintenance and upgrading as it is part of the government scheme to maintain the condition of the building , minimizing the wear and tear after years and most importantly meant for the public to have a better environment to live in .
The above mentioned could be another area in which the government can divert their expenditure to .
Education is another area that the government should focus on as it aids in the development of the country .
The government can invest on having additional amenities in school such as gymnastics; swimming pool; and indoor sports hall as a form of relaxation , providing a conducive environment for the students .
Besides that , expenditure can be channeled in increasing the subsidies in education to encourage people to take up more studies , removing barrier due to insufficient cash flow .
As people are educated , they were able to contribute to the workforce in the near future .
In conclusion , although money spent on the elderly can ease the problem of aging population , it is only for a short term and is not a feasible solution .
It will only create a reliance on the government .
Therefore , we should take into consideration the effects that we will encounter in the long run .
By investing largely in the aged , other areas of developments for the country will be neglected which will result in more social problems .
Hence , spending on the aged should be restricted to a certain amount so that the resources in terms of financial can be divided equally based on the needs of the various sectors .
There should be a limitation for the public spending on the aged .
Over the years , the expenditure on the aged has relatively increased due to the shift to an aging population .
This is mainly due to the increasing needs of healthcare and welfare services for the elderlies .
Should more public spending be used for catering the implications of the ageing population ?
We need to consider other various sectors that the government is concerned , for the economic and social development of the country .
Providing better healthcare and welfare services has been regarded more important than before due to the ageing population we are facing today .
Policies have been changing according to the needs of the elderlies over time .
As people are having a higher life expectancy today , more spending is expected to provide better healthcare facilities and other services for the aged .
It is observed that in certain countries that faced with aging population problem , there is an significant increase in hospitalization rates as well as physician services over the years .
However , the increased health costs should not be depended solely by the government .
People are more educated and can work longer to better support themselves today .
Furthermore , to stimulate economic growth , the government needs to work out carefully on the national budget for different sectors in the country .
Therefore , we need to consider other government expenditure such as Education , Infrastructure and Research and Development  .
The needs of a country will be constantly changing with regards to the fluctuation of the economy .
Even though public spending on the aged has been increasing due to the shift to an ageing population , there should be a limitation on this spending so as to divert the assets for developing other areas .
The educated aged group today should also be able to support and plan for themselves with regards to their healthcare and social services .
In all , the proportion of public spending on the various sectors should be divided properly in order to promote economic growth and maintain a sustainable development .
As fertility rates remain stagnant , many countries are experiencing aging populations .
Governments have thought of many measures so as to help improve the aging population situation .
They have invested time and money into research on policies that can help solve the aging population crisis .
Moreover , since such a trend is only likely to happen in the short run , much has been done to buffer its negative impact on society .
Therefore , I agree to a large extent , current research development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Demographic changes such as a growing population will have a serious consequence on health issues in developed countries .
National budgets and economies will come under pressure as growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer younger persons .
To deal with such challenges , governments have only two options , one of which is to reduce the future old-age dependency burden by increasing available resources .
This means coming up with policies that can increase the size and productivity of the current and next generation's working-age population .
Alternatively , governments can reduce the amount of money spent on welfare benefits for the elderly .
Firstly , elderly dependency should be reduced by encouraging the elderly to retire later , and by lowering barriers to elder employment .
This can be achieved by increasing the eligibility age for public pensions and government incentives .
As people work longer , the amount of wealth generated would be greater .
If they retired at a younger age , the amount of people left in the work industry would be lesser , resulting in a higher dependency ratio .
By lowering the barriers and making it easier for the elderly to be employed , more elderly people would have jobs and be able to generate income for the country .
For example , the retirement age in Singapore and Britain used to be 60 and 65 respectively .
However , as of today , the retirement age of Singaporeans has been increased to 62 , and that of Britain is expected to be increased to 68 by 2050 .
This would lead to smaller dependency ratios for both countries , thus lightening the burden on the working class .
The size of today's economy and tax base can also be increased by encouraging greater productivity among the non-elderly .
This can be achieved by sourcing foreign talents from other counties to immigrate to Singapore to contribute to our labour force .
The revenue of the country would in turn increase and the government can use it for other investment and research purposes .
Therefore , the government has been granting PRs and citizenships more freely than before , as well as providing incentives such as tax rebates to attract foreign companies to invest in Singapore's economy .
The Foreign Talent Policy would thus result in a larger workforce and ultimately lead to increased revenue for the country .
Secondly , the healthcare of the society is very important .
As the society is facing an aging population problem , the retirement age would increase .
Older people tend to have more health problems and need more medical attention .
They tend to see the doctor more often .
By providing medical benefits and asking them to go for checkups every year , the number of elderly with severe health problems can be reduced .
The government should also spend more money on finding cures for common illnesses that old people are inflicted with .
These measures would ensure that medical problems are treated early and more effectively , thus contributing to a healthier workforce and ultimately , a more productive labour force .
For example , in Singapore , citizens are encouraged to go for medical checkups every year and various medical benefits are provided so as to ensure that our workforce stays healthy and efficient .
However , some may argue that 'Health' is very subjective as everyone's body condition is very different .
It is very hard to predict when your body system will malfunction .
The check up could only allow you to have early detection of your illness .
It does not guarantee the recovery from the illness .
Therefore they argue that more and more money would be spent on researching on new technologies to cure the illness .
However , research has shown that for many diseases like diabetes , kidney failure , heart diseases and so forth , the chances of recovery are much higher if the disease was diagnosed in the early stages .
Therefore , the opponent's argument does not stand .
In conclusion , I feel that no matter how much research is being done , it will not completely solve the aging population crisis .
It only helps to alleviate the problems caused by an ageing population .
The only way to really solve this problem is to increase the birth rate of the country .
Only by providing more children will the cost burden be spread over a larger and more affluent future generation .
Therefore , I conclude that although current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent , but they have not managed to fully solve the problem .
With the decline of fertility rate in recent years , statistics have shown that in Singapore , the number of younger persons age 15-64 to every resident aged 65 and above fell from 10 .4 in 1998 to 7 .5 in 2009 .
This would suggest an imbalance in the population ratio of number of young person to the number of older people .
As a result , Singapore will be facing the dangers of an aging population .
Hence , the public spending on the aged will increase .
At the same time , with the rising economy , the national expenditure would eventually increase .
However , solely focusing on the aged population would not be the best approach .
The government should also focus on other areas that contribute to the development of the country , such as education , technology , military and research and development  .
This is because there is still a need to contribute to the country's economic growth in order to be able to sustain the well-being of its people .
The government can limit its expenditure on the medical fees for the older population and use the money to invest in the education of the younger population and develop the country .
Community centres can organise more activities to encourage the older generation to exercise and stay healthy .
In psychological term , this would not only be able to decrease the percentage of them being sick but also lead them to a healthier and happier life .
However , too much help from government can lead to its people being too dependent on the government .
This would result in arising problems including the lack of motivation to work .
Henceforth , the government can introduce policies to encourage its people to invest for their future during the early stages of their life .
This is to ensure that when they do not have the ability to work anymore , they will still be able to support themselves without much help from the government .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should have a limitation .
This will allow the people to learn to be more independent in supporting themselves when they retire .
This would not only benefit the nation's development but also improve its people well-being .
Furthermore , better education for the younger generation would lead to the spread of cost burden of the nation .
Even though there is a need to support the aged , the efficiency of the country should not be compromised .
Due to the advancement in technologies and the implementation of efficacy policies by the Singapore government , these have helped to alleviate the problems that are accompanied by the aging process to a large extent .
Take for instance , in the past , due the lack of current research and developments available , most elderly who are diagnosed with illness were unlikely to recover and in most cases , they would have to stay in bad for the rest of their lives .
Furthermore , in the past , elderly especially spinsters and bachelors whom they have no family members to turn to in their old age often faced financial problems after they stopped working .
However , unlike the past , most elderly now are coping well with the aging process in terms of physically , economically and mentally .
As indicated in the statistics pertaining to the health status of the senior citizens  , it stated that "among senior citizens aged 55 and above , only 35 .8% reported a clean bill of health ."
As such , it would seem that despite the great advancement in the area of medical technologies , a substantial percentage of the elderly are still suffering from medical ailments such as high blood pressure , bone or joint problems , diabetes and sight problems .
This may suggest that the current medical technologies have not help to ease the aging process .

Although , in today's context , around 66% of the senior citizens aged 55 and above are provided with regular cash contributions from their children , there is still a significant number of senior citizens that faced financial difficulties in their old age , especially if these senior citizens are retired singles .
Hence , in order to aid the elderly through the aging process , the Singapore government has implemented several policies and measures to ensure that there is adequate protection for the elderly .
One good illustration would be the new CPF LIFE scheme  that will be launched in September 2009 .
Under this new scheme , it will offer members with a life-time income whereby the members will receive a sum of money monthly for as long as they live and the amount will depend on the cash savings they have in their Retirement Account .
Furthermore , besides ensuring that the elderly will have sufficient funds for their living expenses after their retirement , the Singapore government has also ensured that the elderly will be able to cope with the hefty and long term medical expenses in their old age through the implementation of policies such as the Eldershield  .
As stated from the source , "ElderShield is an affordable severe disability insurance scheme which provides basic financial protection to those who needs long-term care , especially during old age ."
Thus , the elderly will be able to draw on the monthly payout to aid in paying for his or her long-term care expenses .
Hence , with the implementation of such policies , majority of the financial difficulties that the senior citizens faced in their old age would be alleviated .
The elderly would be able to rely on the monthly payouts from the various schemes to cope with their everyday lives even if they had stopped working .

Introduction to CPF LIFE .
Central Provident Fund .

Singapore population comprises of the citizens and permanent residents .
In between the year 1947 and 1964 , there are approximately 1 million babies were born .
This made up of 30% of the resident population in the constitution .
The batch of these baby-boomers will reach 65 years old by 2012 and form the largest aged population that Singapore has ever experienced .
Therefore , the government of Singapore should not limit public spending on the aged .
Singapore is a developed country where the government had already spent millions toward the country's development .
Having established that public spending on the aged should not be limited , other aspects of government spending , however , should not be neglected just to maximize spending on the aged .
Money could be diverted to tourism and military , for instance , as these may be other crucial areas of a country's development that requires public spending .
Money could be diverted to the tourism industry where it plays a key role in contributing to the country's income .
According to Singapore Tourism Board , Singapore achieved a record of 9 .7 million visitors in 2006 , from 8 .9 million in 2005 , and is hoping to achieve a target of 17 million visitors by 2015 .
In order to achieve the target , Singapore has recently invested a substantial amount of money into the major development of the two integrated resorts in order to remain competitive among Asian countries and other popular tourist attractions .
The Integrated Resort is one of the many strategies that Singapore adopt to generate more economic growth and boost the country's Gross Domestic Product  .
Other than the many areas money could be diverted to , military defense is among one of the important aspects because it serves as a deterrence to protect a country's sovereignty .
Money spent on purchasing weapons and armours is necessary to ensure that the warriors of the nation are well-equipped in an event when war occurs .
In addition , money could also be expended on local or overseas training to ensure that the warriors are trained with relevant knowledge to defend the country .
There are many areas where public spending should be used for a country's development .
In developed countries like Singapore and Japan where ageing population is an issue , the importance of public spending on the aged can outweigh that of other aspects .
On the other hand , developing countries may invest most of their public spending on infrastructure instead of on the aged because economic development is likely to be their primary objective .
It would be unwise to limit healthcare spending on the aged since different countries have different needs .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited due to its significance in view of the ageing population .
Instead , the government should allow its public spending on the aged to hang around a certain percentage .
However , such approaches will only solve the skin of the problem and not the root cause of the situation .
Not only that , it will generate the idea that it is okay to not look after the elderly as the welfare will step in and provide the elderly a place .
This replacement of looking after the elderly will only encourage more infilial children to neglect their elderly parents .
Hence , providing sustainable solutions to the aging problem have to start by tackling the root cause of the problem , that is looking at the children who is supposed to take care of them .
The root cause starts from children who have no wish to take care of their parents .
This can be due to many reasons .
One of which is the lack of financial income .
Japan was known to have many homeless elderly and by analyzing into the country' performance it is known that Japan has the highest expenses among the countries .
Beside cultural aspect , this gave us a slide indication that the people there may have problem handling their finance .
In Singapore , this is especially true to people falling under the sandwich generation who have to pay for the spending of their children and also their parents .
Instead of using taxpayer money on the aged , it can be used to generate more jobs and higher income for the people , resulting in better economic .
In this way , the children will have more financial allowance to take care of the parents .
Educating the society on aging issue helps in long-term basis .
Just like other issue like smoking and yellow ribbon , introducing of aging campaign should be improvised in a country .
This approach not only brings awareness to the country , but also educating on the people on what will happen to the elderly when they are neglected .
The experiencing and understanding of such situation changes the way the society thinks about aging elderly , taking this aging issue on another level of humanity instead of practicality .
Law should also being implemented in a country to help control the negligence of the elderly .
Fine should be made on family that neglects their parents .
The Law should not be made severe , as there are also many issues to why one has to neglect their elders .
Issue like financial problem and time allowance may prevent one to take care of their elder .
The Law should take on another part of being just fining on them , but bringing in welfare that helps family that encounter such problem .
In this way , there is a controlling factor in a country , making sure the welfare of elderly will be taken care of by their family and lessening the amount of homeless elderly .
In a nutshell , public spending should be limited and wisely spent in providing aids to the elderly .
Instead of helping directly to the needs of elderly , the government should tackle the root of the problem , which is the people who are supposed to take care of their elderly parent .
This can be done by improving on the economic issue of their country , educating the importance of taking care of the elderly and implementing laws on negligence issue of elderly .
These approaches may not produce effect soon , but it is sustainable for the future generation .
I strongly agree with the sixth strategy which suggests people to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency .
In my opinion , this is the most useful method to reduce the fiscal and economic cost .
That is also why so many countries are engaging in setting up effective systems to encourage or compel people to save money for later use .
For instance , China has developed a complete system which requires people to turn over some money every year according to the individual income and willingness .
Then when they are old they can receive corresponding care and living expenses .
This policy is implemented smoothly , since both the government and citizens can benefit from it .
It not only lightens the burden of government but also brings security to citizens' later use .
To certain extent , it also can inspire individual enthusiasm for work .
However , some people insist that the government should take the responsibility to look after the old people by increasing the pension and promoting the funding of the programs for the elderly , for they have engaged themselves in the development of their countries and deserve the care and respect .
In my perspective , it may not be practical especially for the developing countries with large population .
It not only cannot solve the problem effectively but also may lead the national budgets and economic to come under great pressure .
All in all encouraging people to set aside some money for themselves is the most wisdom method .
Throughout the years , the issue of aging has become a tremendous challenge for the developed countries .
Due to the increase in the standard of living , better medical treatment is available and this has caused the life expectancy of the people to increase .
People are marrying later in life and this has caused a fall in the fertility rate .
Young people are now faced with the insurmountable task of supporting an ever increasing population of the aged .
As a result , public spending on the aged has been on the increase .
Some may think that it is a waste of the taxpayers' money to fund such a spending as there can be no potential benefits to be reaped .
However is this the correct attitude to hold towards the elderly ?
Should we hold back the aid for the aged who had contributed to the country's success ?
That shouldn't be the case .
This essay will argue that public spending on the aged should not be limited to a large extent .
It will touch on the moral issues inherent and also argue that it is actually detrimental to a country's future if its aged are not well taken care of , even if the money saved by limiting public spending on the elderly is spent developing other areas such as education and research and development .
At first glance , spending on education may seem to be more important than aiding the elderly as what we teach the youths will determine the future of the nation .
An education provides a platform for the youths to face the challenges in the future .
When faced with difficult decisions , the analytical skills learnt in school will help us to determine how to deal with these problems .
Hence , for small country such as Singapore which human resources is the key factor for the success , it is important that the citizen constantly upgrade themselves with the latest knowledge .
Therefore , government should devote more capital to ensure that the education system remain relevant in today's dynamic global economy .
This certainly seems to be more important than pouring money down than on public spending on the elderly .
Some may say that it is more important that a country have an excellent research and development sector than healthy , happy senior citizens .
Research and development plays an important role in the innovation process which results in high quality products , successful businesses .
Research and development will very likely increase the levels of overseas investment as foreign multinational companies will see that country as a good place for business .
Therefore , with a strong research and development sector , a country will be more likely to succeed economically .
Again , public spending on research and development seems definitely to be more important than spending public money on the elderly .
After all , what can a group of healthy , well taken care of senior citizens bring to the country ?
Their knowledge has long become obsolete and there's not much value they can bring to a country anymore .
However , is it really true that the elderly is irrelevant to a country's development ?
This is not the case .
When the government provides sufficient money to look after the elderly , what is developed is the intangible moral value of gratitude and piety .
When a nation looks after their elderly without reservations , the lesson conveyed to its populace is that one should always look after the people who have contributed to our development .
As a result , what we learn then is to be grateful to the people who have aided us .
Such values are the essential element of the society .
It helps create strong lasting bonds between citizens and the result will be a more cohesive nation .
What about education and research and development ?
A strong education system and a strong research and development sector , when situated in a country that is not unified and chaotic will not be able to reap the benefits that they are supposed to generate .
Thus , public spending on the elderly does provide important benefits to the country and should not be limited thus .
In conclusion , we should not see elderly as a burden but an asset .
Even thought other sectors such as education and research and development are important to us , we should not forget ours greatly contributors .
There are the ones who build up a nation from the basic to what we have now .
Therefore , we must be grateful to those who aided us and create a sense of belonging to everyone .
In this way , younger generation will then work harder for the nations in the future .
The baby boom in the 1960s and the current low fertility rate in Singapore has entrench Singapore into one of the fastest aging population in the world .
Living expenditure for the elderly is increased by the rising medical costs and standard of living .
Therefore , it is necessary for the government to review the public policies for the elderly .
Essentially , the expenditure used to finance medical and welfare programs should be proportionate to the larger aging population .
The people are the asset of Singapore and they have contributed to the country's strong economic position .
As the population aged , it is the responsibility of the government to take care of its people .
Spending on the aged should not be limited .
The improvement in medical research has lengthened the life expectancy of the society .
However , the longer life span will inexplicitly incur a larger amount of long term health care expenses for the aged and the deterioration of physical mobility and communication might cause them to lose the ability to work and be self-sustained .
The situation is further worsened for a segment of the elderly in the society who is unmarried and inadequately educated .
They stand at the least advantageous position should there be a limitation in the public spending on the aged because they do not have families to depend on and the depletion in the marginal sum of savings will eventually result in social problems like starvation and homelessness .
Moreover , without the government's support for the elderly , the burden of caring for these elderly will fall solely on the "sandwich generation" , whereby the individuals are to be financially responsible for their family , children and parents .
This is especially straining for individuals who are less financially well off .
In the long run , this financial responsibility may be too much for the working population to bear .
Hence , there is a need for the government to intervene by using part of the public funds to care for this aged population and ease the burden on the working population .
Singapore invested much of our public spending on the other areas of the country's development like defence and economy .
Although these areas of development are necessary for the continual development of Singapore , we should not neglect the importance of public spending for the aged .
By providing more for the elderly and improvising health care polices , the government can actually improve the living conditions of the aged which will reduce possible social issues .
Furthermore , if the government can maintain social stability in its country , government may then focus on other aspects such as defence .
Ultimately , it is the responsibility of the working population and the government to take care of the elderly .
Other than taxation from the working population which is compulsory , it is necessary to garner support from the government to provide social welfare services , day-care centres , social support and improvisation of health systems .
Such coordination between the working population and government will benefit the aged who is concern with the provision of welfare from the state and this will give them a sense of security .
An ageing population is a worldwide pattern that is faced by all countries .
As the population is getting older this has social , political and economical impact on all societies .
Social impact would be that people would have to work harder because the proportion of people who are economically productive is not balance thus the younger generations has to be more productive to cater to the elderly low productivity .
An aging population will have a serious consequence on health issues in developed nations in the view that more medical support will be needed by the elderly .
National budgets and economies will come under pressure as growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer younger persons .
Political wise , policy to help the elderly whereas financially or welfare wise , it will hinder the countries growth in the long run which leads to the economical impact as more tax payers money will be used on public spending on the aged .
However , public spending should be diverted to other areas of the countries development like economy and technology which may help in prolonging and enhancing the quality of life for the elderly .
Investing in technology in the sense of research and development will allow the discovery of new medical advancement as well as better facilities for medical cares .
New drugs or medicine will be available for the sick elderly and more cures for diseases and sickness will be available to help the elderly thus reducing the stress on the working force in the sense that they don't have to worried about their elderly parents .
New technology or medicine to prolonging and enhancing the quality of life will be available for the elderly and this will reduce the stress on the working force of the economy and in return increase in the productivity of the working force as they are more focus at work and they are able to provide and spend more time at work .
This means that there will be a better output of production thus more business and more income for a better economy .
This will allow for better economical growth for the country which in return gives more funding for the government to spend on the elderly as well .
Public spending has constantly been an issue in any nation .
Politicians and law-makers are often debating on how much money should be spent in each sector of the country .
With the rising number of elderly in an aging nation , the amount of money spent in this sector would increase as well .
However , there are other areas that require cash inflow to facilitate and push society forward .
Such areas include the military sector , security sector , education sector , research and development sector etc .
Thus , the government should not spend too much on the elderly and neglect the rest of society .
When one grows old , his body will be going through adjustments and soon , he will not be as fast or agile as he was before .
The government steps in and upgrades the environment more user-friendly which includes , more handrails along steps and stairs , longer gentle slopes around the housing estates , upgrading of lifts to every floor in older flats , having more elder friendly lifts , etc .
Elderly become more vulnerable to illnesses and diseases as they age and it would take a much longer time to recover , unlike their younger days .
Together with rising medical costs and inflation , this would pose as a problem for the aged , even if one had prepared an amount of savings for his golden years .
The government would get involved once again and provide subsidies for the elderly in medical bills and as such .

Clearly , spending for the aged is important .
However , the government should not focus too much on this particular sector and neglect the rest .
Education will have a positive impact on the economy .
Educating the youth , who are our future pillars of support , would equip them with skills so that they can handle potential problems , which in turn could support the elderly population in the future .
Education the older generation would also maintain and even push the economy into better times as they remain competitive and up-to-date with the relevant skills and also support themselves for a much longer period of time .
Security and safety of the people are as important as well .
As shown , preventive measures against terrorism is a cost effective way to counter them instead of dealing with the aftermath .
As a saying goes , it's better to be safe than sorry .

Singapore was ranked third for the highest life expectancy in the world , such that an aging population is evident .
Before taking effective actions , leaders must first realise that any further expansion of retirement benefits would only impoverish future generations and limit future public spending ) .
As such , I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that funds can be diverted to other areas like Ministry of Finance , Education , Health and National Development .
Each area must not be neglected , as they have significant contribution to aid in taking care of the aging population .
Thirdly , for Ministry of Health  in Singapore , funds are needed to ensure that the rising demand of healthcare services for the general public is met .
For example , as mentioned by our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong  , hospitals like Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Jurong General Hospital will be built to meet the rising demand and at the same time providing accessibility .
Funds from the government are also needed to aid the voluntary welfare organizations .
This measure is needed so as to free out the beds in the general hospital , so that more acute cases of patients could be taken care of and the milder cases can recuperate in a community level with their families and familiar surroundings , in turn it is also a cheaper alternative for the patients to cope with the rising healthcare cost .
However , if public spending on the aged is not limited , more financial aid could be given to them , and in turn lessen the burden of the younger generation to provide for the elderly .
At the same time , the aged will feel more valued by the nation when they are being cared for .
Public spending must be cost effective to ensure a steady rate of return from its investments to allow the country to develop and prosper .
Sufficient public funds are needed to develop different area of the country in terms of social , economical , defence and government administration .
To ensure that there are sufficient funds for the country's development , public spending on the age should be limited .
In order for the country to develop , funds are needed for investment in retraining of workers , expanding of economic structure and maintaining a high standard of education in various educational institutions .
Lastly public spending are required to maintain high standard of education in various educational institutions .
A high standard of education is an important factor of maintaining a highly educated workforce in the country .
Investing in education is like investing in the future so the future generations are able to meet future challenges .
In Singapore , the government invests heavily on education through subsidising school fees of schools and post-secondary education institution .
In the Singapore Budget  , the Ministry of Education is investing $7 ,884 million into subsidising school fees .
This is to ensure that school fees are affordable and allowing every citizen to receive a proper education .
In conclusion , public spending on the age should be limited so that funds could be used in developing the country through retraining of workers , expanding of economic structure and maintaining a high standard of education in various educational institutions .
Funds being used for country's development to improve peoples' life wouldn't both the young and the old will benefit from it ?
Over the years , the problem of a rapidly aging population is becoming prominent and an area of concern for many countries .
Consequently , economic growth would be affected and many societal issues would surface .
Moreover , a fast aging population would inevitably increase the amount of government expenditure on healthcare and welfare programmes .
Although governments ought to provide financial assistance for the elderly , spending on other sectors of the country should not be neglected .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited as funds should also cater to other areas of development such as education , training programmes , and even national defence .
Firstly , investment in education is vital in promoting economic growth .
Moreover , it prepares oneself to think independently and logically .
Through education , individuals are armed with the necessary skills and knowledge which would increase their productivity and competitiveness in the labour market .
The process of gaining knowledge is of paramount importance in developing countries as it would reduce the level of poverty and increase their ability to find quality jobs .
In this way , wealth would be generated and the economy would improve as their employability increases .
Nevertheless , it could be argued that the benefit of education in elevating economic growth is still unapparent .
There is no one type of education that is suitable for all societies .
Joshua  also mentioned that it is unclear which type of education would lead to a higher economic growth .
Yet , one cannot deny the fact that a shortfall in educated people would restrict economic expansion .
Thus , it is crucial for countries to invest in the form of education that is desirable for its people to ensure greater economic development .
Secondly , countries should also focus on providing financial aid for trainings and seminars to be conducted for the working population .
Through the process of upgrading , individuals are empowered with the relevant skills and knowledge demanded by the job market .
For instance , the National Trade Union Congress  , of Singapore  has been active in providing trainings for jobholders to upgrade their skills and knowledge .
In this way , they would have the proficiency to deal with any problems that may arise .
Nonetheless , it could be refuted that this might promote job hoping .
With the new skills and knowledge obtained , individuals would hunt for better paying and quality jobs .
Ilana  claimed that people who possessed the essential skills would change occupations due to the lucrative salary offered by different companies .
However , funding of training programmes should still proceed as it would increase the productivity and capability of the working population in handling any challenges there might surface in the future .
Lastly , funding on national security should not be ignored .
A strong military defence helps to deter any possible threats and dangers that may occur .
This is of great importance in today's context where terrorism is becoming prominent .
In recent time , terrorists have accessed to sophisticated technologies that could create greater destruction to the surrounding and to instil fear in the people .
Hence , organisations and agencies related to national defence ought to receive adequate financial assistance for research and development .
In this way , military forces would then be armed with the latest equipment which is crucial to maintain their fighting capabilities .
For example , Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  stated that 13 million dollars are spent on national security yearly even though it places an immense pressure on the federal budget .
Therefore , continuous support on national defence is deemed important to ensure peace and harmony within the society .
In conclusion , nations should be careful in deciding the amount of spending on each area of development .
Expenditure should not be spent solely on the elderly as it would hinder the growth of other areas like education , trainings and national security .
Policy makers should realise and recognise that it is through careful planning and a combination of effective policies that would allow the nations to grow and flourish .
Aging population is a worldwide situation which will affect all countries in the world at different intensities and speed  .
This process is experienced by the developed countries at first but now the developing countries as well and it is especially rapid in this twenty-first century  .
As the proportion of elder persons in the world continues to increase , there is a need for the government to intervene as there will be many elderly who cannot support themselves .
Thus , the government needs to come up with policies to help them .
If this public spending on the elderly is not limited , it might have an impact on the countries in terms of national budgets and economies .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that economic growth can be sustained , societal problems faced by the communities can be solved and other essential policies can be sustained .
By limiting public spending on the aged , some spending can be used to sustain economic growth , which is a key factor to the prosperity of a country .
According to Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer  , "small differences in sustained economic growth will have a dramatic impact on the fiscal future of society ."
With little economic growth , society is limited in its ways to assist those who require assistance .
In contrast , with adequate economic growth , more can be done to help the people in need .
This is because people will have more spare money to help the needy and government will not need to increase taxations .
In addition , once economic growth is stable , there will be prosperity and employment rate will decrease .
The number of people in need of assistance will thus decrease .
Hence , it is crucial for a country to limit public spending on the aged and focus on economic growth so that there can be prosperity .
If public spending on the aged is not limited , the government will not be able to solve problems faced by society .
Many countries face problems such as housing , transportation and education  .
Policies will need to be introduced and thus will increase expenditures of the government .
This will increase the burden of the present and future working generations .
Through cutting down some spending on the aged , the funds can be used in solving problems faced by society and help to relieve the pressure faced by the current working force to support the elderly .
The government should channel its spending to sustain policies which are vital for the country .
It will need to focus on areas such as education and reducing elder dependency of the current elder generation .
With higher education , the future generations of working people tend to have higher incomes and thus can accumulate more wealth for future use when they are old  .
The government can also lower barriers to elder employment and stressing filial obligation  .
However , all these policies might not necessarily produce the desired results .
For example , though the government gives subsidies to companies to urge them to employ older workers , there may not be many who have the necessary skills .
The government will need to spend some money on retraining the elderly to equip them with the necessary skills for the job .
Thus , the government will need to be flexible in altering its policies .
Though there may be uncertainties that positive results will be yielded , it is still important to limit public spending on the aged so that some money can still be diverted to other important areas .
As more countries are facing the problem of an aging population , it is important to limit public spending on the aged so as to sustain economic growth , solve problems of the communities and support necessary policies for the country .
Different countries will need to have different solutions specially tailored to fit their own countries and public spending should be split evenly so that there is a balance in each area .
Presently , existing policies have helped Singapore extensively in providing ease to the foreseen aging crisis .
To achieve successful ageing , the government has implemented various policies to be well prepared in her golden years .
Firstly , in order to cope with the drastic fall in fertility rate , the government has encouraged Singaporeans to marry and procreate , and at the same time attract foreigners into our society .
Additionally , the government has also introduced a Marriage and Parenthood Package which includes bigger baby bonus , longer maternity leave , as well as increased subsidies at childcare centres to boost her population .
Unfortunately , these schemes did not seem to appeal to the vast majority as the birth rate still remains stagnant .
The next most apparent concerned is the need to ensure one's financial security during old age , either through retirement savings or an extension of employment years .
The government has implemented lifelong financial policy like the Central Provident Fund to prepare her people in planning and saving ahead for the ageing crisis .
Despite adopting the Central Provident Fund system , statistics has proven that only one in three Singaporeans are financially prepared .
Certainly , this statistics proved that not the entire nation is ready .
Therefore , it would only be wise if there are appropriate modifications made to the CPF scheme .
In recent years , awareness on the extension of employment years has also been promoted .
The society today has widened their perspective in employing aged workers and hence encouraged them to continue working even when they reached their retirement age .
A latest survey confirmed that most Singaporean companies agreed that retirement of older worker will be a great loss of valuable skills and knowledge .
Therefore , having an ageing workforce might not necessary be negative .
Elderly workers can also provide mentorship for the younger employees , imparting and sharing their valuable knowledge and past working experiences .
In an ageing society , the social aspects not only include the need for appropriate housing schemes but also health care systems for present and future generation of elderly .
An elderly-friendly built environment is a key principle to which an elderly can adjust and integrate themselves into the community .
For instance , accessible infrastructure provides a safe and comfortable environment for the elderly to recuperate their old age .
Indirectly , it also helps to maintain social network and allows them to participate in social activities .
Hence , The Housing Development Board has customised studio apartments equipped with elder-friendly fittings and features .
In addition , the lift upgrading programme was introduced to allow lifts to be provided at every level of high-rise HDB blocks for the convenience of the elderly .
Furthermore , other facelift programs in the older estates include ramps for wheelchair accessibility , fitness corner and covered walkways .
Hence , with these schemes , it is proven that elderly in Singapore are given top priority in the community .
Last but not least , to ensure that basic healthcare is affordable to all Singaporeans , Singapore has prepared her people with MediShield , MediSave and MediFund .
This is done by putting safety nets to ensure that healthcare remains affordable .
Besides , the government has decided to build more hospitals to cope with higher demands in the future .
Hence , with the multi-dimensional approach taken by the government , Singaporeans are able to enjoy quality healthcare services .
In conclusion , the government has done well to prepare the country for ageing population in the aspects of economy , social and population growth .
However , to allow ageing policies to be truly successful for the future generation , it should be reviewed and remodelled when necessary .
The society should also maintain a positive and mature attitude towards ageing population .
Most importantly , individuals should be responsible and self-reliant to take up ownership of the ageing issue .
Public spending has been increasing in many countries over the years .
With the world population ageing , many developed countries are trying to cope with high expenditure on the elderly .
However , there is a need to limit public spending on the elderly for the benefit of the country .
In the long run , investing in other areas would help to ease the problem of high expenditure on the elderly .
These funds needs to be diverted to other areas of development as it would help to improve the economy , benefit the younger generation and increase employment rate .
A nation needs a strong economy to support its expenditure .
A weak economy would have difficulty to divide its funds among the different areas .
Needless to say , the nation would have problem to support the increasing spending on the elderly in a bearish economy .
Hence , a strong economy would allow the nation to set aside more funds for the elderly .
Limiting the public spending on the elderly is only temporary .
This solution will benefit everyone in the long term .
Thus it is important for the nation to divert our public spending to with the aim of improve the economy .
There is another reason why public funding on the elderly should be limited .
A nation need to ensure the workforce is well trained to remain competitive .
Many countries , such as Denmark and Singapore , have started to retrain their workers  .
The workforce is the driving force that improves the economy of a country .
Since the economy affects how much funding a nation can spend on the elderly , it is important to ensure that the workforce receives enough training to improve the economy .
However , people should not rely on its government to provide funds for training .
The responsibility lies on the individual who wants to keep his rice bowl .
These people should spend more money on training to assist their future career .
But there is a need to remember that not all people can fully support themselves for training program .
As a result , the government should still provide basic incentives to aid people to remain competitive in the industry .
The three reasons provided explained why public funds on elderly should be limited and divert to other areas of development .
These areas will affect how much a nation can support its aging population .
Although the elderly are an important asset , but they are not the only asset a nation has .
In conclusion , the nation needs to sacrifice the elderly temporarily for the benefit of everyone .
By diverting the resources to develop on other areas , the elderly will benefit more in the future .
The nation must not be short sighted and seek to solve problems of an ageing population only .
Policymakers should think of how the nation can solve the ageing population in the process of developing plans that will benefit the other areas .
To achieve this , we need to remember this; assisting the elderly is important but building a nation is more important .
There are many areas that may contribute to the economy growth of a country .
If public spending is limited , the pressure on the government will be reduced .
Thus sufficient funds will be directed to areas which may contribute to the economy .
Subsidies can be given to other companies that are affected by the current economy downturn .
Singapore has been lending out its helping hands to many companies to encourage the balance among work and life .
This may result in greater productivity among the workers as they tend to be more committed for their work  .
Government may also spend the amount in development where it can attract foreign talents to the country to solve the problems of manpower shortage .
In order to ensure that there are sufficient funds for these areas of development , the government will have to limit the amount of spending on the aged .
It will tend to create awareness on the serious problems due to the ageing population if public spending is limited .
This is to ensure that the elderly and the working people will not over rely on the government for aids .
In addition , it is the responsibilities of the elderly as well as the working people to plan financially for their future  .
During their contribution to the working world , the aged should be able to plan ahead in advance for their future on the likely cost incurred for health care services .
If public spending is not limited , the aged or the working people may take the aids provided by the government for granted thus they may not work hard during their contribution to the working world .
However , some may think that if the public spending is limited , it will result in pressure on the aged as well as on the working people as they will have to provide for rising health care costs in the future .
Also , the numbers of working people supporting the aged have reduced thus putting strain on them .
In order to solve this problem , the government have implemented certain policies to aids the aged , some of the policies are the introduction of the Central Provident Funds , tax reliefs and the Public Housing scheme .
Central Provident Fund is a saving plan that has provided Singaporean with a sense of security in their old age .
For example , the MediShield are used to better prepare them for the future medical costs  .The implementation of these policies will hence reduce the burden on the aged and thus reduce the public spending required on them .
In conclusion , the government should provide certain subsidies to the aged but to a limit .
If not , the amount of the spending given to the aged will be a bottomless pit .
More policies can be implemented to encourage individual responsibility in taking care of the aged so as to reduce the burden on the government .
Therefore public spending should be limited to a large extent .
Meticulous financial planning is crucial to all country .
Inappropriate management of finance can lead to the downfall of the country .
According to the report  , from 2000 to 2030 , the worldwide population aged more than 65 years is projected to increase from 550 million to 973 million approximately .
Therefore more attentions need to be given to the aged .
Although there seem to be an urgent need to spend more on the aged due to the aging population , other aspects in the country should not be neglected too .
Public spending on the aged should thus be limited so that money can be diverted to areas such as economic , defence , education and infrastructure in order for the country to develop healthily .
The government should divert money to build up its economy as economic stability is an important area which will contribute to the success of the country .
With economic prosperity , citizens will have jobs and are able to support themselves .
One factor which contributes largely to the economy of a country is the tourism industry; this is supported by Rachael Kelly  .
The government will require capital to invest and build more tourist attractions .
This will help to create more jobs , increase revenue of businesses and enhance the economy .
Some may say that maintaining economic stability will result in insufficiency of public funds to help the aged .
As technology advances , new methods of treatment and medicine will be invented .
The healthcare cost of the aged will increase too .
Therefore the government should use more of the public funds to subsidize their medical fees .
Indeed building and maintaining economic stability requires heavy capital , but with economic prosperity , more money will be generated .
According to Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer  , with economic growth , society will have more choices and more policies can be implemented to help the aged .
Thus it is necessary to divert money to boost the economy so as to generate greater benefits for the aged .
Other than the economic aspect , the government should also divert money to build national defence .
A strong military force is necessary as it is important that the country has the ability to protect its citizens in times of war .
Money has to be spent on training the soldiers , purchasing military weapons , and researching on new military technology .
Without strong military force , the country will be easily attacked and destroyed .
Some may comment that spending too much money on defence is unnecessary since war may or may not occur .
Thus , it is a less urgent need compared to the aged .
However it is crucial for a country to stay prepared all the time , so that it will not be too late to react in case of a sudden attack .
Hence , the government should divert a substantial amount of money to build a strong and stable military defence force .
Investments in education and infrastructures are important for the country to develop too .
Education allows the younger generation to be empowered with knowledge and helps to cultivate talents which can lead the country and businesses .
Public funds are needed to build educational institutions and schools .
Infrastructures such as public roads and transport systems need to be established too .
With good and convenient infrastructures , the lifestyle of the citizens will improve .
The country will then be able to develop in all areas .
In conclusion , for the country to develop , it is crucial to ensure all areas are taken care of .
Overlook in one area can lead to serious consequences .
Without economic stability , the country will not have enough funds to run the country smoothly .
A weak military force will cause the country to be easily destroyed .
Without education and good infrastructures , the citizens will not be able to improve and maintain their standard of living .
Even though it is significant and essential to help the aged , public spending on the aged needs to be limited .
Excessive spending on the aged will help them in the short run but will also impede the development of the country .
A better way is to evaluate critically on the level of importance of the different areas and balance the public funds according to priority .
People in the current generation are healthier , wealthier and better educated than past generations .
We can tell by the incline in the economy that has taken off over the past few years .
The houses we stay look more superior to those dilapidated houses in the past .
We speak more fluently than our ancestors .
These are due to higher expectations , which arose from the increase in the standard of living .
In spite of these reasons , can we generalize that everyone is equally well to do ?
The group of baby boomers who are now in their 50s has substantial disparity in education attainment due to loosely enforced education rules then .
Some may not cope well in life and would need more financial help than others .
Nonetheless , when putting this in thought , disagreement will exist if we suit the minority .
Maybe we can help the needy in other policies , apart from the general aging population policy , such that our public spending is cautiously used .
Thus , generally , future groups of aged may be better off and can still depend on themselves if they were to make use of their intellectual assets .
Furthermore , if too much public spending is allocated to help those over-reliant aged , there could be an overall adverse impact on outflows that could be put into better use in other development policies .
Say for example , those stricken with illnesses , whose savings has long been drained or even the young whose future have yet to be determined , but are already ailing .
They would require more help than those aged whose physique is still robust .
It would be more beneficial to invest in the nurturing of future generations than in the aged .
These needy are our country's liability and we ought to render more help to them , who could in the end , contribute back to the society after they have recuperated .
If not , our future pillars or hope will eventually be compromised .
Whilst we spend resources resolving the issue pertaining to the aging population , implications such as the increase in societal costs could arise if welfare programs are curtailed , cut and restricted .
Every day , a considerable sum of our money is spent on miscellaneous fees such as transportation fees , education fees , and utility bills , housing maintenance or even healthcare bills .
If these burdens are lightened , people will have more flexibility in spending power , which could in turn help churn the economy .
Consequently , there should be a threshold of public spending for the aged and the welfare programs should be a better attempt to aid everyone in Singapore equally .
Taking into account the issues of not having enough money to pay for expenses , we should all the more fund areas which can in turn generate more revenue for the country .
Through economic growth , funds can be used collectively and more profits and benefits can be allocated to the aged .
This is a cycle .
The only way to deal with this unique matter is to divert money into more productive areas , rather than assigning in all for the aged which have little or no returns at all .
Pen ultimately , by limiting our public spending on the aged , it will not exacerbate the effects of aging population .
But by putting other areas as a focus for economic growth , we can actually ameliorate the whole picture all together .
Singapore's constant upgrading of facilities such as having lifts that serve every floor of a building and replacing stairs with ramps , have facilitated the movement of the elderly .
However , there should always be a limit on public spending on the aged as funds can be diverted to the development of tourism , housing and education to promote the growth of a country .
Tourism is a major industry in most countries , attracting considerable number of tourists to spend in the country and providing employment to many locals .
The influx of foreign currency and increase in job opportunities will definitely help in promoting the country's economic development .
For instance , according to an annual tourism statistics report done by Singapore Tourism Board in year 2007 , Singapore had received 10 .3 million visitors and noted S$14 .1 billion visitors spending .
Thus , it is crucial for the government to improve existing infrastructures and tourist destinations' to attract more tourists to the country .
Tourism helps in the development of a country but in the event of a recession , it will be one of the first few industries to suffer .
Tourist arrivals will drop as people travel and spend lesser , resulting in a decrease in revenue generated by the tourism sector .
There are bound to be risks in every industry , therefore , the development of the tourism industry should not be compromised as it contributes to the growth of the country significantly .
In addition , housing should also be developed to instill a sense of belonging among the people .
Usually , when one owns a home , people will be more motivated to work so as to have a better home and thoughts of migrating would be lesser .
Furthermore , the provision of housing will also encourage the idea of starting a family .
As a result , in times of trouble , people will be more willing to protect their family , home as well as their country .
Thus , with the development of housing , people will learn to unite as one in times of trouble which is crucial for the progress of a country .
Subsequently , it is important to have a good education system so as to equip the future generations with the right knowledge and train them in becoming the future leaders of the country .
For example , in Singapore , seminars , workshops and camps have been organized by schools to help in the development of the students' leadership qualities such as confidence , good communication skills and decision-making .
Furthermore , when they enter the workforce , they will able to fully utilize these skills and contribute effectively to the economy .
Hence , by preparing and nurturing the leaders of tomorrow from young , they will be able to lead the country to a whole new level .
In conclusion , it is necessary to look at the big picture and pay attention to areas such as tourism , housing and the education system to help in the development of the country .
In other words , there should always be a limitation to the amount of funds spent on the aged as they constantly need support and there will never be sufficient funds .
Limiting public spending on the aged should be done so for the favours of other areas of the country's development .
Besides taking care for the aged , there are several other areas the government should put the same amount of emphasis on when dividing how much each sector should get from the national budget .
This includes the country's economy , transport system and infrastructure , public housing , recreational facilities and more .
Moreover , the government should calculate the benefits over cost for the money invested .
The next area the government should pay more attention on is the current economic and social issues that exist at that time .
For example , in times of an economic recession like now , the government should pump in more money to revive the economy , like the upgrading of lifts throughout the island .
Not only does it bring employment , it boosts business and trade .
These current issues should be dealt promptly .
Without prompt actions , the matter may worsen and if not dealt with properly , the consequence is catastrophic .
Hence , it is important for the government to rank the severity of the issues and deal with them accordingly .
As for the aged , although we cannot neglect them , but we can always provide them with just the right amount so that they will too get what they deserve from the society .
The third argument takes the sentiments of the working class into consideration .
Making the working class pay more taxes to finance the needs of the aged will cause resentment amongst the working class .
Prolonged resentment is unhealthy for the society and it may cause social problems like strikes and protests , to name a few .
Therefore the government have to strike a balance and find the equilibrium whereby the amount of tax is reasonable and enough for comfortable usage .
However , some may argue that public spending on the aged shouldn't be limited .
This is because the aged are the most vulnerable group of people in the society .
Age usually comes with illness and disabilities , like wheelchair bound and the need for healthcare for their illnesses .
They require the highest amount of attention and care .
Limiting spending on the aged will deprive them from the basic aids they require for survival .
Inhumane actions like neglecting the aged will be slammed by the public , especially those with special sympathy for the old .
Since there is a need for other areas of the country's development to receive the money and at the same time not neglecting the aged , a compromise must be reached .
The best solution to compromise both parties would be spending the minimum that provides the aged with the most basic facilities to meet their needs .
It would thus accommodate both parties , ideally reaching equilibrium .
In conclusion , there are so many other issues of the society the government has to consider other than the aging population .
These issues have similar , if not higher importance , as compared to the aged .
The government should always measure the economic and social benefits and costs before implementing any policies , and implement those with the highest benefits .
But the question is: Will the government be firm enough to make the harsh decision ?
As people grow older , our health will gradually deteriorates and we will no longer be able to work and support ourselves after retirement .
Hence , public spending from the government is needed to provide the elderly with a comfortable environment to enjoy their retired lives .
Some examples of government's spending on the aged in Singapore include healthcare benefits like the ElderShield and lift upgrading programme in HDB to provide an environment which is friendlier to the elderly .
We need to recognize that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money could be diverted to other areas of country's development to attain higher efficiency and to have better allocation of resources .
Apart from that , it should be limited to instill the importance of being independent and prevent over-reliance on the government .
Firstly , public spending on the aged should be limited to ensure higher efficiency in government's expenditure and to have better allocation of resources .
This is because it is only entitled to the elderly , excluding the rest of the population who are not eligible .
By limiting government's spending on the aged and diverting them to development on other areas , we are not just targeting on the elder population but the entire population instead .
One example is by transferring the money that we can use solely on the aged to other field of country's development like improvement in infrastructure .
This will benefit the whole population including the aged through providing a more diverse and well-developed system in transport , like the construction of the new circle lines in Singapore .
One may say that development in other areas may exclude some of the elderly from the benefits due to their low levels of education and access .
However , we can always organize campaigns to educate our elder population to direct them to enjoy these benefits , allowing the government to limit their expenditure on the aged .
Secondly , to allow our population to realize the importance of being independent and to prevent over-reliance on the government , we should limit public spending on the aged .
This is to prevent the common misconception that the elderly can rely on the government to support them during old age .
As seen from past experience from other countries , over-dependence on the government would dampen the country's economy , for example , the failure of welfare state in Britain .
In order to help the population to be independent and to save for old age , the government has established the Central Provident Fund  Board .
"CPF is a comprehensive social security savings plans that has provided many working Singaporeans with a sense of security and confidence in their old age ."
.
At this point , one may wonder if the government were to limit public spending on the aged , it will lead to higher burden on the rest of the family , perpetuating more social problems like family violence .
Even with the setting up of the CPF account , it will not help to solve the problem because the amount of income earned by the working population will still remain the same .
Therefore , one way to counter this problem is through diverting the money to other field of country's development like education .
By investing more money in education , we will be able to produce a future generation which is more affluent and productive , ensuring economic stability and thus generating higher income .
Only then we can increase our capability and independence to support the aged and thus it is wise to limit public spending .
In conclusion , we should limit public spending on the aged in order to ensure that we can be more efficient and ensure that there is better allocation of resources by developing areas that can benefit the entire population .
Also , the government can implement more policies to allow the population to be more independent and increase the awareness of preparing for old age .
Most importantly , the government should divide public spending equally according to the different needs of the various areas of country's development .
Public spending on the aged should be limited to maintain the standard of living of the aged and to reach out to those who are in need of financial aid .
Secondly , with lesser money spent on the aged , the government can improve the education system in Singapore for the younger generation .
This category of people requires more attention and funds from the government as compared to the aged , as they are the future ambassadors of Singapore .
The future growth and development of Singapore is depended on them .
At the same time , by better educating the future generations of Singapore , they will be able to secure a better paying job in the future , which they will be able to support themselves as well as their aged parents .
Thus , by improving the education system , the children will be better educated and less dependent on the government for any form of subsidiaries for themselves or their aged parents .
Last but not least , the government can use the money to expand on the research and development of the defence technology .
With better defence technology , the government need not spend money on buying defence weapons from other countries and instead , earn they can earn revenue by selling their own weapons .
By limiting the public spending on the aged and using it on defence technology research , Singapore will be better equipped in safeguarding itself as well as earning additional revenue for the country .
At the same time , an expansion in the research and development of the defence technology will demand more manpower .
As a result , more jobs opportunities will be available for not just the future generations , but as well as the elderly .
Limiting the public spending on the aged opens up other areas for development such as infrastructure , education and defence .
These developments will improve the lives of the current and future generation and in the long run , dependency of the future generations when they are old will be minimal as they will most likely have sufficient money for retirement .
Therefore , public spending for the aged should be limited and focused on developing other areas .
Global aging is a critical topic that the world has been concerned about .
While societies are confronted with the many unprecedented consequences of an aging population , such problems will continue to persist , if not worsen if nothing is done to reduce the impact of aging .
Fortunately , various initiatives and policies have been put in place to alleviate the effects of the aging process .
These programmes and policies are targeted at addressing 3 main aging issues: physical and mental health of elderly , employability of older workers and financial burden on the older and younger generation .
Promoting Healthy Lifestyle
While the government focuses its expenditure on improving healthcare products and treatments , it is also important that elderly maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Leading an active and healthy lifestyle helps to reduce chances of getting aging related health problems such as lower stamina , rheumatism , falling memory , senile dementia , and emotional setbacks .
Currently , various programmes have been implemented by the government to promote healthy lifestyle in older people .
For example in Singapore , the government introduce a 2 years wellness programme that aims to encourage healthy lifestyle by catering the physical , social and emotional needs of seniors through health screenings , social services , exercises , eldercare and social networking sessions  .
By maintaining a socially active lifestyle , elderly are more resistance to health problems as they are able to keep both their mind and body active and healthy .
The 3 R's of Elder Employment
Encouraging elderly to support themselves in their old age by extending their working life helps to reduce elder dependency  .
In support of this , policymakers have put in place various measures and policies to govern the employment practices of older workers .
These measures oversee that employment of older workers should be based on 3 R's of employment namely: Recruitment of workers aged 40 and above , Retention of existing workers aged 55 to 61 and Re-employment of existing workers aged 62 and above  .
The practice of 3 R's can be commonly seen in Singapore where it has recently raised the retirement age from 62 to 65 years old and above .
In complement with its re-employment legislation , the government has also enacted other legislations and initiatives for instance the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers and Advantage !
Scheme .
However , elder discrimination is not a problem that can be resolve instantaneously .
Most companies are still discriminating against employing older workers as they can hire younger workers who are better educated and more productive .
Therefore , the 3R's employment practices would aim to lighten the discrimination by resolving most companies' unwilling rationale  in employing older workers .
Hong Kong has also adopted such practices through its 4 yours CADENZA Community Project which seeks to create an "Elder-Friendly Employment Practice" such as job design , flexible working hours and friendly physical environment  .
This strategy of longer employment seems to be a highly feasible and accepted solution in tackling global aging .
Spread of Financial Burden
Policymakers have also step up efforts in reducing the financial burden of an aging population by providing financial aids and encouraging people to save in advance for their retirement .
Medisave , Medishield and Medifund Sliver are some examples of medical schemes introduced in Singapore to lighten the medical cost burden of its senior citizens .
In addition , the state enforces its main retirement saving scheme , the Central Provident Fund Saving  whereby individuals are oblige to contribute a fix percentage of their monthly salary to their CPF account when they are employed .
In this way , the people are indirectly saving for their old age .
Unity is the Best Strategy
Aging population is a global phenomenon that affects everyone .
With the development of various policies and strategies , leaders must understand that the best strategy is one where everyone unites together in conquering the long term battle of global aging .
They need to recognize that the effectiveness of any strategies will depend on every individual involvement .
Nevertheless , leaders should continue to revise current policies and develop new strategies so as to better prepare and tackle harsher challenges ahead .
It is inevitable that public spending will significantly increase with the aging population .
More money has to be diverted to healthcare , pensions and elderly-friendly infrastructure to cater to the needs of the aged .
For instance , it is projected that between 2005 and 2050 , Portugal will have 9 .7% more of its gross domestic product diverted to old age pensions .
As long as the country is financially capable , it is important to ensure that public spending on the aged is not limited so as to support the growing proportion of the aged in the country .
Secondly , social problems may surface if the elderly do not receive sufficient care and help they need from the government .
In Japan , pensioners constitute one-fifth of the country's population .
More than half of the elderly who committed suicide in 2007 was due to health problems  .This is because this group of people is adversely affected by the government's intention of reducing public spending on the pension and welfare system .
It is assumed that as people get older , they will have more health problems and thus need more money to seek medical help .
However , healthcare expenses in Japan are high and many lonely elderly have nobody to depend on except the government .
Thus , if the government chooses to reduce public spending on them , social issues such as elderly suicide rate may rise .
Lastly , it is a moral right and a civic responsibility for us to take care of the elderly .
They are the ones who worked hard and made sacrifices in their early days to provide us with the comfortable living we have today .
After all our education , can we really call ourselves a civilized nation if we close our eyes to the suffering of the elderly living with us ?
Therefore , government's expenditure on the elderly should be allocated such that it is sufficient to help those elderly who are in need .
However , the government should take care of the country as a whole and not just focus on providing for the elderly .
The government should not neglect the need for funding the other development areas such as education and tourism that can boost the country's economy .
With more resources allocated to the country due to its economic growth , the government can also spend some of these resources on the elderly .
Nevertheless , an efficient and well-organized government should have planned the national budget carefully and have allocated desirable amount of funds into the various aspects of spending areas in the country .
This is especially so for richer countries because they have the financial ability to finance sufficient resources into the different areas of development .
Hence there is no need to restrict public spending on the elderly just to have more resources to be diverted to other areas .
In conclusion , the number of elderly will constitute a significant proportion of the population in the near future in many countries .
There is an urgent need for the government to support these elderly , especially those without dependants , so as to prevent unnecessary negative social impacts on the society .
Furthermore , there is a moral need and obligation to take care of the needs of the elderly .
Therefore , government's expenditure on the elderly should not be restricted just because other areas of development of the country are assumed to be more important .
Instead , the government should strike a balance in the spending amongst the various sectors of the economy .
Singapore , like many countries in the world , is facing the same crisis - a rapid graying population .
The fast ageing population has brought about issues such as increased demand for better healthcare and social services , a reduction in competitiveness of the economy and increases the strain and burden of the working population .
By 2030 , local elderly population is estimated to reach a million  .
In other words , there will be one elderly  found in every five residents .
Hence , our local government will have to constantly review and implement appropriate policies to minimise these problems .
However , encouraging self-dependency and higher birth rate is insufficient to cope with the rising aged population .
Problems in the physical environment still pose a challenge to the senior citizens' mobility , especially those who are wheelchair-bound .
Therefore , creating a barrier-free environment is necessary to cater to the needs of the elderly .
For example , in the past , lifts only serve certain floors .
This has created much inconvenience in their daily activities .
To counter this problem , the Lifts Upgrading Programme  has been carried out in phases to upgrade older HDB blocks with lifts that stop at every floor .
In addition , more studio apartments will also be built to cater to the demands .
But , architects may have a harder time designing buildings now as their products must be of value yet able to beautify and sustain the Earth's natural resources .
Also , due to the advancement in the field of medicine , life expectancy in Singapore has risen too .
With longer life span , larger range of chronic diseases is expected to surface .
This in turn , has generated demand for chronic disease management , geriatric services and other healthcare services .
For instance , Research and Development  has enabled cancer to be more controllable now .
To ensure that healthcare remains affordable for most Singaporeans , especially the lower-income group , the government gives different rates of subsidies to the different classes of wards in hospitals .
For example , Class C wards receive the most in subsidies .
On top of this , the government also strongly encourages her senior citizens to adopt a healthy lifestyle .
For example , regular physical exercises and a well-balanced diet are encouraged .
In conclusion , Singapore government has played a huge part in easing the ageing population .
For instance , increase birth rate to surpass death rate , improve physical environment by creating barrier-free access , and continual effort towards R&D are some of the necessary areas for improvement .
Most importantly , planning for old age is a long-term goal .
One must plan well to enjoy a fulfilling golden age .
Public spending is the expenditure by government which includes health , education , military and development projects .
A fast aging population is a serious matter as this challenges the government to consider whether to reduce old age dependency or limit healthcare costs .
The government should allocate more resources to support other areas of the country's development such as education policy and health care policy .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be used on those areas most in need .
Public policies encourage and facilitate education .
Spending needs are growing in many areas , including social spending .
The spending should focus subsidies on those most in need .
Due to the economic downturn , people are encouraged to spend more money so that this will help to increase the growth of the economy .
The public spending should be used in other areas of the country's development like shopping malls , Integrated Resort , restaurants , hotels , museums , theatres , and theme parks .
The aim is to increase tourism industry and attract foreigners to spend more money .
For example , Integrated Resort projects in Singapore are expected to enlarge the industry .
Deputy Prime Minister S Jayakumar  said that a large amount of money has been invested and the overall proposal that meets tourism objectives and requirements .
The purpose is to attract foreigners and to strengthen Singapore's economic growth .
In conclusion , the government should set boundaries on public spending on the aged so that people will learn how to plan financially for their own old age at the early stage .
Public spending can be also used in other areas of the country's development to boost Singapore's tourism industry .
The aim is to attract more visitors to the country and create benefits to the economy of the country .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to others areas of the country's development
In these recent years , the entire world has been confronted with a severe economic recession; which is believed to not only negatively affects lives of millions of people in both developing and developed countries but also seriously threatens the development of numerous firms and companies from almost every sector of the economy .
The governments are strongly expected to efficiently use money from the national budget to maintain a sufficient economic growth and provide a better living standard to its citizens .
Some economists believe that the government should cut down public spending on the aged to invest in other areas while some completely disagree .
I personally support the latter .
Up until now , the social policies toward the age's rights always draw a great deal of attention from the community because of the vulnerability of this special part of the population .
The period of time after retirement often brings along lots of pressure and tension , which don't come from demanding tasks or heavy workload but come from the inevitable emotional and physical changes and also the financial challenges .
They are not able to earn their livings and probably must be dependent on the supports and helps from their relatives or from the society .
In 2006 , roughly twenty-five percents of the Japanese population was over the working age and approximately eighteen percents was under the working age .
These figures are predicted to increase remarkably by 2050 .
The Chinese population , unfortunately , is also experiencing the same pattern .
Researchers forecast that one third of the population of this nation will retire in 2050 .
It obviously means that the rest fifty-seven percents in the first case or two third of the population in the second case have to work and support for both themselves and those who are unable to work .
It is reasonable to state that once the governments reduce the amount of money spending on healthcare system maintenance or accommodation subsidy , it might result in a social and political crisis .
Some might argue that the elderly should have their own savings , which were accumulated earlier in the working years to partly supports for the own needs .
However , not every worker can do so since the living expenses are increasing rapidly in a year basis .
Therefore , helps and assistances from external sources and funds are still essential .
One more factor that should be taken into account is the moral or ethic aspect .
The elderly used to work and devote their talents and efforts to the development of the country .
Therefore , their dedications and sacrifices should be respected and rather relevantly rewarded by younger generations .
Moreover , policy makers and authorities should set good examples for the young .
A stable society in which all generations live in harmony requires a good moral foundation .
Once traditional values are reflected in the law , the law will be more practical and those traditional values will be more deeply ingrained in the society .
Furthermore , when the younger generation witnesses how their seniors are being whole-heartedly cared , they will have motivation to work harder and contribute to the country .
However , in some cases , the government probably should prioritize other areas of the country's development .
Let's take Zimbabwe as an illustration .
In a country where inflation rate reached an unbelievable figure of 11 .2 million percents , where almost every families have to struggle to put food on the table , where the only desire of the children is to go to school , a well-rounded health care system for the aged seems to be so luxurious .
The government here needs a drastic reform to restructure the entire political and administrative system before policies toward the old people could be brought to the conference table .
In brief , the policies toward the aged in each country seem to be widely different due to their very own and distinctive economic and social statuses .
Nevertheless , base on those different situations , each country should conduct more in-depth researches and take necessary steps with the view to promulgating both short-term and long-term policies to ensure that the senior citizens must get what they deserve .
Impaired mobility is a major health concern for older adults and through Assistive Technology , technological invention has helped ease the movement for the elderly .
For example , the installation of grab bars around the tub and toilet bowl can help to prevent falls and reduce the risk of slipping ; the invention of the elevator and escalator allows the elderly for easy movement from one storey to another in a building and the installing of bedside controls for lights and other appliances , which reduces the trouble of moving around just to switch off certain appliances .
Additionally , therapy technology has been designed to improve mobility in elderly patients to increase their leg strength or balance .
Memory loss is one of the biggest problems for old age and Assistive Technology has proven to aid the elderly in their mental ability .
For example , in America , The Center for Aging Services Technologies   developed e-pill CADEX and 12 Alarm Wristwatch which helps to remind elderly that it is time for their medication .
Nintendo also develop games such as Brain Training Game which are able to help to keep seniors stay mentally agile  Samsung's Jitterbug , a mobile phone that is currently on the market offers the elderly an easier way in making calls , sending text messages and listening to voice mail . 
Furthermore , emotional distress has impacted the elderly significantly .
With Assistive Technology , for example , as stated by Intel Corporation  , poor cognitive ability can result in the increased in {loneliness} which may lead to depression and the use of sensor networks and online tools can help in reducing such symptoms .
Therefore they are researching on a product that uses in-home sensors to detect phone calls and visits that are integrated with online tools  .With this product; it can help to promote social activity .
Additionally , interactive technology such as Wii has enhanced social activity for the elderly , easing the distress they may face due to lack of companionship and social activity .
However , though technology has aid the ageing process through improvements in mobility , socially and mentally , but to the elderly , family and friends are ultimately one of the most important aspects to them  .They can help them with money issues; meet their social needs and provide a home for them .
This would greatly ease their emotional distress as human companionship is most important to them as they age , where they become increasingly lonely and require more attention .
The love and concern provided from the family that can ease the ageing process from the family cannot be replaced by technology .
Hence , technology can be used as a tool to increase functionalities of the ageing adult but not able to provide the emotional support and care .
In conclusion , although human companionship is important to the elderly , the technological inventions created through Assistive Technology have helped to ease the aging process greatly in terms of movement , mental ability and emotional distress .
With these technological inventions , elderly functional capability would increase; health issues may reduce and they can become more independent in their own life .
In today's context , graying population has become an arising problem in many societies .
While it results in a delay to the country's economic progress , the problem also imposes a burden to the children as well .
Thus , this highlights the need for effective policies and research to be implemented and conducted , in order to cushion the negative impacts of aging process .
Three significant solutions would be , improve economy , introduce elderly-friendly infrastructure and appropriate financial subsidies .
Increasing economic growth of the country helps to relieve the strain of resources to meet the demands of the elderly .
Monetary contribution is essential to aid the aging process .
However , this hinders the distribution of resources for the country's development .
To improve the development of the economy , the government can attract more foreign investors .
According to the Foreign Direct Investment in Singapore statistics  , Singapore received a total of 457 ,023 .8 million investments from the world .
It showed that with potential lucrative economic growth , the country is able to amass more resources to cope with the needs of the society .
With the increased revenue , this reduces the limitation of support given to the elderly , without taxing on the government resources .
Therefore , the elderly could benefit from the greater availability of assistances without jeopardising economic progress .
It is known that the world is facing the problem of an ageing population .
David E . Bloom , David Canning and Gunther Fink  have shown with projected statistics that between year 2000 and 2050 , the population of the world for those aged 60 and above will increase in every country .
With this increasing amount of the elderly , there are going to be consequences in areas such as the economical growth , the amount of national budget that we are spending and healthcare issues .
Thus , several policies which have helped to ease the consequences are being put in place .
These policies are successful with easing of the ageing process .
We will now look into some of the policies that help to ease the ageing population .
One of the policies that were being introduced was that of the retirement age .
Under the retirement act  , the Ministry of Manpower , Singapore raised the retirement age for elderly from 60 to 62 .
By doing so , the elderly will be able to work longer and thus , they will be able to save up more money in order to support themselves during their old age .
However , we do have to take note that some of the elderly are unable to work even though the retirement age has been raised .
This is due to the fact that some of them do not possess the necessary skills needed for the job or they could be down with some illness causing them to be unfit for work .
Thus , there is a need for other policies in order to protect this vulnerable group of elderly .
Next , we will look at another policy which the government came up with .
This policy is to give out financial aids to the needy .
In Singapore , these come in the form of the topping of the Medisave account and cheaper housing options .
In the report on the ageing population found on the government website  , it was mentioned that the government should top up the Medisave account of the needy when there is a budget surplus so that the needy elderly will be able to afford medical treatments .
It was also mentioned that HDB should introduce more rental housing options for the elderly , this can be done by exploring the rental of the vacant flats
Public spending on the aged has been increasing in recent years due to the ageing population , which results in lesser spending on the other areas of the country's development .
Demographers predicted that by the end of the century , people who are aged 65 and above will be tripled .
This may pose many challenges to the society especially for developing countries , where poverty is evident .
The small labour force has to carry the burden of supporting the aged in the country and with increasing cost for goods and services , income inequality may be resulted .
In addition , the increasing demand on the country's healthcare system will cause the country to divert many resources for the healthcare industry thus neglecting the other potential areas .
Public spending on the aged should be limited because of the smaller labour force supporting its retirees in a country with an ageing population .
This causes taxes , budgets , living standards and economic growth to be adversely affected .
Unless benefits are cut , taxes to pay for pensions and health care may have to be doubled in the next few decades  .
With ageing countries directing much attention to the aged , for instance , spending large sums of money on hiring healthcare workers and on the latest medical technology , there will be lesser investments made in other areas like military , tourism , education and research and development .
Hence , this will greatly hinder the development of these countries and deter national progression  .
Therefore , the smaller labour force will face with many difficulties in supporting the retirees due to the high cost .
In conclusion , the fact that people now live longer poses many challenges to a country .
The government and the public are contributing a vast amount of resources to support the aged , hindering the overall development of the country .
To lessen the impact of the aged on the country , the aged can learn to keep fit and healthy to reduce healthcare dependency .
In order for a country to grow and prosper , significant contributions are needed to support its funding and hence , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Based on the report of the United States Census Bureau , there are 506 million people hitting 65 years old and above as of mid 2008 .
This figure will be doubled to 1 .3 billion by 2040 , which accounts for 14 percent of the total global population .
Mr Richard Suzman  mentioned that the problem of aging is affecting every part of the world .
Both developed and developing countries are challenged by the difficulties resulting from global aging such as limitation of public spending on the health care of the elderly .
Although there's no doubt that health care of the elderly plays an important role in public spending , it should still be limited so that funds can be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as education .
Cost-containment measures on the health care of the elderly have been practised by many governments all over the world .
Japan is a successful example in controlling the health care cost for the elderly .
The government titles most of the financial incentives to primary care .
It leaves some available services to the family .
Japan has also adopted more efficient ways of financing health care and paying claims using a regulated all payers system which allows payment through a standard system .
Compared with the US , it mainly relies on market competition to provide health care .
There are many insurance companies hiring lots of agents to sell their products and each of the insurance company has its own system .
This will result in high cost of health care services .
Thus , some perspectives can be adopted from Japan , for example how to set limits for hospital services , in order to lower the health care costs .
Public spending should focus on areas that play an important part in country's development like education sector .
According to the Budget Speech  , the government has an budget of S$18 .1 billion expenditure in social development which mainly comprises six Ministries: Ministry of Education  , Ministry of Health  , Ministry of National Development  , Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  , Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources  and Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts  .
A total budget of S$ 8 ,701 million has been planned to be invested in education , accounting for nearly half of the expenditure budgeted for social development .
The government maintains that the expenditure on education sector would never be cut back even in the economic downturn .
The government heavily subsidise the education fees in schools and tertiary institutions every year to prepare students for the future .
In this way , public spending on the elderly should be balanced with other sectors .
In addition , with the limitation on the elderly , people would be encouraged to work harder to accumulate more wealth before they retire .
It would tremendously relief the government's burden as they could support themselves in their old age .
However , some may argue that the government should provide more public spending on health services instead of encouraging the elderly to later retirement .
It may seem true in some way as the elderly have less ability to perform as well as younger work force .
More funds should be invested in health services instead of paying salaries to the working elderly .
However , there are increasing pressures on social benefits including health services fund especially during economic crisis .
The limited fund could only be used in those more deserving areas such as public health services; therefore , the elderly should be encouraged to work harder to reduce the fiscal dependency .
In conclusion , there must be some limitation on the public spending in order to divert the money to other areas contributed in country's development .
The elderly should be encouraged to work harder to support themselves in their old age .
With many countries successfully practising cost-containment measures on health care , a lot of perspectives can be learned to spend the public funding within the limitation .
Besides , considerable efforts should also be made to educate the public to lead a more healthful life .
The problem of an aging population is increasingly affecting more countries .
Especially in the developed countries , due to reasons like better healthcare and women joining the workforce , life expectancy increases significantly as the rate of reproduction decreases .
As the population ages , social problems follow after .
Many governments , in view of this problem , would invest more resources , especially in monetary terms , to seek remedy .
However , this is a bottomless pit .
A better solution would be to limit direct spending on the age and redirect these resources to aid the country's development .
In fact , this can indirectly ease the stress of an aging population through developing the research and development industry and providing skills training for workers .
The research and development industry is important as it brings about new technology , which can help to improve the standard of living of people .
One crucial area is the research and development of healthcare .
By investing money in research and development , more is done to explore new treatment solutions for existing illness thus , allowing healthcare treatments to be more efficient .
This not only in turn improves the economy; it also provides more options for the elders when they have to seek treatment .
New methods of healthcare treatment often bring down the cost of it too .
This would in turn ease the cost of healthcare to elders and indirectly has the same effect as funding elders' healthcare costs directly .
Some may claim that one can never be sure if there will ever be positive returns .
Even if it does , more often than not , it would take years before the end product can be sold to the general public for use .
Although this is a point to note , one must also consider the fact that by directly spending money on the elderly , it would be like driving on a one-way street .
It would be investments without returns .
Furthermore , the issue is to limit spending and not totally cutting it off .
Thus , it would be more effective to spend money on research and development so that not only will the elders benefit in the long run from the research findings; it can also catalyse economic growth .
In conclusion , although spending money on the elderly can help ease the problem effectively in the short run , it is not a feasible solution , as one must consider the effects in the long run .
By endlessly investing in assisting the elderly , areas of country developments will be overlooked , resulting in more serious social problems like unemployment .
Thus , spending on the aged should be limited so that more financial resources can be used to fund other areas of development , which in the long run , can actually help to ease the problem of an aging population .
Singapore is gradually moving into an aging population due to low birth rate and long life expectancy .
According to Mr Lee Hsien Loong , Prime Minister of Singapore , our median age today is 36 and the life expectancy is 80 years .
By 2050 , our median age will be expected to be 54 .
One of the reports estimated that "the demographic change would slice 3 percentage points from long-term economic growth , while possible government support for the elderly could cost the country more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product  ."
.
This shows that an aging population will result in lower productivity and affect our economies .
Bryan  also suggested that healthcare and social cost will also increase as there will be longer life span due to better healthcare quality .
Therefore , to pre-empt the problems of aging population , several policies have been introduced and helped to ease the aging process .
These policies include social security , healthcare and housing .
Secondly , healthcare system has been restructuring to meet the needs of the aging population .
Hasnita  reported that besides building new hospitals around neighbourhood , Singapore also focus on its step-down care sector which includes community hospitals and nursing homes .
PM Lee also added one vital step which is to associate acute hospitals with neighbourhood ones so that patients can seek treatment at the acute hospital and transfer to the neighbourhood hospital for recuperation .
This approach will help to free up beds in the acute hospital for more severe cases to be treated .
Through the reorganization , the new healthcare system will be able to accommodate more people .
Lastly , according to Mr Yap Chin Beng , Director , Estate Administration and Property , they have worked closely with Housing Development Board  to initiate policies such as constant upgrading to our physical infrastructures to become more elderly-friendly .
The upgrades include lift upgrading to install new lifts which stops on every floor , shelters to connect to the nearest bus stop of the blocks and ramps for people who have difficulties in climbing stairs .
These upgrading projects have helped to create convenience for the elderly , especially for those who are disabled .
In addition , HDB is also building more studio apartments which are suitable for elderly as it is customized with elderly-friendly fixtures and fittings .
These two approaches have helped to make an elder-friendly physical environment .
Clearly , current policies such as social security , healthcare and housing have helped to ease the aging process .
Without these policies , the elderly will be facing problems in terms of monetary , healthcare and housing in future .
Therefore , it is important to help the older population remain employed and promote active aging .
Nowadays , many countries have to face different problems about aging population .
The popular one is about public spending for the elderly in each country .
It is controversial since many people are afraid that spending too much money on the elderly might decrease national budgets for other areas' development .
Therefore , it is necessary that the public finances spent on the elderly be always considered carefully by the government .
A limited amount of money given to help the aging population is a good issue for both the elderly and the rest of population which is benefited through the development of different sectors of the country .
The next point this essay discuss is about the consequence of having no limitation on spending money for the elderly .
A research done by Swiss banking giant UBS reported that Singapore's long-term economic growth would lose its 3 percentage points because of the demographic change while Japan's growth will drop from 9 .8 to 8 .3 percent and China's growth may cut down of 1 percent .
The aging population really affects the country's economy .
Without the guarantee of healthy economy , the government cannot improve or develop any necessary areas in their country .
Thus , we must ensure that the money we use for the elderly is reasonable; otherwise , we will lose a lot and end up with preventing our development growth .
In my opinion , the limitation for public spending on the aged is a good issue for the entire population .
We actually have many kinds of help for the senior citizens instead of giving them money from the public budgets .
For example , the financial problem can be solved by encouraging the elderly to work longer .
They can earn money by themselves .
Then , we are able to spend our money to develop other areas in our country .
Furthermore , the elderly now have a long-term provision for their own lives by their income and contribute their ability to the society .
The thing we should do is just give them a chance and help them in upgrading their skills to adapt to the modern work place .
For instance , in Singapore , the Tripartite Action Group  was formed to help the elderly increase their employability .
In conclusion , it is essential for us to set a limitation for the money we spend on the old aged .
This limitation will help us give the right supporting finance to the elderly as well as to other areas' development in our country .
Moreover , with the limited money spent to support the senior citizens' lives , it might give the government a motivation to come up with new solutions for the aging population .
The focus on ageing issues is not new .
Since the 1980s , various committees have been formed to make sure that Singapore is prepared for the challenges and opportunities from the ageing population and at the same time harnessing her economic and social possibilities .
The government has placed necessary policies and developments to empower Singaporeans to lead meaningful lives in their golden years , to ease their process of ageing .
The growing pool of seniors would require varied expectations and needs .
For Singapore to be ready for its expanding ageing population , developments and policies have been enforced over the years to enable seniors to lead a fulfilling and enriching lives .

Meanwhile , in an article published on the 17th of August 2009 , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called for more community hospitals , nursing homes and home care to be built , to provide competent and appropriate care for the elderly .
The Government has also implemented various measures over the years to make homes more elder-friendly and to provide more housing choices for seniors .
Efforts were made by the Housing Development Board  through the development of retirement housings with non-slip tiles , support hand bars , emergency pull-cords and heat detectors that activate alarms .
Town Councils also came up with barrier-free features like ramps leading to blocks and outdoor facilities are provided to facilitate mobility of senior from homes to public areas .
The Land Transport Authority  featured elder-friendly buses allowing seniors to move around Singapore easily with low-floor , step-free and wheelchair accessibility .
Road facilities have also been upgraded to enhance accessibility on public streets .
Such costly infrastructures and developments are fully funded by the government .
Despite many who would argue that such public spending could be better spent on other areas of the country's development , it is important to understand that they are beneficial to the general public .
Elder-friendly bus networks benefit not just seniors but also young parents with children in prams and those with physical disabilities .
Residences fitted with senior-friendly features not only enhance the ease of mobility but also the quality of life for the public .
Even though the development of retirement housing is costly , it reaps profit for private developers and benefits the economy as the greying population fuel the market with their special needs and demands .
A greying world is inevitable and it is essential to provide necessary care and support for the elderly .
Health subsidies and housing developments by the government have helped to ease the ageing process to a large extent .
Healthcare subsidies provide proper care for the needy elderly patients .
In addition , retirement housings promote the social integration of our seniors , by not segregating them from the community at large and allowing them to age in a safe and comfortable environment .
The policy of later retirement not only solves the problem of elderly dependency immediately , it also eases the ageing process in Singapore as the elderly no longer face financial constraints once they earn an income every month .

As one of the most rapid aging population in Asia , Singapore encounters the challenge of developing policies to accommodate this evolving age structure .
Now , people are living longer and longer lives must be carefully planned for .
It is a necessity to raise awareness concerning the issue of aging population .
Welcoming immigrants and increasing fertility rates are some of the issues that should become national priority and these subjects will be discussed in relation to the Singapore context .
Although the relieving of the aging process is unlikely to take effect immediately after the implementation of the policies , much can still be done to ease the impact of an aging population .
Firstly , the aging process should be eased by allowing more working-age immigrants .
Minister Mentor , Lee Kuan Yew  mentions that there are complains about the welcoming of working-age immigrants resulting in a reduction of job vacancies available for Singaporeans .
Immigrants who possessed the skills and expertise in the various industries were more favorable by employers .
This is because they could contribute their knowledge and bring the companies to greater heights .
Hence , this caused Singaporeans who were not as proficient to become unemployed .
The introducing of working-age immigrants also increased the competition in the workforce .
Eventually , social issues like a surge in suicidal cases and psychological problems will surface .
Furthermore , immigrants who set up businesses or companies in Singapore would create more job vacancies .
They could share their knowledge and technology with Singapore and Singapore could in return , provide them the necessary infrastructure and manpower .
This will certainly be a win-win situation where both Singaporeans and immigrants will benefit .
In addition , competition in the labor force might stimulate people to be more eager and determined to improve themselves .
They will be shocked by the competitiveness and drive themselves to perform better .
This will bring about a progress in the overall standard of the country and the economy .
In the last 10 years , governments all over the world , especially those in developed countries such as Japan , United Kingdom , Singapore , etc , invested heavily in research and development and formulating new policies to tackle the prevailing ageing phenomenon which is threatening their economies .
However , some policies introduced by the government are causing much problem for the society which outweighs the effect of easing the ageing process .
In this paper , two strategies , one of which encourages older retirement and the other leads to the increase in foreign immigration , introduced by the local government to tackle the ageing population issue shall be discussed .
In 2007 , the government introduced a CPF  reform scheme , which will push retirement age to 65 years old in 2012 which will then par with Japan .
This , coupled with other initiatives such as the workfare to older workers and incentives for companies to hire elderly workers , serves to encourage longer working lives and decrease dependency among elderly workers .
However , according to the Singapore National Census in 2007 , 68% of the elder workers are unskilled and most of them are employed as cleaners or laborers , working long hours per day for mostly as little as $5 an hour  .
However , many might argue that through employment , older workers will be able to earn their upkeep , save up for future medical needs and live an active and healthy lifestyle  .
But on the contrary , it has been statistically proven that older workers tend to suffer from occupational injuries that were inflicted and accumulated since younger working days , thus accidents are more prone to occur , especially for jobs which require substantial amount of physical strength such as lifting or carrying  .
Besides , elderly workers can get abused just as much as younger workers , by considering the fact that if elder workers were to be dismissed for some reasons , finding another employment with equal remunerations and similar job tasks might not be easy .
In additional , if they were to be subjected to demands of work performance and long work hours in most jobs , how could they ever live a healthier lifestyle ?
On the contrary , older workers could develop more medical problems as they continue to work and grow older .
Therefore , it can be said that governments who support older retirement age could have committed the fallacy of equating both wealth and health together when it is the other way around .
Singapore has been adopting an "open-door" policy which favors foreign immigration as part of the strategy to overcome ageing population .
With a healthy supply of young workers from other countries , Singapore can fill up job vacancies quickly and replacing those older workers .
By "one stone killing two birds" , it can be said that foreign immigration solves both ageing problem as well as babies shortages .
However , with the influx of foreigners into the economy , cultural clashes will occur and more often than not , misunderstandings due to language differences arise .
According to a survey published by Institute of Service Excellence  last year , Singapore has a lower service level satisfactory score of 68 compared to 72 in South Korea and 75 in the States; one of the reasons is the ease of foreign immigration here .
Nowadays , many semi-skilled foreign immigrants are working in service sectors , and even greeting many customers in their mother tongue .
As a result , tourists and even mainland Singaporeans are often put off by their incomprehensible enunciation and insolent intonation of their native language .
Thus , businesses in these sectors employing lower cost foreign workers might lose the goodwill of customers .
Therefore , in the long term , it could hurt the service industry's economies and so , this policy contradicts the main objective of having a strong labor economy .
Singapore's policy to tackle the ageing issue has so far achieved limited success but the side-effects caused by their implementations have greater adversities which outweigh the benefits .
There can never be a single solution or working policy in the battle against ageing population but however , besides the government , each and every individual can actually play a part for their future .
After all , we all grow old one day .
Nowadays , we have been facing the old aging matter as it increases the pressure on our society .
A number of old people are going up day by day while young people , who contribute mainly to country's economics , are on the way down .
This situation makes some countries like Japan , UK or USA keep working on how to ease the aging burden .
Some policies such as later retirement age or more children's responsibility for their parents have been applied .
Though there are still dubious opinions around these solutions , they really bring us a hope about the better future .
At first , some researchers are still skeptical about the later retirement policy , which has been saving millions dollar for countries .
Belly P  writes an article "Can they carry on working ?
Later retirement , health and social inequality in an aging population" to question about the opposite sides of higher retirement age .
She worries about its bad impacts on older people's health , which may increase the health care fees for government and about the unemployment of youngster that will cut down the GPD .
Yet , some believe differently .
Rebecca Smith  finds out that longer working time may help us fight against the Dementia , one of the most terrible illnesses of old people .
In fact , working helps elderly become more independent , more enjoyable and healthier .
If older people keep working , they can pay for their own health care and contribute more for society .
Besides , younger workers still have various work chances , especially , when companies do know about the creativity , activity and intelligence of younger workers .
Ian Ziskin , chief of human resource and administrative office of Northman Grumman , says that it's necessary to have new brand of workforce in a company and his company will keep hiring young workers for the next 5 to 10 years  .
In a short , encouraging later retirement of employee remains effective solution to reduce the burden of old aging .
The second solution being discussed in many countries is raising the adult children's responsibility for caring their older parents .
Every year , governments have to spend around 0 .2% to 3% of total GDP to take care of old people and the number is increasing year by year  .
Does the "light care" of family toward older people help to reduce this ?
In fact , this caring plays critical role in easing the spending of government and citizen on health care for the elderly .
According to the Genworth Financial Cost of Care Survey  , the average fees of nursing care for the elderly is $ 194 per day which does not include the fees of medical care , therapy , etc .
It means you have to pay nearly $6000 per month for caring your parents , which is such a large amount especially in the economic critics recently .
Home care for the older parents , therefore , seems to be acceptable for a lot of families to reduce the cost .
From the government's view , this strategy really saves a lot of money for them .
According to AARP  , home care saved up to $350 billion in 2006 , which is even over the Fed's budget .
In USA , just only 50% of adult say that they are caring for their parents  so if we can raise this number up by increasing the grown children's responsibility , we can save our budget to pay attention to other necessary fields .
Briefly , home caring is going to be the long term plan for us to cope with the problem of aging population in the future .
Although there is still skepticism around the two policies which are used to ease the pressure of aging population , a number of study and facts have shown us their benefit to our society .
Later retirement not only helps elder feel more active and healthier but also brings us a large sum of money .
Similarly , increasing adult's responsibility for their older parents particularly assists the government in caring a number of older people and saving health care's fees .
By and large , until we find the better way to balance the global population , the two solutions are , at least , beneficial .
Because of the fertility decline , together with the expected shrinking population , subsequently , the dependency ratio will sharply increase .
Hence , such explicitly damaging results are unavoidable .
The worst impact is the pressure on the National budget .
Since many people are old and cannot work efficiently , young people have to carry on .
And if the situation get worse , young generation would not be able to pay tax and we would have insufficient fund to care for the elderly .
So what have we done to prepare for this doom day ?
Fortunately , some thoughts have been considered .
Although they have not been perfectly completed , but base on fair judgment , such ideas have helped to lighten the aging effects in our society .
First is the intention to lengthen the working age .
In fact , the Government has introduced the Re-employment Act , which will take effect in the year 2012 , to extend the work age from 62 to 65 .
According to scientific survey , 41 percent of people want to retire after 65 .
However , this policy has been strongly disagreed .
One of the opposing views was the doubt about the olds strengths and perspicacity .
They fear that old people would not response well enough to the fast changing world .
Moreover , some senior workers may be outdated in some field works .
These fears are not unreasonable .
However , old people can still contribute a lot .
Although their knowledge may be antiquated , their experiences are invaluable .
Besides , some older workers still keep them up to date and learn new things .
In addition , they can even train those inexperienced young .
Many companies nowadays have changed their views and greatly welcome these skilled workers .
More importantly , if we extended people's working age , which would give them several years to devote and save more for their old age , we would greatly ease the aging problem .
About 50 thousands people step into retirement each year , which will then contribute to the dependency ratio .
By encouraging people to work for some more years if they still can work well , we would somehow reduce negative effects of this dilemma .
There has been an increasing trend in problems associated with the increasing population of the aged in Singapore .
To tackle these issues commonly encountered by these elderly people , the government has been putting in considerable effort towards alleviating their problems .
The solutions in which Singapore has adopted and the policies that they have implemented aims to help the aged lead a more comfortable life .
This will be further discussed in the essay .
Higher divorce rates and family breakdown are becoming rampant in modern , urbanized societies and will have consequential effects on the quality of care and support for the elderly .
A liberal country such as America operates in the form of nuclear families whereby the young adults leave their parents at an early age in search for their new home .
Thus , it will be very difficult for them to take care of their parents on a day-to-day basis .
Development of medium to long-term policies and formulation of appropriate implementation plans would be necessary to deal with problems related to the social and health care of older persons as the population ages .
In Singapore , a significant legislation known as the "Maintenance of Parents Act" in 1995 requires children to support their parents during the latter's old age which has the effect of preventing problems related to the neglect of elderly parents .
Such a forward-looking policy helps to ensure adequate care and concern for the elderly , helping to ease their aging process .
Financial independence during old age is of great importance to many .
During their twilight years , the weak and elderly would inevitably require to continually seek medical treatments .
Repeated medical treatments can be a financial burden and thus , create a trauma for the elderly .
In Singapore , cost of living is high , in particular , medical cost .
Therefore , the opportunity cost of retiring early is too high and is almost beyond many individuals .
The government has thus taken measures to counter these problems such as setting up the Central Provident Fund  so as to allow people to save when they are economically active .
These savings can be set aside for retirement purposes so that they can be self-dependent .
Since they have an ensured amount for retirement , this would naturally ease the financial burden in their later years .
In conclusion , although the aged in Singapore faces increasing number of problems each day , the government is actually implementing many policies , funding , facilities , programmes and services such as the Central Provident Fund Scheme to ease the problems the aged faces .
In the light the above , current research and governmental policies have , to a large extent , helped ease the aging process .
Aging population is now a serious issue in most developed countries , where the number of young people is overwhelmed by the number of elderly ones .
This increases much pressure to the government when dealing with every aspect like economic issues , or infrastructure systems .
This essay will consider the impact of recent research , in particular science , on the aging process .
Despite some opposite opinions on how science makes aging a serious problem in many societies , the benefits of science brings to ease this process seems to severely outweigh its detriments .
Scientists are seeking a way to prolong life and reverse aging process .
In this point , there might be arguments that the new technique , if available , will results in a larger number of old people , increasing pressure to an already aged and crowded population .
This opinion , in some ways , is not wrong , however , with the help of science , old people are consulted and encouraged to live healthily with appropriate exercises and sufficient nutrition .
The aged now mostly spend their retirement staying healthy and thus prevent diseases or damaged accidents more efficiently .
Besides , this can also lead to less dependency on their children and money from government .
This may not be a way to stop aging process of a population , but is likely to be a good way to ease the stress and difficulties both government and each individual have to face .
Evans  deduces that dietary proteins intake along with proper exercises can help improve muscle strength and prevent sarcopenia and high blood pressure .
Science with the invention of many toxic chemicals either used for fertilizer , pesticides or nuclear weapons , are responsible for higher infertility rate in human and many mutants babies born .
The World Wildlife Fund  has published a list of toxic chemical associated with gene mutation .
However , though it is undeniably true how chemicals increase mutation in tissues , it is still unclear whether infertility rate of human beings can rise due to chemical usage .
According to the Institute of Population Health , University of Ottawa and University of Medical Sciences , Iran , there is still not enough evidence to show the link between infertility and chemicals .
At the same time , in 2003 , Queen's University in Canada published a research on an increased amount of a chemical called TCE found in many infertile men .
While this seems to be a controversial issue , on the other hand , a large quantity of babies is born from infertile couples .
This can be achieved thanks biology and medical science , as well as new technology .
It is estimated that more than 100 ,000 babies have been born through in vitro fertilization  .
Medical researches have moderately changed these couples' lives , and also found a new path for further discoveries .
The world's population is aging .
Recent declines in the fertility rates and increases in life expectancy together have reshaped the global age structure in most regions in the world by shifting the younger groups to the older ones .
According to the UN , life expectancy is projected to reach 76 globally over the next half century , and fertility rate is also predicted to drop more than a half from 5 .0 to 2 .1 children per woman globally by 20501 .
Just like Peterson says "There's an iceberg dead ahead .
It's called global aging and it threatens to bankrupt the great powers"2 .
As a result , the social economy will be affected dramatically in a negative way , one of which is the lack of labour force .
Thus , to prevent the situation from getting worse , many policies should be taken simultaneously by the government .
This essay will discuss about some suggested solutions to the lack of labour force problem that the demographic aging issue brings about based on the context of Singapore .
Initially , increasing the certain age of retirement would alleviate the burden of aging population .
The retirement age of Singapore is currently 62 .
By this policy , if the retirement age is increased by a number of 5 years , the policy makers would have more time to activate some other policies such as boosting the fertility rates or allowing entrepreneurs to employ foreign workers temporarily .
In addition , the more time elder people can work , the more savings or pension they will have to secure their life sufficiently at the old age without being dependent on their children or the governmental fund .
The policy , however , has its own hinders .
Later retirement could cause a decrease in productivity because old people tend to be less healthy or less up-to-date with the new technology , information than the younger ones .
The payment system based on the operation of age for a company could make it more expensive to pay for the old workers than the younger ones .
Secondly , the attempt to raise the fertility rates could also be one the possible solutions .
In fact , this solution somehow could ensure the economy that it would be sufficient new generation of workforce to provide for the labour market when it comes to the time for the previous generation to get retired .
However , the policy might encounter a big obstacle , i .e .
how to ensure that there will be enough space for all people to accommodate in a condition of land scarcity , especially in Singapore , a country with total area of 710 .2 square kilometres .
Also , the policy might take at least 20 years to become feasible once it is started .
But in recent years , the Singapore's government has put more effort to tackle the housing issue , which can be seen through HDB's building programme to provide more public housing for residential use and allow citizens to make loans up to 80% of the value of the flat to make it more affordable for everyone .
As aforementioned above , in the mean time for the next new generation of workforce , the government can consider employing immigrants for a short period of 10 or 20 years .
This solution seems to have been adapted fairly well by the Singapore's government since the beginning of the 21st century , and the immigrant workers have been closely associated with the economic development of the country .
Like many other solutions , the government should be aware of this policy's hidden risk involving the race issue .
Many immigrants coming from different regions of the world with many different cultures and religions might result in conflicts between them .
Plus , since a lot of immigrant workers with different nationalities , their skills might not be similar or adequate enough to meet with the requirement of the jobs .
To solve the problem , a new standard of skills for immigrants should be established or the government should have the immigrant workers re-trained for the country's purposes although it might take time and quite lots of money .
In conclusion , the problem of aging population is rather a problem of rigid and outmoded policies and institutions than only a problem of a demographic change .
Policies need to be developed that account for the natural incentives individuals have to adjust their behaviour in the face of aging population .
Current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Today , aging problem starts to draw people's attention .
Therefore , some research in economics , science and medicine might help to ease the problem .
Secondly , science also helps to cope with the aging problem .
As people get older , they are facing more and more health problem like kidney failure and other chronic diseases .
Science has helped scientists to find out more treatments that can cure illnesses like cancer , stroke , heart problem , etc .
In the past , many people died of cancer because there is no treatment for cancer .
But , nowadays , with the help of science , many types of operation appliances have been created .
For example like machine for radiotherapy , dialysis , etc have helped people to recover from the sicknesses .
However , not every people are afforded to undergo such treatment because they need to pay up to thousand bucks in order to undergo such treatments .
If people are not afforded to pay the fees , they cannot receive treatment also .
Therefore , the government should give money to needy people especially elderly in order to undergo treatments .
Besides , with the help of science , the percentage of a surgery to succeed is getting higher .
It is because nowadays doctor will sterilize their operation tools before they start a surgery .
Besides , scientists start create more healthy food through bioengineering , that is , the gene of the food can be altered so that the nutrition of certain food can be levelled up .
For example like scientist altered a gene of tomato so that the vitamin "folate" can be levelled up .
However , there are side effects also when we are having such gene-altered food . 
Thirdly , the introduction of many new medicines has helped to ease aging problem .
Today , many medicines have been created to treat cancers or other health problems .
For example like high blood pressure , there are many types of medicine that are available to treat these sicknesses .
Furthermore , besides medicine that uses to treat sickness , there are supplements which can make our body to become healthier .
Nowadays , there are many types of supplements available in the market .
For example like pill vitamin , iron , calcium , etc .
The introduction of these supplements is due to people's hectic lifestyle .
Many people have no time to take a balanced diet , so these supplements can help them to get certain nutrition where they did not get from their diet .
However , such supplements have also found to have side effects .
Due to some findings , overtaking supplements can lead to kidney failure or diabetes .
It is because the sodium level in some supplements are too high , then it might lead to kidney failure .
Therefore , it is better for us to gain certain nutrition from natural food like fresh fruits and vegetables .
In conclusion , aging problem is getting more serious , therefore , we have to pay more attention to this topic so that the problem can be eased .
With an exploding population , a quickly aging people is becoming a major issue in many countries .
With more career minded youngsters , marriage and having children are being postponed to the later stages of their lives .
The increase in number of aged people has seriously slowed down the development of country and burdened the government in terms of healthcare and financial aid packages for the elderly .
As a solution , several social policies have been implemented by governments around the world .
One of them is financial support managed by government pension funds .
Workers are obligated to contribute certain amount of their income to build up their retirement fund since day one of employment .
Governments have enacted laws for workers to save part of their wages so that financial security after retirement is guaranteed .
The Singapore government has set up the Central Provident Fund  , one of the many pension funds around the world , which requires employees to save almost 12% of their income in their CPF accounts .1 The money cannot be withdrawn except for housing , education , investments or medical care purposes .
However , Adam Smith  suggests that government should not interfere with the free trade of society .2 Trade should be free from affectation as the policy has been speculated that it reduces cash flow , and in turn reduces purchasing power .
This is untrue as the government can make good use of CPF funds to invest and develop the nation .
For instance , equipping a rural area with modern infrastructure and public amenities creates more job opportunities .
The consumption power of society will increase in the long run .
Another policy is to extend the retirement age to expand a nation's workforce .
A larger workforce allows employees to save for a longer period of time to strengthen their financial status for their retirement .
The Government of India has extended the retirement age of people from 58 to 60 in 2007 .3 However , the productivity of aging people is lower compared to the youngsters .
Aged people are not able to work as porters , construction workers , and plumbers .
The elderly can opt to work as lecturers and teachers to put their experience to good use .
Mentoring the potential employees enables them to gain experience which would have taken them decades .
They can learn at a faster pace , thanks to the guidance provided .
Department head should be of the elder ones so that they can impart their experience to the young worker .
The payoff of this investment is a highly efficient and the productive workforce .
As a conclusion , the policies that have been implemented by governments have countered the issue of aging workforces .
This solution can be further enhanced by employees .
Saving money on the onset of employment should be practiced in preparation for retirement .
Governments should play a part in making investments that provide returns .
The dividends of investments can be credited directly into employees' pension fund accounts .
With the cooperation of government agencies and the private sector , this issue can easily be resolved .
Leaving this issue unchecked means risking the welfare of the elderly , who have given years of their working life to the country .
They definitely deserve a break after contributing to their nation's economy .
If one looks back into the past just only 20 to 30 years ago , he/she can see a big step in the improvement of life quality thanks to the rapid development of modern technology .
As a result , people's lifespan also increases .
However , the question is whether we are ready for the increase in aging population or not ?
It seems to be good news , but to many developed countries , this fact is causing trouble to their leaders and because of that , many research and policies have been established to ease the aging process .
This essay will discuss those policies as the government's efforts to create a brighter future for the old people .
The context in Singapore will be looked into more detail as illustrations for this essay .
Before the creation of any policy , there is a need to analyse what the possible causes are in order to find out the most effective solution .
The most common difficulty faced by the elders is finance since they cannot earn their livings from their jobs anymore .
Hence , the governments propose a solution of encouraging working aged citizens to work more or increasing the inflow of immigrants so that government's tax income is enhanced and so does the subsidy for the elders .
Unfortunately , there are quite a lot of side effects attached with this policy .
First of all , with the current intensive workload , is it possible to put more burdens on employees' shoulders ?
In Singapore , occupational stress has been popular and even become a dilemma .
Nowadays , working-Singaporeans get so stressful from their work that they could barely have time for their own enjoyment and for their family .
Even more seriously , young people do not have enough time for dating which is shrinking the country's population .
We usually hear Singaporeans complaining about stress , primarily from work or from education system .
One of the common reasons for Singapore's low birth rate is stress .
Therefore , we need to pay attention to work-life balance amidst our economic pursuits .
.
Secondly , inviting more working immigrants as an alternative method is not a good idea either .
: One of the issues raised is the potential competition for use of resources such as public space , transportation , etc .
This concern has been expressed by some Singaporeans over the gathering of foreign workers in certain parts of the city on weekends , particularly where these places are at or near residential areas .
Overcrowding on roads and other public spaces , littering , vandalism , urinating in public and theft are some of the complaints levelled .
More foreigners not only raise the crime rates but also require government to spend more money on developing infrastructure , public housing to accommodate all of them .
All of those troubles that the appliance of this policy bringing about may outweigh the benefits .
The appliance therefore needs further consideration and comparison between what we get and what we lose .
Besides , another method considered is encouraging later retirement and longer working lives .
Although it is true that when the elders work more , they can earn more , hence reducing old-age dependency , the implied cost may not be less than the benefit .
Though the elders have a lot of experience , they may not work as effectively and make decision as quickly as the younger generations do .
There may not be enough jobs for both young and old people , especially in down turn economy like today .
Therefore , finally , government may need to spend a large amount of money on creating incentives for companies to hire old people , namely: tax reduction , subsidy for each elder employed , etc .
Moreover , old people may not strong enough to withstand the stress at work and the cost for healthcare and insurance for old working people will surpass the profit , which all companies try to earn as much as they can .
For all the above reasons , this policy seems to be impractical .
In conclusion , it seems that we are still not ready for an increasing old age population yet .
Despite the government's attempt to ease the aging process , there are still many issues that need further careful consideration .
Having such advanced technology in the current world , the aging population will be expecting a longer health life expectancy .
Therefore , the baby boomers in the early 1950s will be likely to live well into their 80s and 90s .
Such trends will cause a drastic decrease in the world's population by 2050 if the fertility rates do not increase substantially .
Due to low fertility issues , most developing countries are currently facing a situation where there will be insufficient people to replace the retiring labor force and mortality of the aging population in the near future .
Since such aging issues cannot be resolved instantaneously , technological means and governmental policies should be implemented over time to reduce negative societal and economical impacts brought by the aging trend .
Statistical researches have shown that most couples are unable to sustain two or more children due to the high cost of living and constant increase in inflation .
Despite of these economic constraints , there is still an urgent need for the government to increase the amount of children per household to replace the huge retiring labor force in order to maintain the economic growth within a country .
By having sufficient replacement in the labor force , it will generate adequate taxes and economic returns for the government to provide public pensions and subsidized health programs for the aging population .
On top of that , producing more children also means that it enables the future generations to better distribute their social responsibilities in the context of fulfilling their filial obligations , resulting in lesser elder dependency on the government .
Therefore , the government should implement policies such as giving monetary incentives and tax rebates to encourage the current generation to produce more children .
As for those couples who are facing infertility problems , the government can minimize such social problems by maximizing the use of current technology simultaneously with the aid of new policies and subsidy schemes to make infertility treatments more affordable .
However , such subsidies will be available on a case-by-case basis where only infertile couples who fall below a certain household income range will be entitled these subsidies .
In addition , for those who are not eligible to receive the subsidy , the government can liaise with local banks to offer short-term loans to encourage them to take up such treatments .
With these policies in place , infertile couples will less likely to be a burden to the social and economic aspect of an aging population .
Another way to ease the aging process is to encourage "active aging" , which refers to encouraging later retirement and longer working lives of each individual .
It is stated in CEC  as "an orientation towards policies and practices including life-long learning , working longer , retiring later and more gradually , and engaging in capacity-enhancing and health sustaining activities .
Such practices aim to raise the average quality of individual lives and , at the same time , at a societal level , contribute to higher growth , lower dependency burdens and substantial cost savings in pensions and health .
They therefore represent win-win strategies for people of all ages ."
Nevertheless , this is a difficult task as the efficiency and productivity of elderly workers decreases relative to their increase in age .
This means that it is less likely to reduce elder dependency if there are no substantial benefits to employ such employees .
However , with the creation of new policies such as tax rebates , it will attract employers to hire older workers .
For example , giving tax rebates to employers who hire more than three workers aged 60 and above .
Besides targeting the employers , the government can try improving the productivity of elderly workers by offering training or retraining for employees above the age of 50 .
These schemes will equip the aging community with sufficient technological/technical knowledge to remain productive and efficient in the labor force despite of their disadvantages .
In conclusion , with the aid of the current technologies and governmental policies , countries can ease its aging process by increasing the fertility rates , encouraging filial obligations and active aging  , reducing elder dependency on government , and lastly , improving the productivity and efficiency of elderly workers .
With these in place , the impact of aging population on the social and economic aspects will be greatly reduced .
In recent years , governments have been faced with the demographic reality of an aging population .
Main concern is that the graying population may cause the national economy to come under pressure as there will be less younger people to support the growing numbers of elderly .
The rise in the median age of a country can cause substantial burden to the economy because governments will have to incur huge spending on healthcare system to meet the needs of the growing demand of healthcare services .
However , current research and policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
Such policies include social policy like increasing the retirement age , allowing more work age immigrants into the country and introducing retirement scheme to ease basic needs after retirement .
The increase in retirement age will give people a few more years of earnings to build up social security and savings .
Karen Holden  suggests that as people work longer , it can help to reduce the likelihood of elderly falling into poverty when they reach a certain age .
This also allows them to lead a better quality life and support themselves so as to reduce the dependency on the younger generation for a longer period of time .
On the other hand , the increase in retirement age does not necessary mean that people will be able to maximize their working years as some might be faced with health issues even before their retirement age .
Forcing oneself to work beyond his/her limit might cause one's health to further deteriorate and contribute negative impact to the economy .
However , even if the elderly were to become inactive from the working society and rest at home , it does not mean that he/she will recover faster .
Graying population has created pressure for younger generation as the ratio of young adults supporting one elderly has been constantly decreasing .
Therefore , allowing more work age immigrants into the country may be one of the social policies that can help to ease the aging process .
Increasing the number of work age immigrants will help to lower the median age of the population and at the same time , result in a rise in the efficiency level because of a more competitive workforce .
On the contrary , such policy can lead to social problems as the increased competition can result in citizens losing their job to the foreign immigrants and eventually causes them to lose confidence and feel demoralized .
However , the quote from Matthew Bandyk  , "The evidence is actually pretty strong that immigrants create jobsthey don't steal them ."
can justify that the locals will have more job opportunities when foreign companies set up businesses here .
The social policies mentioned in the above paragraphs might be helpful in influencing the public on doing something individually which can affect the nation as a whole .
In summary , Social policies such as increasing in retirement age might result in lesser dependency on the younger generation while lowering the barrier of work age immigrants will decrease the median age of the population and lastly , the introduction of retirement scheme can allow people to save for their retirement .
Therefore , it can be concluded that social policies do play a part , to a large extent , in easing aging process .
The world population is expected to increase from 200million to 2 billion between 1950 to2050 , especially for people aged 60 and above  .
It is becoming an increasingly important issue for governments all over the world .
Measures have been implemented to slowdown the process of a matured society  and at the same time cope with the problem brought about by an ageing population  .
In the following paragraphs , issues on whether the government should redirect public funds to other more important matters concerning the country , or focus on improving the health of the aged by growing the resources especially for them .
The concerns that will be discussed if funds should be put into funding education and its facilities , and the growth of the country itself is of a more paramount significance with regards to the country's development .
Economic Growth is another issue that should not be neglected when a country is concerned about her development .
There should not be a diversion of public funds because economic growth is dependent on consumption , investments , and government expenditure  .
Economic growth can be brought about through consumption and investments , not necessarily government incentives .
This means that public funds should be given to providing for the aged as economic growth can be dependent on other factors .
Conversely , as stated by Mackenzie  , Canadians benefit typically $17 ,000 from the public services from tax funds , about the same amount a Canadian working full-time would earn .
Since extensive monetary benefits are given out to Canadians , it should not be a problem for them to cope with ageing as they can save while benefitting from government incentives .
In addition , economic growth can come about through diverting funds into more valuable area like education .
Education worth directly affects individual earnings  .
Skills obtained allow for higher productivity in the workforce .
Young adults will be able to secure a well-paid job in the future; it will lead to higher consumption and investments  .
Thus this leads to elevated economic growth and higher standard of living , and children will be able to look after their parents .
This means that through investing in children's higher education , the country is able to compensate for the decrease in public spending on the aged .
Hence , public funds should not be allocated solely to helping the aged .
Therefore , there will never be a situation where funds should be restricted to just one area .
Spending of public funds should be diverted to various areas of the country depending on its country focus .
Hence , government should consider what is more important for the country's development and direct the funds into that direction .

At the beginning of 21st century , we have to deal with a series of global issues , among them the aging population should be considered as a black spot .
Not only putting adverse impacts on other members in their families , the elder people day to day cause many troubles to societies'developments in general .
Beside the expense for societal aging , there are also sponsors from the government which need be diverted to other fields .
For these reasons , it should be better if the money pent on the aged is deliberately limited for investing on many critical factors of the national economy .
To begin with , it can not be denied that the governments have to care for elders partly because they weren't much concerned about their health in the past .
Along with the improvement of living standards , people have got used to the sedentary lifestyle - having a seat all day without any exercise .
Besides , during their adolescence , probably time for studying and various kinds of indoor entertainment such as movies or PC games contrained them from joining in outdoor activities and unintentionally stole the essential fundamentals for their health afterwards .
According to a study in 2004 , 20 percent of all deaths of people 35 and older were related to the lack of physical activities , even higher than those involved in smoking .
Moreover , because of the unawareness of humans , our damaged environment is really pushing us to the verge of the extinction .
Hence , before receiving public funds , aged people as well as their future generations should review their lifestyles to rescue themselves .
Secondly , the aged generation could strain national budgets .
When the aging population is excessive , this results in extra enormous expenditure and the government is pressured to ask the citizens for higher taxes .
However , once such taxes are applied , the poors unexpectedly become the first victims .
Naturally being full of financial issues , the more difficult and challenging life can push these innocent people to illegal behaviors .
Furthermore , due to high taxes , the reduced incomes of citizens could have negative impacts on their purchase and in the same way , the domestic market and the economy in general might be caused a lot of trouble .
Countries with extended programs serving for health care to the aged might find the escalation in the cost when the number of recipients rises .
By 2050 , some economists predict that the fiscal burden of the financial crisis , for advanced countries , will be only about 10 percent of the ageing-related expense .
Additionally , it is clear that a nation's development is ruled by a lot of factors .
Some of them like education and military are compulsory and indispensable since they have unreplaceable roles in the destiny as well as a country's future .
For this reason , too much money paid for caring the graying population means the shortage of concern on other essential areas .
Meanwhile , it might be recognized that public spending on the aged should be encouraged as a charity activity instead of being mandatory .
Why ?
The elderly can be looked after by their own families as a traditional aspect before relying on the support from the national budget .
Therefore , helping the aged on financial issues could not be the priority in a country's policies .
On the other hand , opponents of this position can argue that ther should be filial obligation for the dependence of this grey population on their children .
They were also parents sacrificing their whole life for the children so it is sensible that they are concerned at the end of life .
Since families are the nuclears shaping the society , humans morality should be well educated from these first shells , Nevertheless , it might be more useful for the aged if the pension age is put up or getting more exercise in order to prevent dangerous risks coming with their downgrading bodies .
In fact , Japan increased the age of retirement for men from 60 to 65 and from 57 to 65 for women .
As a result , despite the limit on money spending , we still respect traditional responsibilities .
Also , it might be necessary when citizens all act for the common target- the country's benefits .
Since the grey generation is just one part of a large society , its duty could be reduced for the growth of the whole society .
In conclusion , aging population is a global phenomenon , but it doesn't imply that the government should waste too much money on finding a solution .
The elderly people could be a huge expense on the national budget , while there are other significant sectors demanding for more concern from the entire society , In spite of partly against moral aspects , the country's interest might outweighs the filial obligations .
Instead of using money as the only method , it is highly recommended that changing all our lifestyle for being independent and healthy regardless of the age .
The problem of an aging population has been one of the top agendas in national policies and budgets for many politicians all over the world , especially for Singapore .
In the Budget 2007 , three billion has been earmarked for healthcare spending to deal with the issue .
However , Singapore should limit public spending on the aged because it does not provide a long-term solution for the nation and thus it should be spent on other developments that can indirectly but significantly relieve the economic burden of the aging population .
The other developments include medical science , science and technology and lastly , education .
Proponents claim that the government should implement better policies to alleviate the aging population with increasing public spending on mainly medical benefits because illnesses catch up with them as they grow older and the expensive treatments could possibly wipe out their savings accounts .
Compared to other countries such as USA , Singapore does not have as much money reserves , therefore it is not feasible .
Singapore has already implemented adequate schemes such as Medishield and Medisave for citizens to pay medical fees which are also heavily subsidised .
Unlimited public spending on the aged would only pose as a long-term problem for the nation .
Instead , it should be diverted to other developments that can aid Singapore's future developments .
Public spending on the aged can be diverted to medical science development .
It can be utilized in more in-depth research that develops new and inexpensive medicinal drugs for the public .
With the occurrence and wide spread of mutant viruses and disease , medical research serves a greater purpose for survival of the infected patients and drugs can be manufactured in large quantity and be easily available for them .
New treatments can also be developed to cure the illnesses encountered by the aged .
Therefore , public spending on medical science not only benefits the aged but also for people of those who are diagnosed with virus or diseases .
In addition , public spending on the aged can be diverted to advancing science and technology .
As Singapore does not have its own natural resource , we can develop new ways to gain these resources in order to be self sufficient .
For example , water has to be purchased from foreign countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia .
If Singapore fails to maintain good relationship with these countries , our lives will be in jeopardy without water .
Fortunately , in the recent development of Newater , water can be 'renewed' .
The government should emphasize on developing new land for high technological agriculture .
Thus public spending in science and technology can alleviate the rising cost of food which deals with the problem of the increasing population .
Lastly , public spending on the aged can be diverted to educate the younger generation on financial planning so that they can save enough for their retirement .
Most of the younger generation do not have the habit of saving because they have not been told or taught on how to deal with future obstacles they may face in the later years .
Therefore , it is necessary to improve their knowledge of planning for the future through financial planning so that they can cope with aging .
In this way , they will be less dependent on the government in the future .
In conclusion , the government should limit public spending on the aged and focus more on the major future developments which can help Singapore tackle the main problems that the majority of the local population faces , and also the roots of the aging population .
Therefore , the aging population would be less of a burden to many politicians on how to allocate the national budget every year to cope with the problem .
Demographic changes such as a growing aging population will have an unprecedented problem in developed nations .
National budgets and economies will come under pressure as more funds are required to support the growing numbers of elderly persons .
In the context of Singapore , given the socio-economic and political disparity between the possible usages of the fund , the funding for elderly issue remains controversial .
Ministry of Finance  states that the Government will be contributing $226 million to top up Medisave accounts for the elderly .
The amount of public spending used to support the elderly has been seen as a more constructive expenditure on other areas of development of the nation .
To deal with such challenges , one of the options is to set boundaries on public spending on the aged .
However , setting limitations on public spending on the aged may or may not assist development of the nation but the changes may shatter the existing system .
With little economic growth and increasing expenditure to develop the nation , the majority of people regard the amount of public spending on the elderly can be used as a more constructive expenditure on other areas of developing the nation .
Ministry of Finance  reports that many public infrastructure projects are financed by the Government through a combination of government grants , loans and user fees .
Budget Speech 2009 reveals the measures the Government is going use to sustain the property market  .
A 40% property tax rebate for industrial and commercial properties for 2009 will require about $800 million of national budget  .
These expenditures require the Government to explore possible ways to further utilize national budget in order to continue to develop the nation .
Public policies assist the continuation of national development by encouraging education , research and development , and introducing the latest technologies to its people .
With the power of knowledge and advance technology , the nation can improve its economy and ensure the well-being of current and future generations of older people is taken care of .
Public spending on elderly in Singapore is carefully designed , so as to provide the needs of the aged in the best possible way , but the fund is insufficient to support the growing aging population .
Medifund Silver is introduced to provide means-tested socialized care for the elderly needy  .
Ministry of Finance  states that the Government will be providing $226 million in Medisave top-ups for 734 ,000 elderly in the nation , this amount of assistance cost breaks down to about $290 per elderly .
MediShield covers more than 90% of the working population and almost 80% of the population  .
On an individual basis , elderly are ill-equipped to withstand the possibility of contracting a terminal disease , from the calculations from Ministry of Health  , a $2 ,227 treatment bill on heart attack is likely to devastate most retirees .
To increase the livelihood of elderly , Dr Balakrishnan  announces an increment of $30 for elderly living alone with no dependents will receive Public Assistance allowance of $290 per month .
All in all , Medifund Silver , Medisave and MediShield are focused and realistic approaches targeted to lessen the financial burden on future generations yet due to the insufficient fund , the current amount of public spending is not enough to sustain the basic necessity for elderly .
In the developed countries , a greying population brings about slow economic growth .
To progress as a nation or to leave out the elderly is controversial .
The argument Dr Balakrishnan  points out reflects the insufficient public funding for the elderly , with $290 per month , it merely covers the basic necessity leaving elderly no chance to fall sick .
$1 a day will not be able to buy them one meal a day in any hawker centre  .
This claim strongly emphasizes the lack of public spending on elderly , needless to say , the idea to set boundaries on public spending on them .
In addition , this can be seen that  $226 million of funding on Medisave accounts for the elderly is insufficient to support the S$800 million property tax rebate  , it may shatter the existing system by depriving elderly their basic necessity and healthcare needs .

Aging population becomes a ubiquitous trend in many developed countries such as Japan .
The government confronts a series of financial and social problems .
The biggest challenge is to reduce the fiscal and economic cost of elder dependency .
Many policies have been proposed by scholars .
The idea that reserving retirement fund in advance can ease the aging process is regarded as an efficient and feasible method to the government  .
However , some still think that the younger generation and the government are responsible to deal with the problem coming with aging population .
If elderly people failed to accumulate enough funds before retirement , they have to rely a lot on their children .
However , the younger generation have heavy financial burdens to take care of their own families and sometimes are unable to support their parents .
For example , in a Singaporean middle class family , a young couple usually has two to four children and lives in a governmental or private house with mortgage .
They have to work hard to provide the basic necessities of life , such as food , clothes , education etc .
In this harsh situation , the elderly parents who have no incomes and no savings become a big financial strain to the young .
When the health conditions of the elderly people become bad , the financial burden on the young becomes overwhelming .
In some cases , an expensive medical bill can even lead a prosperous family to bankruptcy .
When the young are exposed to both financial and emotional stresses , they cannot concentrate on work .
Finally , it negatively affects the society by decreasing productivity and economic growth .
On the contrary , the government should compel people to save a certain portion of their incomes into special retirement accounts before they reach retirement age and allow the owners to withdraw the money when they retire .
The government could also give subsidies to encourage the public to do so , for instance , offering a reasonably high interest rate .
Singaporean government has been doing well in this respect .
All Singaporean must save 5 percent of their total incomes and their employers contribute additional 20 percent into a government retirement account .
The government provides a 4 percent annual interest rate which is relatively higher than many commercial banks .
There are two reasons that the Singaporean government to do so .
One is to give confidence to the public; the other one is to help them to mitigate the effects of inflation .
Most Singaporean are expected to accumulate sufficient amount for retirement with the help of this system .
Aging population is a social problem as well as an individual problem .
The government has responsibility to help and guide the public to plan their retirement life .
Furthermore , the public must take care of themselves .
Providing retirement fund in advance is a long term project and this can only be achieved by raising public consciousness .
Public spending , in terms of taxes , refers to the sum of money charged by the government for specific facilities or services , levied upon incomes , property , sales , and more .
Some of the taxes include Income Tax , Property Tax , as well as Goods and Services Tax  .
This strategy suggested is feasible to a large extent .
Public spending should be limited to a certain degree so that budget would be diverted to different areas such as education , research and development , tourism industry and transportation system of the country .
The most basic yet important area of the country's development would be education .
In most countries , education is considered to be one of the fundamental sector that the country's government can develop and improve on .
It is the base system of the country that imparts knowledge to the people and keeps a majority of them employed .
For that reason , the process of education is considered to be essential for the development our society such that every child has to go through a minimum ten years of basic education .
It has also become such an indispensable part of our lives that to the majority of people , it appears to be a norm to complete the whole process of the education .
It is crucial that the country have a good education system for a better future economic development .
The Research and Development  sector allows the development of the country .
According to the Yearbook of Statistics Singapore , there has been an increase in demand for R&D by many companies .
As changes occur every day , modernization occurs , new technologies are introduced and people try to catch up with the rapid advancement .
In many cases , research and development is important to the countries' businesses and industries to boost knowledge and skills .
For favorable progress , it is important for the business sector , universities , colleges and research institutes to collaborate in order to stimulate innovation , growth and modernization .
More needs to be done in order to draw us nearer to the fast changing know- how of the society .
The tourism industry attracts foreigners to spend , thus giving rise to an inflow of cash into the country .
To many countries , tourism is their only source of income and is therefore vital for them to develop in this area .
For example , Maldives and Seychelles only earn the opportunity for employment in the tourism service industries .
It includes hospitality services , such as hotels and resorts , transportation services , such as airlines , cruise ships and taxis , as well as entertainment venues , such as shopping malls , amusement parks and casinos .
Thus , government initiatives for the tourism industry are important , to enhance growth throughout the country by promoting the development of the industry and also to increase employment opportunities by creating more jobs available for them .
However , on the other hand , though should be limited , adequate percentage of public spending for the aged should be allocated fairly .
The reason being , many elderly are being neglected by their own children , and thus uninsured .
They might not have enough money to get their regular medical checkups done .
So , does this means that they are to die ?
This problem would continue to get worst every year if there is an inadequate attention paid .
Though it is important to solve the problem of the graying society , we should limit our public spending in this sector so that we can allow more budget on the other aspects of a country's development , such as the transportation infrastructure .
A significant level of road traffic can be created due to the high density of an urban environment .
This can have a great impact on businesses and environmental factors .
Therefore , careful planning and development of the transportation system are crucial .
More money should be used to develop this infrastructure in order to support the moving of goods from one place to another efficiently and effectively .
Parking space is another concern .
For example , in Singapore where land scarcity poses a big issue , multi-storey carparks are built to allow more vehicles to be parked given the same land area used .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited to the certain percentage that is adequate for the welfare of the aged .
On top of that , public spending should also be diverted across different aspect of social concerns that lead to the development of Singapore .
By putting a limit for the spending on the aged , we can create more budgets to spend on the education , research and development , tourism industry and transportation system as they are equally important to our nation .
No , I do not agree with the statement .
Current researches and development/polices have indeed ease the aging process but only to a small extent .
The aging issues that today's elderly faces include active life expectancy , diet/nutrition , disease prevention , health behaviors and beliefs , health service utilization , mental health , long term care and etc .
The technological advancement in medical science will be discussed to address some of the issues mentioned .
With investment in technologies , it provides new opportunities for medical interventions .
For example , Stem Cell technology greatly helps to aid the discovery of new medicines by improving the process of developing new compounds .
By adopting this technology , we can now develop medicines that are safer and more effective .
This is necessary to help ease aging process .
Moreover , with recent advances in science , more treatments can be developed to treat disease .
These treatments will be helpful because people get increasingly susceptible to chronic illness .
However , with new development of treatments , it will mean that there will be an increase in health care cost .
This will lead to an increase in burden for the elderly .
In context of Singapore , to address this issue , various financial health care schemes like Medisave and Medishield are implemented to help lessen the financial burden for the elderly .
Technology and its advancements have given medical science the forefront to ease aging process .
Another example will be the invention of nutritional supplements .
Research has found out that by taking nutritional supplements on a daily basis can provide significantly health benefits for the elderly , reducing the possibilities of them falling sick .
There are current on-going researches on the different types of dietary supplements that can reverse disease , improve the overall health of the elderly and help them to live a longer , happier life .
This in term slow down the ageing process and promoting a healthy lifestyle .
However , some nutritional supplements have harmful side effects .
It contains addictives that can deteriorate the health of the elderly .
Preventive measures can be taken by referencing medical brochures/guides , or consulting the doctor on the suitable type of supplements to consume if one has medical history .
Such well-tested medical products have help to ease the aging process .
When people grow older , they have to cope with the physical , mental and emotional stresses of being  ?old ? .
These stresses will cause negative influences on health as it affects our body functions .
However , social policy can address such issue to make aging process less painful for the elderly .
For example , the Singapore government has introduced a pilot wellness programme for the elderly Singaporeans in an effort to promote a healthy lifestyle among them and also engaged them socially .
The key components are mainly regular medical-check ups and follow up , regular exercises , and social networking .
By exercising , elderly improves their overall health and helps to prevent chronic diseases .
Social networking helps elderly battle against loneliness and makes new friends .
All these factors improve the overall quality of life for the elderly .
However , social policy has to be revised timely to address the changing needs of the elderly .
With effective social policy , it will help to slow down the aging process .
However , the easing of aging process does not only depend on the above factors .
Other factor includes individual's responsibility on maintaining a healthy diet/nutrition .
So what type of foods should elderly consume ?
According to Neilmark  ,  ?The foods that decrease inflammation in the body are called "anti-inflammatory foods ."
These foods help stop the aging of our cells and help restore youth and vitality to our body and mind .
Elderly should adopt The Best Longevity Diet Around .
According to Neilmark  , he defined it as  ?Eat fewer calories .
Eat no processed foods .
Eat no fried foods .
Take an ultra-refined fish oil supplement .
Exercise moderately .
Stop stressing: your mental diet .
Remain calm emotionally: your emotional diet .
?
In conclusion , current research and development/polices has helped to ease aging process but only to a small extent .
Technology can be used as a solution to cope the current healthcare challenges we are faced with .
However , in the future , healthcare systems have to be reformed to deal with the increased needs of healthcare support required by the aged .
While the advancement in healthcare industry can help prevent diseases and other consequences of aging , medicine along is inadequate .
A healthy lifestyle is important for the elderly to enable them to cope with stresses physically , emotionally and mentally .
It also helps to reduce the risk of disease .
Ageing population is currently a global phenomenon that occurs in many parts of the world .
Singapore has currently one of the fastest growing ageing population in Asia , with the current one in twelve citizens being the age of 65 and over set to increase to every one in five in 2030 .
Hence , public spending on the aged in Singapore has a high possibility of rising in order to cope with the shift in aging structure .
However , limitations should be set on the public spending on the aged to a large extent in order to promote the country's development in other areas .
In Singapore , where there is a reasonably low birth rate and top-notch health care which helps prolong people's lives , population aging is inevitable , hence being prospective-looking , the strategy that is feasible would be to reallocate of funds and attention on other areas , in particular , Education and Tourism .
The diversion of capital into the Education Sector will enable Singapore to identify more opportunities .
Singapore is presently building an education hub in Asia , investing millions of funds to boost her image and economy .
As foreign students start pouring into Singapore , it is projected that education services will generate about five percent of the gross domestic product .
Moreover , a high quality education system will be beneficial for the next generation , as exhibited by the ripple effect .
The increased education quality will extend an average Singaporean's working span allowing an increase accumulation of savings .
This will indirectly help to solve some of the problems posed by ageing population , as it will help to reduce elderly dependency and changing Singapore into an independent society where elderly will be less reliant on the government .
The tourism industry is another area Singapore should divert her funds into as the industry is highly influential , affecting other related industries such as the hotel and service industries .
The tourism industry posted high revenue of S$14 .8 billion in 2008 , a 4 .8% increase from 2007 .
This increase has demonstrated the potential of Singapore's tourism industry and making full use of every opportunity presented in this sector will be vital , owing to the colossal impact this industry has on other industries .
For instance , the upcoming Integrated Resorts  will without a doubt stimulate a positive impact on the economy , both financially and image-wise .
Therefore , by reallocating more funds and attention to this industry , it will bring about a positive change in the Singapore tourism industry and economic as a whole .
On the contrary , the effect of this ageing population will increase the expenditure in both the healthcare and welfare services , with the aged being the major beneficiary in both areas .
More capital might be required to be invested into the healthcare sector .
As people continue to age , they will be more prone to more illnesses which require much healthcare attention , establishing a direct relationship between age and the need of health care .
By not limiting the public spending on the aged in this sector , it will allow more research and development to carry on and technologies to be imported that will ease the ageing process .
Nevertheless , the choice to not limit the public spending on the aged will only help to solve today's problem of the ageing population .
On the other hand , diverting capital to the education and tourism sectors will not only help with the country's developments , but will also help to solve the current problems with today's generation of the aged .
This win-win situation will allow Singapore to embrace itself for the future challenges and reduce elderly dependency .
In conclusion , the decision whether to limit public spending for the aged in order to divert it into other areas is a very debatable issue .
With many pros and cons on both sides , this issue will definitely meet many different opinions from different people .
Nonetheless , the decision to divert funds to other area's for development such as education and tourism will be the most viable one , solely because of the fact that not only does it help with Singapore's development , but also coping with challenges that arises with a ageing population indirectly with time to come .
Hence , Singapore should continue to focus and direct her attention and spending onto the tourism and education sector so as to reinforce the country's development and strength .

Old age , for a normal person , is the last stage that one has to go through in his life .
This is the stage when the elderly have to face the changes in their physical appearances and also mental sensitiveness .
They start to have wrinkles on their face and their hair colour turns gray or white .
Their memory power starts to become weak and they tend to forget things easily .
This aging process has made old people suffer from functional and mental disabilities , causing them to feel inferior and being alienated .
This is the time when the psychological practitioners and the government have to step in to help easing the aging process of the elderly .
To ease the aging process of the elderly , the government has also introduced and encouraged the need for working individuals to prepare a fund for their future use .
The private savings funds and investment plans may be optional , but the government implemented one should be mandated , so that every retired citizen will have a secured fund for their post-retirement use .
In Singapore , the Central Provident Fund  has been introduced to provide the working Singaporeans with a sense of security and confidence in their life after retirement .
The workers and the employers are required to make monthly contribution to the CPF accounts .
Some people may think that the saving plans will only benefit those who earn more .
Those who earn less will be less privileged .
However , it is proven wrong , because there are different plans which cater to different person's needs .
Most plans have very low requirements , so that to make sure every working individual can benefit from the savings plans provided .
This will definitely reduce the financial burden of the working force , and minimise the stress caused by financial difficulties .
In conclusion , psychological treatments such as counselling and also the implementation of government's social policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Although it has become an arising issue that the aging population will bring a great impact to the society and also the economic growth of the country , more emphasis should be given to the older generation , as they are important assets to the nation .
Therefore , more measures have to be taken to make the aging process an easier one for the elderly .

In general , our society is aging and there are problems associated with an aging population .
In Asia , Singapore is one of the fastest aging populations .
According to Inter-Ministerial Committee on Aging Report  , currently 7% of its population is over the age of 65 , and this number will increase to 19% by 2030 .
There are three broad aspects of problems associated with aging process , namely the physical , emotional and financial aspect .
Physically , the aged will feel weak and body ailments will increase as a result of wear and tear of the body .
Emotionally , the elderly will feel lonely as their parents , friends and in some cases their life partner has departed .
Financially , the old no longer work and they can only depend on their savings or their children for their daily expenses .
Current policies such as Medisave , HDB's rules on housing where the young live near their parent and parents' maintenance act are therefore put in place .
Unfortunately , these policies have played a little role to ease the aging process for most of the elderly .
Currently , there are policies implemented to help the aging population in three different areas , physical , emotional and financial .
First , elderly have weaker health and are more susceptible to chronic illnesses .
Medisave policy is introduced to aid in healthcare needs such as paying hospitalization expenses and selected outpatient treatments .
Next , to meet the elderly needs of emotional support , the government implemented additional grants on HDB housing to foster family bonding .
To illustrate , if couples are staying near or together with their parents , they have priority over regular applicants when they apply for new HDB flat .
Similarly , those buying resale flats benefit from a higher housing grant , approximately an additional of 10 ,000 dollar .
In this way , it enables the young to continuously get in touch with their parents .
Moreover , the elderly can help to take care of their children , if any .
Last , elderly loss income on retirement , therefore , they have to depend on their savings or children for their expenses .
In cases where elderly cannot support themselves financially and their children refuse to take care of them , Maintenance of Parents Act had been implemented in 1996 .
Consequently , parents can demand financial maintenance from their children through family court .
On the contrary , "elderly will use between three and five times more health-care services compared to younger generation"  , thus Medisave would be still inadequate to assist most of the elderly in their course of aging .
Besides , Medisave can be easily drained especially on chronic illnesses , which can tote up to a huge amount .
Furthermore , women of older generation in Singapore had particularly low average incomes because they received lesser education .
As a result , the amount of money in their Medisave will be very limited .
Moreover , most of the aged Singaporeans are not insured by anything else .
In essence , most of the old remains incapable to afford their medical expenses despite with the help of Medisave .
Next , HDB housing policy is only feasible for family that values filial piety .
According to Mr . Gerard Ee , chairman of Council for Third Age , it is progressively common for younger generation to abandon their aged parents .
Besides , for couples who purchase a house near their parents , they may not have time due to hectic work schedule and family commitments .
Thus , staying near their aging parents does not equate to giving them the desired emotional support .
In additional , elderly will need friends to talk to and at the same time to accompany them .
In this way , it can keep them socially active thus , feeling valued .
Lastly , the policy on Maintenance of Parents Act remains highly ineffective to seek children to support their parents for four different groups .
First , the sandwiched generation that is expected to take care of their children and their aging parents and on top of that to manage the increasing standard of living .
Hence , the breadwinners would find it difficult to cope with their own needs and support their growing children and aging parents .
Second , majority of the aging parent is not willing to resort to the law to receive financial maintenance because they do not want to further strain the relationship with their children .
Next , the law is not applicable for children who are overseas and their aging parents are all alone here .
Finally , a large family when merely one child takes the main bulk of care giving duties of their aged parents .
In brief , the current Maintenance of Parents Act alone is not sufficient to help the elderly to be financially dependent .
All in all , the current policies benefit minority of the aging population .
Most of the elderly still remains vulnerable to the aging process and improvements can be made to create a less painful process .
For instance , government can lighten the aged burden of medical expenses by subsidizing one of the visits to the polyclinic for an amount up to a hundred dollar every six months .
In any case , for any policies to be effective , government have to continuously revise them by analyzing the current situation and making adjustments to the policies accordingly .
Government must not forget to consider whether they are putting too heavy a burden on the current generation .
To summarize , a balance must strike between responsibility of individual , government and their family members .
Populations in many developed nations are facing a demographic time bomb in the form of an ageing population , and Singapore is no exception .
This is largely due to the fact that Singapore encountered a baby boom between 1947 and 1964 and thereafter , people started to have fewer children .
The baby boomers are generally better educated , richer and healthier as they were the beneficiaries of a developing education system and the predecessors of industrialization and the primary contributors of Singapore's economic growth .
Hence , they enjoy a longer life span which resulted in a demographic shift in Singapore today .
A phenomenon as such would have repercussions on the economy and society .
Therefore , the government plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges of an ageing population through implementing programs which involve expenditure by the government .
Such expenditure is known as public spending .
However , as Singapore aims to be a world-class city , the government should not only focus its expenditure on the aged but also on other areas of development such as development projects and education .
Public spending on the aged should be limited in terms of healthcare and eldercare services , housing and accessibility .
Firstly , it is important for the government to finance healthcare and eldercare services as it is inevitable that people fall ill and frail as they get older .
By 2030 , one in five Singaporean residents will be aged 65 years and above .
Thus , the government should seek to construct more healthcare and eldercare facilities as the current number of healthcare institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes may be insufficient to cater to the increasing needs of the population .
With an increase in healthcare facilities , the government has to ensure that there are sufficient skilled healthcare service providers through implementing training programs and introduce incentives to attract skilled foreign labour .
Secondly , the government should execute schemes and regulations to ensure that housing is affordable for the elderly .
In the United States , sharp increases in the housing costs fueled by rising urban land prices have created difficulties for the elderly to afford housing and this resulted in an increase in the number of homeless .
Thirdly , the government should construct elder-friendly facilities such as lifts in every HDB flat to restrict hindered access from homes to public amenities , communal and recreational facilities for the aged .

Preparing for an ageing population - the Singapore experience .
15th September , 2009 , from {w .nus .edu .sg/nec/InnoAge/documents/AARPjournalwinter09_PMLee .pdf}
Even though it is essential for the government to allocate public spending on the aged since the effects of the ageing population will impact the national economy and society , unlimited funding on the aged may have negative implications on the economy .
By 2030 , the number of elderly in Singapore will increase to 18 .7% and the number of working persons supporting one elderly person will decrease to 3 .5 persons .
These statistics have proven that population aging is enduring and this mean that tackling the challenges that come along with it is a long term process for the government and government spending on the aged will continue to increase .
Hence , unlimited funding instead of proper allocation of public spending on the aged may drain the economy .
Since a primary source of revenue for public spending comes from taxation , the government will have to increase the tax rates in order to finance its unlimited spending on the ageing population .
This may lead to unhappiness in and weariness of the working population especially given that the number of working persons supporting an elderly has decreased .
High levels of taxation may also lead to a decrease in domestic and foreign investments .
Unlimited funding may discourage people from staying employed and accumulating savings to see them through their old age as they may have the tendency to rely on the benefits provided by the government .
Unemployment will cause the workforce to shrink and result in an economic slowdown .
Therefore , it is important for the government to develop policies like the Central Provident Fund Scheme that help the government to limit spending and assist the elderly to be self sufficient at the same time .
As the only natural resource available in Singapore is people , human capital is crucial to the survival and progress of the nation .
Hence , the Singapore government should be far-sighted to see the value of education and should set aside funds to continue investing in it .
In order to have a well-trained workforce to cope with the knowledge-base driven economy of the 21st century , the government has to pump in more funds to ensure that the people are receiving a more all-rounded education through introducing more extensively planned academic programs , building more educational institutions and hiring and training more educators .
The Singapore government has unveiled in its 2001 concept plan that the vision for Singapore in the 21st century is to become a thriving world-class city .
In order to become a world-class city , the government has to pump in funds to rejuvenate and upgrade existing areas for living and working , creating more recreational spaces and continue to develop the commercial and industrial sectors .
A world-class city also means that the nation should be safe and secure .
Thus , the government also has to invest in research and development of defense technology which can deter small and vulnerable Singapore from any potential invasion .
As evident , the government has to handle many areas of concerns with regards to developing the nation into a world-class city .
Therefore , the government may require several years and a huge amount of public spending to achieve the vision of becoming a world-class city .
The challenges that come along with an ageing population are unavoidable and Singapore has to make preparations now to confront them .
Even though the government has implemented measures such as the CPF scheme and building of more healthcare institutions , more remains to be done .
As the pace of population ageing increases with time , the issues may become more complex because of the changing expectations and preferences of the population .
With a demand of higher standard of living , the government may have to divert more public spending to look after the increasing needs of the aged .
However , as the government also needs to focus public spending on other areas of developments , the government can look into adopting an integrated approach which urge better cooperation between key agencies and emphasize the need for community support .
Everyone has a responsibility to assist seniors living among us and people need to change their mindset that the elderly are a burden to the society where in actual fact , the elderly are the knowledgeable and experienced resources of the society .

Committee on Ageing Issues , Report on the ageing population .
September 15rd , 2009 , from w .mcys .gov .sg/successful_ageing/report/CAI_report .pdf
According to UN  the number of elderly people has tripled in the past 50 years and will continue to rise in the near future .
In developed countries , the median age rose from 29 .0 in 1950 to 37 .3 in 2000 , and is forecasted to increase to 45 .5 by 2050 .
Declining fertility , along with longer life expectancy , attributes to an aging population .
In order to cope with the rising numbers of elderly , the government has increased public spending on health care programs and subsidiaries .
Although an aging population is a global phenomenon , public spending should also be allocated in other areas of the country's development such as tourism or housing to help increase economic growth , to make Singapore a global city .
One of the major problems the elderly face today is the lack of financial security .
Singapore is not a welfare state unlike countries such as America and the United Kingdom .
Elderly who were not able to save enough will face the problem of making ends meet when they are old .
Furthermore , global inflation and rising medical costs will add to their financial burden .
Thus , their only solution is to turn to government for assistance .
The Singapore government has recently introduced a new CPF policy which provides lifelong income for the elderly , instead of the current policy where payouts only last about 20 years .
However , such programs are a burden on the country's budget .
Tourism is an important aspect that Singapore could further dispense its budget on .
According to the Singapore Tourism Board , in 2006 , Singapore achieved a record of 9 .7 million visitors , compared to 8 .9 million in 2005 .
An estimated sum of $12 .4 billion was spent .
Singapore hopes to achieve a record of 17 million visitors by the year 2015 .
With such high volume of tourists , more hotel rooms are required to accommodate them .
Strong competition from the region also requires Singapore to be unique from its neighbouring countries .
With no natural attractions and little resources , Singapore has no choice but to create man-made attractions such as resorts and casinos , or coming up with attractions that is only attractive to foreigners .
Such attractions require large amounts of money .
However , the benefits outweighs the negatives as it helps to create more jobs and attract foreign investors to invest in its thriving tourism which will help boost the country's GDP .
Education is also a very important development in a Global City .
The lack of education is one of the problems that elderly face in today society , thus leading to poor financial management .
As Singapore is small and doesn't have any natural resources , it is shaping its economy into a knowledge-based economy .
In order to achieve such goals , more resources should be pumped into the education system , such as providing additional funds to needy students , which allows them to break out of their poverty cycle; improving the infrastructures of schools and universities; and recruiting more teachers .
With a better education system , it allows Singaporeans to enter the workforce with better skills and increases their employability , thus preventing the problems that current elderly are facing now .
Housing is also another major issue that Singapore faces .
Singapore currently has a population of slightly more than 4 million people .
The average population density is about 6814 per km  , thus it is one of the most crowded cities in the world .
To cope with the increasing population , more high-rise residential buildings known as HDB flats are built .
These flats are heavily subsidised by the government to make it affordable .
More money should be invested in older flats , such as providing upgrades to the current facilities to improve the quality of life of citizens living in such areas .
Public spending on the elderly should not be removed .
However the government may have to consider limiting it .
Without limiting , it will cause over dependence on the government , worsening the current situation in the near future .
If public spending is allocated on areas such as housing , education and tourism , the new generation will be more financially secure than their parents .
It will also help Singaporeans to stay ahead and be competitive in terms of employability and marketability , furthermore contributing to the country's GDP growth which helps in the overall country development in the long term .
In 2007 , one of Financial Times's reporters once mentioned that with the low fertility rate and an increased in life expectancy , Singapore would soon have only 2 .2 workers to support each elderly person .
With such a low number of working adults to support the elderly , there would be a need for the government to at least remain at its current expenditure on the aged .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be overly limited .
Though public spending should be used fully on the aged , there are other areas of concern that the government money should divert to , such as the healthcare system .
Recently , Singapore Prime Minister , Mr Lee Hsein Loong , had stressed the need for step down care system during his National Day Rally Speech for the nation's 44th birthday .
The step-down care system requires Singapore acute hospital to link with community hospitals , this , in turn , will enable long term illness patient to enjoy a suitable care while saving money on hospital fees .
As the community hospitals charge less .
However , Singapore should not make use of budget for the aged to improvise other areas .
This is because Singapore will be suffering from aging population by the time it reaches year 2030 .
If public spending for the aged is not well utilised for the next few years , Singapore will be having problems when the time comes .
Though government had encouraged children in fulfilling filial obligations of taking care of their parents , with their own family to take care of , children of these elderly would not be able to bare the financial burden .
This further emphasizes the need for a helping hand .
For the past decades , Singapore government had been emphasizing the value of self reliance on its citizen despite the economic ups and downs .
Policies , such as the Central Provident Fund  , had been implemented to ensure that Singaporeans are able to support themselves after retirement .
However , recently , many found that the amount is insufficient to keep up with the rising cost of medical fees , resulting in the use of the children's CPF account .
Currently , the common age group of children , whose parents are elderly , are in their late 40s or early 50s , and it is common that the children's CPF account is emptied because of the hefty medical bills .
If this vicious cycle continues , the future generation will suffer .
An extreme example would be the grandfather uses and depletes the CPF account of the parents , and when the children grow and their parents suffer from long term illness , such as diabetes , they may use their CPF account if they do not have sufficient cash on-hand .
Therefore , the government should not limit their public spending on the aged .
In the above paragraph , the vicious cycle occurs when the elderly depends on her children but what will happen to the elderly if the children refuse to fulfil their filial obligations .
As a matter of fact , these old folks will be left on their own , with the support from welfare organisations .
However , for most cases , welfare organisations can only help to the extent of getting daily necessities for them .
When it comes to financial assistance , the welfare organisation , too , will have difficulty in helping the elderly .
This is because donations from publics are used to support the basic daily operations of these organizations , thus leaving little or nothing to help these old folks financially .
This , therefore , requires a further assistance from their next supporting pillar: the government .
Though decades of self-reliance had taught Singaporeans to stand firm and learnt to support themselves and their family solely , now they can no longer do so .
With the rising cost of medical facilities , elderly with the supports of their children could longer rely on their own CPF accounts and their children income to pay the fees .
If such scenarios are already occurring to those elderly with family , the situation would be worse for old folks who have no one to turn to except for the government .
If the government refuses to help these people who had once contributed to the country , who can they rely ?
Therefore , even if public spending is required in other areas , public spending on the aged should not be limited .

However , the alleviation of ageing process is putting a strain on users' pockets financially even though the introduction of the facilities benefits them in term of comfort and convenience .
To illustrate , although the Lift Upgrading Programme  that is introduced in Singapore is heavily subsidised by the government and the Town Councils , the beneficiaries are still required to pay a large sum in order to enjoy the benefits .
The maximum amount which the flat owners have to pay is capped at $3 ,000  , and this amount is not a diminutive amount .
Although the residents have to pay to enjoy the benefits of convenience , the amount of benefits enjoyed by the residents are definitely more than the value that they have to fork out , in terms of long-term usage .
Seeing that , the policies or acts that were implemented under Building Construction Authority  and Housing Development Board  have improved the standard of living for the people .
The BCA states that "a $40-million Accessibility Fund had been set aside to upgrade buildings built before 1990 .
This fund is also used to upgrade all key areas and essential facilities in Singapore to provide at least essential accessibility by 2011"  .
Under this scheme , the LUP is introduced and it is designed to improve the flat's access and personal convenience by the Singapore government in 2001  .
Since lifts in HDB blocks that were built before 1990 are not providing 100% access to every level , any existing building under Housing Development Board  will be altered and added with lifts that stop at every floor .
This change has made a significant change to the residents , especially elders who are physically weak .
Thus , there will be no need for them to climb the staircase which they might have the tendency to fall when using it .
Other than the LUP , Singapore government has also inputted public ramps to ease elders from climbing the stairs under the same scheme .
These strategies have aided in easing the ageing process effectively .
To give an example , The Straits Times on 31 August 2009 , reported that two new ramps , a covered shelter connecting the 20-year-old station to the nearest bus stop in Yishun Avenue 2 , as well as an additional drop-off point have been constructed for the elderly residents living at Nee Soon South , where it housed approximately 50 ,000 elderly residents  .
Hence , the government policies with regard to architecture have helped to ease the ageing process effectively .
On the contrary , with the alteration made to the flats , the elders might rely too much on the lifts rather than using the staircase which could be the only form of exercises for them .
Thus , the convenience might unintentionally exacerbate the health of one being due to the lack of exercises .
Due to the fact that negative effects occur when one is too dependent on the usage of facilities , the town council has solved this problem by building Fitness Parks for elders to exercise to maintain a healthy body .
Moreover , the elders would have a more conducive place for them to do exercises as well as to treat it as a place for gathering .
Hence , the government policies with regard to architecture have helped to ease the ageing process effectively .
To summarize , even though there are some disadvantages pertaining to cost and indirect negative effects , it is definitely beneficial for the elders and disabled to a huge extent .
Thus , it is important to keep improving our current research on technological inventions and government policies on architecture that have helped to ease the ageing process , as the benefits are definitely worth the cost .
As many believe health is wealth , if spending a little more could give the elders a healthy lifestyle , everything is worthwhile .

Illnesses Of The Elderly - 4 Most Common Ailments Affecting The Elderly {ezinearticles .com/ ?Illnesses-Of-The-Elderly-4-Most-Common-Ailments-Affecting-The-Elderly&id=1662832}
Over the past few decades the pace of evolution of technological advances has increased significantly .
At the same time , the aging trend somehow seemed to have caught up with it .
The post war baby-boom generation is now starting to age , due to advancement in medical science and increased standards of living .
The average life expectancy has also increased , meaning that the elderly population will form a majority of the population mix .
More emphasis will have to be placed to catering to the needs of the elderly , so that they can transit into the aging phase more easily .
Thanks to modern research and development , the aging process has been made lesser painful not only to the elderly , but to the societies as well .
As a person age , physical changes in one's body occurs and their functions degrade with time .
Traits such as one's mobility , as well as visibility will be significantly reduced as compared to their younger days .
The chances of injury increases with age , as proven by statistics .
It was observed that more than one third of the elderly falls each year , and the chances of falling increases proportionately with age , and that three quarters of elderly falls were caused by "non-elderly friendly" design flaws of buildings .
If this trend were to carry on , national budgets and economies will come under pressure , as a large sum of money will have to be spent taking care of the elderly .
As a result some government campaigns might have to be delayed or even cancelled due to shortage of funds .
Therefore , a prevention measure , in the form of upgrading public facilities is implemented to prevent this from happening .
One way is through advancement in technology .
Technology has always been beneficial to man .
With each passing day , technology evolves and moulds new inventions which can make life better , and easier .
Technological inventions can help the elderly overcome the limitations of their body due to old age or sickness , and in a way , prevent accidents from happening due to these limitations .
This can be achieved through introduction of inventions such as steps-free buses , which helped ease the difficulty of elderly climbing up the steps of the bus .
Other inventions such as slip proof tiles and solvents can effectively cut down the possibility of falls due to slippery surfaces .
We are living in a concrete jungle , and as the population ages , the design of the structure has to evolve accordingly so as to cater to the needs of the people staying in it .
Architectural design with elderly friendly considerations will be crucial so that the chances of an injury in their homes will be kept to a minimal .
As stated earlier , proven through statistics , three quarters of elderly falls were caused by "non- elderly friendly" design flaws of buildings .
A series of upgrades are therefore implemented , in countries like Singapore and The United Kingdom , engaged in the 'UP' project .
In this project , buildings are being modified so that the lifts can stop at every level of the building .
By doing so , it effectively reduced the chances of the elderly having to use the stairs .
There were also observed increase in usage of slip free tiles in wet markets , a place frequented by the elderly .
Distress warning devices were also installed at every elderly home unit to ensure that they have a channel to call for help in event of trouble .
Although it might seem a feasible and effective way to cut down injury rate and therefore rising medical costs which will take the load off the national budget , it might do more harm to the economy than good as the government will have to spend more money investing into the installation of all these facilities to make it more "elderly friendly" .
The cost might even exceed the amount spent treating the elderly .
That will mean that in comparison , even more money and resources will have to be taken from the national budget to spend on upgrading of facilities rather than for the country's economical development .
However , these are long term investments and the advantages will surface as time goes by .
Furthermore , people , being a country's most valuable asset who has once contributed to the economy during their prime , should be entitled to all these inventions which will make their age transition less painful .
In a way its a form of 'paying back' by the government for their contributions to the country's development over the past few decades .
Aging , is an inevitable process which every man has to face .
We cannot stop aging from happening , but through modern research and development , which brought about the introduction of inventions and new architectural designs to cater to the elderly , the aging process has been made lesser painful to them .
As the world develops , progresses in medical science as well as other fields have enabled the human race to make suitable changes .
These changes allow us to fight diseases , as well as make improvements in the quality of life .
The main objective of this report is to discuss and analyze the extent to which these various factors have helped ease the aging process .

Firstly , social policy has helped to ease the aging process as the financial burden of the aged has been reduced to ensure that all needy elderly patients are able to afford and receive basic treatments .
This is achieved when the Ministry of Health  put forth a sum of money in the way of Medifund Silver so that it can serve as the last resort for those who still cannot afford the medical fee despite the subsidies that were offered by the government or other charitable organizations .
Thus , most elderly will be able to stay physically healthier when they are able to receive professional treatment and medication which may be easier for them to take care of themselves in their old age .
Secondly , the "togetherness" between family members can reduce the painful aging process .
The concept of family has changed over the past few decades .
Many young married couples prefer to move out from their parents' place and start a small family on their own .
As children move out of their parents' residence , the aged parents have no chance or little time to see their children .
This change often brings upon the concept of being "abandoned" by their children .
This need has been met when the Housing and Development Board  introduced a scheme known as the "Married Child Priority Scheme " .
This scheme allows the married child to be given the priority in the balloting application with the condition that the flat they are applying is within 2 kilometers of their parents' residence .
Thus , children are staying near to their aged parents , bringing stability to their emotions .
Thirdly , the relief of the aging process can be established through family obligation .
This is achieved as people are encouraged or compelled by the law to carry out their duty as offsprings .
The Family Court of Singapore has established laws to ensure that an adult child has put forth effort to support their own parents through informal and familial channels , for example: Parents Maintenance Act .
Thus , this gives a form of security to the elderly that they are loved by their children .
The strategies implemented might be successful; however , the painful process of aging is still inevitable unless the country can understand the inner world of the elderly .
Thus , we have to analyze and understand the problems that have been forgotten or overlooked by the developed country .
The change in the research and development of the country is so rapid that the elderly finds it difficult to catch up with the changes around us .
The world has become so IT savvy that almost all trades require employees to be equipped with IT skills .
As a result , the elderly are often rejected when searching for a job due to their inadequate skill set .
Thus , this gives an impression to the old aged that they are redundant and useless in the society .
Low self-esteem grew in the hearts of the elderly can cause psychological instability , especially when they were the head of the family in the past .
This drastic change has caused the elderly to be unable to keep up with the pace of the society .
Equipping of skills can be done with the support of the government by encouraging the elderly to take up courses at an affordable price .
Therefore , it enables the elderly to make use of the skills learnt to join the workforce , enabling them to increase their esteem level .
In a developed country like Singapore , an aging population often brings about multiple problems .
Before any decision can be made , leaders must understand the needs of the elderly .
At the same time , they should go beyond the realistic need of the elderly and provide more in-depth solutions to meet the needs of the elderly .

The government should not limit the amount spent on the aged because this problem is becoming more and more prevalent in Singapore .
An ageing population or what has been coined the "silver tsunami" is a phenomena faced by developed countries around the globe and Singapore is no exception .
Currently , one in 12 of the population is above 65 , but this has been projected to hit one in five by 2030 .  .
Factors such as improvements in sanitation , medical technology , and public health awareness have raised the life expectancy of Singaporeans , resulting in an ageing population in Singapore .
The challenge of an aging situation will cause social issues such as the shrinking workforce to be faced with an increasing burden of supporting the elderly .
In 2000 , one elderly person was supported by 9 .8 working persons .
This will decrease to 3 .5 working persons per elderly person by the year 2030  .
This sharp reduction in labour growth is expected to cause average GDP expansion to slow to 3 .9 per cent between 2006 and 2030 , down from 6 .9 per cent from 1981 to 2005 .
Thus it is crucial to solve the issue of an aging population as it has a domino effect on the social and economic aspects of the society .

The sources of public spending in Singapore come mainly from taxes .
These taxes include personal and corporate income tax , goods and services tax and property tax .
We have to balance these resources with other areas of Singapore's development too: transportation , education , and defence in an effort to spur the growth of the economy .
Secondly , there is lack of healthcare professionals and facilities to cater to the needs of the elderly .
The difficult part is attracting the right people who are both competent and professional .
There is a current shortage of doctors in Singapore .
The current doctor to patient ratio is 1:620 and the nurse to population ratio is 1:210  .
There is a lack of healthcare workers in specialized fields relating to elder care especially in the area of palliative care .
According to Dr Cynthia Goh , head of palliative medicine at the National Cancer Centre of Singapore , it is estimated that about "65 per cent of the population will need hospice in the future , up from the current 20 per cent ."
.
There is also a severe shortage of hospital beds , with a long average waiting time of four to eight hours needed for admission to the hospital .
To resolve this issue , Singapore has resorted to set aside $500 million to help hospitals recruit and train nurses , doctors and allied health-care professionals including physiotherapists , occupational therapists and pharmacists .
To retain and attract talents , the government can also raise the profile of the public sector healthcare industry through increased media and promotional efforts .
Two new hospitals including the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and the Jurong General Hospital are also on the way to provide more hospital beds for the aged .
However , Member of Parliament Paulin Tay-Straughan was quoted in the local media saying that the increasing healthcare costs could eventually cause a major strain on the government's resources .
"If  don't have adequate coverage , there will be a tremendous strain on subsidized care which will drain revenues from the state ," she said .
Long-term care is expensive and begets the issue of who pays for the care .
Even if the government were to invest heavily in the aging problem , the government will not reap any rewards and more money will have to be allocated to this sector .
Money will not resolve this issue and the government will have to seek other non-monetary means of resolving this problem .
The various issues regarding an aging population as laid out in this essay are serious problems faced by most developed countries around the world .
It is unlikely that reforms can eliminate the problems entirely , but they may serve to lessen the impact of these trends .

"Aging does not denote a process at all , but merely describes a medley of unhappy outcomes ," claims Richard A Posner  .
These unhappy events will involve the deterioration of the health as well as the occurrence of mental and physical disturbance .
But of course , it is not responsible for anyone to say that the older generations should be taking care of themselves and not bother others isn't it ?
Furthermore , it can be argued that research and development policies have relieved the aging process in a very successful way .
The development of medicine in this era has shown its capabilities to ease the aging process .
In the ancient times , the development of medicine was so superficial that many did not get to live their old age because they died of lethal diseases such as leukemia .
But with the development of medicine from the East or West , people can not only live to their old age , but to live their old age in a more comfortable way as well .
For example , Anti-Ageing in western medicine involves specific and detailed analysis of blood , urine and saliva to ascertain the level of hormonal imbalance and cellular damage caused by ageing and Traditional Chinese Medicine acts as a complementary treatment to western anti-ageing medicine which includes acupuncture .
Therefore , the combination of both sides has helped ageing process to be at ease .
In today's society , people are particular about their physical appearance .
The first impression is important as it determines how others perceive the person to be .
As the baby boomers are now approaching their senior years , there is an obsession for youth of beauty .
Therefore , to a large extent , current research and development have helped to slow down the aging process .
The negative effects of aging are major problems which the aging population is facing As people get older , it becomes more difficult for them to complete their daily task due to the loss of muscles and strength and health problems such as diabetes , cancer and dementia are commonly found .
Therefore , scientists and researchers have conducted experiments to identify solutions to ease the aging process .
Research has shown that reducing the calorie intake can decrease the negative effects of aging .
This is because it helps to reduce damages on vital cells and tissues which are crucial in prolonging the lifespan of a person .
Thus , illness such as heart disease , cancer and diabetes and other disease can be prevented .
Christiaan Leeuwenburgh , Ph .D . , an associate professor of aging and geriatric research at the UF College of Medicine stated that with lower calorie intake and moderate exercise program , significant signs of dysfunction in the aging process are found in key organ such as the liver  .
Thus , with the results from experiments and researches , it would be beneficial to ease the aging process .
However , the mind plays an important role in controlling the beliefs and thinking of an individual which helps to ease the aging process .
It is amazing to see a sixty year old woman exercising at a gym and dressing like a fourty year old working adult .
If the person holds thoughts that they are old and incapable of achieving great things , then she will succumb to the negative effects of aging .
However , if the person maintains a positive attitude and live a healthy lifestyle , the aging process could be slowed down .
For example , if the person suffers from back pain , instead of lamenting on it , she needs to change her mindset and tell herself what she can do to improve on this weakness .
This would enable the person to regain its youthful lifestyle .
Therefore , this shows that research and development and policies are not the only factors that reduce the aging process , the mindset and attitude of a person is also a contributing factor which delays the aging process .
As people age , some of them are unsatisfied with their appearance .
Fine lines would gradually appear on their eyelids , foreheads and mouth .
As a result , they feel inferior and have low self-esteem .
With technological innovation , there are many types of equipment in the market which help to reduce the aging process .
For example , the invention of laser technology aids in the removal of wrinkles in areas such as the eyelids , foreheads and mouth .
After receiving approximately four to six sessions , visible results can be seen .
Besides , the creation of nano liposome technology enables active ingredients to penetrate the skin and deliver the vital nutrients more efficiently .
According to John Kressaty  , the head chemist at 3Lab ,Inc who was in charge of the product h" Serum , an age defying booster , supported that clinical studies has shown with the use of this technology , there was a fifty percent reduction in the depth of the wrinkles after using the product for four weeks .
Therefore , technology has played a vital role to eliminate or slow down the negative effects of aging .
In conclusion , with the increase in aging population , the aging process will bring about adverse effects on the quality of life .
This issue cannot be avoided .
However , with the help of current research and development , the aging process can be slowed down through technological innovation and new discoveries made by researchers and scientists .

A declining rate of population and a longer life expectancy results in an aging population , causing a high dependency ratio in some countries .
This creates further problems such as a less efficient economy and a rise in public expenditure to meet the increasing needs of the elderly .
Hence , solutions have been suggested to reduce the heavier burden of the young in future , and one of the solutions proposed is to limit public spending on the aged .
The idea that public spending on the aged should be limited so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development is feasible as these developments may actually help to gain greater benefits for the aged .
However , it should be noted that the limitation should not be too much till the extent that the aged are neglected and are not being provided with the basic needs of living .
The aged are citizens of the country and they deserve the necessary welfare rights .
The general perception is that over public spending on the aged would lead to over-dependency of them on the government .
Hence the burden of costs would hinder the growth of the country's important developments , and one of which is the economy of the country .
In Singapore , the government pumped in huge sums of money to build the two Integrated Resorts and host the Grand Prix Formula One night race to promote tourism and investments , leading to an increase in revenue .
With this additional wealth in the economy , the government would then have the capability to have more choices to look after the aged , for instance , holding more welfare programmes .
However , diverting the resources to boost economic growth may not always result in a guaranteed protection of the welfare of the aged .
This is so as the wealth may not be distributed appropriately and furthermore , there is always uncertainty in investments and returns are not guaranteed .
For example , it was reported recently that the Singapore state-owned investment company , Temasek Holdings , has lost over $US4 billion on its investments in organisations such as Merrill Lynch .
Therefore , despite the benefits economic growth could bring to the elderly , it is still necessary to set aside a portion of the government spending for the elderly as a safeguard to protect their basic interests and not only to rely on the revenue earned to help the aged .
It is argued that development in the healthcare sector is important and this benefits the aged as well .
Investment in the healthcare sector could bring about new and more efficient medical technologies .
New cures of diseases may also be invented , like the Alzheimer's disease , which is a common illness among the elderly and it does not have an exact cure at present .
This would thus benefits the elderly who would require an increasing need for healthcare services .
Hence , it is perceived that public spending on the aged could be reduced and be switched to the healthcare sector in providing more quality medical services for all in the future .
However , we should not neglect that these new technologies come with high costs , and it is unlikely to benefit all elderly as many are not financially self-sufficient .
It is thus necessary for the government to subsidy healthcare costs in ensuring the availability and affordability of these services .
It is part of the government's responsibility to meet the basic needs and look after the well-being of the citizens .
Therefore , even though the aged could greatly benefit from the advancement of healthcare services , public spending on the aged still should not be limited to a large extent so as to ensure sufficient funds to maintain affordable healthcare costs for the elderly .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited as over- provision would cause over-reliance of the elderly and leads to an inefficient and low productive workforce and population .
The money could have been put into better uses by diverting to other productive developments to improve the country's economy and overall standard of living .
Yet it is also impossible for the government to limit the spending too much as the elderly should also be entitled to the basic rights and be provided with the basic necessities .
Too little provision may represent an increase in the social costs for the families of the aged and more difficult lives for the communities .
Adopting other solutions to reduce the effects of an aging population , such as extending the working lives of the elderly , may also require the government's spending to provide incentives for them to work longer .
It is thus important for the government to reach a balance and spend the public's money appropriately to have the optimal effects on the aged , population and the country's essential areas of development .

The trend of an aging population is becoming more common nowadays .
One of the main reasons for this situation may be a result of the post World War II baby boom and also the shift in women's role in the society .
As the post war babies age , coupled with the fact that many women are delaying marriage and having lesser children , the population of the elderly has become increasingly significant in proportion in the society of many developed countries today .
The problems pertaining to the process of aging are also becoming more prominent .
Today , with constant breakthrough in medical research and development as well as reassessment in the social policies , the aging process has been eased for many .
Nevertheless , a small portion of the aging population is still experiencing much difficulty in the process of aging .
In the field of medicine , new developments and technology have helped the aging population to improve their physical appearance as well as provide cures to their ailments .
Particularly in the field of aesthetic medicine , anti-aging procedures such as Botox injections and face-lifts are becoming more common and readily available to the aged .
The American Society of Plastic Surgeons  has reported that more than 6 .3 million women chose to have cosmetic plastic surgery in 2000 and there is an uphill trend over the years .
These procedures seemingly help to turn back the hands of time and stall the physical process of aging .
This is extremely helpful to the aging population and especially for women who are known to be more concern about their outward appearance .
The improvements in appearance may relief the emotional stress of aging and gain further access to many opportunities .
However , these aesthetic procedures are costly and usually not subsidised by the government .
Generally , the improvement of their outward appearance through the means of plastic surgery would be exclusive to only those who can afford it .
Therefore , only a limited number of the aged will benefit from these new developments in aesthetic medicine .
Nonetheless as time pass , new technologies are constantly being introduced and the prices of relatively older aesthetic procedures will eventually become more affordable to the majority of the aging population .
Thus , current developments in aesthetic medicine can greatly help to ease the physical process of aging .
As demographic shifts take place and the aging population grows , social policy reforms are required to cater to the problems which arise in the aging process .
In Singapore , the government has reassessed the ElderShield policy in year 2007 .
According to Singapore's Ministry of Health , the policy is an affordable severe disability insurance scheme which provides basic financial to those who require long-term care during old age .
Singapore citizens and permanent residents are covered by the scheme at the age of 40 .
The recent ElderShield policy together with previous policies such as the comprehensive social security saving scheme , Central Provident Fund  , provides a basis of financial support for the aged .
As the population age , it is more difficult for them to work as efficiently as before and their market value also falls .
In addition , the elderly are more likely to suffer from health issues and incur high medical cost .
Therefore , it is important for them to build up a financial reserve to support themselves in their aging process .
Despite the introduction of these policies , there are still some elderly who are excluded in these schemes .
Some elderly women have remained a housewife for decades and they have not worked in the workforce before thus there is no contribution to her CPF account .
In this case , it is dependent on oneself to save from the money she receives to support her in the future .
This is especially true for those who do odd jobs where the employers do not help to contribute to their CPF account .
Although the current social policies can help to build up the financial capability of the aging population and make their aging process easier , there remain a group unprotected .
Nonetheless , the government has also introduced the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly  , a government assistance scheme providing financial help to needy and disabled elderly Singaporeans , who are not eligible for ElderShield because of their age or pre-existing disabilities .
The government also recognize the heavy cost of elderly patients who require immediate and long-term care  services as they are admitted for a long period of time .
Thus , government subsidies are given based on the patient's eligibility and financial status .
Therefore , the different social policies are introduced to complement one another so as to ensure the entire aging population receives a form of financial support when they are in need .
As such , it is possibly true to say that the current social policies can indeed help to ease the aging process to a large degree .
In conclusion , the aging process is indeed one that is difficult to cope with but with the current medical technologies and a wide range of social policies and reforms the elderly are more protected .
The policies intends to cater to benefit as many aged as possible and thus it is possibly true to say that the technologies and the policies have helped the majority of aging population to cope with their problems more effectively today .
Having the fastest demographic change , but by applying the sensible planning and policies , currently , Singapore's CPF achieves the highest exposure than any other retirement plan in Asia and adds from 16 .3 to 30 .4% to Gross National savings rate .
Alleviating the aging structure , the contributions to these savings are deductible in Singapore as the Governments aim to basic needs and medical expenses security and stability for aging population .
Therefore , Singaporean citizens will be more sensibly confident and well prepared for their old age when they have financial guarantee for retirement years .
However , more effort need to be put into strategic planning for bridging the retirement saving gaps as this , basically , is a method of short-term saving on one generation perspective only .
The debates on this national strategy also lie on the ownership of the money raised in this government programme and the incorporation from a part of employees and employers .
Additionally , the income differentiations , low level of commitment from individuals and lack of awareness from a certain number of populations can be the main obstacles to the achievability of the policy .
Together with improvement from financial security , more effort is needed to put in living arrangements , health care and employability to ensure a better living condition for the elderly .
All in all , the result of retirement saving scheme is acceptable in the society as a whole and it is an undeniably necessary step we need to make to cope up with the burden from speedily aging population .
Singapore has a low population and a transparent administration in compared to other Asian countries to attain high workability from this programme and hopefully , it can reach the higher level of living condition when the health care and employability policies are implemented .
In this modern world we live in , a country cannot develop without considering the aspect of globalization .
The main aim for almost all countries is attaining economic stability and progress .
We do not deny that the elderly have their values .
However , we have to be realistic and accept the fact that the elderly have very little contributions in terms of economy as they are not able to join the work force as they are too old to work .
Therefore , we emphasize that public spending on the elderly is not totally absent but limited .
With globalization , countries are now more integrated .
Hence , we can achieve economic growth through investments in other countries; especially highly developed ones such as China and India .
For example , Singapore has limited resources and land area , thus in order to expand their economy , more overseas investments are needed .
Also , this increased integration would also mean people are able to travel between countries more easily , bringing about tourism which is a highly profitable and marketable economy sector , therefore the need for public spending on hotels , recreational facilities , and etc .
As globalization becomes more widespread , countries are exposed to tougher and higher levels of competition as can be seen by multi national companies moving to low labour cost countries like China .
Being a country highly dependent on the foreign market and MNCs , Singapore has a need for better skilled workers in the future as competition is bound to reach more advanced levels .
In order to do so , education plays an important role .
Hence , there is a need for public spending on it in terms of better training for teachers , better school facilities such as advanced technological equipments and schemes for an all rounded curriculum .
However , public spending for education does not only have to be for the young .
The elderly can also be educated on how to take better care of themselves , reducing their dependency on the society and help them ease the aging process .
People today are less willing to have children , which resulted in low birth rate .
There is a need for government to spend on "baby boomer" campaigns .
For instance , Singapore government came up with a Baby Bonus scheme to supports working adults' decision to have more children by helping to lighten their financial costs of raising children .
According to the Baby Bonus scheme  , "A cash gift of up to $4 ,000 each for the 1st and 2nd child and $6 ,000 each for the 3rd and 4th child .
All children born on or after 17 August 2008 will also enjoy government contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar matching for the amount of savings contribute to the child's Children Development Account " .
Currently , these policies are not working as well as the government's expectations , seeing that the future generation in an ageing population is essential , public spending would be needed to intensify these campaigns so as to improve its efficiency .
However , there is of course a need to have a certain amount of spending on the elderly .
The problems of the elderly these days are issues of abandonment .
Hence what we can do is to spend on campaigns which emphasize on the social value of the elderly .
With their experiences and stories , by sharing them with the society , humanity is implemented into people as they learn the hardships of the elderly in the process of bringing them up to the position they are in presently .
Thus , these elderly campaigns encourage three generation families living together , solving problems of abandonment .
In addition , working adults are now more willing to procreate with elderly acting as babysitters for them , so that they could concentrate fully on their job , moving in tandem with the "baby boomers" campaign .
Regarding issues of elderly illnesses and recreation , there are actually adequate facilities for them .
For example , Singapore has a well connected system of foster homes and hospices providing elderly with a comfortable environment in preparing them for the afterlife .
Furthermore , community activities are well planned with many interesting ones to accommodate their interests .
However , if any spending were to be done regarding this aspect , it could be spent on promoting the establishment of more non-profit organizations volunteering and holding charity events to help ease the elderly problems .
In conclusion I would like to reiterate the point that we do admit that the elderly are assets to the society .
Should any spending be done , it would be to hold campaigns to promote elderly importance so as to reduce abandonment , or promoting an increase in volunteering organizations , and improving foster homes and hospices should the facilities be inadequate .
Ultimately , we have to be realistic in this global context and focus more of our spending on advancements in factors affecting the more pressing issue of economic stability and inter-country relations .
The impact of globalization on our society has been rewarding yet punishing .
With the availability of birth control methods and equal opportunities given to women in terms of education and in the workplace , the aging population is inevitable .
In addition , expenditure on a new born baby is extensive .
However , with the current economic growth , majority of the populations are educated and are able to support themselves throughout their golden years after retirement .
There is much concern due to the negative impact on the stable economy and society caused by a graying population .
What is therefore needed is a wise planning for limited yet sufficient public spending on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
According to the text "Doomsday Predications about Population Aging Are exaggerated" written by Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer , it mentioned that the population aged 65 to 75 is healthier , wealthier and better educated compared to those in past generations .
Due to the rapid economic growth , majority of the populations are earning enough for a living and are already having sufficient savings for old age .
This is commonly supported by substantial insurance policies and personal savings .
On average , the working population holds 5 to 6 insurance policies which is adequate for health and financial coverage .
On top of that , the government has implemented mandatory schemes like Central Provident Funds to ensure that all Singaporeans have sufficient amount of money for the later parts of their lives .
However , limitation on spending for the elderly will cause a sense of financial insecurity to the mass public as well as foreigners working in Singapore .
As Singapore is attracting foreign talent , such policy will affect its reputation due to the financial insecurity for retirement .
Moreover , Concern regarding personal saving for old age will arise .
The trepidation will be answered by the cutting on expenditure and discouragement of foreign talent residing here for retirement which decreases the return to the country's financial system .
Therefore , it affects and slows down the rapid growth of the economy .
On the other hand , without a limitation on the public spending for the aged , society will take it for granted that the government is responsible for taking care of the elderly .
In time to come , the burden will fall back on the working population through less direct and more expensive means; which is liable for higher taxes .
Instead , the society will face a wider range of issues related to education , housing and even transportation which creates a negative pressure on the economy of the nation .
Issue in regards to the graying population requires a balance effort from both the government and its citizens .
Educating the mass on the essential of financial stability in the far future is one of the solutions for cultivating a habit of saving among the mass .
Not only that , the majority of the population will understand the importance of saving and built up responsibility for oneself as well as their love ones .
There should be a substantial boundary in the financial and welfare support for the aging population .
The transitions and consequences will be easier if we are better prepared .
Human aging is known to be a continuous , complex and dynamic process where it will start with birth and end with death .
Everyone will eventually grow old and experience the effect of the aging process .
Even though it is a natural process , which every individual know that he or she will have to undergo , many still fear the process of aging and dying .
To minimize the fear among this increasing group of people , research and development in areas such as medicine and technology and social policies supported by the government have helped to a very large extent to ease the aging process , be it physically , emotionally or socially .
The development of anti-aging medicine such as anti-aging injections , special mineral waters and other products and services like hormones replacement has helped to slow down the fundamental process of human aging and prolong human life .
Anti-aging injections such as Botox is one of the anti-aging medicines that many elderly especially the older women are depending on as a solution for youth .
For most majorities , physical appearances are usually the first sign of aging; hence , look-conscious individuals turn to Botox when they want to retain their look or to look even better when they aged .
Hence , only when they look physically good , they will feel good emotionally as well .
Naturally , when they feel good , their self-esteem and level of confidence will gradually increase .
Therefore , this will lessen the feeling within them that aging is a helpless yet painful process .
However , not all people can afford this substantial amount of money to invest in such anti-aging medicines as it is more often than not , expensive .
Therefore , they might turn to counterfeit product that may even cause more harm to their body .
This will not pose as a threat as it can be overcome with strict regulation by the authorities on anti-aging medicines .
Besides the complexity amount of anti-aging medicine available in the market , the advanced technology has also helped to ease a generation into old age despite the fact that some elderly might not be able to accept these complex technologies .
From simple gadgets to complex computer system , marketers are developing almost everything to ensure that elderly do not face any difficulties in the transiting process .
For example , some luxury car company such as Lincoln offers night vision that projects an infrared image of the road within the car .
With such invention , failing eyesight will not be the reason to stop them from driving; therefore , they will not feel emotionally affected by inability to drive .
Elderly often perceive that old age is a barrier for them to continue doing things that they like because there is a big difference in them , physically .
However , this is not always true because technology can overcome some obstacles that they faced during the aging process .
For instances , at the Institute of Technology's AgeLab in Massachusetts , they invented shoes with battery-powered vibrating soles that will stimulate nerve to improve balance for the elderly .
As there are many other complications if an elderly were to fall down , such invention helps to prevent elderly from falling down .
Apart from depending on the invention of new anti-aging medicines and the development of new technologies , social policies catering to the welfare of the elderly are equally important in helping to ease the aging process .
According to Stansfeld  , loneliness , lack of social support and isolation are identifies as major risk factors that combined increase the risk of stressful life events in old age .
Therefore , policymakers need to implement new policies to ensure that elderly enjoy a happy yet productive life even when they age .
This is to minimize the emotional and social implications that old age will bring about .
Indeed , current research and development in areas like medicine and technology and the implementation of new social policies have helped to lessen the discomfort that the aging process will cause among the elderly to only a large extent .
However , it definitely cannot ease the aging process for the elderly totally as this process is still a natural process .
This can only be achieved when the elderly do not perceive themselves as suffering from old age .
Moreover , they need to adopt an attitude that refuses to succumb to the traditional stereotypes of them as the process of aging is controlled by one's belief thinking and system .
In additional , individual's effort like getting sufficient sleep and nutrition have to be put in to slow down the aging process physically and mentally .
In conclusion , the actual age does not inhibit one's ability to living life to the fullest .
With the right mind and attitude , one can easily and comfortably overcome the aging process especially with the aid of the latest medicine and technology available in the market as they played an important role in helping to ease the aging process .

Remember the old adage ," Take The Bull By The Horns" ?
This saying used in the ageing process implies that we must do everything in our power to look into the difficulties faced as we aged and grapple it .
This has been a vital issue globally because slowing down and easing the aging process can extend our life expectancy and live life at a more comfortable level .
To deal with such challenges , research and development as well as implementation of policies have come into the picture .
Over the years , research and development in all fields of study has been constantly changing and improving the life of older people .
Architectural aspect is one of the fields in research and development that plays an essential part for the aged .
In additional , social policies have also played a major part in solving the ageing process .
National policy implemented which provides special attention to the elderly has been ameliorating over time for the beneficial of the older people .
As the policy changes and the need for technologies increases , the elderly becomes increasingly reliant .
For instance , Central Providence Fund is a policy which helps people in saving for their retirement .
As a result , the elderly , who depends on the fund , would have the mindset of not saving up for emergency or the thought of having longer working period .
Thus , those elderly who have subsequently used up their funds will then seek for financial help .
Moreover , the policies or welfare schemes are only provided when necessary for cases which require specific attention .
In this case , not all elderly will be eased of their ageing process .
Furthermore , if the technologies which are inaugurated in the buildings become faulty , some of the elderly who are used to the devices will not leave their comfort zone .
This in turn , creates a less active lifestyle for them such as exercising and interacting with their neighbors , friends or family .
Even though research and development or policies in architecture aspects can cause unconstructive impacts , it still has its positive impacts in aiding the ageing process .
In countries like Japan , United States and Singapore , research and development has come up with technologies for the welfare of the aged .
In Singapore , some buildings such as the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple have installed the stair-climb device on the rail of the staircase to help the elderly to move from one storey to another easily .
Hence , there are other various devices developed that have helped to relieve the accessibility of the aged as they move from one place to another in the building .
On top of that , Singapore has also implemented policy for buildings such as the Barrier Free Accessibility Upgrading Program  .
In this program , the government has set aside $40 million into the Accessibility fund so as to encourage owners of the buildings to provide accessibility features in the existing or new buildings .
Therefore , by having accessibility features like ramps and accessible toilets help to minimize the problems faced by the aged .

I agree to a certain extent that current public spending on the aged should be limited so that this excess money could be used in other areas of the country's development .
The problem of an aging population has been a rising issue for most of the developed countries .
For instance , in Singapore , the number of people over the age of 65 will hit a high 19% by year 2030 . . Judging from the statistics , it shows that the elderly will form a relatively big portion of the country's population structure in the near future .
This implies that the impacts of the aging society will increase with time .
Therefore , it is important for these countries to tackle the situation before it reaches its peak .
But nonetheless , countries that are already dealing with the problem of aging population had identified the limitations of the policies that are implemented .
For example , in the context of Singapore , we have been holding pro-natalism campaigns since the 1980s , but there is still an insignificant rise in our replacement rate .
This indicates that perhaps the emphasis towards the investment of the country's revenue should be diverted to other area such as economy investments and improving the education system to further boost the rate of advancement of a country .
Firstly , public spending on the elderly should be limited and not be reduced .
But in additional , a pool of reserve funds should be available to cope with the rising aging population as well .
This is because the problem of an aging population affects the rate of development of a country on a long run .
And if this problem persists , it will gradually become a roadblock for the future advancement of a society .
As such , the country should still pay attention to the proper handling of the issue .
The approaches that countries usually adopt to solve the aging issue include the prolonging of working lives of the elderly and the provision of an array of welfare pension schemes for them .
Secondly , medical science has also come up with many types of anti-aging compact things called anti-aging drugs such as Deprenyl , one of the best anti-aging drugs currently available .
People will look younger and surprisingly , not just women but also men are now using the drugs .
Anyway , not all the drugs are good and cheap though so finding a suitable drug is a tough task to do .
Furthermore , the nutrition industry has also jumped in this battle against aging problem with milk and other products like quintessence that can help the aged from the depression of bone strength and the cells of the heart from damage like that benefit of milk thistle and many more .
As people , especially the youth , feel healthier , they will work harder and earn more money for their future life .
It would not only help the government to reduce the amount of money they have to spend on the welfare program for the elderly , but also provide the elder a chance to have a rich old-life .
If people have to work for themselves , they will try their best to earn as much as possible .
Therefore , they may get even more money for their own than receiving from the government's welfare .
However , taking too many anti-aging medical products like medicine in general is not as good as supporting yourself with a suitable and healthy diet .
Those natural solutions to anti aging process include fruits and vegetables .
Fruits like apples , strawberries , etc contain ellagic acid that has the capacity to hinder the growth of tumors within the body and those such as cantaloupe , peaches , etc contain lycopene guarding body's cells and organs like heart , bladder from damage caused by free radicals .
Vegetables would also demonstrate the same benefits in antioxidant capabilities , for example , Genistein in soybeans works as cancer genes' enzymes' inhibitor .
Besides , people who usually do gymnastic will live longer and healthier than those do not .
Some may argue that fruit and gymnastic do not play any part in easing the aging process .
In facts , by doing physical exercise , their immunity increases , make them immunize with lots of bacteria and viruses .
A healthy diet along with gymnastic will prevent some disease to germ .
To countries with old population , medical science needs to be considered , and invested more in so that we will have more and better ways of easing the aging process .
With the achievements of medical science , treatments , medicine and dietary habits , humans get not only happiness and health but also a better longer life .
Furthermore , medical science is one of the effective solutions for aging process , which help ease the economic burden for the country by reducing the money for elder's welfare , diverting it to other areas of the country's development .
Secondly , the tourism sector is a revenue generator for Singapore through the various tourist attractions such as Sentosa and the upcoming Integrated Resorts .
Hence , funds have to be constantly injected for new tourist attractions and contingency plans in the case of an economy crisis .
For example , in February 2009 , the Singapore Tourism Board announced that an incentive of $90 million has been provided for the BOOST  which is targeted at aiding the tourism sector in times of challenges  .
Thus , funds are essential to ensure that the tourism sector is filled with vibrant attractions and is prepared for any crisis .
This ensures a constant flow of revenue for the economic stability of Singapore .
Lastly , R&D is extensively utilized with various purposes such as major institution projects , innovation and creativity in new developments and for environmental concerns .
For example , R&D is supported with the National Research Foundation which focuses into areas such as the Environmental and Water Technologies and the Interactive and Digital Media .
A total of $1 .55 billion is invested in these areas  .
In addition , R&D discovered the NEWater and ensured the consistent high quality for the past few years  .
Although , the R&D sector is important , the aging population must not be neglected as a portion of the old may still remain vulnerable .
Due to globalization , the aged has become richer and of better health .
However , a portion of the population could still need financial help such as those of lower incomes .
Thus , financial benefits should be provided to those that are in need of help .
In contrast , schemes such as the Central Provident Fund and the Medisave schemes do cover a large proportion of expenses .
Hence , funds spent on the aged should be limited in order to accommodate for the high expenses in the three sectors that contribute a large proportion of revenue to the economy .
In conclusion , R&D brings about innovation and inventions , hence bringing various business opportunities and revenue to Singapore .
On the whole , the aging population is not insurmountable problem .
Hence , public spending on the aged should be limited in order for funds to be sub-divided among the education , tourism and the R&D sectors which are the main sources of revenue .
In turn , with more revenue being generated , more benefits and financial aids could be provided to the aged which benefits the country as a whole .
Setting limits on the spending on the aged would raise indignation among the elderly , especially people without a savings , poor single women , and the illiterate .
Some may say it is inhumane when limiting the spending on the aged .
However , policy makers should always look at the interest of the whole country rather than just focusing on particular one area .
Additionally , the government can conduct specific tests such as the means- test for those who really require financial support .
In conclusion , it is applicable to make the spending on the aged limited .
The reduced spending on the aged can then be invested in other areas for instance education .
When the education is enhanced , graduates would have a higher chance of getting a job and hence contributing to the economic development of the country .
In addition , together with the development of economy , the young adults would be capable to support their parents .
Furthermore , they could enjoy a high living standard and security in life .
Generally , the government would have enough budgets to empower the stable development of the country , and to maintain the welfare and pension system at an acceptable level .
To illustrate these are only some out of many benefits which public can be achieved from the reduced of the aged spending .
To conclude , it is vital for the government to limit the spending on the aged to a reasonable level , and which money can be invested in different aspects of the country's development .
In the short run , the country may face difficulties , but in the long run it will be beneficial to the society .
Although almost everyone agrees that economics is the vital component in the world's life , not many people realize that it also play an important part in easing the aging process .
The effects caused by global economy indirectly control the speed of aging .
In developed countries with strong economies , health issues and other social services are sure to be cared much more than in undeveloped ones .
With a simple comparison between Western societies with those from Africa , we can see significant difference in life expectancy and actual lifespan .
While Western people tend to live long happy lives with small number of serious diseases , people from African countries usually have much shorter life expectancy .
However , economic problems may cause very bad impacts on the efforts of slowing down aging process .
As the economy goes up , there are more concerns to be taken care of and people get busier .
This will reflect in their bad habits like over-working and also harm their mental health , which will shorten their lifespan .
After several researches , it is not surprising to know the fact that , usually , the richest man is not the happiest man .
But again , these are individual's lifestyle so a person should be able to change it easily by himself putting some understanding and efforts .
Hence , economics , in some ways , is providing a useful helping hand to ease the aging process .
In conclusion , aging is nowadays a global issue .
Human beings , with their intelligence , can find out ways to ease the aging process .
The only problem left is that with a longer life , what will a person do to contribute back to the society and next generations ?
Aging population and longer life expectancy will inevitably lead to rapidly increasing elder residents .
Housing , which is one the basic needs of elderly people , is significant because elderly need a safe , pleasing and interactive environment for their old age .
Current housing developments and policies have provided better choice to enhance the quality of life of older people .
Government agencies have strived to promote an elderly-friendly physical environment .
Policymakers have implemented various strategies to ensure older people own a home while enjoy sufficient retirement income for old age dependency .
Some housing schemes are also introduced to facilitate mutual care and support for elderly .
Housing policies and schemes play a critical role in easing the aging process .
Most countries have provided various housing schemes to ensure adequate supply of affordable accommodation for aging population .
Under these schemes , housing developers are subsidized with lower land costs to build up retirement housings , while needy elderly are given priority to access to public housing .
It may be objected that there are a number of elderly people are "asset-rich , cash-poor" .
They own a house but do not have sufficient fund to meet their basic needs in old age  .
Nevertheless , there are policies that allow elderly to monetize their housing assets .
These people are encouraged to sublet their house or to downsize to a more affordable one .
In Singapore , the Lease Buyback Scheme helps the elderly in smaller flats to monetize flat value whilst continue to stay in the same flat .
Hence , we can notice that the housing needs as well as the financial needs of elderly have been effectively tackled by various public policies .
Finally , a harmonious and caring elderly society has been promoted through housing schemes as well .
On the one hand , policymakers have carried out a range of policies to encourage younger children to take care of their elderly parents by staying with them .
In Hong Kong , the Harmonious Families Priority Scheme allows families to live in one flat or two nearby flats when they apply for public housing .
On the other hand , senior activity centres are also developed in housing estate to encourage elderly remain integrated in society .
These centres provide social and recreational activities , as well as community-based care and support services for elderly residents .
Indeed , these strategies have effectively enabled elderly people to lead a fruitful andmeaningful social life .
Clearly , the quality of life of elderly people has been more contented and enjoyable through various housing developments , policies and improvement programmes .
These efforts have successfully eased the issues in aging population .
We can look forward to a blending of housing schemes and developments in future that help the older people to live as independent as possible .
Today , many governments around the world are particularly concerned with problems brought about by a fast ageing population .
One cause for this is attributed to the era of baby boomers , who are now mostly in their late fifties or early sixties .
In Singapore , this constitutes to 31% of Singapore's population and approximately half the workforce .
Being born from 1946 to 1964 , they are fast approaching the national retirement age of 63 .
In other words , in 10 years time , half of the current employed citizens at work would have retired .
Such manpower shortages are examples of how an ageing population would have a detrimental effect on the economy .
Among some other issues that the elderly face are those of deteriorating physical condition and old-age sickness , which might cause a strain on the local healthcare system , and financial needs , which will threaten to drain the government's coffers .
In anticipation of this , governments have set in place policies as well as encouraged initiatives to ease the ageing process for both the individual and society .
In the context of Singapore , some of these include mandatory personal retirement funds , development of the health sector to better manage an ageing population as well as encouraging longer working lives .
Despite some of the limitations of these policies , they have certainly eased the ageing process in Singapore .
One such policy in Singapore is the Central Provident Fund  .
Set up by the government in 1955 , it serves as a retirement fund for all Singaporean citizens .
CPF is a mandatory savings plan for an individual , where a portion of their income is set aside in this fund , and will be made available to them once they have retired .
This policy provides for financial security for the elderly as they are financially dependent , and need not rely on public initiatives or their children for money in their golden years .
With this policy , the government is then able to redirect these resources to more vital sectors .
Critics of this position point out their concerns over the misuse of the funds once it is made available .
Being unsure of their future financial requirements , the elderly might be unable to plan for their expenditure , and might drain their finances too quickly .
However , a recent introduction by the Singaporean government has eliminated this problem .
Participants of this new , compulsory scheme , named Lifelong Income for The Elderly  will receive lifelong monthly payouts from their CPF accounts .
Instead of being granted with a lump sum of money upon retirement , this ensures that the elderly do not exhaust their retirement funds too quickly , easing reliance on public funds .
Lastly , developments in medicine have also helped in the ageing process .
With new technological advances , the elderly now have a variety of medical treatments for most old-age related illnesses .
For example , advances in surgery have helped developed a non-invasive surgery technique for glaucoma , one of the main leading causes of blindness , in which the elderly are at a higher risk of contracting .
This non-invasive technique will help to minimize any potential surgical risks .
One impending problem with such rapid technological advances in medicine would be the rising costs of healthcare , brought about by the intensive research processes to develop new cures and treatments .
With most of the elderly retired and no source of income , they might be unable to fund their medical expenses should the need arise .
In view of this , the Singaporean government has in place a variety of measures to minimise the occurrence of this situation .
One such measure would be Medisave .
Introduced by the Ministry of Health in 1984 , Medisave would set aside a portion of an individual's income to their account , which will be available to fund medical expenses should the need arise .
With this fund , most Singaporeans will go into retirement with a sum of money collected from their working life which can be used to pay for medical expenses .
This reduces the possible reliance of public funds for funding of medical expenses for the elderly , which might result in taxpayers shouldering a larger burden of the alderfly's medical expenses .
In conclusion , this article has illustrated that the current policies in Singapore have helped ease the ageing process to a large extent .
As shown , policies such as CPF , raising the retirement age and the development of healthcare policies have helped to ease the ageing process in the society , thereby reducing the societal effects of an ageing population .
The issue of ageing population is a great challenge faced by many developed countries in the 21st century .
The great advances in medical technology over the years resulted in the improvements in the health conditions of individuals , and hence the reduced likelihood of them contracting life-threatening diseases .
The life expectancy of individuals has increased due to better accessibility to healthcare services and facilities than before .
In countries such as Singapore , the existence of an ageing population is attributed by the baby boom period after World War II , and the persistently low fertility rate ever since 1970s  .
As such , this has increase the need for public spending on the aged in order to fund for the needs of the elderly , such as the construction of the elderly facilities and healthcare subsidies .
It could be argued that public spending on the aged is carried out at the expense of a country's development in other areas , such as education which will increase the productivity of a country , and also infrastructure and transport facilities which serve as attractions for foreign direct investments .
However , Jenson  reported that it is inevitable that individuals have a higher tendency to consume more healthcare services as they age despite the reduced susceptibility to diseases .
Thus , it is not practical to limit the public spending on the aged such that the money can be used alternatively for a country's developments .
In conclusion , fertility rates are declining while life expectancies are increasing around the globe .
As a result , populations are aging rapidly and Singapore is not exempted from this trend .
The ratios of Singapore citizens aged sixty-five and above will climb from one in twelve in 2007 to one in eight in 2020  .
Therefore the public spending on the aged should not be limited and should fluctuate according to changes such as impending demographic shift , population growth and healthcare expenses .
However , it is also important and responsible for Singaporeans to plan ahead so that they can depend on several sources of income to sustain their old-age livings and at the same time ease the burden of public spending on the aged .
Employers should also do a part in changing their traditional perceptions that old-aged employees are unproductive and potential burden to society  .
Employers should try to retain and retrain older workers for them to be retained in the labour force , this will extend working life of citizens and they will be in a better economic position to sustain their own old-age livings .
Population aging is progressing rapidly in many countries and in the near future , this may push up the public spending on social security and healthcare costs .
In viewing the aging population problem , some people argued that we should not limit but to provide more public and financial assistances for elderly due to the increasing number of elderly in an aging population .
However , the increase in public spending means that working people may need to have higher tax contributions , as public spending is supported mainly by taxation .
Minford and Wang  stated that researches have shown that the increase in tax to GDP had reduced GDP growth and lowered the output per worker .
In an aging population , having increasing tax contribution from the shrinking workforce can be a burden to the working people .
Straits Time  mentioned that the huge increases in public spending could slow down countries' economic growth .
In aging society , it is important to limit and have control over the increasing public spending on aged .
If not , there could be a drop on the GDP and eventually cause the percentage of public spending to be spent on aged to reduced too .
Singapore has one of the fastest aging populations in the world and is expected to be considered a country with an aging population by the year 2030  .
This alarming trend is stimulated by declines in fertility rate , medical advances , and better health care which have resulted in longer life expectancy .
With this rising aging population , many issues related to old age become significant , especially the public spending issue .
Even though this trend would most likely affect Singapore negatively , the government must not only concern themselves with the increasing expenditures on the aged and try to divert the budget for the aged to other areas of development .
They must also consider the impact on the elderly if there were no financial support for the elderly .
In addition , they should also consider the contributions that the elderly could give and had given to the country .

One of the issues if the public spending is limited is that it will impose financial hardship on the elderly , especially for elderly women .
Women tend to have longer life expectancy as compared to men  .
However , this demographic pattern of aging shows that the elderly women are likely to be widowed or single , and hence , they will be economically dependent .
Moreover , it also accentuated the financial risk of long term care that may not be sufficiently covered by existing insurance policies .
This will make older women remain vulnerable financially .
This situation might result in the incapability to seek for medical assistance when the need arises .
The aged may be a liability to the country due to the increasing cost of looking after them .
However , their experience and knowledge can be an asset to the country .
Furthermore , leaving the elderly to the care of family members may be more detrimental to the overall developement of the country .
Therefore , the government should provide appropriate support and take care of them .

With respect to the overall social benefits for a country , investing into dealing with the aged problem is not as profitable as into some other domains .
Apparently , it is not the elderly but the young generation that is the "future" of a country .
When getting older and older , generally , people cannot contribute to the development of their countries as much as the young do and it is the younger generation that will assume responsibility of consolidating the country's powers as well as enhancing the nation's status in the world .
Therefore , instead of spending too much on the old , the government's budget should focus on the collective who will decide the future of their states .
At this point , one may wonder that the old people did contribute to the improvements of their countries in the past , consequently , they deserve the government's regard at their old age and if the governments ignore this problem , the next generations may not be willing to devote their ability to those who will make their contributions oblivious .
It should , however , be emphasized that the governments do pay attention to the aged population and what mentioned here is limiting the spending on this matter in a reasonable way .
The article Help the aged  stressing that "the budget must not forget older people" even when governments are in difficult financial situation one more time provides evidence to confirm this argument .
In other words , governments highly appreciate the contribution of old people in the past and try to offer them more but the budget constraint calls for limiting in order to develop other aspects of society .
The Korea population is graying rapidly , and the proportion of elderly with the aged of 65 and over is expected to reach 13 .2 per cent in 1960 .
Korea needs to reform its national policies if it hopes to create a better and sustainable future society as there will be a lot of negative impacts to the country such as inevitable labor shortage , increase in public spending and healthcare problems if the ageing population continues to grow disproportionately with the country's fertility rate .
This is supported by Jones  , stating that the increasing in this population will have strong physical , psychological , social , cultural , economical and cultural implications .
Therefore , in view of this acute phase , current research and policies have been carried out by the Korean government and have helped to buffer the ageing process .

Social service programs have been introduced for the welfare of the elderly .
It can be divided into two groups , consisting of the recreational programs and community programs .
Under these programs , the elderly are able to obtain personal needs and social- psychological developments needs amongst others .
For example , under the community program , there is this sub- program called the Home- Help Program which provides home- help services to the elderly without any fees incurred .
Around 35 ,000 volunteer home helpers were active , linked to 552 voluntary organizations in 2001 with the provision of government in financial assistance for recruiting , training and maintaining volunteers .
Although many beneficial services has been provided to the elderly , this program still does not seem to be so effective as volunteers may or may not render their services whenever the elderly need them .
It is not a mandatory or binding issue for them to always lend a hand to the elderly .
Therefore , the government should think of a better way to tackle this problem so that the society will have a concept that their voluntary work is not an optional choice , but a domestic routine to serve the elderly who need their assistance .
Due to the low fertility rate and the growing of elderly in the society , there is a shortage of workforce in certain occupations .
To keep an ideal and constant working age group  and ensure the stability of manpower in Korea , the government has been inviting immigrants to join the workforce .
The number of foreign labors has grown from a few thousand to estimates of 168 thousand in 1999  and 358 thousands in 2005 .
This replacement migration in coping with the population in Korea has not only helped to ease the ageing process when the older Koreans started to retire which resulted in certain downfalls of manpower in certain specialization , it also has helped to buffer the current shortage of labor in the market .
Unfortunately , the idea did not seem to give only positive impacts , but also negative consequences when there are around 65 percent of the immigrants imported in 1999 are working illegally  .
The large volumes of immigrants to fill up the labor shortage due to population aging also arouse fears of loss of national identity  .
Thus , even though the adoptions of the immigrant policy have helped to ease the ageing process , it might not be the best policy to conquer this matter .

Firstly , the aged has contributed their youth to the advancement of the society .
More than half a century ago , they fought to restore peace to our country .
Then , they worked hard to rebuild and develop the war-torn country into what we are living in now .
We owe them for the peace which not all of us can acknowledge its value; we have to thank them for creating and developing the country and the safe environment that we are living in .
Public pension , healthcare and all the services for the elderly are the least we can do to pay our debt of gratitude to what they have done for us .
Won't it make us inhumane if we make our benefactors struggling when they are near the end of their lives ?
Is this really a decision coming from a civilized world ?
And how do you feel if the younger generation does this to you ?
In conclusion , we should not limit spending on the aged because it is our way to express our thanks to their contributions to the society , it is to allow the under-privileged old people to live on and it is to maintain the economic and social stability .
Global aging population is one of the most critical and pressing issues that the leaders of the twenty first century face .
According to the United Nations report , the proportion of population aged 60 or above in the developed and less developed countries is projected to reach 33% and 25% respectively by 2050 .
The change in the age structure of a country's population will has a profound impact on the political , social and economical conditions of that country .
In view of the increasing number of elderly , governments across the globe have implemented various policies to help them cope with the aging process .
Aging process here refers to the problems that will come about as one grows old , such as healthcare issues , financial problems and many more .
Although there are already policies in place , much changes and improvements have to be done to effectively help the elderly address their growing concerns and improve their quality of life .
Advocate of government policies often argue that many countries have provided financial security and support for the aged through policies such as social pension and compulsory savings  .
While this may be true , such measures are ineffective in reducing old-age poverty as many elderly have little understanding of how the system work and do not possess the necessary financial knowledge to manage their savings and allowance .
As such , government has to put more emphasis and effort to impart financial education and provide money advice and information to help the elderly better finance their savings and incomes .
Due to the complexity of these policies , some elderly do not even know how to use them to their benefits , hence rendering them worthless .
In addition , a study by  shows that old people often do not know how to optimize their savings and spend their money carelessly .
As a result , their savings and incomes are exhausted quickly .
In another separate study by  , it is stated that around 67% of the respondent think that the compulsory saving in Hong Kong cannot provide them with a happy retirement life as they do not understand about the benefits of Mandatory Provident Fund  scheme and hence do not care about it .
Therefore it is necessary that the government highlight the availability and benefits of their financial policies and equip the aged with basic financial education to increase the effectiveness of these policies .
Lastly , more should be done to increase the labour participation rate of the aged in the workforce .
An argument against this is that adequate effort has been put in to encourage later retirement and longer working lives .
Despite the effort , employment level of the aged still remain low as the elderly continue to face discrimination at work .
Older workers are often viewed as less dynamic and less creative as compared to the younger workers , thus they are less preferred .
Unless there is a change in attitude towards the older workers , it will be difficult for them to be find jobs , which can keep them active and support their financial needs .
Discrimination towards the older workers is more evident during the recession .
There was a 46% increase in the number of unemployed people in the UK whereas the biggest increase is those aged 60 and above with an increase of 65%  .
A possible solution for this is to scrap national default retirement age which often give the power to employers to retrench those above this retirement age .
Also the government can give benefits or incentives to older workers to encourage them to go for re-training in order to increase their employability .
Employment can reduce elder dependency and provide some financial support for the aged to finance some of their activities .
In conclusion , current policies are inadequate in allowing the elderly to retire happily .
Changes should be made to the current financial , health care and employment policies for the aged so that they can better help the elderly .
There is a need to equip the elderly with the proper finance management to make the financial policies effective .
Also , cost reduction and increasing accessibility are vital for an efficient health care system .
In addition , reducing age discrimination in the workplace must be enforced to better help the elderly secure jobs .
Subsequently , these policies should be revised and improved frequently as the needs and concerns of the aged will change over time .
Public spending is the amount of taxation collected by the government to provide services for its people such as education , health care and law and order maintenance .
The dominating population in countries that are experiencing growing aging population is the elderly citizens because the demographic trends change had led rapid increment of the seniors rather than the young ones .
If the number of elders continues to increase , pertinent problems will definitely escalate .
Therefore , government should spend more on the aged not only to ease their aging process but also to tackle problems arising from a growing population .
Despite the government consistent spending on the old , public spending on the aged should not be limited but should be used accordingly based on the circumstances .
There are always some controversies over the aging future which is one of the most concerning subjects nowadays .
Some people think about it as a burden to national economy which is to spend a lot on pension as well as health issues while other people of pessimistic opinion argue that old people have the right to enjoy public money .
From my point of view I strongly agree with the idea which encourages government to reduce the amount of money spent on the aged for some reasons .
The very first and most striking point to note is that the economy of world is suffering from many depression as well as recession and the most recent period occurred from 2008 to first 6 months of 2009 .
It means that it will be a burden for the government to keep financing the pension or taking care of all the olds expenditure such as in health issues and in accommodation .
And to be specific , I think there are also many different important fields that also need a lot of government aid such as education or children's upbringing which will definitely have a considerable influence on the country's future .
Secondly , there should be family's responsibility in taking care of the old so that the government can have more time and money to spend on other fields .
For examples in some Asian countries such as Vietnam or Japan , their children are very willing to take care of their old parents till the end of their life to reciprocate , which is a kind of common moral principles in Asian culture .
Moreover nowadays there are many blue-collar jobs which are impliedly reserved for old people to earn a living .
By saying that I mean old people themselves somehow can earn money to live on .
For instance , by observing I can see that almost the blue-collar workers in Singapore are about over fifty .
Even though there are some people argue that old people have the right to use the government financial aid because they have paid tax , I personally think they as well as their children have also benefited from tax such as transportation , education , etc .
In short , I think not only government but also family will have the responsibility to take care of old people so that public budget will be spent on many different areas to develop country and we all can enjoy life with a higher living standard .
It is well known that our society is aging .
Our Government has played a huge role in implementing and improving our policies to maximize the aid for the elderly .
However , there will always be persisting problems that the government will face such as National budget and economies coming under pressure , rising cost in the medical field and providing safety aids and measures in public areas .
Thus , current research and development in these areas are required to further ease the problems .
National budget and the economy have come under pressure as government provides heavy subsidies to the elderly in medical , transportation and even social activities .
Some might think that rather having to research and develop better economic policies , the government should just allocate this money for elderly benefits .
However , we should not just blindly put these money into subsidies , instead , we can use it to research for better policies or systems that will maximize the utility of the budget .
Having better policies , the government will be able to increase the productivity of the work force .
When productivity increases , economic growth will also follow .
There will be more money generated and fewer people in need .
One example would be that the government implemented the "Foreign Talent Policy" , which opened our market to foreign talents and thus increasing the productivity of the workforce .
Besides having greater productivity , the government introduced a scheme that allows people to provide in advance for their old age dependency .
They are encouraged to save a portion of their salary into a special account when they are most active in the workforce .
In Singapore , this particular self-funded retirement scheme is called "CPF Contributions" .
This is where the employer and employee have to provide monetary contributions for that particular employee's CPF account .
Apart from this , there are additional or related schemes such as Medisave and Medishield .
Britain , Australia , Chile have also moved towards this kind of funded retirement schemes .
Therefore , current research in development and policies in the economy sector do help in easing the aging process .
In the medical aspect , it may be objected that no medicine in the world can cure aging illnesses such as Dementia and Arthritis .
Even though that is a fact , advancement in the medical field has proven to pro-long and even cure some old age diseases like Cataracts .
Constant research in this field has better prepared the elderly in terms of knowledge , treatments and physical conditions in relation to these diseases .
With prior knowledge , people will be mentally prepared for the aging process .
In addition , they can seek treatments in the early stages to prevent worsening of the conditions or even get cured .
This will also in turn save huge amount of money for the people , as later treatments will require one to pay a higher price .
Knowing the symptoms of a disease does help too .
One example is that when an elderly is having doubled or blurred vision , sensitivity to light and glare , he or she might be having cataract .
Thus they can seek treatment or go for a cataract surgery if needed .
Research and developments have also seen implementation of the latest technologies being used in hospitals , clinics and some even at home .
New age technologies like these have helped doctors to react within precious seconds in saving a person's life .
They can also assess the their patient's condition in a shorter and more accurate time frame .
For example , elderly with high blood pressure can check their blood pressure anytime and anywhere with just a push of the button on a compact , portable blood pressure monitor .
Thus , all these research in medical field has aided the aging process tremendously .
In conclusion , all the research and developments and policies the government has invested in have made aging a more joyous and less terrifying journey .
Thus , current research , development and policies in the economy , medical sector and architectural sector have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
One of the biggest issues the world is facing now is the problem of an aging population .
Thus , there are an increasing number of concerns as to how to solve the problems of an aging population .
One of the most direct ways of dealing with the problems is to divert more government spending to the aged .
However , the amount of government funds available is limited .
By directing more funds to the aged , there will be lesser funds for other areas of the country's development .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Critics argue that by limiting the government spending on the aged , it would increase the consequences of an aging population .
When lesser amount of government spending is given to the aged , the individuals and families will end up paying more .
Their financial burden will increase with financial related social problems following behind .
However , without limiting the government spending on the aged , the people may become too reliable on the government .
They may not take the initiative to save their money for future uses .
This could create serious problems for the government as it will cause additional pressure on the national budget and the economy .
The children may even end up not supporting their parents at all .
An example would be the increasing number of elderly suing their children for not supporting them in Singapore .
From August 2008 to July 2009 , Popatal  found that there were 172 people who filed applications at the Tribunal for Maintenance of Parents .
This was much higher than the average of 100 in previous years .
The elderly are being forced to get help from the government as their children are not willing to support them .
By limiting the government spending on the aged , the children will not push all the responsibilities of taking care of their aged parents to the government .
They will not create a habit of relying too much on the government .
Another reason why public spending should be limited is because a country does not only consist of the aged .
There are other sectors that needed the government's help .
If the government spending on the aged is not limited , the other sectors will be neglected .
The education sector will be an example .
The education sector is very important to a country as it nurtures the young and turns them into useful adults .
The government helps them by issuing bursaries scholarships to encourage students to study hard and help those who are poor but are eager to go to school .
Without setting a limit on the government funds spent on the aged , all these will not be possible .
There will be lesser amount of skilful adults in the workforce and this may in turn slow down the economy .
Without economic growth , the government may face a deficit .
Taxes may have to increase and takes a bigger toil on the people .
Hence , it is important to limit the public spending on the aged so as to divert it to other areas in the country's development .
In conclusion , it is important to limit the spending on the aged so that people will not be too reliable on the government .
They should also be aware that the elderly are now healthier and so are capable of supporting themselves .
A country does not only consist of the aged and spending too much government funds on the aged will cause a negative impact on the economy and is unnecessary .
Population in the world is aging rapidly and the number of persons aged 60 or over is expected almost to triple , increasing from 737 million in 2009 to 2 billion by 2050 globally .
This signals the need to deal with this pressing issue Aging Population .
Fortunately , many countries have recognized this need and have come up with different strategies to tackle the aging issues .
Many countries' current strategies have been formulated with the elderly in mind and hence they are able to address the needs of the elderly , thereby easing their aging process .
"Aging" is defined as the process of becoming old .
Hence , easing the aging process would mean making the course towards old age an enjoyable and less tedious one for the elderly .
In Singapore context , she has many different approaches in place and the few main ones include the implementation of Central Provident Fund  , development and improvement made to the existing healthcare system and elder-friendly infrastructure and the implementation of Tax Relief Scheme .
All these have indeed helped to alleviate the aging process and allow the elderly to enjoy their sunset years to the fullest .
Overall , the different strategies such as the introduction of CPF , the development and improvement of the elder-friendly infrastructure and healthcare system and the implementation of tax relief scheme have indeed helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
These strategies have helped to ensure that the elderly are self-sufficient during their old age and also allow them to live in a more conducive and barrier-free environment .
Although there is still room for improvement , current strategies have already done a pretty great job in ensuring that the individuals have saved enough for their old age and thereby increasing their sense of retirement security .
All these have indeed made the process towards aging a more enjoyable and fulfilling one and it allowed the aged to truly enjoy their well-prepared sunset years .
Expenditure on the elderly is taking up more of the government budget due to the aging population .
Money that can be otherwise spent on the country's development has to be used on settling the problem of nations on the long list of greying nations in the world .
These countries are spending more and more money on health care , infrastructure and transportation especially accustomed to the needs of the elderly .
Due to this , the country's development in other areas has to take a step back , thus resulting in the inability to attain her potential .
In the following essay , I shall discuss the problems that are brought about by the increase in public spending on the aged and the areas that could have been benefited if the fund is used on them instead .
However , in contrary to what common perspective of the elderly is , Pat Thane argued that , they are not inevitably unhealthy .
As the living conditions improve and technology advances , people are able to lead a healthier lifestyle and live longer as compared to the past .
Thane also cited that "evidence that many tasks can be performed as well by people in their seventies as by younger people , even when they involve quite heavy physical or intellectual demands ."
As a result of the above mentioned arguments by Pat Thane , the Senior lecturer in Social Science and Administration at Goldsmiths College , London , and old age might not necessarily translate to being a burden to the society .
The elderly , especially the "young elderly" , can surely be able to earn a living on their own if they do not have the luxury of their children supporting them .
Therefore , an aging population might not posing problems as feared .
In summary , public spending on the aged should be limited because the fact that the elderly should have planned for their old age when they were young and they might still be able to support them if the need arises .
Concluding this , the country will be able to progress if their citizen do their part in planning for their retirement and , or their children supporting them .
Many countries are currently experiencing aging population which leads to a series of related economic and social problems .
For instance , workforce gets smaller as elder workers retire and working class have to pay more taxes due to the slower economic growth and the need to provide more healthcare services for the aged .
Even though the world is facing aging population , public spending should not only be spent on the aged as there are many other factors that need to be taken care of in the country's future development .
Aging population is already an inevitable problem in many countries such as Japan and Singapore .
Therefore , public spending had been reviewed to address this problem and it helps to reduce the negative impact of aging problems to the society .
However , due to the practical reasons , a country has its limitations on supporting the aged .
Hence , countries should assess other important areas that public spending should be focused on as well .
On the other hand , if public spending on the aged were reduced , many social problems would arise in the country .
As the aged are used to receiving allowances and subsidies , the lack of government aids might affect their well-being .
They would be unable to support themselves especially with the increasing level of healthcare costs .
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics , the Consumer Price Index for healthcare had an increase of 3 .6% from February 2008 to February 2009 .
This would translate to higher costs of living for the aged .
Therefore , in this case , moral issues need to be considered as well .
Children of the aged should do their part in taking care of their parents after their retirement .
In conservative countries such as Singapore , children are expected to take care of their parents by providing them with allowance to meet their daily needs .
Children should remember how their parents have taken care of them when they are young and hence , should do their part in demonstrating the value of filial piety and take care of their aged parents , instead of relying on the country to help .
In order to ensure that the aged are properly taken care of by their children , government could introduce policies and enforce it on all .
This would help to enforce the emphasis government places on moral values and also directly reduce public spending , which could be diverted to other areas of development .
Other areas of development included addressing social issues such as the decrease in the birthrate and the increase in child abuse cases .
In Singapore , the Marriage and Parenthood package with the extension of the Baby Bonus only attained marginal success in increasing the birthrate of Singaporeans .
Median age of citizen mothers at first birth had increased over the years from 28 .6 in 1998 to 29 .4 in 2008 , thus causing the fertility rate for the prime childbearing age group of 20 to 34 to decline .
Hence , public spending could be used to introduce more programs and subsidies to encourage having larger families instead .
With increased birthrate , Singapore would be able to resolve the problem of aging population in the near future .
Besides aging population , other social issues such as child abuse are also crucial problems that need to be addressed .
According Social Statistics 2009 conducted by Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , the number of child abuse cases investigated in Singapore had increased from 154 in 2007 to 176 in 2008 .
This significant increase indicates that attention should be diverted to address this problem .
Public spending could be used to ensure that there are ways to reach out to the abused victims in the society .
In addition , it is essential to increase public awareness through campaigns and seminars to allow public to have a better understanding on child abuse .
With this , the society could play a part in creating a safer environment for children and hence , enhancing the social development in Singapore .
Even though many countries are facing aging population , there is a still a limit on what can be done .
Thus , countries should not be overwhelmed by the problems of aging population and overlook other potential problems .
In conclusion , public spending should be used on the aged but also not neglecting other problems arising which hinders the country's development .
Too much of the nation's budget is spent on aiding the elderly and the government should limit and channel these funds to other more important areas for country's development .
For most countries , part of their national budget will be spent on funding the aged each year .
For example , $121million is set aside as Senior Citizen Bonus in Singapore this year  .
The elderly receive subsidies in various areas such as housing and medical subsidies .
As the elderly today are able to survive without subsidies from the government , these funds should be put to better use and be directed to support the country's development .
The society has stressed on the importance of filial piety which requires children to take care of their parents .
Children are obliged to take care of their parents and this will lessen the burden on the society to take responsibility for the well-being of the elderly .
Thus , less funds are needed to help these elderly .
Excess funds should then be channeled to other areas for country's development .
Many may think that with the obligation to support their parents , the working family members will bear a heavier burden to provide for their parents .
However , providing for the parents is not an additional burden for the children as benefits are reaped when they take care of their parents .
For example , tax relief for adults who live with aged parents has been increased to $5000 and CPF Housing Grant Scheme to encourage young couples to stay near their parents  .
Therefore , it is not true to say that the working adults bear a heavier burden from supporting their parents when government incentives are provided .
Hence , the government should limit the amount used to aid the elderly as their financial needs are taken care of by their own family members .
Everyone should be responsible for their well-being .
The aged should still continue to work even beyond their retirement age when they are still capable of supporting themselves .
In recent years , the government have been promoting elder employment and raising the eligibility age for employment .
Hence , the elderly should have no problem finding jobs to financially support themselves .
Others may think that the elderly have already contributed their share to the society and should now retire .
However , instead of letting them idle at home , the retired should be allowed back in the workforce and continue contributing to the economy .
Their contributions not only benefit themselves financially , they are also able to share their precious experiences with the apprentice .
With elderly returning to the workforce , they are less dependent on the government subsidies and thus , less funds should be set aside for the elderly .
Elderly will be supported in their retired days through various methods such as support by their working family members and support from government policies  .
There is no need to worry about the large sum of financial aid required by the aged .
All in all , funds should be limited and directed to other more important areas for country's development so that the country will be able to remain competitive in the economy and achieve sustained economic growth .
Aging issues are very complicated but not indomitable .
For all nations , wise planning on public spending and wise policy planning are very crucial as they influence one's future .
Creating welfare dependency on the government only solves the issues temporarily .
In order to prevent this , public spending on the aged should be limited .
Instead , it should be used on other areas of development to tackle the roots of the issues and improve the quality of life .
Public spending means expenditure by government , covering the military , health , education , infrastructure , development projects , and the cost of servicing  overseas borrowing .
Aging problem likely causes a substantial increase in public expenditure on health .
But the stable development of society as a whole needs the balance of public spending on all aspects .
Thus the government should be cautious in expanding spending in the aging population , taking into account the impact on economic growth .
Above all , many recent reports from developed countries have found that ageing will have only a small effect on the healthcare expenditure in future , thus spending on the aged can be limited within a certain small scope of the proportion of GDP .
For example , reports from the United Statesthe United Kingdom and Australia have reached similar conclusions .
There are two reasons why researchers have reached this conclusion .
Firstly , the older population is not spending a large proportion of the country's GDP , and the fact is not simply that the relatively greater proportion of older people there is , the more spending is as a percentage of GDP .
For example , the Sweden and the Australia have similar health outcomes , as measured by life expectancy .
But in 2000 , 17 .3% of the Swedish population was aged 65 years or older; it spent only 8 .6% of its GDP on health .
This is less than the 9 .3% spent by Australia in 2001-02 , when only 12 .7% of the population was 65 years or older .
Secondly , many countries have adopt effective strategies to make the effect of population ageing on health expenditure to be small and manageable , Here is some of the strategies:  stratify the old by age and sex;  give the limited coverage of the public pension system , new means-tested benefit for the elderly to reducing poverty;  increase transparency about self-employed income to ensure fairness in the financing of social insurance systems , including the new long-term care insurance .
But , the aging problem may be exaggerated , due to a variety of reasons .
Here I just give three of them .
Second , some group of people may , as the reasons for their positions or interests , require a significant increase in public spending on the aging population .
One group is the old .
Compared to long-term economic development they may more concern about their own welfare .
Another is the government .
Because of an increasing number of elderly voters , in order to win majority support , politicians may provide excessive benefits to the elderly .
The other is private medical institution .
If the government finds that aging is a heavy burden , it is bound to decrease the necessary public expenditure , thereby forcing more people to use private health institutions .
Many countries including Singapore are facing the issue of the aging population .
There are many implications to this issue and one of such implication is that the spending by the government on the aged has increased in order to deal with this issue .
This affects the amount of available funds to spend on other areas of the country's development such as the economy , education and infrastructure .
Thus , in today's society , much has been debated on whether public spending should be limited so more money can be diverted to other areas for the country's development .
In my own opinion , I agree to a large extent that public spending on the aged should be limited .
One of the reasons to limit public spending on the aged is that there is a greater need to spend money on education than on the aged .
For countries such as Singapore where labor is vital and is the only resource , spending on education is important for the future growth of the country .
Furthermore , in Singapore where it is currently experiencing low birth rate , developing education aspect for the young is crucial to ensure there will be sufficient of local talents in the future .
This is to ensure that Singapore will be able to stay competitive with other countries in the future .
Therefore , in the long run , spending on education will generate economic benefits for the country .
On the other hand , if this same amount of money is to be spent on the aged , there will be no economic benefits generated by them for the country .
Hence , if the government does not limit the spending on the aged , smaller budget will be left for developing education .
This may affects the country in long run .
It can also be argued that there is a greater need to spend on infrastructure development as it is an important area for a country development .
Limit spending on the aged means that there will be a larger amount of funds available to spend on infrastructure development .
This fund allows the country to develop proper infrastructure such as roads , electricity and even water supply to attract more foreign investors in setting up firms in the country .
Superior infrastructure attracts foreign investors in setting up business in the country as it reduces production cost and also increases accessibility for their business .
Attracting foreign investors is important as foreign investments contribute to the country economic development .
Therefore , if government spending on the aged does not limit but increases due to aging population issue , the budget on infrastructure development will be lesser and this may affect the country's economic development negatively .
Another reason to limit public spending on the aged is that there is a need to set aside larger amount of money for economic area especially currently when there is global economic downturn .
As economy is a key area of a country development , government should spend more money on economic development in order to sustain a healthy economic growth .
In addition , a prosperous economy will leads to the increase of affluences .
This means that the burden of supporting the aged by the society will be lessen .
Thus , spending in the economy will bring beneficial for both the country and the aged in long run .
On the flip side , spending on the aged is as equally as important in spending on any other area for country development .
Limit spending on the aged does not mean that government should not spend on them .
As they are part of the country's population , there is a social responsibility to take care of the aged .
Moreover , this group of elderly had work hard for years when they were young and had contributed to the economy and society .
From this essay , I conclude that there is a need to limit public spending on the aged as there are other areas that require money for the country's development .
After all , the aged is not the only area that we should look into when deciding on the allocation of public spending .
There is a need for government to take a wider perspective of the different areas that need money as much as the aged when deciding on how much money to spend in each area .
Thorough the entire world , the national leaders of developed countries are anguishing about the crisis of aging population .
A country budget would be spent in a few key areas such as defense , healthcare , environment , transport , research and development , education .
Public spending on the aged is necessary but should be limited in order for money to be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
If majority of spending is focus on the aged , it would limit the growth of the country which consequently lowers that standard of living for all .

Goulding , Margie R . 2005 "Trends In Prescribed Medicine Use And Spending By Older Americans , 1992 2001"  September 11 , 2009
Limiting elderly spending does not confine only within the present .
It is about coming out with a permanent solution which would curb the spending in the long run .
In Australia , the mean-testing pensions have helped to cut down a significant amount of aging population costs .
However , statistics have shown that the nation's health care spending will still nearly double from 6 .4% of its GDP in 2002 to 11 .5% in 2025 due to the larger proportion of elderly in relative to its population .
Therefore , the fiscal outcome may not turn out to be ideal , other expenses such as education and national defence will end up being squeezed .
So it can be deduced that limiting elderly spending in the present does not equate to paying off in the future .
Freidland and Summer  suggest the importance of increased productivity of future workers , regardless of age , for better economic growth .
However , in the future , bulk of the working population will have to come from the retiring baby boomers .
There are several limitations to the extent of how the productivity can be increased among these workers .
Firstly , for the more well-offs elderly , they are less willing to work as they want to enjoy their retirement .
Secondly , more health issues will surface if the elderly are to work more or longer , especially for the less well-offs as most of them have difficulty in paying for their medical expenses .
Hence , in order to have a better economic growth , the process should be viewed with a more comprehensive perspective .
Government should provide a wider protection net for the elderly , such as implementing health insurances , promoting health campaigns , better welfare programs so as to reduce the mental and financial burden on the aged .
And this means spending on the elderly is required .
Although economic growth is important in providing care for the elderly , the limit standards on the elderly spending should be set carefully , so that they would not create any adverse effects on the economy .
As elderly will likely to form the core of the population in the future , they are becoming the major source of the economic growth .
Thus , their welfare and healthcare should be well taken care of .
When this condition is satisfied , economic growth then can be sustained to cater for other areas of country's development .
The government has a duty in taking care of the aging population .
However , they should limit the public spending on the aged .
The responsibility to look after the aged should be shared between the children as well .
In addition , the aged could prepare themselves for the old reducing the burden of others .
Limiting the public spending on the age reduces dependency of them on the government .
Also , more money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Ageing population is a pervasive phenomenon affecting countries worldwide .
Governments have been working on strategies to deal with this problem .
One of the strategies is to increase the birth rate of the country .
For example , Singapore has implemented the baby bonus scheme to lighten the financial costs of raising children .
However , the government not only has to deal with reducing ageing population but to attend to the needs of the aged as well .
There is a need to subsidize the aged for their healthcare , transport , facilities and in other areas .
More public spending has to be channeled to cater to the needs of the aged .
One may argue that public spending on the aged could be spent on country's development .
The development of the country is important but public spending on the aged should never be limited under all circumstances .
Whether the country develops or not , public spending on the aged should not be limited .
The aged still deserves to receive the best welfare given by the country .
It is known that they had contributed to the country for during the prime time of their life .
Their contribution should be recognized .
A practical way of recognizing their contribution is to provide them with subsidies and growth packages .
By limiting public spending on the aged , it may signify that the government perceives that the country's development more important than the welfare of the people .
Due to this , some of people would resent the government for regarding development more important than its people .
In the extreme cases , some of them would hold protests to vent their anger towards the government .
There could be a social backlash if the government were to limit the public spending on the aged .
The people may view that the government sees the old aged as a burden , not wanting to taking care of them .
This could cause the people to be skeptical about their welfare for their old age in the future .
The morale of the local workforce could be affected .
Some people may seek to migrate to countries that will look after the welfare of the aged .
And the migration of the workforce would lead shortage of workers in the country .
Shortage of labour would impede the growth of the country .
Therefore , this causes economic development of the country to be reduced rather than growth .
On the other hand , limiting the amount of public spending spent on the aged could help the country to develop more effectively during crisis .
If the country is facing an economic downturn , its revenue is reduced .
This calls for a need for the government to spend on areas which could boost the economy .
Money should be spent more wisely on helping the country to get out of the economic downturn .
With the reduced revenue , the government should be more flexible by limiting the public spending on the aged .
By limiting the spending on the aged , it helps the government to have more funds available for getting the country out of the economic downturn .
More public spending could be allocated to skill upgrading for workers , education and building projects .
Despite the economic downturn , the government could use money from their reserve fund instead .
This could be a morale boost for the people because the spending on the aged by the government is not reduced despite the economic downturn .
The limit of public spending on the aged is important because it indirectly controls the funds which would be channeled into other areas of a country's development .
This accounts for the dilemma in the amount of spending to be diverted towards the ageing society as many believe that money directed to boosting a country's economic growth is more practical than spending it on an ageing population which offers no economic returns .
Hence , a country should decide on the level of limit of spending they want to commit on the ageing population as different levels would lead to different results .
For a country which places low limit on the public spending of the aged , the amount of investment being channeled into other areas of the country's development would be lower than another with a higher limit on the public spending .
For example , Britain spends more on their ageing population as compared to America and their level of investment in research and development is lower than that of America .
However , this is not to say that the public spending on the aged is the sole factor for the cause of lower investments in other areas of a country's development , it is only one of the many factors .
Nevertheless , it still affects the level of fund being diverted to a country's development .
A low limitation limits the funds being diverted to other areas of the country's development such as education , technology and economic investments .
This may result in a slowdown in the progress of a country because the progress of a country is dependent on its ability to keep up with the competitive global economy .
With less funds being pumped into areas such as technology and infrastructures , investments may flow out when other nations offer better incentives .
This would then lead to an overall fall in the revenue of a country which will translates to a drop in the public spending on the aged  .
Thus , it can be seen that negative results are being achieved with neither the aging population nor the country's economy benefitting from it .
However , the increase in investments may not necessary lead to a rise in the revenue of a country because an outflow of capital may occur as those investments are foreign based .
Also , one cannot be sure that the increase in revenue would be diverted to the ageing population as a country may continuously tap on the increase in revenue to spur more economic growth .
Lastly , by having a high limitation , it may mean that proper healthcare and medical technology are not provided for the ageing population and this may lead to a poorer health standard among the aged .
This would then translate to a more serious problem as the country would then need to pump in even more money to increase the health standard of the elderly in the future  .
Hence it can be seen that different levels of limitations on public spending produces different results which can be both good and bad as shown above .
These results may not be the same for all countries because each country has their own unique way of implementing different policies to deal with their ageing population .
But there is no doubt that public spending on the aged should be limited because it affects the level of fund being diverted to areas that aid the development of a country , however more importantly , it is the level of limitation that a country has to take note of .
Each country will have a different level of limitation because of the differences they have within their society .
In conclusion , each country should understand their society well and implement a limit which will best benefit their ageing population and economy .

Fast-aging population remains a precarious global challenge in today's world .
This unprecedented demographical shift with the number of dependent adults surpass the number dependent children envisage serious negative impacts , from declining of work forces and real GDP to sharp increasing of elderly fiscal cost , that will impoverish and subsequently impede developmental growth .
Among all , the astronomical healthcare-cost issues generate most controversial arguments as more chronic degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or arthritis are perceived as an inevitable component which tend to manifest in the later life .
Nonetheless , current research and development as well as policy have preeminently help to alleviate the dire consequences of aging process towards society .
Alzheimer's or Alzheimer Disease is the most common form of dementia mostly diagnosed on people aged 65 and above .
It is well-known as a terminal disease leading to cognitive impairment , memory loss , apraxia , aggression , muscle mass and motor skills deterioration and ultimately death results in complication by external factors .
According to Bonin-Guillaume , Zekry , Giacobini , Gold and Michel  as well as Meek , McKeithan and Schumock  , dementia specifically Alzheimer's is one of the most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States , placing great psychological , physical and economic burden on caregivers and governments .
It is speculated  that the figure of dementia patients in Asia Pacific will quadruple to 65 million by 2050 .
This could be a calamitous tribulation to the nation .
However , scientists are now offering glimmers of hope by making headway on research to diagnose , treat , prevent and optimistically to cure this devastating disease .
For example , last year , Prana Biotechnology in Melbourne  developed PBT2 that targets and reduce beta amyloid , a sticky protein hypothesized to be the cause of Alzheimer's which form plaques that kills brain cells .
Memory and learning behaviours are reported to improve drastically sometimes within hours being given the drug .
Other drugs such as Rember , are announced to delay progression of the disease up to 81 percent while Dimebon promised to power and halt the perishing of brain cells .
.
Researchers also hope to develop early detection methods which will help by prescribing preventive medication before the actual occurrence of the disease .
Critics have argued that though these researches are seemingly impressive and hopeful , there are simply no concrete empirical evidence on their practical significance or effectiveness .
Furthermore , these findings fail to address the exigent issues of aging societies presently facing .
Yet , one should be constantly aware and confident of the actualization of technology's development for a promising future on account from the past .
Also , policies are implemented in attempt to dissolve current concerns .
Despite Scandinavian welfare state such as France , countries like Singapore who have long promulgate self-reliance do adopt certain policy framework for example the 3M's , Medisave , Medishield and Medifund simultaneously with Eldershield to protect and support citizen on the skyrocket Healthcare cost .
Government subsidies on a wide range of intermediate and long-term care services such as community hospitals and dementia care centers are available for patients especially elderly who require continuing care after hospitalization .
Efforts and workshops in collaboration between the Oxford Institute of Ageing and the Singapore Council for Third Age  are launched to educate as well as promote active aging among Singaporeans .
.
An aging population has been an issue in recent years as the increment in social needs of the elderly , public spending and burden on younger generations have governments probe deeper into the situation .
Despite these significant consequences related to an aging population , "They  must realize that any further expansion of retirement benefits would only impoverish future generations and limit future public spending ."
.
As concerns have been raised on the effectiveness of excessive money injected into financing social welfare policies to arrest short term issues , the improper use of public spending will likely create much burden for the next generation .
These measures almost certainly do not benefit the nation in the long run .
Therefore , public spending should be spent on other sectors of the economy beyond the minimum need for social funding .
Public spending on the aged should be limited as money should be spent in other areas such as defense and public infrastructure as they play a more important role in a country's future development .
Currently , most developed nations such as Japan , Singapore and Australia are facing problems of their societies turning grey as numbers working to support the old are dwindling .
This causes social security problems which concern the ability of the young to support a larger number of people .
An aging society causes a smaller working force which results to lesser tax players which might cause in a decline in government fund .
It is not feasible for a country to spend more the elderly when funds have a possibility of decreasing in future years .

Funds should be used more on developing talents instead .
The problem that the aging population is facing right now is the lack of human resource to provide for the total population .
We should now invest in creating and attracting talents , both local and foreigners to reduce the impact of the dwindling working force .
Taking Japan for example , by year 2050 , one in three Japanese will be past their retirement age as average birth rate is reported at 1 .23 babies per woman .
One of the solutions is to do a "replacement migration" where the foreign talents are attracted to replace the lack of human resource in certain countries .
A country can secure these talents by setting aside funds for education , giving bursaries and scholarships to attract foreign students whom will in turn stay and work .
Either than talents , providing high level of security is essential .
There are currently growing fears of terrorism after the September 11 attacks on the twin towers .
Funds should be casted aside for security purposes , such as military technology to protect their people from external threats .
Only by living in a safe country then can one enjoy the benefits of living in a ripe old age .
Moreover , a dwindling population signifies lesser people to defend the country .
Therefore , technology is highly needed to replace the lost of manpower .
However , not all elderly are well supported by their children .
Especially during the wallstreet meltdown in 2008 , many have lost their jobs .
With huge families facing financial crisis , the government will have to stand him to provide for the elderly in need .
Not only that , single elderly that was being abandoned or do not have kids are in a disadvantage as there are no one to support them in anything happens in the future .
Therefore , retirement age should be extended and people should be educated to work longer and save more for their future livelihood .
Elderly should be more independent instead .

As mentioned earlier , one reason why we should not limit the spending is that it may not be fair to the elderly when the public spending is limited as among the elderly , there may be people who are really in great need of the support from the government .
We do know that the older population has a higher chance of facing illness and inconvenience in their physical movements .
Furthermore , based on the Census 2000 data , in Singapore , we have 14 percent of the elderly who only live with their spouse and 12 percent of the elderly do not live with their immediate family .
These elderly are facing problems in their lives .
In this case , they may not have the financial ability to take care of themselves without the help from the government .
Hence , it is the government's duty to come in and render the help to them instead of limiting the help they can receive .
After looking at both sides , we can see that the older population is not a small group of people and the number will continue to increase in number in the future .
Thus , to cater to the needs of the older population , which may also be the largest group of people within the country in the future , it is best not to limit the amount .
Instead , keeping it flexible , to be increased in times of great need will be a better choice .
Our society is aging .
Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing  suggested , "since year 1950 , the average life expectancy has increased by 20 years and is expected to extend a further 10 years by 2050" .
This increase in life expectancy has been said to be the result of better public health care and advances in medical care .
Governments , realizing that there will be profound consequences followed by this global demographic transformation , have now come out with different strategies and policies to ease the aging process .
Nevertheless , the effectiveness of current research and policies in helping to ease the aging process are doubted by the public .
In fact , it calls into the question whether the elderly really benefits from the policy implemented in the aspect of financial security , employment and living arrangements for elderly .
In terms of economics , old age financial support is the government's main concern and therefore mechanism that provides citizens with financial security in old age has been introduced .
For instance , Central Provident Fund  , a comprehensive financial savings plan for the workers has been implemented in Singapore .
Although CPF was aimed to secure the retired elderly by providing income to support their basic need in old age , nonetheless , it has been accused for its deficiency .
Shantakumar 1999 , Asher 1996 and 1998 , Lee 1999 and 2001a , have pointed out the lack of universal coverage and the lack of adequacy of funds for retirement security in this CPF scheme , especially for the low-income elderly  .
Along with the criticism , recent National Survey of Senior Citizens 2005  showed that only 41 .3 per cent of the elderly aged 55 and above had CPF savings and , of these , 61 .6 per cent felt that their CPF savings were inadequate .
Meanwhile , in a study of Asia Times Online  , it showed a recent survey found out less than 5% of the current elderly population rely on CPF disbursements for their livelihood .
All of these prove the failure of CPF scheme in providing a secure future life for most of the elderly .
''Public spending on aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
''I am fully agreed with this statement .
Nowadays , a lot of countries are having aging problem especially advanced counties like Japan , Sweden , Germany , Singapore and United State of America .
This global aging is also starting to intrude some developing nations such as Malaysia and Thailand .
According to the journals 'A Graying World' and 'Doomsday Predications about Population Aging Are Exaggerated' , population aged 65 and older is anticipated to more than double by year 2030 and furthermore median age in many first-world countries will reach between 52 to 54 by 2050 .If the fertility rates do not rise again , the problem will worsen the society .
Demographic changes due to growing aging population will have a serious consequence on health issues .
Governments are forced to spend more money to overcome it .
For instance , Singapore needs to restructure the whole health care system due to the aging population as Singapore Prime Minister mentioned .
However , the funds have to be restricted wisely and diverted to other fields of the country's development .
Firstly , governments have to continue push up the pension age in line with rising life expectancies .
Elder is encouraged to work longer to accumulate more wealth which could be used to support themselves .
Moreover , a tardy or zero fertility rates has increased the importance of elderly workforce in the market .
They could help to boost up economic growth by involving in different kind of sectors .
For some countries with little economic growth , society faces few choices on how to care for those who are least able to care for themselves .
On the other hand , with sufficient economic growth there are more choices and fewer persons in need  .The more elderly workforce in the market , the least governments spending on medical expenditures as well as lower down their pressures on aging problem .
Secondly , money can be diverted to education field in order to educate people or youngsters .
Well educated people tend to have higher incomes and better health generally .
These people are not only helping government to cut down expenditures on health care , but also helping countries to generate more income as well as stabilize economic stability .
That is why a lot of countries are spending in a large portion in education .
To illustrate , education expenditures always occupy in a larger segment in fiscal budget in Singapore and Malaysia .
Besides , public policies that encourage and facilitate education , basic research , and the application of promising technologies can enhance the well-being of current and future generations of older people  .In other words , elites are able to invent more advanced technology in term of accelerate nation development .
In a nut shell , every country needs to consider wisely about public spending on the aged .
Other fields of the country development are important too .
Therefore , governments may have to choose the most sustainable and efficient way to estimate their national budgets .
Growing older is often associated with deteriorating health , economic declination and emotional problems .
Singapore has made legal amendments to improve state provisions which include social programmes for old age and sickness  .
These changes demonstrated how seriously the government has assumed its responsibility in managing its ageing population .
With population ageing being prioritised as a top national agenda , the aging process would certainly be eased substantially .
The Survey of Senior Citizens  showed that although the health status among respondents aged 60 and older was generally good , more than 30 per cent received treatment for some chronic illness .
The majority of respondents had little or no formal education .
About 25 per cent males and 69 per cent females either never married , were widowed or divorced .
Collectively , these findings suggest that the elderly must rely on others for financial and social support .
To provide a wide safety net , the government has implemented several national-level health insurance schemes such as Eldershield , which is targeted at the long-term care needs of individuals aged 40 and over  .
It provides cash benefits to the insured who cannot perform certain unaided activities .
In 2007 , the government announced a new potential Eldershield payout of $28 ,000 , instead of $18 ,000 for up to six years  .
This money is meant to be used to pay for care-giving needs , such as nursing home care .
General practitioners and dentists also provide care to low-income elderly in their neighbourhood at subsidized rates , thus enabling eligible elderly to have access to care near their homes .
These private practitioners are reimbursed by the Ministry of Health .
With these measures in place , the elderly can be assured that they would be cared for and that health care would remain affordable .
Another policy is to ensure Singaporeans are financially secure after retirement .
The Central Provident Fund  has been the state institution to provide economic support to older Singaporeans .
Currently , Singapore's CPF has the highest coverage of any retirement plan in Asia  .
In 2007 , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the age at which individuals can withdraw their minimum sums will be increased from 62 to 65 .
This move will increase the period of time that individual savings can last during retirement .
CPF LIFE was launched this month to provide Singaporeans a lifelong income into old age .
Members will receive a monthly income depending on the cash savings they have in their Retirement Account for as long as they live  .
In addition , for individuals 62 and above , the Housing Development Board will buy back the lease of their apartment and provide a shorter lease of 30 years for the same flat .
There would be two payouts; a lump sum up front and monthly installments for the rest of the individual's life .
All these schemes ensure adults have at least a source of cash income available to them during old age .
However , the main source of financial and emotional support for older persons in Singapore still rests with the family .
Approximately 60 per cent of older adults live in households where other family members pay for all the expenses .
One-fifth of older adults are self sufficient and there is almost no dependence on welfare  .
Additionally , co-residence or living in close proximity to children remains the norm in Singapore .
Only 9 .3 per cent of the 60-plus lived alone or in other arrangements , and 5 .8 per cent lived only with their spouses .
The majority received financial or in-kind support from their children , if these were present  .
Existing policies would be rendered inadequate without the family being responsible for the care of its older members .
Nevertheless , filial obligation should be stressed .
The Government has introduced schemes to encourage Singaporeans to maintain their parents such as the legislation on filial piety , known as the Maintenance of Parents Act  .
Under this scheme , elderly parents who have no other support can claim financial aid from their children .
Taxpayers who maintain their parents or grandparents in Singapore are also given income tax relief .
These social policies should be credited in helping the current generation of older adults cope with the emotional and behavourial challenges of the aging process .
At present , the Singapore government has taken a very proactive role in dealing with population ageing and various policies to enhance the quality of life of older people have been put in place .
However these remain works-in-progress and will continue to be developed in the years ahead .
The effectiveness and relevance of these policies should be evaluated regularly to provide an even better understanding of changing requirements and needs of the elderly .
An aging population has been much talked about in recent years .
Goh  stated that countries like Singapore and Japan who face a fast aging population are expected to have a projected median age of 54 and 55 respectively .
Hauner , Leigh , and Skaarup  believed that countries with a high and rising old-age dependency ratio will expect their age-related spending to escalate by 4 percentage point of GPD over the next 45 years .
As a result , governments and policy makers around the world are ready to set aside a larger portion of their countries' budget to cater for age-related spending , with healthcare for elderly as most of their top priority .
However , to avoid compromising the development of other sectors , it is essential for policy makers to limit this perpetually increasing spending on the elderly by looking into viable alternatives .
Prime Minister Lee  suggested that although it is the government's duty to look after the elderly , children should do their filial duty by taking care of their own parents .
However , some might argue that the burden of their own families and the high cost of living in Singapore make it hard for them to provide for their parents' living expenses .
While this may be true , it is still possible if these working adults can make adjustments to their lifestyles by cutting down on unnecessary expenses like the purchasing of luxury items .
This way , they are able to provide for their parents instead of abandoning them in a home or hospital .
Even though the government can look after the aged , Prime Minister Lee  has pointed out that it is ultimately the warmth and love from the families that they need .
Majority of the elderly are not concerned with how much their children give them instead they are satisfied as long as their children are able to spend time with and show their love and concern for them .
By taking care of their own parents , these working adults can be positive examples for their children .
Under the influence of their parents , these children will be more likely to follow in their footsteps and will voluntarily take care of them when they are old .
Therefore , it is highly encouraged that children should fulfil their filial duty by looking after and caring for their own parents .
Chow  proposed that mandatory medical savings scheme should be implemented in order to tackle the challenges of an aging population and the rising medical costs in Hong Kong .
Critics of this proposal have pointed out that the money set aside for this scheme will go to waste if they pass away even before they can utilize them .
However , governments of many countries have urged that such savings scheme offers protection as health can be unpredictable .
By implementing a mandatory medical savings scheme , its contributors will have a ready sum of money to deal with any hefty medical cost which they may incur when they get older .
This way , it minimizes the chances of them not being able to afford their medical bills , and at the same time reduces the heavy burden on government subsidies .
The scheme does not only provide protection for its contributors .
In addition , a substantial payout from the medical insurance will be awarded if he or she is to encounter any mishap which results in death or any form of disability rendering the contributor unable to work .
This ensures that the family is still able to sustain themselves financially in the event that the contributor is unable to provide for the family .
Hence , implementing a mandatory savings scheme is essential to its contributors , their families and the government .
Countries with a fast aging population face an ongoing battle against the ever increasing welfare and health care costs .
It is therefore crucial that the governments and policy makers do not recklessly sink huge portion of their countries' spending on these areas .
Instead , they should be looking at viable solutions that do not compromise the development of the other sectors .
Therefore , a boundary to the spending on elderly should be set in order to avoid increasing the burden on future generations and upsetting of the development of other key sectors as mentioned earlier .
According to the text , governments are stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow's grown children to support their own elderly parents .
However , such practices are not well performed .
It is crucial for the government to spend money on the aged as not doing so will lead to social problems .
Already , we are seeing a breakdown in extended families .
The young no longer see filial piety as important .
Elderly who are unable to support themselves and are abandoned by their children will have nowhere to turn to if the government turns its back on them .
This will lead to increased crime rates , begging and vagrancy in the country , which is harmful for society .
However , this is not the only area where government spending is required .
As countries spend more money on public spending on the aged , other important sectors such as defense and education may get neglected and become under budgeted .
These sectors are as important as , if not more important than , spending on dealing with an aging population .
For example , facing an ever increasingly challenging global economy , it becomes increasingly important for countries to focus on education to maintain a skilled workforce .
An educated workforce increases productivity , which drives the economy leading to increased wealth .
By increasing public spending on an aging population , governments risk overlooking important areas of the country's development at the expense of the country's overall well being .
Moreover , healthcare cost has been increasing .
The introduction of new technologies and treatments for the aged are relatively expensive .
Governments have been spending too much money on the subsidies to help the aging population .
People may take advantage of government subsidies to pay for the expensive new technologies which are not necessary .
Governments should specify the types of treatments that it considers essential and subsidise these treatment , while leaving non-essential treatment cost to be borne by the consumer .
Limitation of the public spending will make sure government does not overspend on treatment that is not essential so that the money can be diverted to other areas .
It is important that governments plan their finances well to benefit different sectors of the country .
With the growing population of the aged , public spending is increasing so rapidly that governments are losing control of their spending .
Governments should forecast from a wider perspective to ascertain whether the spending is necessary or should the money be diverted to other areas .
Public spending should be controlled to establish a balanced outcome for both the young and the aged .
If the usage of public funds is not well balanced , it will not only affect the country's development , it could put the country's future into jeopardy .
On the other hand , there are also researches done on sickness which most commonly affect the old aged .
Researches on healthcare are being done to help maintain or improve the health of the elderly .
Better solutions are hoped to be found in order to help the elderly on their health issues .
For instant , in the United Kingdom , researches on dementia are being done to find a better solution to cure the patients who are mostly the old aged .
According to Rebecca Wood , the Chief Executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust , the population living with dementia is forecast to double within a generation .
To help ensure less elderly from suffering dementia in the future , researches are now being done by the UK .
Much investment had been put into this research to defeat this sickness which is currently and will continue to haunt the old aged .
Some may argue that these researches do not help to ease the aging process because most of the time money is wasted as the proper solutions is never found although much investment had been dumped to help the researchers .
Although such may argue this way but it is better to try rather than to leave the devastating sickness continue to haunt out older generations .
Besides researches and developments on the field of medicine , social policy also plays a main role in helping to ease the aging process .
Many countries had taken this step to enforced policy and scheme to everyone so that the burden of the elderly can be lighten .
In Japan , the government has imposed the "National Pension Scheme" to all the citizens of the country .
In this scheme , a basic old aged pension is provided to all citizens who are above 65 years of age and have contributed for 25 years or more to the country .
This scheme is helpful to ease the burden of the elderly as it secure the financial need of the elderly .
The old aged can then be independent and they do not need to rely on their children for money .
The old aged can live a comfortable life without worrying or without seeking for financial aid around .
But on the other hand , with these schemes , children need not do their duty to take care of their parents .
This may end up with social problem in a country .
Much younger generation will not be filial to their parents and will not bear the burden to take care of the older generation and will tend to push the burden on the government .
Although such thoughts may arise , but there are not other better ways to guarantee the better life of the old aged .
Clearly , all these researches , developments and policies had helped the aging population to get a better live .
This effort should be continued without fail as this would guarantee the living standard of the old aged .
Thus , having the living standard for the elderly guaranteed , the social problems can also be avoided in a country .
In conclusion , the issue on the "graying world" can be solved and well taken care of if necessary steps are taken to prevent it .
Caring for the aged is definitely an act to be applauded for and encouraged .
Some might have the perception that caring for the aged is the responsibility of the country .
Nothing could be further from the truth; to care for the aged is to be taken upon by respective dependants , such as their children .
In fact , the ideal situation would be that they should actually take the initiative to be responsible for their own welfare .
If the country were to spend entirely caring for the aged , then many would shove responsibilities and indirectly many would also not care for their own health , since the healthy , represented by the country , would care for them .
While it is important to care for the aged , it is just as important to take into consideration and not neglect other areas of the country's development .
Thus public spending on the aged should be limited .
To rely on ourselves would still be the best option rather than relying on others .
For a start , prior planning is crucial where from young , one should not only be active physically but also actively saving .
This would be proved beneficial in the short run , when facing emergencies , or in the long run , when facing retirement .
Policies that encourage skills upgrading have also been introduced to enable the aged to re-enter the workforce .
This is further enhanced with incentives being offered to companies who hire them .
Instead of grieving with regards having to work after reaching the retirement age , they could actually be optimistic and take this as an opportunity to be active in the society where they could sustain or even establish friendships through interactions at work .
Not only could they be able to sustain living through earnings obtained from working , the aged could also keep a healthy mind and body .
Although it would be ideal if the government need not have to be 'burdened' with expenses to care for the aged , it is not feasible .
There are those who are without any dependants and savings to see them through their retirement years .
In addition , it could also be dreadful where they are those who are not well equipped with education or skills to work and who really needs the country's help .
Even so , the country should not be obliged to care for them entirely .
Help given could be in many other forms instead of just monetary value .
With policies such as those that encourage the aged to acquire new skills , the government could also provide aid by compensating the loss in
income during that period of 'learning' .
Although help is given , it is not encouraged for the aged to continuously be reliant on that .
Instead , with the skills acquired , they should 'venture' out and earn a living of their own which would in turn reap many returns in both monetary value and health .
It is also mentioned "work can help us stay physically active , mentally alert , socially connected and financially self-reliant"  .

ADDING LIFE TO YEARS !

A country has to always be ready to meet any form of challenges .
One such challenge in recent times would be the ageing population .
To find a solution to that problem certain amount of the public spending has to be diverted to it .
However an ageing population is not the only concern of any government .
Therefore public spending on the aged should be limited to allow diversion of the funds to other areas of the country's development .
One of the reasons why public spending on the aged should be limited is due to the emergence of other better alternatives .
According to Robert B .Friedland and Laura Summer  the working population would be able to share a large proportion of the responsibility , with the government to take care of the aged .
One of such initiatives would be the baby bonus package which has been introduced in several countries .
In the case of Singapore , the government has increased the cash gift for the first two children from $300 to $400 .
This is one of the long term efforts that the government has decided to invest in so that their public spending on the aged would be reduced in years to come by , as the future working population starts to emerge .
Another temporary measure would be to increase the working population by encouraging immigration into the country .
Canada has experienced the highest per capita immigration rate in the world and expects an increase of 23 .1% of population growth over a period of 25 years  .
An increase in the working population will then allow more resources to be channelled out to other areas which demand such funds .
Thus proving to be a better solution to the problem , allowing the government to limit the public spending and allow fellow citizens to take responsibility .
This ageing population problem can be dealt through a solution which is to increase the working population so as to share the burden with the government to care for the aged .
Public spending should also be limited because areas like R&D need more of such funds to ensure constant progress of the nation .
Without a limit the country would then experience a decline in economic growth .
As such public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
It is an ironic truth that Singapore is facing a demographic challenge as the population aged 65 and oleder is anticipated to more than double by the year 2030 .There is much concern about the current development and policies  , of which older people tend to be the principle beneficiaries .
Many policies for example Maintenance of Parent Act , Baby Bonus Scheme and later retirement agreement have helped to ease the aging process significantly .
Last but not least , an aging population brings about a shrinking workforce  , long-term stagnation and along with it a significant decline in real GDP .
The critical challenge of the government is to ensure the productivity of future workers .
The main root of this problem is because of low birth rate .
The modern parents prefer to have fewer children compared to the past generation .
They claimed that the living cost now is very high and they could not ensure a quality life style with more children .
Therefore , the government introduce the Baby Bonus Scheme which enlighten the financial cost of raising children .
The parents will get a cash gift of up to $4 ,000 each for their first and second child and $6 ,000 each for their third and forth child .
Furthermore , all the children born on or after 17 August 2008 will also enjoy Government contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar matching  .
As a result , the birth rate increases from 2 .1%  to 2 .55%   .
In a long run , it is believed that the Baby Bonus Scheme would increase the population  .
Over the recent years , there has been a large demographic shift in Singapore towards an ageing population .
At present , the median age is 36 .7  and it is estimated that if current demographic trends persist , the median age will rise to 41 years by 2030 , lagging behind only by Japan .
The rapid growth in ageing population brings in controversial issues , one of which is related to the allocation of expenditure for the aged .
A prominent example would be public spending on healthcare , which occupies 4 .5% of Singapore's gross national expenditure .
Although it is one of the lowest expenditure in comparison to other countries , the fast-ageing population makes it difficult for Singapore government not to increase public spending on the aged and allocate more on other areas instead , such as the Research & Development industry .
The three main problems associated with the fast-ageing population point out that public spending should not be limited and allocated to other areas .
They are lower birth rate , rising healthcare development costs to meet growing ageing needs and the economic loss incurred from a neglected ageing society's welfare system .
Next , it is indeed that Singapore is a well-established country coupled with advanced healthcare facilities .
That being said , the majority perceive that current public spending amount on the development of healthcare facilities is sufficient to meet the ageing demands .
On the other hand , this is often not the case .
Singapore faces a sharp shortage of medical specialists in the areas of geriatric field and palliative care , to the extent of importing foreign nurses into the medical industry .
This implies that the government has to invest more on training local medical specialists in these fields to meet the growing ageing needs , thus , more expenditure is required .
Furthermore , hospitals are constantly facing the common problems of shortage of beds and long average waiting time; the major factor of this problem is the geriatric patients .
The geriatric patients are often the ones who occupy majority of the hospital bed space and they suffered from chronic illnesses that require regular follow-up consultations .
Therefore , in the recent 2009 National Day Rally speech , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the need for step-down care such as building more community hospitals , day-care centres as well as nursing homes .
In this way , more competent healthcare is provided to the large ageing demands , since geriatric patients can receive treatment in acute hospitals and then recuperate in the community hospitals .
Therefore , the development of healthcare facilities to meet growing ageing demands would inevitably raise public expenditure on the aged .
All in all , it has become a fact that Singapore is currently facing a fast- ageing population and clearly shows that many problems will arise should public spending on the aged be limited , such as increasing financial burden on the fewer offspring , insufficient funds for rising healthcare development costs and losing of Singapore's economic competiveness .
By establishing the pros and cons of limiting public expenditure on the aged , it would most likely impede the Singapore government from doing so and divert it to other areas because much expenditure is required to remedy these issues .

On November 13 , 2006 , the prime minister of Singapore , PM Lee , said in a speech: "Singapore has treated social welfare as a dirty word .
The opposition and the Worker's Party have called for a permanent unconditional needs-based welfare system .
I think that is an even dirtier five words ."
In Hong Kong , welfare is seen as an individual's responsibility and the government will only step in to help those who are proven incapable of helping themselves  .
The four tiger economics in East Asia; Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan , and South Korea have taken the approach to being a 'light welfare state' , in which they had achieved high standard of living without burdening the state with heavy social expenditures  .
In contrast , the western welfare states that fund heavily on social expenditure have hindered the functioning of private market .
Public spending on the aged should be limited to avoid heavy social expenditures and money can therefore be diverted to other areas for the country's development .
The old age dependency ratio is estimated to increase with longevity and the decline of fertility .
With no limits set on the expenditure of welfare for the aged , a country with an aging society will face enormous financial burdens with regards to the funding of public pension system , expensive healthcare system and long-term dependency expenditures .
The higher the expenditure of a country's welfare , the higher the tax rate will be to finance it .
It may undermine investors' incentive to invest .
Concurrently , Japan is facing financial difficulties in gathering funds for their National Pension and Employee's pension insurance .
The Japanese government is now emphasizing on achieving economic growth rather than increasing welfare expenditures to support it's growing aging society .
The Hong Kong government reluctantly implemented deficit financing from 1998 to 2004 to meet the growing expenditures of caring for the aged .
It is estimated that if the deficit budget continues , Hong Kong's $369 billion fiscal reserves would be wiped out by 2008-2009  .
Instead of limitless spending on the aged , funds should be diverted to develop economic growth , and in turn use the revenues gained to finance aging welfare .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited so as to prevent incurring heavy financial expenditures , and the spreading of the 'welfare diseases' that undermine the incentive to work .
It will not be a feasible plan to drain off money from nation reserves to fill up a bottomless pit .
Money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development to grow revenues in order to support the aging population .
The responsibilities of caring for the aged are divided or relied heavily on private and family sector , to lessen the burden on the state .
Helps are readily available to those who are incapable of providing for themselves .
Aging of population is a summary term for shifts in the age distribution of a population toward older ages .
Thus this refers to an increase in the population's mean age which is generally due to the decline in birth rate and the increase life expectancy  .
Problems associated with aging population will be the increase in social and healthcare cost and lower level of productivity .
As one ages , our body tends to be more vulnerable to healthcare problems , this will add on to the medical cost which requires funding from the government  , thus putting greater stress on the younger generation with increasing taxes .
Moreover , we will also expect a shortage of labor which affects the level of efficiency of the country .
Hence , ongoing medical research  , country's development and government's policies can help to alleviate these problems .
In conclusion , I agree to a large extent that research and government policies implement presently helps to alleviate the aging process .
Developments in the future will be expected to be much improved and better , though aging process is inevitable , it can sure be minimized through many different areas .
The average age of human increases drastically within few years and this has lead to fast aging population and raised concerns of the governments and policy makers .
According to the Health , United States  , from 1900 through 2005 , life expectancy at birth increased from 46 to 75 years for men and from 48 to 80 years for women .
The aging process has caused unprecedented problems and negative impacts to the society especially to the aged which includes health issues as the aged will face a lot of illness when they are become older .
Besides that , the economics of the country face difficulty to support the growing number of the aged as there is many vulnerable aged whom live alone and need assistants from the governments .
Therefore several research , development and policies have been used to ease the aging process to support the dependency of the aged and undeniable there is significant success in the strategies used .
To ease the aging process , governments had put a great effort in research of medicine to provide the best treatment to the aged .
Since there is an obviously advancement in technology when compared to past years , there is more inventions in medicine and equipments to treat the illnesses .
However , some people may think that the aged will not be affordable to pay the treatment fees as better equipments and treatments will increase the costs needed .
To prevent such a situation , governments had founded some insurance schemes to reduce the costs of treatment .
For example , Singapore government had introduced CPF Medisave Scheme and Medishield Scheme which can cover part of the treatment fees: the patient need not pay any deductible for outpatient treatments and Medishield will pay 80% of the actual expenditure up to the claimable limit .
By this , governments ensure that the aged get the proper treatments to reduce the suffering of the aged when facing illness and subsequently ease the aging process .
In addition , community centers or community clubs had their policies to ease the aging process especially to help the aged who do not marriage as they do not have children and live alone or some aged whom live separately with their children .
For instance , An Area Agency on Aging  is designated in each of New Jersey's 21 counties to serve as the primary entity responsible for developing comprehensive , coordinated systems of community-based services for the aged .
It analysis the needs and existing services within the county and prepare a comprehensive plan for the delivery of services to the aged .
The community centers organize some activities such as performances , games and feasts to help them feel less lonely , cheer them up and make them happy and this has eased the aging process in the society .
There is also many enthusiasts and volunteers in the society that are willing to spent their time to accompany the aged as they know that this can give mentally support to the aged .
For a country to do well , the government has to ensure that all areas of its development are well funded .
Healthcare , military , education , and research and development are just some of the key areas affecting a country's development .
With so many issues to be considered , it is certain that the funding available will never be sufficient .
Thus , it has always been a tough choice for the government to decide how much budget should be spent on the various areas of the country's development .
In recent years , the increasing severity of the aging problem has brought about yet another problem that requires action to be taken promptly .
One of the most direct solutions to the aging problem is to allow more public spending on the aged .
However , with the limited budget a country has , it is essential that the more important priorities are first taken care of before large scale policies are implemented to help the aged .
With more emphasis placed on healthcare by governments today and the advancement of our medical technology , people get to live longer .
Cancers are not as deadly as in the past and new vaccines are constantly being developed .
People , including the elderly , are made less vulnerable to the incapacitation of diseases , and in a way , we become biologically stronger .
This also means an increase in the productivity of the aged physically .
McClatchy Newspapers  suggested that with the miracle of modern medicine , 60 might be the new 40 .
However , most treatments do not come cheap and chronic illnesses , especially , take a toll on their finances as people live longer .
"One hospitalisation , for example , a stroke can set you back at tens of thousands of dollars ," as stated by Associate Professor Paulin Straughan , sociologist , National University of Singapore in Channel NewsAsia  .
In fact , most elderly are not rich and many cannot afford the treatments .
Friedland and Summer highlighted that some segments of the aged population might be overlooked and remain very vulnerable .
For this group of people , most governments intervene to help to subsidise for treatments they genuinely need .
Modern governments promise old age security , which ensures that their citizens can fend for themselves during old age .
The approaches , however , may vary from society to society .
In some like The United Kingdom and Canada , government pensions are distributed to the elderly .
In some others such as Singapore , the people are compelled to provide in advance for their old age dependency .
Some societies have laws in place to enforce children to take care of elderly parents .
For example , in Singapore , elderly parents may file in to the court if their children do not provide for them .
However , there are various financial concerns about these methods .
In the case of government pensions , the heavy spending of public fund on the old aged may take a toll on other areas of the nation's development .
Thus a method that works in a society may not work in another and sometimes , multiple approaches have to be taken .
However , better healthcare and protection from government result in rising age expectancy , which is a double-edged sword because on one hand , people live longer as shown in report  and on the other hand , the proportion of aging population increases if the younger generation are not reproducing enough , and this is exactly the trend today in developed nations .
In the fast-paced society nowadays , there are several factors , such as high living cost and late marriage , discouraging people from reproducing "If fertility rates do not rise again , the problem will worsen as the median age in many first-world countries will reach 51 by 2050 ," as claimed by Peterson .
As the number of elderly increases , with a great potion due to the baby boom , there might not be enough young people in the workforce to support the economy and generate enough money for healthcare subsidies and government pension as mentioned previously .
While there are temporary measures to alleviate this problem , such as rising the retirement age and importing foreign workers , the key is still to increase the fertility rate .
The aging process has been eased with the modernization of our society as better healthcare technology and government welfare are available to serve the elderly .
However , this revolution has generated a rising aging population which would be a problem to all levels of the society .
Governments in developed countries should look beyond temporary solutions to rising aging population and focus on getting people to reproduce .
While there are initiatives like maternity welfare and baby bonus to encourage reproduction , I believe more can be done and hope for the better .
Many people have argued that public spending in the aged is a must for countries facing the problem of an aging population as this will have dire social , economical and cultural consequences of the country .
True as it seems , the question posed here is how the government should allocate its resources to cope with this problem .
As the saying goes , 'Give the man a fish and feed him for a day , teaches the man to fish and feed him for a lifetime' .
Therefore , the use of the country's resources should be well diversified to different areas of the country's development so that no one area would be compromised on .
With the implementation of elderly care hugely subsidized by the government , the aged will tend to be reliant of the government on providing for their old age .
This caused the aged to be heavily dependent of the government and thus developed a negative practice of the aged not saving for their own retirement .
It may be objected that the money which is not saved for retirement can be better spent elsewhere .
Adam Smith argues in his book Wealth of Nations that 'each individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment of whatever capital he can command' .
Although it is argued that the 'extra money' that the elderly will possess will be better spent elsewhere , it may not be spent in the most efficient way possible .
Adam Smith also points out that individuals will act in his own advantage , not that of the society .
Therefore , the 'extra money' that the elderly possess at the expense of the government may not result in the most efficient allocation of resources .
By designating the role of the caregiver of the elderly to the government , "Asian values" such as filial piety will be eroded as children would shed the responsibility of taking care of their parents to the government .
It may be objected that these values are innate to one's identity and is not easily influenced or changed by other factors .
However , real life scenarios do actually show that these values can be influenced or eroded .
In Singapore , one is compelled to undertake the role of the caregiver and this compellation is backed up with law , the law of maintenance of parent's act to ensure one fulfills one's filial obligations .
It is true that there are multiple advantages supporting public spending on the aged .
But in view of the many problems that country would face if large amount of public spending are spent of the aged , it is only wise that the government do likewise , to diversify its public spending to other areas of development and strike a balance among the other priorities .
In addition to that , the money that is spent to help the elderly is partially their money which was deducted through tax payment .
Thus , policy makers have the responsibility to provide the elderly with comfortable ageing needs .
The aged should be able to enjoy the social security during their later years .
We have to be conscious that even though they are deem as a liability , they are also part of the nation and shall not be neglected .
Stressing filial responsibility and raising more productive children is a way to support the aged , as suggested by Peterson  .
However , there are certain groups of elderly who are single , children-less , not in good terms with their children or still need to support their 'parasite' adult children .
On top of that , elderly who are disabled and suffering from chronic illnesses would need a large sum of money to relieve themselves from their condition .
They won't be able to get ample financial support from their children and have to depend on the government to provide this assistance .
Even with the assistance of MediSave and MediShield , elderly suffering from terminal illnesses will not be able to pay for their high healthcare cost when these accounts are exhausted  .
Albeit this will create a sense of dependency on the government , it is an unavoidable situation where the government would need to care for its citizens' need .
Here , the emphasis it put on the ethical and constitutional aspect of a nation when they limit this public spending  , preventing the elderly from ageing gracefully .
In a summary , the government should not limit the public spending on elderly and divert it to other areas of the country's development .
This is due to the ascending numbers of elderly in the coming years that we need to deal with  .
These elderly were once the people who had helped in building up the nation and the government should show their compassion and care for this vulnerable group by not restricting public spending on them .
It is vital that the expenditure on elderly is being delegated according to their needs so that wastage can be avoided .
Hence , more elderly can be benefited through this act and it would not be seen as wastage of the country's funds .
The aging processes in Singapore with the ensuing serious impact have drawn our attention .
Aging process requires special attention because due to the low birth rate , Singapore has became an aging country with a large fraction of its population being aged .
The governments are currently carrying out research and implementing policies to help to ease the aging process for both the elderly and country .
Researchers are mainly focusing on healthcare and infrastructure .
The former involves finding out the types of age-related illness that are likely to arise when people reach a certain age and measures that can be taken to reduce the occurrence of the illnesses .
The latter involves developing public facilities that cater to the need of the elderly who are physically weak .
Besides that , various policies have also been introduced to aid the elderly .
These policies include granting subsidies that help to reduce the high cost of living , various HDB schemes to encourages children to live close to their parents as well as the upgrading of housing estate for the elderly .
The research and policies that have been continuously implemented for the aged in Singapore have worked well because of the pragmatic approach that has been taken .
Therefore , although all these approaches provided limited ways in easing the aging process it is still a feasible and practical approach with the current research and policies implemented which had worked fairly well .
Only a small group of the aging population faces the limitations and the government can also come out with other policies to solve the problems so that the approach implemented can workable without any flaws and limitation .
Besides relying on the government , Singaporeans must also pay attention to aging issue and help to play a part to reduce elderly dependence on the government .
For instance , they can help to take care of their aged parent , be a volunteer to contribute to society that is gradually aging and works with the government .
They must put themselves in the elderly's shoe and realize that one day they will also be aged and they will also need the support of their children and others .
It is believed strongly that one will be repaid for their kindness in treating others well .
In reciprocation , they will receive the same treatment one day if they do not treat others well .
Demographic trends across both developed and developing countries reflect that the world population is rapidly ageing .
In Singapore , the increasing life expectancy with the high-quality healthcare and the declining fertility rates are the causes of graying population .
In fact , it has been projected that 20% of the population will be over 65 years old by 2030  .
Besides slow economic growth , the result of an ageing population is the rising pension and healthcare costs , which forces major increase in public spending in Singapore .
Hence , governments and policy- makers face great challenges and implications towards the ageing population .
Nevertheless , despite the fact that the ageing population is likely to hurt public finances , it is crucial to recognize the well-being and livelihood of the aged cannot be compromise by investing in other developments for economic gains .
This is because the elderly has not only contributed significantly to the society; in fact they have many important roles to play .
For instance , they represent the imperative link with our history and tradition which is a crucial source of cultural identity and social stability  .
While Singapore strives to develop itself to become a "world-class" and self-sufficient country , it is equally important for a society to be socially stable and secure .
This paper examines the various reasons for allocating more public spending on the aged as the ageing population continues to grow in Singapore .
Singapore was lauded by economists "for avoiding the pitfalls of erecting an expensive welfare state that diverts government funds from economic development"  .
This is because over the years Singaporeans are encouraged and educated to be financially independent , self-reliant and plan for their old-age so as not to be overly dependent on the government .
For instance , Singapore established its social security through the Central Provident Fund  since 1955 , which is a mandatory savings programme that fund pensions and healthcare for each citizen  .
On the other hand , it was stressed that children should carry out their filial obligations to provide for their ageing parents .
One example would be the passing of Maintenance of Parents Act that allow parents to sue their children for financial support  .
In other words , public spending on the aged can be limited so that the government can pour in more state's fund into other areas of the country's development such as education , research and development  , urban development and upgrading of public housing and transport .
As a result , these ongoing efforts to invest and develop the nation benefits the future generations of all ages .
Nowadays , aging population is increasing and the problem is to be more serious .
In year 2008 , the proportion of the elderly in Singapore is 8 .6% and we estimate the proportion of the elderly in year 2003 to increase to 18 .7% .
From other perspective , an increase in the aging population will lead to an increase in the government spending on the elderly .
According to the statistic , the elderly dependency ratio in Singapore is 11 .9 per 100 in 2008 .
However , public spending on the senior citizens should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of country's development such as taking care of the needy , the unfortunate , the young and infrastructure .
Public funds that are saved can be used to develop the economy because economy growth will increase the citizens' standard of living .
However , resources are limited .
Government cannot choose everything to develop because scarce of resources such as land , fund and worker .
Therefore , the government has to choose the most beneficial areas to invest .
In addition , government can also invest in areas where the profit and social welfare can be improved so that the citizens' standard of living will be increased .
For example , investment will bring more job opportunities to the market due to the economic growth .
Therefore , the citizens have more job options and find it easier to be hired .
Moreover , the citizens can request for higher salaries as the economy has improved .
Higher salaries will encourage citizens to purchase more goods .
Therefore , the citizens' standard of living will be much better compared to the past .
Accumulated public funds can be used to finance research and development .
Research and development is needed to discover new products and processes or to improve existing ones .
New products and technology will benefit the citizens by giving the citizens satisfaction and convenience .
For example , a new invention's medicine for elderly to improve health , electronic wheelchair for handicapped people and robot to take care of the children and elderly .
Moreover , some of the research and development are not only beneficial to the economy but is also environmentally friendly .
Solar power is an example of environmentally friendly technology .
Solar power is an energy source obtainable by converting sunlight into electricity using photocells .
Therefore , environment pollution can be lessened by reduced usage of fuel .
Have you ever asked yourself: How will we live in the old age ?
Who will take care of us: our descendants , ourselves or government ?
Nowadays , more and more people have to concern themselves with these questions as fast aging population is becoming a serious problem with which many countries are confronted .
In my opinion , because there are a lot of effective methods to solve aging problem except medical and welfare programs , government should limit spending on aging population in order to develop prior areas .
Firstly , public spending diverted from the aged to other important areas of the country's development can contribute to promote economic growth .
When the economy grows , fewer old persons need to be help because of the following reasons .
The first point that should be taken into consideration is that the more economic growth is , the more chances the elderly have to find jobs .
As a result , they can cover their everyday needs by themselves .
Moreover , with sufficient economic growth , more services are supplied to care for the old .
For example , people can invite nurse to their home to look after their old parents everyday or the elderly can live in rest home with creature comforts and a lot of care .
So , to ease the aging problem , economic growth should be accentuated .
Last but not least , reducing public spending on the aged helps to stress filial obligation .
Because little medical and welfare programs are launched when decrease government expenditure on the aging population , many people may have not enough money to send their old parents to rest home .
They have to spend more time to take care of their parents by themselves .
So , there are more opportunities for descendants to express their love and gratitude to their parents and grandparents .
As a result , family sentiment is enhanced significantly in the society .
In conclusion , because of enhancing economic growth , ensuring better lives for future generation of older people and stressing filial obligation , limiting public spending on the aged in order to invest in other prior areas of country's development is a good approach to solve global aging problem .
In order to make the most of the limited budget for aging population , government should concentrate to support people who really need aid such as older single women .
The aging population is a common situation in many developed countries .
With the number of elderly increases rapidly , there are numerous problems like deterioration of health .
There is a need for government to focus on these problems , in order to improve the welfare of the aged .
However , this may lead to an issue of whether the government should limit their public fund on the aged .
From my perspective , I agree that it is morally right to spend the money on the aged who had contributed most of their life in national building , instead of limiting the spending .
The public funding spends on the construction of medical infrastructures as well as the building elderly friendly houses are beneficial to all the human beings .
The reason is that the process of aging occurs to everyone .
It is just a matter of time .
Since there is no way to escape aging , the government needs to pay much attention in the issues relating to aging .
During the Singapore national day rally , Prime Minster Lim Hsien Loong pointed out the need to improve the health care system for the aged .
There is a need to make health care more accessible and affordable to the aged .
Therefore , the government had implemented the three M policies -Medifund , MediShield and Medicsave .
In addition , the government is focusing on step down care too .
For example , the co-operation between the Changi general hospital and St Andrew community health care .
These measures help to reduce the expensive medical fee for the aged as well as cater to the needs of the elderly .
These measures will benefits the younger citizens in time to come .
Therefore , it is rather wiser to focus on the aging issue and solve it before it backfires .
On the other side of the coin , if the needs of the elderly are well taken care off , they will still be capable of contributing the society .
The elderly bring years of knowledge , experiences and business contacts with them .
They are just like encyclopedias which provide wise advice for the younger worker who may not be experienced .
In acting as the role of advisor , they will help the company to progress economically .
For example , Lee Kuan Yew , Minister Mentor of Singapore , is still active in the politic by advising the young politicians .
The requirement for Mr . Lee to remain active in the politic is good health .
Thus , it is crucial for the government to spend more public fund in dealing with medical problems of the aged .
In conclusion , the public spending on the aged should not be limited .
Critics may argue that other areas such as education require public funding as well .
I agree that other areas do need public funding , and indeed money have to be spent on it .
However , a developed country will have the ability to take care of all the areas .
Moreover , by taking care of the aged , it will portray the country to be a gracious and caring nation .
This positive impression will in turns attract foreigners to choose the country as one of the destination for pleasure .
This will benefit the country economically .
Aging population is a problem affecting many global countries .
With an increasing aging population , countries will face lower productivity and raises the social and healthcare costs .
Therefore , part of public spending will be placed on the interest of the elderly and the rest will be diverted to other areas of the country's development to help boost the economic growth .
First and forth most , education is one of the aspects that could greatly help to boost a country's economy .
Though it is a long term investment where one takes many years to graduate to be ready to step into the workforce to help generate income for the country , but it is definitely worth the investment .
When government steps in to provide subsidies for eligible students to further their education , the country will have a population with higher qualification as it covers more of those less fortunate families who could not afford the huge amount of school fees as compared to without subsidies .
Coupled with high education system , powerful research and development , and creating business opportunities is not all but part of the key to attract more businesses and foreign talents into a country as people are always interested to work in a vibrant country .
By doing so , a country's development will be improved as there is circulation of wealth when trading is performed .
On the other aspect , if most of the public spending is used on easing the aging process , it will slow down economic growth because it's more of a cost than income for the country .
The cost of building a more suitable healthcare , infrastructure , transportation , housing , pension and financial aid for the elderly is necessary to help ease the aging process as the elderly health and economic value decline , and emotional and social problems rose , but these spending should be limited .
This is because in the long run , if most money is spent on accommodating the older population , there will be little economic growth , and society will face with fewer choices on how to care for those in need  .
On the other hand , with sufficient economic growth , there will be more choices available to help those in need and there will also be fewer persons in need  .
In addition , governments will be able to ensure the continuation of welfare programmes for the elderly .
It is widely known that the source of the government's money comes from the citizens .
Where is all the money invested in ?
It has always been for the development for Singapore and its people .
However , Singapore is faced with an inevitable crisis: a growing aging population that is affecting the country's economy  because of the assistance the government has to render for the elderly .
The elderly has been perceived as the nation's burden .
Should the government pay more attention to a specific group when their children are financially stable and forsake the country's future ?
Hence , I agree that the government should limit their expenditure on the elderly so that money can be focused on other aspects for the country's development .
On the contrary , the elderly need the government to support them and the government should do so .
This is because the elderly do not have the capability to work and fend for themselves .
The cost of medical and healthcare is increasing and this causes problems for families especially those earning a low income .
The cost of living in Singapore is high such that children have resorted to abandon their parents .
As government , it is their responsibility to take care and ensure that their citizens are not suffering and to ease their plight , especially in times of recession .
The elderly had played their part in their younger days by paying for taxes and it is only reasonable for the government to repay them .
With the inflating cost of health care in Singapore , it is inevitable for the government to implement necessary schemes such as Medisave and Medishield .
In conclusion , public spending on the elderly is necessary , however to a certain extent .
We could not rely on the government as they too have other areas of development to look out for .
Furthermore , not every parent is lucky enough to have children who could love them and fulfil their wants and needs .
Instead of helping them with monetary schemes , the government should implement new initiatives such as psychological and emotional support that encourages the elderly to get out of their misery and age actively .
Singapore , well-known for its top city infrastructure , has been ranked 26th in a quality of living survey done by Mercer  .
The criterion for being a city with top infrastructure includes having excellent airport facilities and an extensive transport system  .
Singapore has one of the best education systems in the world , thus attracting students from all over the world .
With regards to the controversies on how public spending should be distributed , the main focus should be on creating a more conducive environment for the old since Singapore's reputation as a global education hub is unrivalled .
The fact remains that education helps individuals gain knowledge and insights to life , which is the basis of civilisation and is vital for a nation's political stability in the long run .
Learning from the mistakes of past politicians , current leaders will avoid making the same blunders .
With proper education , leaders will know which policies are good for the country , when they should be implemented and how long the policy should be in place .
In spite of having a world-renowned education system , the leaders should strive to make improvements instead of just being contented with the current situation .
For instance , the government should adopt a more holistic approach such that the skills learned in classrooms can be adapted to the globalising world .
With its well-reputable education system , the focal point of public spending should instead be placed on the elderly .
The government should aim to provide a better infrastructure for the old as well .
Coming up with the Wellness Programme , "a pilot project to help seniors keep fit mentally and physically"  , is the stepping stone for a more elderly-friendly environment .
This programme comprises of health checks , talks on how to engage the elderly socially , as well as conduct activities that help them adopt healthier lifestyles .
However , this programme is not readily available because it is only set up in 12 constituencies .
In addition , it is only accessible to the elderly in newer estates such as Jurong Central .
This programme is not extended to areas which have a higher concentration of the elderly population , such as Jalan Bukit Merah .
The inculcation of the right values into the elderly would make this programme much more effective .
Instead of enticing the elderly with material benefits such as goody bags for example , motivating the elderly to exercise on their own would sustain interest in the long run .
To maintain the elderly' interest , public spending should ideally be spent on building more facilities island wide so that the elderly need not travel long distances .
The efforts made by our leaders though commendable , is not sufficient to ensure the elderly interests .
More should be done to ensure that they get the appropriate healthcare subsidies and proper facilities for them to stay healthy .
In the future , Singapore may even aim to become one of the best destinations for individuals to retire in .
In this growing society , younger generations are getting more educated .
Unlike in the past , younger generations nowadays are more work oriented .
They are reluctant to set a family and even though they are married , they do not wish to have any children .
They feel that having children will hinder their progress in their careers .
On the other hand , life expectancy rate has increase because people are becoming more affluent .
Thus , aging population is now a rising problem globally .
A very good example will be Japan .
A case study in 2008 have shown that 20% of the population now in Japan is sixty-five years old and above .
By the year of 2030 , the percentage of the population who is sixty-five years old and above will rise to 38 .1% .
Aging population will be a never ending problem in this modern society .
Increasing of public spending on the aged will not be able to solve this problem .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited and the money should be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Firstly , increase of public spending on the aged will only make the aged dependent on the government .
The government should encourage the aged to extend their service to the workforce .
In Singapore , the government extended the retirement age from 62 years old to 65 years old .
People may think that it is time for the aged to enjoy their life because they have slogged for many decades but they do not know most of the aged are still fit and healthy .
If one person is occupied , it is beneficial for their physical well being .
In addition , it will also benefit the country's economy .
It proves that it is not necessary for the government to increase on their budget on the aged if their aged population are able to cope financially .
The money on the other hand can be put in good use by improving on their research and development .
Lastly , policies have been implemented by the countries to help the aged .
In Singapore , the government has enforced individual savings through mandatory Central Provident Funds  , which mandates that the population saves for old age .
However , people might argue that the aged has their children to depend on but this dependence is straining on family ties as average health care cost rise .
Having a saving for them would be a better choice .
Hence , by having this CPF scheme , the government is able to cut down on the spending on the aged and this sum of money could be put to better use by diverting it to the other areas of the country development , thus improving the country economy .
In conclusion , public spending should be limited and divert the money to the other areas of a country development .
Through research and development and having the correct policies , a country not only will take care of their aged , it will also improve its economy .
This wills not only help the present old aged , it will also enable the present generation to be able to enjoy healthy and fulfilling lives into their sunset years without putting a heavy burden on their children and grandchildren .
I agree to a large extent that current policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Being one of the top aging populations in Asia , Singapore has to be prepared for the challenges to be faced currently or in the future when Singapore turns into a prominent ageing society .
In order to take care of the challenges , Singapore government has implemented several policies such as housing , health and employment policies to overcome the obstacles of the aging phenomenon as well as to provide an "effortlessly" aging process .
Last but not least , it is important to make the elderly an asset to the society in Singapore by giving those physically well senior citizens the opportunity to work .
Government has started to put emphasis on the re- training of the older workers to work more efficiently and productively  .
Not only that , government also extended the retirement age of the individuals .
These permit the aged population to continue serving the society and also in certain ways help to build confidence in the elderly .
In any case , a lopsided spending will only compromise progress for other sectors which in turn will lead to other social and economic problems .
First , Education spending is a long term investment that a country cannot neglect .
If our budget over focus on the aged , this will result in insufficient funding for Education which the academic intelligence of the younger generation will be greatly compromised .
This will create a huge economic cost to the country .
When the population is less educated , we can foresee that our country's general growth declining , especially in the area of Research and Development that requires highly educated personnel to function .
We must understand the correlation between economic growth and spending on the aged .
With economic growth , the budget available will increase and we can afford to spend the same portion of the budget yet providing a larger real sum .
Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer  mentioned that with economic growth , there will be a lower demand for government's handouts and there will be more funds made available for elderly welfare programmes .
Thus education , which helps to sustain future economic growth , is an aspect where the spending on the aged must be carefully limited in order to prevent any compromise .
To conclude , we cannot deny the role of government in providing assistance to the elderly , either to show its appreciation or simply to those who are in need .
From Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer  , we know that a group of uneducated or single elderly remains vulnerable as they do not have to means to save up for a decent retirement when they were working .
But we ought to ensure that while our sympathy and appreciation for the aged must remains , we must not overdo it because there are more than just the aged to look after .
Thus spending on the aged is necessary yet it should be carefully limited so as not to compromise other sectors and overall national interest in the long run .

In the modern era , ageing population has become a phenomenon in many countries , especially those which hold records of past baby boom and present low fertility rates , like Singapore and Japan .
This rising trend in the median age of the population has drawn much attention to the welfare benefits of the elderly .
While liberals view social welfare as a legitimate function of government and provision of welfare as citizens' rights , I would beg to differ as a welfare state may end up heading towards a 'bottomless pit'- one which requires relentless public spending , in this case , on the aged and is indifferent to the person's capability in attaining self-sufficiency .
Also , to ensure a nation's continual economic growth and social development , we should utilize much of the fiscal earnings on other areas like investments and education .
Therefore to maintain a healthy balance between various demands and reduce dependency , there should be a boundary set on the public expenditure for eldercare .
Nevertheless , some may argue that it is to one's "entitlement" to receive pension and other forms of material benefits upon retirement CITATION Fer94 \l 1033  .
To deprive one of his privileges is an inhumane act .
Such perspective , in my opinion , would instead create an impression that one can rely on the state at old-age , and result in the sapping of the incentives to work and save for retirement age .
Since an ageing population would translate into a growing number of 'beneficiaries' , the figures of public expenditure would thus be expected to multiply and eventually become such a vast amount that could go beyond the financial capability of the welfare state societies .
To avoid such social repercussion , we should prohibit free-flow expenditure on eldercare that can draw individual dependency on the nation .
In whole , public spending on the aged should not be spent at the expenses of other sectors' progress .
Also , restrictive expenditure will avert the formation of "welfare dependency" but promote the building of a "compassionate society" through family-centred policies CITATION Chu93 \l 1033  .
The concept of a welfare-state should be especially avoided in resources-scared countries like Singapore , because in times of financial difficulties , they will have no resources to tap on but to rely solely on themselves  .To be on safer side , policy-makers should allocate fiscal earnings in a diverse manner , and not solely on maintaining the aged .
Diversion of public spending to other areas the country's development , instead on the aged is a doubtful policy to maintain regional political stability .
Most nations practise democracy that conducts general elections through which a population chooses an individual to hold the formal office  .
Firstly , limiting public spending on the aged will definitely cause disparity on the principle of democracy itself , where the aged are denied their freedoms and rights to be supported by the government although they are the rightful citizens who play the role of voting the government .
It will lead to a less unified country because the aged are provoked and would give fewer reasons for themselves to vote for a ruling government who marginalize them .
Hence , age is a necessary factor for the voters .
A research has shown that young people in India are less likely to vote and the elderly are most likely to vote  .
Additionally , Japan which 20 percent of its population is 65 years or older  hold relatively large voting decisions too .
Political parties are less likely to ignore this essential vote bank in order for them to thrive in the elections .
Secondly , Mark L . Haas of Duquesne University argues that disproportionate high number of young people in a society along with high rates of unemployment creates strong grievances against current political conditions and little stake in society .
He cited a research showing that population ageing has been a source of political stability and economic development in many regions .
In other words , world's ageing population has the potential to defuse war on terrorism .
Diverting funds from the aged to other forms of development will allow growing levels of poverty within the rising ageing population , thus create shaky grounds for the country's political stability , and also create more means to result the funds to military spending .
Public spending on the elderly should be limited .
Some people may argue that limited public spending on the elderly is not a considerate action .
The aged has contributed a lot to form and shape nowadays society .
Limitation in public spending brings a deeper meaning that the government doesn't acknowledge their contributions to the country .
However , this is not entirely true since spending money on other suitable sectors may be a better and perhaps permanent solution to solve this aging problem .
Education is one of the good examples that help to solve this issue more effectively .
It ensures that the young generation is well educated , full of knowledge and able to think critically .
This may indirectly help them to think and spend wisely in their future such that they are less dependent on the government as their future is financially secured .
Besides , instilled moral values remind them of the importance of taking up the filial obligation on their parents .
Moreover , it benefits more citizens rather than the elderly .
For example , it actually helps to ease the poverty problem since the lack of formal education among the poor contributes to the poverty issue directly .
Hence , public spending on the education should be stressed as well since it helps to solve the aging issue more effectively , rather than keep spending money on the elderly where the problems will never meet an end .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited .
It does not mean that the government doesn't take good care of the elderly or doesn't acknowledge their contributions in the past .
However , from another view of perspective , the money diverted on other areas or sectors such as industry , tourism , social work professional associations and education help to form a more rigid and structured society .
Moreover , public spending on these areas has a wider coverage rather than focusing only on the aged .
Hence , for a better future , public spending on the aged should be limited .
The aging issue of population worldwide had never been so pressing until recently the large population of the Baby Boomers generation is due to welcoming their golden years .
As medical facilities and technologies have continued to evolve , so have the lifespan of the modern mortals prolonged .
Global life expectancy at birth , which is estimated to have risen from 58 years in 1970-1975 to 67 years in 2005-2010 , is expected to keep on rising to reach 75 years in 2045-2050  .
Demographic changes due to the rapid aging population will post serious consequences on health issues as well as the economy of the country .
In recognition of this problem , current policies as well as research and development that have been implemented has yield to ease the aging process .
An aging population is often associated with the decline in the workforce and the productivity of the country .
For example , Denton and Spencer  noted that the rate of growth of per capita GDP is certain to fall significantly over the coming decades unless either the immigration rate or the productivity growth rate increases rather dramatically .
It is the aging of population that lies behind this concern  .
Therefore , policies such as Angel Policy 1989 , New Angel Policy 1999 and the "Angel Plan , Plus-One" 2003 have been introduced and implemented in the fast aging Japan to increase the birthrate and expand the workforce of the future as to maintain productivity of the country   .
Size of tomorrow's economy and tax base should be increased by raising more productive children so that the cost burden is spread over a larger and more affluent future generation  .
Another alternative carried out by Japan is to use their advancement in science and technology to curb the aging issues which is the application of robots in their workforce .
Japan has innovatively modified robots to put them in the line of production and service industry as substitutes to their aging workforce .
These two measures have attempt to reduce the reliance of workforce on the aging population and soothe the pressing matter of the aging population .
Although it is a continuous battle against the impact of aging population on our societies , given the support and coordination between the government , Voluntary Welfare Organizations  , community and individuals and through these coherent blueprints of policies and researches mapped out meticulously by governments , the aging process of various countries are believed to be able to be eased , if not overcame .
Although hospitals are built to cater for the elderly and medical science is advancing , the most critical issue is still regarding the high medical cost that patients and families have to worry upon .
To tackle this issue , the government has introduced policies and regularly improving them , like the CPF which consists of the Ordinary Account , Special Account and the 3Ms , which include Medisave , MediShield and Medifund Account , to prepare the citizens for their retirement .
When the citizens of Singapore turn to age 55 , they can withdraw their savings from their CPF .
Besides that , the CPF can also be used to buy a house , cover hospital expenses or for child's education fees .
Medifund caters more to help the needy in paying for their outstanding medical bills .
As a result , the government sees fewer cases of residents unable to afford healthcare and the social medical workers reported the Medifund is enough to cover hospital bills .
Community Centres and Resident Committee Centres are also built in different areas of Singapore to provide recreational activities and programmes for the elderly to participate in .
Infrastructures such as elderly friendly facilities outside HDB flats or in the parks are also specially built for the elderly to encourage them to exercise and keep fit .
Although not all elderly would be willing to use the facilities or take part in activities , the centres do advertising on the activities through banners and flyers or even mass media to encourage the elderly to be active and healthy .
Even though new products like robots are invented , families with a lower financial background may not be able to afford these extra luxuries .
However , these are just extra solutions to help the elderly and bring more convenience to families who can afford them .
Another more practical solution is the introduction of housing grants by the HDB for families who want to live near their parents .
In a way , it is to encourage adult married children to live near their parents so that they can take care of them and attend to their parents' needs conveniently .
The government also encourages adult children to take care of their own parents by pushing filial piety values in them , as there is a limitation on the government to help all elderly because resources like land and workforce are very limited in Singapore .
However in some cases where unfilial children comes in , the government has introduced the "Parents Maintenance Act Law" , to help solve the problem of unfilial children by making them support their elderly parents in a form of paying them a monthly allowance .
In addition to the fear of being burdened by financial issues on the adult married children to take care of their own elderly parents , the government also introduced different policies to help them in other areas like ensuring work security in women who are in maternity leave , baby bonuses and children's Edusave education funds .
The WDA has also come up with retraining and upgrading programmes to ensure and encourage people to hold on to their jobs .
However , we still have the problem on growing aging population due to low birth rates .
In order to deal with this problem , the government has opened up doors to foreign workers to work in Singapore so that they can help increase the workforce productivity , and also for companies to employ more care-givers to help the elderly .
Besides attracting foreign workers , the government has also come up with campaigns and more incentives for married couples to give birth to more children so as to help ease the aging process .
In conclusion , the government has helped ease the aging process by introducing many new policies related to healthcare and laws to support the elderly and also medical advancements and infrastructures to help the needs of the elderly to cope with the aging process .
From the birth to the death , man have experienced huge change continuously which is called aging process and as a result , our society has became older and older .
Not only man , our world has been changing continuously especially in economic sector which is the most important part of making a living .
Thanks to this economic growth , we may escape from worries about hunger and poverty but do we feel insecure about our future when we imagine when we are 70's or 80's ?
Though our world economy has prospered dramatically for about a century , it doesn't seem to have more places for the old as we all focus on achieving hasty economic growth .
Thirdly , someone may argue that people have achieved huge economic growth and the product of that accomplishment results an upgrading of our living standard without uncertainty for the future .
Needless to say , our GDP shows our economic improvement in every year .
Despite of this progress , people in this time don't ready to live without earnings from the jobs .
Because our economy always encourages people to spend all of their money on new products and services not on saving , we are not used to save something for the future .
A concrete example can be a credit card in our wallet .
To get a drastic expansion of the consumption for economic growth , the market created the credit card which can distribute our current consumption to our future to reduce the present burden .
The aim of this maybe good , but this led to the crisis of credit so people suffer from their financial difficulties .
In a nut shell , our economy only has cared about the profit , people cannot prepare for the future by saving and finally the old may experience financial hardship .
Ageing population has been a problem encountered by many countries today .
To date , elderly aged over 65 constitutes 8 .6% of the total population in Singapore , which will see an expected rise to 18 .7% in year 2030 .
Such significant trend has led many to worry over the problems associated with this phenomenon , hence the government had initiated certain policies and developments aimed at helping the elderly .
These initiatives although are beneficial for the aged , government should consider limiting public spending on them to divert money to other areas such as education and development in Singapore .
Spending on the aged should be kept in a smaller proportion as compared to areas such as education .
The younger generations should be the focus and not the aged as they are the ones who will up keep Singapore's standing in the near future .
Prime Minister Lee  at a dialogue with Nanyang Technological University students takes on the perspective that local students should build networks with the rest of the world and integrates in new environment in order to "push the boundaries" and break new grounds for Singapore .
Hence , plans by the ministry should be made to foster greater interaction between local students and international students .
Money should be given aid to needy students who will then not be deprived of a chance to participate in Exchange Program administered by the institution .
These programs enrich a student's soft skills , which is essential for their ability to lead the country in time to come .
Singapore having one of the top education system should continue it's reputation and government should divert money spent on the aged to pump in on refining students , who are the future leaders of Singapore .
Singapore's tourism sector is a lucrative field , which has contributed greatly to the country's economic success , and government should divert money on the aged to this thriving industry .
Since 1996 , the number of tourists coming to Singapore has been increasing steadily with an estimated $14 .8 billion tourist receipts in 2008 .
Tourism has significant contribution in creating more jobs for locals and with the upcoming Marina Sands project , it is expected to thousands of jobs for Singaporeans in this period of economic downturn .
Also , tourism sector have made huge contributions to Singapore's economy , with an estimated $230 billion in 2007 .
All these benefits brought about by tourism must not be underestimated .
Thus , government has to continue improving on its infrastructure and developments for tourism and tourists so as to remain at a competitive edge with other Asian countries .
Hence , funds spent on aged should be limited in lieu of spending it on more beneficial areas for the country .
By limiting public spending on the aged does not render their importance in Singaporeans .
Aged still remain as a figure of respect .
However , instead of hanging onto the past , Singaporeans have to look ahead and plan for the future journey .
Government should reduce the proportion of funds spent on aged facilities and divert it to areas in education and tourism development as these two fields will enable the continual growth for a small nation dependent on it's labor force .
Many countries experience population aging .
In fact , nowadays Singapore population is aging too and it is one of the fastest aging populations in Asia .
There are several developed countries such as Japan , US and Singapore predicting that educated aging boomers will have longer life expectancies than the generations that preceded them .
It is estimated that by 2050 , our median age will be move from 36 to 54 , similar to Japan and Italy .
Recent studies have shown that Singapore has a low rate of population growth due to the declination of birth rates .
Many young couples think that having a baby is too expensive in Singapore .
This situation is not getting any better as more of the population ages .
Thus , there will be fewer younger generations to look after aged people in the future .
In addition , aging population causes a decrease in the workforce .
The decrease will be prominent when the baby boomers reach their retirement age and there will be fewer younger people to replace them .
In such a case , Singapore faces the challenge of developing public policies to accommodate the trend of aging and to gear up for a growing aging population .
Nevertheless , immigration policy is feasible to cope with an aging population .
Immigration policy has helped to ease the aging process .
It has been adopted by many countries especially in Singapore , which faces a serious population challenge .
Notwithstanding of a viable policy , Singapore citizens feel that these new immigrants and foreigners might not benefit them because they will face even more intense competition in the workforce .
However , if Singapore does not adopt immigration process , it will face manpower shortfalls .
As we can see more elderly people retire from the work field in their retirement age and this cause the lacking of productivity in the workforce as well as labour shortage .
Subsequently , labour shortage will bring negative impact on economic as it slows the country's economic growth .
In future years , the economic burden will be increased tremendously due to the aging labour force .
Despite it , these problems could be eliminated as the influx of foreigners through immigration will satisfy the needs of labour market and to boost the economy with improved labour productivity .
Immigration is a possible solution to easing the aging process .
It can help to sustain the overall population size .
By admitting more immigrants , it will help to replenish a country's aging population in the years ahead .
For example , Singapore government has introduced several measures to boost the fertility rate .
One of which is immigration approach , which have attracted many immigrants mainly from China , India , and Malaysia to integrate into our society and their coming have helped to raise the fertility rate .
In effect , more productive children will be raised and there will be sufficient numbers of younger generations to replace those of the older generations as they retire .
Moreover , since there are more young people engaged in the workforce , the elderly in later life will become more secured as they will be supported by the younger generations .
Immigration policy is a practical solution adopted by developed countries with aging societies , namely , Singapore , USA and China .
Nonetheless , some countries are exclusively independent without relying upon immigration to sustain population growth .
For instance , Aging Japan is facing a population crisis as they have the lowest birth rate in the world .
However , Japan is not yet ready to open the country's door to immigrants and the rigidness of Japan's immigration laws has been seen even until now .
As a result , it will lead to the economic problems associated with its graying population .
The shrinking of labour force and the lack of vitality for the workforce will be happening in the near future .
Therefore , Japan needs to ease up on its immigration laws by allowing more foreigners to immigrate , in order to solve the problems .
In conclusion , coping with an aging population will require a long time effort and it is a challenge to a country .
However , this challenge could help to ease the aging process in the long run by adopting immigration process .
Despite it , the government should not only focus on a particular policy in order to resolve the aging problems .
There are others policies that should be taken into consideration , including; family policy , later retirement for elderly , and promoting healthy life styles in resolving problems posed by aging process .
By encountering long term aging process , the government should encourage older population to live an active aging life .
If they are encouraged to be productive , they can be economic contributors as well .
Elderly , who prepare well and early for old age will be more ready for retirement life , then the present generations of people will be able to enjoy meaningful and happily lives , without relying or putting burden on their children .
The aged needs money to cover for their extensive bills , that range from medical purposes to other basic necessities .
In Singapore , it is not uncommon to see the aged works in sectors that are shunned away by the young .
One significant example is the cleaning industry .
It is true that the aged is able to support himself by being financially independent .
However , they receive little salary , which can hardly cover the increasing cost of the medical bills .
Medical technologies have developed to be more advanced and sophisticated over the years .
Thus , the cost of medical purposes is considered as expensive by aged especially those who hold low-income jobs or living alone without the support of the family .
This group should be categorized as the vulnerable group .
Therefore , it is timely for the public to spend their wealth on this group .
The vulnerable group should apply for jobs that are registered under the Workfare Income Supplement  in Ministry of Manpower .
Then , a portion of the income tax from the working individuals should be channeled to help this group .
However , those who are not under WIS will not benefit from public spending .
This is to prevent the syndicate schemes that are on the rise today .
Their target is always on this vulnerable group as they believe that it is relatively easy to manipulate them in order to gain sympathy from the public .
The vulnerable group is usually forced to sell tissue packets and other religious symbols .
Hence , it is important to ensure that the group is well-informed of the policy .
Ideally , the policy should be in four different languages to cater to the understanding of residents .
Thus , if public spending is limited , the vulnerable group will be economically disadvantaged .
In conclusion , the amount of money utilizes to help to ease the burden of the aged should not be limited .
The financial burden and the discrimination faced at the workforce are among the problems that the aged is going through .
There should be a level of awareness to help this aged so that he will age with dignity and pride .
This is because we as individuals , sooner or later will reach at the ageing stage and will want our needs are being taken care of well .
The problems faced by the aged will be a global phenomenon .
Hence , this is where the role of public spending should come in the play of addressing the needs of the aged .
In the middle Ages , most people were lucky if they lived to be 40 years old .
By the end of the 20th century , the average life expectancy had reached the early 70s .
For most of us living today , it is not unusual for us to grow up knowing our grand parents and great-grand parents .
Some people even remember their great-great grand parents .
I strongly agree with the statement that to a large extent , current research and development have helped to ease the aging process .
There are several reasons for this increased aging situation such as this increase in life expectancy .
Through the use of these specific reasons and examples , I will demonstrate why especially in the field of medicine .
Second , people today are more aware of the effect of healthy living on their life expectancy .
For example , even as late at the 1950s , many people were not aware that eating too many large portions of steak and potatoes and other foods rich in carbohydrates and cholesterol could significantly increase their likelihood of a heart attack .
Also , people were not aware of the links between habits such as alcoholism and cigarette smoking and diseases such as liver disease and cancer .
Today , medical research , both traditional and holistic , stresses the importance of healthy eating and exercise in increasing one's life expectancy .
Thus , our increased life expectancy is largely due to advances in medical research .
However , it is also due to people's willingness to accept the results of such research and to apply them by eating better and exercising more .
Many scientists predict that our average life expectancy will slowly continue to increase as medicine finds more cures for diseases that are still terminal today .
If the government places more emphasis on the well-being of the aged instead of nurturing the younger generation , it discourages the younger generation to stay in a particular country .
The country's resources are limited .
Giving more to the elderly means a lesser proportion for the younger generations .
Fewer opportunities , in the form of job security and stability arise from lesser money being diverted to education and development to the economy .
This will lead to emigration and brain drain from the country , which will in turn lose its competitive edge , and thus will be less attractive to investors .
More money should be diverted to education for the development of the younger generation to deal with the problem .
An example is Singapore providing free education and has one of the world's best childcare services and facilities .
However , critics may argue that the elderly have contributed their part to nation building and should not be denied access to government funds .
Nonetheless , the younger generation forms the pillar of a country's economy; more attention should be given to nurturing them .
With an aging population , spending on the elderly is bound to increase .
However , this spending should be limited because the development of certain areas of a country deserves more attention .
This is because a welfare state is not feasible for every nation although it may seem desirable .
In addition , healthcare subsidies should be reduced on the part of the government and transferred to the community in the long run .
Lastly , educating the younger generation is essential to a nation's economic growth .
To conclude , the importance in the development of other areas clearly surpasses that of spending on the elderly .
The issue on aging population has become an increasing important issue in our society today .
The problems caused by aging population are increasing and it has placed great pressure on our society .
Hence , the government is paying more attention to solve these problems caused by aging population through various means .
One of them is to increase the public spending on the aged .
However , some may argue that by doing so it may limit the country's development .
I feel that public spending on the aged should not be limited because the issue on aging population has become a major problem in the society .
Some may argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that it will not limit the country's development .
Other areas of the country's development are equally important and hence government funds should also be directed to these areas such as education and healthcare sectors instead of just focusing on the aged .
Education is equally important because the young will determine the country's development in the future since they would be the ones who will lead the country .
Without proper education , they will not have the ability to compete with other countries and this will hinder the country's development especially in the economic sector .
Hence , the education sector is equally important .
In addition , the healthcare sector is also very important as it can help increase the standard of living of the people .
The health of the people is one of the major considerations when investors chose a country to invest in .
Hence , if the health status of the people is very low , investors may not want to invest in the country and this may affect the economic growth of the country .
Therefore , some may argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that the funds can be diverted to other areas for the country's development .
In addition , public spending on the aged should not be limited as people are having longer life expectancy as compared to the past and they will face larger financial risks of health .
As people live longer , they face more health problems .
With the increasingly expensive healthcare services , they may not be able to afford them .
Even the existing healthcare policies that help people to cope with the expensive healthcare services may not be sufficient .
In Singapore , the government has come up with policies such as Medisave and Medishield to prepare the people by saving a portion of their salary in these accounts .
Hence , when they are ill they are able to use these accounts to pay for their medical bills .
However , with rising costs of healthcare services , the money in these accounts may be used up quickly and therefore they will not be able to afford any more healthcare services .
Therefore , public spending on aged should not be limited .
In recent years , many countries are beginning to face the sticking issue of ageing demographic and undeniably , Singapore is one of the fastest ageing populations in Asia .
Population ageing will bring about social and economic changes , and such a shift in the age structure means that the government has to make amendments to the public spending on the aged .
While it is important to care for the elderly , other areas of the country's development should also be taken into consideration and not to be neglected , so as to achieve a balance in both the social and economic structure of the country .
According to Friedland and Summer  , an ageing demographic will cause serious fiscal problems for publicly-financed health and welfare packages .
Indeed , money has to be spent to curb ageing problems but it is the society's responsibility to ensure a desirable standard of living for the elderly , and to constantly fulfill the varying needs of this group of senior citizens .
The government has to ensure that all elderly has a permanent roof above their head even after retirement , and they could also finance their day-to-day living expenses .
Moreover , with longer life expectancy , it is also important to be certain that the country's health care system is well-structured and sophisticated enough to prepare for an influx of sick elderly , and the cost of health care expenditure also includes the cost of promoting good health .
It is important to promote preventative measures as it will mean less expenditure to take care of people who are sick .
Research and Development is also another important area of a country's development .
In today's context , industry changes in a fast pace and technology gets obsolete very quickly .
It is important to be innovative and constantly produces new ideas in order to stay ahead of competitors and to improve a society's performance .
For example , Research and Development in pharmaceutical is particularly important as the creation of new drugs will help in the advancement of medical and clinical studies .
With more sophisticated health care system , it will in turn helps to reduce medical spending on the age and might even help elderly to sustain good health .
Therefore , it is important to receive incentives and funding from the government to perform Research and Development .
Other than areas in education as well as Research and Development , the defence force should have a share of the public funding too .
Defence not only ensures national security but also maintain peace and stability in the country .
With the increasing threat from terrorism , defence should never be relaxed .
Nothing can be achieved in a chaotic environment , thus it is important to set aside of the public funding to effectively build an army , the navy and the air force .
Many considerations have to be made when it comes to the topic of dividing the public funding .
No doubt that it is essential to take care of the elderly who have contributed much to the society during their younger days , but the government must still ensure that there is enough funding on other areas of the country's development .
Economic growth must never be sacrifice as the society as a whole must progress and achieve further advancement .
Discussion on the Factors that Have Shaped the Space Technology of China "That's one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind" , since Neil Armstrong left the first human impossible on the moon , it has always been a dream for human beings to explore more about the outer space .
As a country possesses over five thousand years history , China never stops seeking the outer space .
In 1999 , 2001 and 2002 , China successfully launched in succession three experimental unmanned spaceships .
Later on 15th October 2003 , the first manned spaceship had been sent to the outer space .
Until now China has already launched 3 manned spaceships and over 30 artificial satellites are working on the earth orbit .
Moreover the Chinese government is proposing a plan that will send spaceship to the moon and built an observation station on the moon .
Currently China has become the third strongest country in terms of the space technology , only after the America and Russia .
But how and why could China achieve these goals as a developing country ?
In this essay , I will explain this issue from two aspects , the economic factors and the military demands .
First come first , the development of space technology is a basic need of economic boost .
China is undergoing a rapid development in economy .
Among all the Hi-tech industries , the information industry is the most important part .
For a country which has an area of 960million square kilometer , enough communication satellites are the first security for the information communication , which then provides a good environment for the development of economy .
For example , until 1994 China had built 8100 telecommunications systems , 11 satellites TV broadcast systems and 30 radio broadcast system in response to the needs of communication for the remote areas in China , such as the Xinjiang province , Inner Mongolia , and Yunnan province .
Currently 80% area of China is covered with the communication satellites not only for the TV broadcast but also for the world wide webcast .
The innovation of the space technology is an indirect result of the development in economy of China .
Second , the military force of China needs the support of the space technology .
Most of today's military device needs the guide of artificial satellite .
As the deterrence policy and capability to meet the new threat , China has developed several kinds of precision guild weapon and nuclear missile .
All these weapons have to be guided by artificial satellites .
Except for the military device , the natural resources of the outer space are also important for military aims  .
The earlier China lands its spacecraft on the moon , the earlier China can begin to use the natural resources .
The resources of the outer space would be a great support for the continuous development of Chinese military force .
General speaking , the development of space technology is a certain result of the economic development and military development in China .
With the economic and military forces developing , the space technology will develop in response to it .
When the space technology has reached a certain level , the economic and military forces will achieve a higher goal .
Under such circuit , Chinese will finally stand on the place where Neil Armstrong has once stood .
When one accepts a new product , the first thing come to mind is "How to use it ?" .
The next question that will appear to the mind is "What is the easiest way to operate it ?" .
Hence , an invention which is easy to use should be given priority .
Nowadays most people are living in a hectic life .
An invention which is easy to use is very important to help them to reduce the time consumed yet achieve the effectiveness of the product .
For example , a laptop , which is simple to operate , helps the owner to collect lots of the information from the internet just in a short while .
This helps to reduce the time consumed to find the information from the thick books in the library .
An oven , which is also easy to operate , helps human to cook food in a short time .
If the way to operate a product is complicated , human will prefer not to use it because the time spent in operating the product is not worth to be wasted .
When the people are not using the designed product , there is no point designing the product .
Therefore , designing a product which is simple to operate is very important .
To design a product which fulfills the human needs mentioned , there are five steps to solve the design problems .
Firstly , define the problem and recognize the needs of the new product .
The main problem now is to create products that are simple to operate .
A clear definition of the problem is important because different problems require different solutions .
Second , gather pertinent information .
All the information has to be collected before going further into process .
The information resources can be searched from traditional publications , scientific encyclopedia , technical handbook , electronic catalog and the internet .
Next , generate multiple solutions .
This step begins with creativity in generating new ideas that may solve the problem .
Engineers should not be afraid to try new experiences or ideas .
Then , analyze and select a solution .
The solutions that are conceived need to be analyzed and decision has to be made on which solution is the best suited for implementation .
Finally , test and implement the solution .
Implementation refers to the testing , construction , and manufacturing of the solution to the design problem .
Several methods of implementation as well as distinct activities that occur during implementation must be considered when testing is done . 
In conclusion , inventing a product which is easy and require less human effort to operate is essential .
The five steps in engineering design process should be well-followed to produce a good product and fulfill the human needs .
The development of technologies from the context of the innovation-development process may be observed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view .
Technology determinism proposes the perspective that technology progresses along its own path , independent of social development .
In other words , technology has an effect on society but society does not affect technology .
Another perspective is social determinism , also known as social constructivism , which supports that society influences and shapes technology , and not vice versa .
One important technology which was socially determined is the mobile phone .
There are several factors that contributed to the shaping of this technological innovation .
The first factor that shaped the mobile phone technology is the market forces .
Initially when mobile phones were created , the society's demand for them was low .
There are several reasons to this situation .
Early mobile phones were heavy , bulky and expensive with very low coverage .
The demand was still there because there were those who could afford it and mobile phones were important to those who were always on the go .
In the 1990s , the number of mobile phone subscribers was initially almost zero , but it shot up to half a billion people around the world in a very short period of time .
The society had demands for cheaper and more portable mobile phones and thus , innovations came about .
Mobile phones came in more light-weight and smaller sizes .
There were also demands to turn mobile phones into entertainment and portable office tools devices .
Mobile phones now have many funky designs and added features like music players , cameras and e-mail readers .
Secondly , personal communication is also one of the factors that shaped this technology .
People want to get connected with the world in the simplest and easiest way , and with mobile phones , they can do so almost anytime , anywhere .
Keeping in touch with friends became much easier .
Short calls help in bonding relationships as it portrays that the caller is concerned enough to give a call even on a busy day .
The internet is also an important communication medium and with that , mobile phones can now connect into the internet .
With the internet , people can get instant access to information online by just typing out the keywords and press 'Search' on their touchscreen mobile phones .
Mobile phones can also be used for entertainment purposes .
For example , there are songs and videos available online and they can be downloaded directly into the mobile phone for listening or watching .
Another factor that shaped the mobile phone technology is personal display .
For some people , the mobile phone is like an extension of their external self and they feel incomplete without one .
The ability to customise one's own mobile phone according to their preferences came from this so that each person could display their selves through their mobile phones .
With this , mobile phones became more like a fashion accessory and trends were created .
In conclusion , most people cannot survive without a mobile phone now .
It could be good or bad but research on the impact of mobile phones on the society is still ongoing .
One thing for sure is that mobile phones have changed the way the society lives .
Problem 1: Inadequate technologically inclined talents 
Singapore , a country with only 4 .4 million population , she has not enough professionals in the field of technology and scientific as most technological innovations are created by scientific research  .
When manpower is the fundamental element of any process , without sufficient quality manpower , the commencement of processes is already hindered .
In short , this problem will hit hard directly on the first step of innovation , 'needs/problems' , referring to figure 1 below .
As the world become more IT savvy , Singapore needs to set her foot onto the technological industries .
The easiest way to recruit technologically inclined talent is attracting foreign professionals .
Singapore does this by giving scholarships to foreign students from IT- savvy countries like India , Bangalore .
This act will effectively increase the quantity of technicians , allowing the kickoff of innovation process temporary .
However our heavy reliance on foreign talents will put Singapore in a vulnerable position in the long run where the foreigners do not have loyalty towards Singapore .
To reduce this over- reliance , Singapore has been taking careful measures in her education system , for instance her first IT Masterplan for education  in 1997  , ensuring that Singaporeans have sufficient IT skills for future endeavors .
Problem 2: Adverse societal attitude towards failure
In conclusion , if Singapore is to survive in the high risk volatility of the global economy , more pervasive idea generation skills throughout the population  is required for innovation process to begin .
Education should not only focus on producing 'exam-smart' students but also those who that can react flexibly with the changes and needs of the current society .
At the same time , society should also give ample supports to this creative thinker of our civilization .
However , we should know that for these problems to be solved , it will require long term investment and there will certainly be some factors that cannot be completely unraveled .
Appendix Figures and diagrams
Malaysia is generally a failure in terms of innovations .
According to E .M . Rogers in "The Generation of Innovations" , the six main stages in the innovation-decision process are the needs/problems , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption , and last but not least the consequences .
However , in Malaysia , this process often ceases at the first stage , which is the problems .
Even if there is research done , the effort being put in is insignificant at all .
The main cause to this phenomenon is the ineffectiveness of the current education system in Malaysia .
The education system in Malaysia is typically exam-based .
All students are educated to pass or get high scores in their examinations .
In other words , schools are producing machines that study for the sake of examinations .
They don't know how to apply their knowledge .
They don't know how to improve things that they are taught .
They just receive everything blindly .
Under such circumstances , it is totally not surprising that younger generation usually do not have the ability to cope with problems that they have never faced before .
At most , they can only deal with problems whose solutions have already been identified and proven to work successfully .
Upon facing new problems that they never encounter , they will just give up and take other short-cuts instead .
That's why the whole process of innovations tends to stop after problems or needs arising .
By chance the process might proceed to the research and development state but that is where more and more problems and troubles will appear and try to block the way out .
How many of them can survive all the way through the six stages mentioned above ?
Another factor that contributes to Malaysia's failure is the policy played by the government .
In order to gain political advantages , the government or the ruling party has applied plenty of policies and acts to constraint the freedom of individuals in giving opinions .
Mass media in Malaysia might be seen to have a lot of freedom in reporting news and views but the truth is that they are all being controlled behind the veil .
Wondering how all these connected with innovations ?
There is an invisible link .
If you are the government , what will you do if problems arising in your country ?
What if more and more problems keep on coming out ?
Try to find solutions for all the problems ?
No way !
The solution is most probably trying to conceal the problems from the public .
With most of the mass media under their surveillance , they will try their best to block all the negative issues and scandals that might threaten their position as the ruling party .
Since problem is the first stage of the generation of innovation , the government is actually blocking the entire flow of process innovation .
Country ruled under such government will certainly have very limited evolution in terms of creativity and innovation .
Does this make things clear enough now ?
As the conclusion , the government plays an important role in deciding the overall development of innovation and innovative design of a country .
Sadly , my home country , Malaysia , is not a very good example to be followed by others .
Hopefully , Malaysia will become a famous country for its people's innovation and creativity in the future .
The world today has become more sophisticated and problems in our society are created , most of the time , by humans from the results of their innovations and inventions .
However , these inventions do not appear out of nothing; it is the result of bringing together technologies and systems to solve our problems and to improve human needs .
All the products and systems humans are enjoying now are the results of human effort to improve our society .
But one thing is for sure - our Earth resource is depleting and engineers , being the problem solvers , have to come up with ideas to reduce fuel consumption and the risk of greenhouse effect and global warming .
All these harmful effects bring us to this certain human need that should be given the utmost priority health .
There is more than one solution to any engineering problems .
Before further research can be done , collection of data that is related to the problem is needed to narrow the solutions for engineers to work on .
Details such as whether the issue of global warming is real has to be consolidated before ideas , such as to replace our motorcars with hybrid cars can be generated .
Solutions to engineering design problems do not magically appear .
Ideas are generated when people are free to take risks and make mistakes .
Brainstorming at this stage is often a team effort when people from different diversities are involved in generating multiple solutions to the problem .
Questions have to be asked and certain pointers have to be fulfilled and established .
The pros and cons of a solution have to be worked through and analyzed to select the best solution .
The final phase of the design process is implementation , which refers to the testing and manufacturing of the solution to the design problem .
The solution has to be fine-tuned as much as possible .
Product or systems has to go under a real condition test .
Graphs and charts , and information pertaining to the testing have to be recorded and reported to understand what has created .
The ability to communicate and sell an idea is an critical skill in engineering design .
Last but not least , the solution is implemented and a patent , which protects the idea from copyright infringement , has to be applied to develop an original and novel solution to a design problem .
In conclusion , engineering design process helps to meet human needs by the identification and the analysis of the processes .
Design activity occurs over a period of time and requires a step-by-step methodology .
The solution to a design problem does not appear out of nowhere .
There are as many processes of design as there are engineers .
However , since design problems are usually not defined properly and can have a great number of correct answers , the process may require backtracking and iteration .
To sum it all , it is best that common sense comes into play when certain steps do not play a part in the engineering design process .
Nowadays , the technology of developing alternative and renewable sources of energy is rapidly gaining popularity due to its many advantages over the traditional sources of energy .
They are the supply of traditional source of fuels , such as coal , petroleum and natural gas which are known as non-renewable fuels .
Alternative and renewable fuels include both biofuels and hydrogen fuel .
Biofuels are obtained from living or lifeless organisms CITATION Tsc07 \l 1033  , and it may be in solid , liquid or gaseous forms; plant oil , ethanol and biodiesel are all examples of biofuels .
Hydrogen fuel refers to using hydrogen gas as an energy carrier CITATION Ram09 \l 1033  .
The reason for the rapid development of alternative technology and renewable fuels are primarily based on four causes: environmental safety , future sustainability , economic benefit and geo-political stability .
First and foremost , renewable fuels are much more environmentally friendly compared with fossil fuels .
Fossil fuels like coal and petroleum produces a large amount of carbon-based polluting agents and greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming .
In contrast , alternative and renewable fuels produce significantly less carbon-based pollutants .
Let us make ethanol an example .
"Ethanol contains 35% oxygen" CITATION Hel09 \l 1033  , this high percentage of oxygen , allows for a more complete combustion , thus reducing the harmful emissions .
In fact , ethanol reduces exhaust carbon monoxide and toxic emissions by 30% CITATION Hel09 \l 1033  .
The mankind's battle against climate change is the catalyst that has fueled the search for the renewable sources of energy; it's one of the few positive impacts of the global catastrophe that we are heading to .
The greatest secret to the success of alternative fuels is the fact that is it renewable .
There is an abundant supply of sources of biofuels and hydrogen fuels .
Unlike alternative fuels , the fossil fuels are finite resource .
They are destined to finish someday .
They take millions of years to replenish and are used up at a strikingly hasty rate .
At the current rate of consumption , all the natural gas and petroleum will be used up in less than 50 years CITATION Tan07 \l 1033  .
However , our daily life depends a lot on fossil fuels as a source of energy .
It is impossible to imagine a world without them; this leaves us with another ethical issue to chew-on: is it fair to take away the luxuries of fossil fuels for the future generations ?
Therefore , renewable fuels are the key to the sustainability of our future .
Furthermore , alternative and renewable fuels are less expensive than fossil fuels .
Due to the shortage of petroleum and the ever-increasing dependence on it , the price of crude oil will keep continue to go higher .
In comparison with fossil fuels , renewable fuels will be much cheaper and more stable due to their wide availability no freight cost .
Hence , affordability and market stability are other factors that project the usability and usefulness and renewable resources .
Last but not least , alternative fuels do not rely on oil from Middle Eastern , owing to the advanced technology used to make renewable fuels opens up an entire dimension of ethicality .
The technology can build country energy independence , and thus regional geo-political stability .
It is an indispensable asset that many countries strongly support and endeavor to adopt .
After analysing the topic , I understand the main issue is about the problems and obstacles which slow down engineering design processes moving for innovations , and the place I will discuss about is my own country China .
I should be able to interpret two of these significant problems and analyse their influences on certain stages of the process .
So now it is time to come up with some specific problems hampering engineering innovations in my own country .
China has been through a great many of innovations and revolutions during the past few decades , and there were indeed some problems which people of China encountered during those innovation periods .
As the aviation industry is a significant symbol of a country's strength and a vital sign of the level of a country's industrialization , I would like to dig further into this aspect .
The following is the essay:
Do you know when the first time that China created its own aircraft was ?
The first aircraft that was created all by China was finished on 30th of July in 1923; 26 years before China become independent .
It was on that very day that China , the "huge dragon" was added the wings .
Furthermore , the aviation industry of China got developed rapidly later on and China is able to produce many kinds of aircraft with high-tech now .
However , things were not always going well .
In the first place , it was quite a challenge for China to set up its manufactories to produce planes in a rather big scale because of the lack of resources and equipments; then the situation of unstable state of government emerged and dragged back the total industry dramatically .
Quite early in the 1910s , the government of China started to prepare for setting up aircraft manufactories .
The engineers tried so hard that they were able to design the first aircraft in 1923 .
However , till 1949 , there were only over a dozen of small manufactories with shabby devices and few planes were produced .
Worse , the necessary raw materials , processed tools and accessory and advanced equipments were all depending on import from other countries , let alone setting up an independent aircraft manufacturing system .
The problem really stunned the aviation industry for a while .
After China got independent , under the cheerful care and proper guidance of Chairman Mao and some other leaders of China , the aviation industry started to enjoy a pleasant time .
The government spent a lot of money sending engineers to study advanced technologies and importing expects from abroad; the other various industries of China all give a great support to the aviation industry , especially by providing resources and funds .
In a few years time , China's aviation industry grew from small to rather large and became able to produce aircrafts of many kinds .
As the pleasant time moved on , in 1953 China was able to make its first five years plan for its aviation industry .
The government guaranteed a lot of labours , materials and funds for the industry and the engineers and workers showed much initiative and creativity in work .
However , after the great success of the first five year plan , in 1958 a dim and disordered period of governance arrived .
A three year of "The Great Leap Forward" took place .
The government began to think that the industries of China had already developed so well that the government started to require the industries to pursue higher quality , huge plans and vigorously speed of construction blindly , which in turn induced many serious quality problems .
Worse , taking advantage of this , reactionaries inner the government planed some sabotage in order to achieve their own goals .
As a consequence , a huge lost was caused to the whole industry .
Fortunately , people started to realize how wrong those guidance were and crush the reactionaries .
The aviation industry kept stick to a solid and standard guideline when producing aircrafts and production gradually recovered .
From then on , some new aircrafts were invented and the industry went on well .
First of all , in my opinion , the hugest problem throughout all the innovations will be lack of certain resources , raw materials , some necessary tools and high-tech devices or equipments .
The next significant one is that the Chinese government used to be unstable and giving some wrong guidances so that some vast lost were caused to the industry .
There are some other problems such as lack of help from some developed countries , lack of engineers with brilliant knowledge and conflicts between conventional Chinese culture and western cultures in terms of some certain designs which are not so essential , so they are not discussed in this essay .
Here are the aspects of engineering designs for innovation of China that I have thought of:
* Aviation industry .
* Automotive industry .
* Petroleum industry .
* Catalyst industry .
* Iron and steel industry .
* Chemical industry .
The world that we are living in today has been shaped by many technologies , people and cultures .
One of such important technologies is the wireless communications technology .
Wireless communication is the transmission of data or information using electromagnetic waves or radio frequency without using physical wires .
The growth of this technology is unprecedented especially in this new millennium .
All over the world we will see that there are many devices that use this technology .
It is almost impossible not to find any devices in our homes and offices today that use this technology .
For example , the remote controllers which help us to switch on or off our televisions , lightings , security alarm systems of our cars and homes and the opening and closing our auto-gates use the wireless communication technology .
Besides these , other examples of devices that use this technology are devices that use the Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , Wi-Max , wireless LAN , mobile phones , etc .
Life would not have been as easy and as enjoyable without these devices .
Thanks to the many inventors , researchers , developers and governmental agencies that have helped to make these products available to the general public .
The evolution of this technology is somewhat driven by the social needs .
For example , the precursor to Wi-Fi was invented in 1991 by NCR Corporation for its wireless cash registers .
Today , because of the growing demand of high-speed broadband internet connections , in areas where cabling cannot be run such as the outdoors and historical buildings the use of Wi-Fi is a good solution .
The use of radio frequency technology to transmit information is governed by strict regulations .
In each country , the development , import or sales of these devices are governed by special governmental bodies .
For example , in United States it is governed by the Federal Communications Commission  , in Singapore by the Info-Communications Development Authorities of Singapore and in Malaysia by the Malaysian Communications & Multimedia Commission .
Many of these wireless devices would not have existed if our governmental policies do not change to encourage innovation .
For example , in 1985 , a decision by the FCC of United States to open several bands of wireless spectrum , so-called "garbage bands"  without the need for government license has spawned growth in R&D in that area .
Originally , these garbage bands were allocated for equipments that use radio-frequency energy for purposes other than communications  .
Due to this decision many "unlicensed" wireless technology products for communication purposes were developed , such as the Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , Wi-Max applications which operated using the spectrum of the garbage band .
Unlicensed wireless devices are devices that emit low power radio frequency energy which are permitted without specific device or user authorization either through registration or grant of a license .
This is because these devices have low probability of causing harmful interference to the users .
Hence , unlicensed devices are free from the usual delay and cost associated with approval of the licensing process .
This policy has great economics significance .
The chain effect is that it encourages innovation to develop new communication products which help to fill consumers' needs , which in turn helps to generate jobs in manufacturing of these products , logistic costs for transportation of these products to various countries around the globe and finally sales of these products to the end consumers .
Engineers rarely identify a "need" but rather let the society discover it .
"Need" here refers to a desire or shortage of a good , and sometimes this "need" can be considered as a neccessity or a form of luxury .
For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi , an engineer from Toshiba Corporation , saw the need for portable personal computers and came up with the idea of laptop; and as of current , one of the human needs that seek unremitting attention would be transportation .
Based on a study in the U .S done by Ecobridge , about 33% of carbon dioxide emission comes from the burning of gasoline in internal-combustion engines of cars and trucks .
As the struggle between man versus nature continues to be unabated , it is the engineers' job to design cars that are environmental-friendly to mitigate what has already been done to our environment .
According to Khandani  , the engineering design process can be used to tackle such needs .
First of all , we have to define the problem clearly .
The process of defining a problem involves identifying a need , developing a problem statement and establishing a criteria for success .
It must be clear , concise and unambiguous to prevent any off-track .
Next , it would be to gather pertinent information regarding environmental-friendly cars .
This can be done through the use of internet , library or even encyclopedias .
According to Khandani , gathering pertinent information can reveal facts about the problem which might in turn result in a redefinition of the problem .
Subsequently , it would be to generate multiple solutions .
Creativity is one of the biggest emphasis in this step in order to generate techincal solutions to the problem .
Team brainstorming sessions are also conducted to develop multiple solutions , reckoning on team dynamics .
Engineers must also be willing to take risk and make mistakes , and not to be afraid of being criticized for their ideas .
For example , the team that invented hydrogen fueled cars faced several setbacks before they could attain their goal .
Lastly , it would be to select a solution and implement it .
Analysis of all possible solutions are to be done and reasons of why the final solution overrides the others must be clear .
In the design of environmental-friendly cars , it must be in a way that , the design of this car would be less polluting than the current ones , coupled with lower price and better performance .
In conclusion , engineers today now shoulder the responsibility of striking a balance between man and nature .
Greenhouse emissions must be put to the lowest level as much as possible .
Designing a car that reduces greenhouse emissions significantly definitely poses a great challenge to them , and they should use engineering design process to help them in designing .
Nonetheless , at the rate of how man has been working on this , one can expect to see a big leap in car designs in the coming years .
"Eureka !"
exclaimed Archimedes , Greek mathematician and physicists , when he noticed water flowing out of his bath tub as he submerged himself into the tub .
This incident gave him an idea to later formulate the Archimedes principle .
Is the Archimedes principle considered research or serendipitous ?
At times , it can be quite ambiguous .
The Archimedes principle may seem more like a lucky incident which results in the formulation of a grand idea .
However , it was research and experiments that proved the Archimedes principle to be true .
We can define research technology as a technology based on deliberate examinations and careful analysis , and serendipitous technology as a technology found purely by luck .
Despite their differences in definition , a research technology and a serendipitous technology both share a common similarity; the technology is ultimately used to tackle the problems of Man .
In the past before the discovery of the space pen , astronauts had difficulty in writing their discoveries with the normal pens as they resulted in leaks in zero gravity space .
Pencils were also strongly avoided as the lead posed a danger in space .
American industrialist and pen manufacturer Paul C .  saw that this was a problem and started working on producing a pen that would allow astronauts to be able to write their discoveries in extreme environments and temperatures .
After years of gruelling research and analysis , the space pen was finally produced .
The same goes for Teflon , which was discovered by chemist Roy Plunkett .
As Teflon is considered to be one of the most slippery substances , it is widely used as a lubricant in the manufacturing industry and as a coating for production tubes in the pharmaceutical industry .
The technology is also used as a repellent against spills and dirt for fabrics , and under the brand name Tefal , the product is used in cooking wares , non-stick pots and pans .
However , despite their similarity in resolving problems of Man , the two technologies also share one difference; the process in which it was discovered .
This would define a research technology from a serendipitous one .
As mentioned above , the invention of the space pen occurred because Fisher realised that astronauts were not able to pen their findings with a typical pen or a pencil .
He saw a need to assist Man in this area , and worked towards producing the ultimate pen .
We cannot say the same for Teflon .
Plunkett's initial aim was to produce a refrigerant that has better thermodynamic properties and safety measures .
He had a different goal .
He was not looking at producing a slippery lubricant and saw another set of problems that had nothing to do with Teflon .
To put it simply , he had no aim to discover Teflon .
Plunkett's accidental finding only occurred when he was testing the chemical reactions of gaseous tetrafluoroethylene   .
In conclusion , both research and serendipitous technologies share differences in their definitions and the process in which they are discovered .
However , regardless of that fact , both technologies serve an ultimate purpose to provide a much better , easier , and safer environment for Man to work in .
Do you not yearn for the latest gadgets like , PS3 , iPhone ?
Throughout history , we , mankind had always sought to improve the quality of our lives .
We have consistently created solutions to suit our needs and wants .
We have progressed much since the Stone Age .
Nowadays , electricity has become a key ingredient in our life .
Electricity is a form of energy that is generated mainly from burning fossil fuels .
However , fossil fuels are running out !
Singapore has no other natural resources , hence , our most urgent need will be to find a reliable source of sustainable energy .
According to Khandani  , the design process consists of five main parts: Defining the problem , gathering required information , generating multiple solutions , selecting a solution and testining of the solution .
The problem is obvious .
Crude oil , a fossil fuel , might run out in fifty years .
There are a few alternate energy sources apart from fossil fuels .
A simple search yields the following sources: Solar energy , hydroelectricity and wind energy .
Solar energy is harnessed through photovoltaic process when the sunlight hits solar panels .
This process generates electricity .
Hydroelectricity uses moving water to spin turbines , creating energy .
A hydroelectric dam will need to be built to harness this form of energy .
Wind energy utilizes the kinetic energy of moving winds to spin blades .
These blades are connected to a generator which will generate electricity when the blades are spun .
These three sources are the most commonly found alternate energy sources .
Solar energy will be the best alternate energy source for Singapore .
Hydroelectricity and wind energy will not be feasible in this island state .
Hydroelectricity requires a large body of water which is not available in Singapore .
Wind energy requires a vast open area to place the windmills , Singapore does not have such space to spare .
Solar energy , on the other hand , is easier to harness .
The infrastructure required is much simpler , only the solar panels and necessary wirings are needed .
The panels come in many sizes which gives flexibility in positioning them .
Solar panels do not contain moving parts , unlike the turbines in the windmills or hydroelectric dams .
Hence solar energy is the best choice as the equipments are easier to maintain and safer to use .
The most effective method to harness solar power in Singapore will be to install solar panels on the roofs of all HDB flats .
The majority of housing in Singapore are HDB flats , these flats add up to form a considerable amount of land area .
As all HDB flats are under the jurisdiction of a government board , there is no need to seek approval from individual owners to implement this plan .
In conclusion , the most feasible sustainable energy source for Singapore will be solar energy .
This scheme is highly probably because the government has control over a large number of HDB flats , which constitutes to a large land area .
We will need to put this into motion as soon as possible .
Since 19 century , the environment has been polluted because of the fast development of industries and economics .
Nowadays , the pollution is very severe and has threatened living condition of human beings .
To have environmentally-friendly product is a human need that has to be given priority , so that the products people use won't be harmful to neither the environment nor health of people .
In the following paragraphs , how engineer design processes can help to achieve the purpose will be discussed .
Then is time to generate multiple solutions for the problems .
Now there are a lot of researches done on environmentally-friendly energy and materials , so learning to make use of these research results can help to solve our problem a lot .
At the same time , the creative idea of design to make the product more effective is important for the solution too .
The next step is to analyze and select a solution .
To analysis those design solutions , a lot of factors need to be considered .
Functional analysis , ergonomics and product safety and liability are all important elements to evaluate those solutions .
And all these are for making the decision .
To compare one solution with another , ranking according to the attributes for the solution is necessary for us to see with one the best , in our case , environmentally-friendly should be the major criteria .
Then , analyze each solution against the criteria we have , and rate each solution , in our case .
At last , choose the most scored one for the next process .
To sum up , the design processes can help to solve the problem we have effectively , since in each step we do our job based on the problem we want to solve and the efficiency .
New and clever technologies are constantly being realised by people all around the world to tackle problems that they face .
However , the creation of these technologies can be attributed to research or chance .
One example of researching resulting in an invention is a type of wall-mounted bed that can be folded onto the wall when not in use .
It was called the murphy bed and was invented by William L . Murphy to solve space constraints that he faced while living in a small apatment .
An example of an invention attributed to chance discovery is the Telfon .
This is a type of substance discovered by Dr . Roy J Plunkett while he was working on gases being used as refrigerants .
These two type of technology share many similarities and differences .
One of them is that they both exist to address problems that people are facing at that time of creation , but differ in process it takes to develope the product .
Another is that both type of technology requires people to ultilise a certain amount of creativity and good peception to develope them completely but differ when it comes to the type of people it usually involves .
Technology , no matter how it is developed , will be used to address problems that people face .
Teflon for example , is being used in a variety of products as anti-stick or anti-stain coatings .
Cooking utensils coated with Teflon are now easier to clean up since the burnt food no longer stick to it .
Clothes coated in a variety of Telfon became stain resistant which means less chance of it becoming damaged permanently by tough stains , and an easier time washing the dirt off the clothes .
Another example , the murphy bed , also addressed a problem that some people faced .
This problem is the space constraint due to a small living space .
By being foldable , space could be made available for use where the bed would havve been .
Ultimately , both type of technologies are beneficial to the human population .
The two ways of developing technologies have different processes .
The development murphy bed , for example , is driven largely by the problem it was trying to solve .
This result in a process where identifying the problem comes first , after which time and effort are put in to solve that one problem .
However , Telfon has seen itself being used as coatings to cloths , coating on cookware , insulations and even in medicine as stenotic arties .
One reason for this versatility is that the brainstorming is now focused on the various problems where Telfon could be used to great effect .
With a large pool of possible uses for Telfon gathered , the next step would be to modify this new technology so that it may be used for as many of the problems as possible .
Ultimately , while the murphy bed and Telfon originated from two differing processes , they still do share some similarities .
By observing this , it could be possible that people would combine some of the key aspects of the process to create a better model for developing new technology .
When the human first learnt to use energy - the fire , the progress of civilization witnessed a fantastic leap .
Today , we can even say that energy plays the most important role in our daily life and also in supporting our huge society .
Therefore , as we human are running out of energy we could make use of , providing sustainable , green and reliable energy has been crucial for the survival of the whole human society .
So this is indeed the need of people today that should be given priority and engineers are especially expected to take their responsibility and play a key role in powering up our world again .
Fortunately , after decades of painstaking efforts we have already come up with many possible solutions .
Many of them fall in two categories: searching for new energy sources and implementing energy-saving methods .
For instance , the solar cell as a source of energy for satellites , industries as well as households has proved to be a promising method , while refining the ignition inside the cylinder in order to extract the most from every drop of gasoline is what many people are doing in laboratories now .
I have a Nokia N79 and surprisingly I found that when I un-plug the charger cable from the phone , a message saying , "Un-plug the charger from the socket to save energy" will appear on the screen , which is really an innovative way to publicize energy saving .
However , when it comes to analysing most of the solutions , considerable problems may arise .
Some may be highly constrained by geographical or climatic factors .
Such solutions contain hydro and solar energy generating .
Some may be too risky or expensive , like the nuclear power .
There are also solutions that are innovative but may not be of so much use that we cannot rely on them to save us from the coming energy famine .
The warm-hearted message of my Nokia may well belong to this category .
So selecting the right solutions must be a very complicated task because we must take everything into consideration and assess all the solutions in the presence of the various factors .
Here , in my opinion , safety , sustainability and the harm done to the environment should be given significant priorities .
Testing and implementing the solutions are always combinations of excitement and disappointment .
Your new device may end up saving half the electricity or prove to be in vain .
But whatever the result might be , we must apply scientific methods in every stage , from building a prototype to conducting concurrent engineering , from the very first planning to the later maintenance .
Every step deserves our full efforts .
To sum up , solving the current energy crisis is a very complicated and systematic issue and engineers should act as pioneers in solving it .
By and only by applying the correct energy design process can they make more breakthroughs and bring us more good news .
Technologies have been developed since long ago , however , not all of them are planned .
There are many pathways that lead to a technology being created , mainly by serendipitous discovery or through research .
In our everyday life , we stumble across things that are out of the norm .
While most of the events appeared to be non-significant , there are some where people actually get ideas from it .
This is what we call serendipitous discovery , when people make discoveries that they are not seeking .
One of the example technology discovered from research is development in automobile safety and better design of roads in the United States while an example of technology resulted from serendipitous discovery is the Post-it pads .
Technology created via research has significant difference in comparison with technology resulted from serendipitous discovery in several aspects .
One of the major difference is whether there is a need for the technology .
Technologies developed through research are ussually to address a problem that have been identified .
In this case , the development in automobile safety and better design of roads in U .S . is to reduce the massive casualties from road accidents where the annual vehicle death rate reached 50 ,000 in the early 1960s .
The generation of innovations .
In Diffusion of innovations  .
New York: Free Press) .
On the contrary , technologies developed through serendipitous discovery are not born from a need for them .
For instance , Post-it pads were developed out of mere coincidence .
Decades ago , the 3M researchers found a new bonding agent during their research but it is not what they wanted to achieve as the bonding agent did not stick paper very tightly to the surface .
Therefore , it can be said that technologies created from research are due to a need for them while technologies from serendipitous discovery do not originate from a need .
Another difference is the final usage of the technologies .
Technologies developed through research are use for their intended purpose .
For example , in U .S , the development in automobile safety includes safer cars that come with padded dashboards and stronger bumpers while safer roads are achieved by placing impact attenuators in front of viaduct pillars .
These technologies were developed for their intended purpose , which is to reduce casualties from road accidents .
Whereas , technologies developed from serendipitous discovery are not use for their intended purpose .
For instance , the researchers of 3M found a new bonding agent during their research .
The bonding agent was initially thought as a failure as it does not meet the expectation of the researchers ,which is to stick tightly to the surface of paper .
However , it is later converted into a successful product when it is use to create "Post-its ," the little stick- on squares of colored paper that can be used to attach a note to a letter or other document which is not the intended purpose of this technology .
In a nutshell , technologies created from research will be use for their intended aim while technologies developed from serendipitous discovery might not serve its intended purpose .
Lastly , the difference between the 2 is the background research .
Technologies created from research undeniably have lots of background research .
This is proven just by looking at the amount of research needed before measures taken to developed a safer automobile as well as better design of highways .
The research span can be years ,decades or even longer before the technology can be successfully developed .
However , this is different for technologies originated from serendipitous discovery .
There are no background research for these technologies , as they are created out of pure coincidence .
With reference to Post-it pads , they are created without any background research .
The researchers simply found a way to utilize the bonding agent years later which led to the product Post- it pads .
Hence , there it can be said that there is background research for technologies originated from research while there might not be any background research for technologies created from serendipitous discovery .
Despite the differences between the ways the technologies are created , they help to improve the life of mankind be it through convenience or any other means .
In conclusion , there are significant differences between technologies developed from research and serendipitous discovery , however , it does not change the fact that they are key to the future for mankind .
The development and advancement in science and technology has brought much convenience to human's society today .
With a click of the mouse , one can communicate with another person half a globe away , strike a business deal with foreign entrepreneurs and catch up with the latest happenings all around the world .
Technology is something which is created to help solving the problems we face in our daily life and at the same time , improving the quality of our life .
Generally , most of the technological innovations are created through basic research , followed by applied research and finally leading to development .
.
The generation of innovations , para .
7) .
However , there are also some technological inventions which are designed from a serendipitous discovery .
According to Roger , serendipity is the accidental discovery of a new idea .
The differences between these two types of technological inventions can be perceived in terms of their research backgrounds , cost of the invention of the technology , and time consumptions .
Technology developed via research and technology which resulted from a serendipitous discovery have different research backgrounds .
Technology based on scientific research requires a wide range of knowledge about the research .
Special skills are also needed to carry out certain experiments and to record the result and data of the experiments .
Many researches also have to be carried out to identify and rectify the problems encountered throughout the experiments .
For example , to create a miniaturized medical submarine which can be injected into human bodies to destroy the blood clot that threatens a human life , there are many technical problems to overcome , such as how to make , power and steer them .
Voyage of the micro robots , para 2) .On the other hand , technology created by serendipitous discovery does not require any knowledge and special skills .
It is an invention by chance while a very different invention is undergoing research and analysis .
For example , DDT is created out of a substance used for protecting wool clothes against moth .
.
The generation of innovations , para .
11)Obviously , more research and analysis are needed for technology based on research as compared to technology created by serendipitous discovery .
Both the technology based on research and technology created by serendipitous discovery require different amount of cost to be carried out .
For technology based on research , a large amount of money is needed to purchase materials that are essential for the research and investigations to be instigated .
Moreover , specific apparatus , for instances , machines and robots , which are usually expensive , are also needed in order to carry out certain experiments .
However , for technology created from serendipitous discovery , it actually requires a few cents or even not a single cent as it is a useful "side product" from a different research .
Less cost is required for this technology because it is an unplanned technology discovery .
Apart from that , time consumption of both the technology based on research is much different from the technology created by serendipitous discovery .
In order to carry out many research and analysis , much time has to be spent for the technology to be successfully invented .
For instance , Thomas Edison had spent his whole life to invent a light bulb with almost ten thousands of failures before he succeeded .
For technology created from serendipitous discovery , less time required as it comes out unexpectedly .
One popular example is penicillin , where it turned out to be the first antibiotic because of its property of killing biological materials when it was left in Petri dishes containing biological organisms .
.
The generation of innovations , para .11)
To sum up the salient point , technology created via research requires more researches and investigations than technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
Besides , cost of creating a technology created via research is much higher as compared to that of technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
Technology based on scientific research consumes more time than technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery as there are many research and experiment need to be carried out .
Although all technology serves a common purpose , there are many differences between inventions that resulted from research and serendipitous discoveries .
Looking at an example of invention that resulted from research which is the laptop and an example of serendipitous discovery which is the implantable pacemaker , a few distinct differences such as the cause leading to the research , final usage of the technology and the research procedures can be spotted between them .
Firstly , the most distinct difference between an implantable pacemaker and a laptop is the intentions which led to the discovery of them .
In the case of the laptop , the inventors of the laptop started with the intention of creating a "DynaBook" which is a concept thought up in 1968 .
The "DynaBook" concept is to make a "personal computer for children of all ages" .
The implantable pacemaker , on the other hand , was initially an attempt to build an oscillator to record the sound of heartbeats .
However , when Wilson Greatbatch , inventor of the implantable pacemaker , inserted a wrong resistor and discovered a different reaction , it led to the invention of the first implantable pacemaker .
Therefore , it is obvious that the cause which led to the invention is very different where in the case of the laptop which , it was already intended since before its creation whereas in the case of the implantable pacemaker , its creation was never intended .
Another difference is the final usage of the inventions .
In the case of the laptop , the final usages is what it is intended for since before its creation during the time of conceptualisation of it .
However , in the case of the pacemaker , the final usage was not what it was intended to be .
It was intended to be a machine to record the sound of the heartbeats which was mentioned above but end up as a device to stimulate the heart to serve as a cure for certain heart problems .
As shown above , in the case of most serendipity discoveries , they will normally not be used for the initial purpose of the experiment that led to its discovery whereas in the case of invention through research , it will be the used for its intended purposes .
Lastly , the pace of advancement that led to the invention of the laptop and the pacemaker is different too .
Normally in the case of a serendipitous discovery , there is a sudden advancement in the progress of the research as it is an accidental discovery during the experimental process .
The experiment that discovered the implantable pace maker was done in 1958 and within months of its discovery the first implantable pacemaker was being used on a human being .
However , for the laptop , the concept of it was thought up in 1968 and the first "laptop" only came into existence in 1975 .
On the other hand , there are undeniably some similarities between serendipitous discoveries and discoveries made through conventional research method .
In both example , regardless of its method of discoveries , both are beneficial to mankind and help to improve the quality of life .
The laptop simplified human work whereas the pacemaker help prolong life of some stricken with life threatening diseases .
In conclusion , though there are many differences between the discovery of the laptop and pacemaker shown above , they both help to propel the human race forward into the future .
Today , the change in climate is being labeled as one of the main threats that are affecting the existence of humankind .
For example , global warming has caused the temperature throughout the world to rise , which results in the melting of the icebergs in the North Pole .
Concurrently , the sea level would rise and cause serious floods that would dangerously threaten the survival of our human race .
Thus , we should rank preserving our environment as the main priority among our other needs .
By applying the engineering design process , we could design a product that is environmental friendly .
The first step in the engineering design process is to identify the problem that our product will face .
Firstly , during the manufacturing of the product , we should be environmentally friendly by reducing the amount of wastes produced and ensure that the wastes produced are properly disposed too .
Secondly , we should also use used materials as the main material for our product and ensure our product is recyclable .
The next step is to gather relevant information that would help make our product a success .
The most convenient way to collect the appropriate information is through the use of internet , as there are always search engine available to help get our sources more accurately and quickly .
There are also traditional ways such as using the library and looking through bookstores to gather more detailed information .
The third step is to generate multiple solutions to solve the problems that are stated in the second paragraph .
For example , we could use filters in gas pipes to reduce air pollution from the factories manufacturing the product .
We could also come out with a standard procedure on how to dispose the waste products so that there would be no chemical leakages that are harmful to the environment .
Through more brainstorming within our group , we would arrive with more solutions .
The fourth step is to analyze and to select the best solution .
The best solution would be chosen from the few ideas that we have thought of during the" generating multiple problem" process .
There will be many criteria that we need to fulfill in order to choose the best solution .
The most important criteria are which solution proves to be the most environmental friendly and whether the product will be able to function properly by using mathematical calculation and scientific theory .
The subsequent criteria will be whether it is safe to implement and if it is cost effective to produce .
The last stage in the engineering design process is to test and implement the solution .
We should come out with a series of tests to prove whether the products work in real life environment .
We should also develop a suitable design for our product that would be warmly welcomed by the public .
Even if one of the tests fails , we could apply the engineering design process to solve the problems that developed in the process of the testing .
In conclusion , the engineering design process would be able to help us develop an environmentally friendly product to help preserve the environment .
Therefore , it proves to be a good method to solve most of our needs .
Technology developed via research and technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery
Human beings have gone through 21 centuries .
In this long time period , technology developed together with human society .
There is one obvious point that technology developed via different ways .
Two main ways are research and serendipitous discovery .
Both research and serendipitous discovery are very important in technology development .
Technology developed via research and technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery differ in some aspects and share similarities in some other aspects .
In terms of development process , technology developed via research and technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery are different .
For technology via research , scientists have a clear plan before they start their research .
They know what they want to get or to achieve at the very beginning .
Then they just do what they should do step by step according to their plan .
Finally , they achieve their goal .
The process of the development of technology developed via research is very systematic with very clear target .
Technology resulted from a serendipitous discovery is different .
Scientists discover a very useful technology unexpectedly .
That means they themselves even do not know they will discover it until they really do .
They do not have the target but they finally get to dig out some new technology .
These two kinds of technology also differ from each other in development input .
As an old saying goes , one cannot make bricks without straw .
Technology research is also the same .
From the moment that scientists decide to work on a new technology , scientists have to put in a lot in order to discover a new technology .
These inputs include time , effort , found , and so on .
Unlike technologies developed via research , technologies resulted from serendipitous need almost zero input .
This kind of technology is just like a gift from god .
It is for free .
What is needed is just luck .
Scientists need such luck to get this god's gift .
So , these two kinds of technology need different input .
Consumer domain is another difference between technology resulted from research and technology resulted from serendipitous discovery .
In most circumstances , scientists are clearly aware of consumers of their technology before they start their research .
They develop certain technology which satisfies certain consumer domains; in comparison , scientists usually do not know the use and the specific consumer domains when they first accidently discover a technology .
In spite of these differences , these two kinds of technology share several important similarities .
Both of them are very useful to the development of our society .
They help make our life easier and more comfortable , thus improve our living standard .
If adapted into industry production , both kinds of technology can bring economic benefit .
To conclude , technology developed via research and technology resulted from serendipitous discovery not only have differences but also share similarities .
Even though these two kinds of technology develop from different ways , they both can benefit society and our daily life .
Over the past century , the technological boom has brought about much comfort and convenience through different inventions .
These luxury items , although they bring about a lot of convenience to our lives , are major culprits of destroying our environment .
As such , one of the main human needs would be to restore balance and lengthen the lifetime of our environment .
The process of creating new inventions , also labelled as engineering design process , is able to address this issue .
This can be done by taking into consideration the factor of inventions being environmentally friendly as one of its major factors in the five steps of engineering design process , which are as follows: Defining the problem , gathering information , generating solutions , analysing and selecting a solution and implementing the solution . 
The step of defining the problem is very important .
It points the whole purpose of the process in the right direction .
Thus , for new problems defined , the factor of it being environmentally friendly can be factored in .
For example , eco-friendly gym equipments today are able harness the energy generated during its use to power the machine itself .
This innovation eliminates the need for external power for the gym equipment .
Moreover , new inventions should not be the only products with a "green" factor as old inventions can be revised in order to cohere to the "green" status .
One such example would be the invention of hybrid cars which are recognised as environmentally friendly automobiles .
The next step is to gather information and generate solutions .
Information gathering is a step which allows the designer to be equipped with background information of the problem before tackling it .
At this step , researching on the various methods in order for the product to be more environmentally friendly should be one of the main concerns .
It also allows them to consider existing solutions , if any , and consider various factors which will determine the success of the product such as the economical factors of the product and its effectiveness .
Thus , solutions generated from these ideas should be able to resolve the problems indentified as well as conforming to the requirements of society .
The solutions should be environmentally friendly such as being able to bypass or convert the by-products which are harmful to the environment , such as greenhouse gases or toxic waste .
Moreover , not only should the product solve the initial problem , it should also meet society's demand in terms of usability , ergonomics and economical concerns .
In conclusion , engineering design process is a general process which ideas can be generated to resolve current issues .
One of the main human needs of the current millennium would be to have a sustainable environment in view of the rapid progression of our technology .
Engineering design process is able to address this issue by encompassing and focusing on being environmentally friendly for every invention .
Technological developments are divided into two different categories: the conventional method of developing technology through researching or through serendipitous discovery .
The two technological innovation discussed would be the Laptop Computer and Sildenafil  .
Though they are on opposite spectrum in terms of the field of technology , both have similarities in their own way .
One difference , aside from their uses , is in the manner which they were developed .
The development of the laptop in Toshiba took on a systematic and direct approach towards an apparent goal: to reduce the size of a personal computer so it will be compact enough and portable .
On the other hand , Sildenafil , the compound in Viagra , was synthesised and studied initially for usage in treating hypertension  and angina pectoris  .
However , clinical trials showed that it did not treat angina but instead , stimulate significant penile erection .
The company , Pfizer , thus decided to manufacture the compound into pills and market it as a drug to treat erectile dysfunction .
Another difference between the two technological developments was approvals from the inventor's company leaders .
In the case of Viagra , the inventors Peter Dunn and Albert Wood had the blessings of their company to carry out their research and were given research facilities and funding .
Tetsuya Mizoguchi , on the contrary , had to go "underground" with the laptop research project in the company's other factory , diverting funds and shifting engineers from military projects to design the laptop , despite being denied development funds and an experienced team of engineers  .
Ironically , after the success , Tetsuya was promoted to Toshiba's board of directors while the inventors of Viagra were denied recognitions for their invention .
Yet , aside from being products of different fields , both technologies were able to commercialise into products successfully .
Pfizer managed to patent the newly synthesised Sildenafil  , incorporate it into pill form before marketing it as an oral treatment for erectile dysfunction .
In 2000 , Viagra sales accounted for 92 percent of the global market for prescribed erectile dysfunction pills .
The laptop was a radically different innovation then , nevertheless , it was marketed furiously and soon had majority market shares in Europe , United States and Japan  .
Another similarity between both technologies was that they had competitors .
Global shares of Viagra dropped to 50 percent due to other erectile dysfunction pill manufacturers like Cialis , Levitra and several counterfeits and clones .
.
Toshiba , similarly , has seen its fair share of competition with leading names like Dell , Apple and Fujitsu .
Finally , both innovations have helped enrich the lives of people by addressing a need or a problem .
Offices in Japan are crowded and homes are small with no space to install a desktop gave rise to a need for smaller personal computers .
The problem of male erectile dysfunction was solved by the innovative development of Viagra , though it was a 'coincidence' the compound Sildenafil causes penile erection .
In conclusion , though the development of Viagra was serendipitous and would seem unfair to the arduous task of development via research in the case of Tetsuya's laptop project , both worked towards a common goal of enriching lives , which I feel is first and foremost the basis of technological advancement .
Also , let us not forget that chemists , Peter Dunn and Albert Wood , were also working systematically towards creating a compound to treat hypertension and angina .
Transportation is a necessity that humans cannot live without .
The number of car on the road keep on increasing year by year and so do the pollution that arises from it .
Therefore engineers need to come up with better design of environmentally friendly hybrid cars that run on green energy fuel to replace the current diesel engine cars .
The first step in engineering better hybrid cars is to define the problems of current hybrid cars and to gather information about them .
Current hybrid cars available in the market are not practical and do not appeal to the mass market .
Some of the factors include the lack of recharging stations and the high cost of producing it .
This deters consumers from switching their old diesel powered cars to the more environmentally friendly hybrid cars .
We also need to make a complete market survey on the reasons why hybrid cars are not getting the attention of consumers .
As stated by Khandani in "Engineering Design Process , 2005" , consumers are the one that ultimately establish the need for a product .
Thus , understanding this need of environmentally friendly hybrid cars is of importance before proceeding to the next step of the design solution .
Next , engineers need to generate multiple solutions for the hybrid cars .
This includes brainstorming sessions to find new alternative fuels and designing a new engine that can run on it .
Engineers also need to make comparison on the latest hybrid cars such as electric cars , hydrogen fuel cell cars and solar powered cars to see which one is more efficient and suitable .
Willingness to take risks and experiment with new alternative fuels are also important so that more creative ideas can be generated .
Then , we proceed to the next stage of analyzing the various solutions and selecting the best one .
As highlighted by Khandani , there are some factors that may need to be considered in the analysis such as the product safety , functional analysis , market analysis and mechanical analysis .
The hybrid cars should be tested for its safety and functionality .
For instance , solar powered hybrid cars need to be ensured that it has enough energy to function well in the night .
Hydrogen fuel cell cars must have a practical way of emitting water as its waste .
We also need to analyze the safety of the designs .
If it is below par , we can add adequate safety features or a thorough instruction manual to it .
Lastly , after going through rigorous analyzing and selecting the final design , we need to make a prototype of the hybrid car and test its overall function in real world situations .
This will reveal the weaknesses in the design , hence the engineers can improve on it .
We also need to test and check various criteria so that the hybrid car meets the needs of the consumers .
Documentation and patent on the overall design should be done at this stage .
Then , we need to execute extensive marketing and awareness campaign to get consumers to buy the hybrid car .
To conclude , engineering a new design of environmentally friendly hybrid car helps to reduce pollution by using green fuels such as electric and solar power .
Creative engineering design can produce a paradigm shift for people to start using environmentally friendly cars due to all its positive advantages .
What is the best alternative of fossil fuel ?
The answer is widely believed to be one of the renewable energies , which include solar energy , wind power and so on .
However , in the process of looking for new energy source to take place of coals and oils , a more urgent problem of the energy system has been neglected  the storage of the energy .
If the coal , oil and sunshine can be regarded as the primary energy carriers , the battery , whose energy can be consumed effectively and cleanly , is the secondary energy carrier , which relates to our daily life more closely .
Ironically , comparing with the primary energy carriers , the battery is far less popular and only used in some specific fields .
How can the engineering design make it widely used by innovating ?
The process can be divided into three parts , defining the problems of battery , finding the solutions and selling the new products .
Although battery is not widely used today , it is possible to change the situation by innovating .
To enhance the capacity of the battery , keep trying new materials is important .
Since the new battery is designed to use in the big machines to replace engines , the capacity will have the priority .
The engineers can try some heavy materials without worrying about the weight and volume .
Additionally , the engineers can also redesign the energy system of the big machines to cooperate with the battery to get a best efficiency .
To shorten the charge time , the technicians can get some ideas from the design of small batteries , which can be fully charged in fifteen minutes .
The last part of the process is to sell the products .
The popularization of battery is not isolated; as an energy carrier , it should be together with the innovation of the electrical cars and other engineering products to form an industry chain .
The chain will also include the battery charge station , which will replace the refueling station as the popularization of battery .
To sum up , the engineering design process can be a good way to innovate new generation of battery .
A process that includes defining , solving and selling will build a whole industry chain of new battery , and finally meet the energy carrier need of the society .
Nowadays , there will always be an engineer designed product wherever we go to or whatever we do .
They are the results of engineer designs to meet our needs .
In order for us to progress faster , more money needs to be pumped to the research sector so that discoveries like cures for illnesses , could be discovered faster .
Therefore , engineers should design products or systems that could improve the economy .
Engineer designs that save energy , cut costs and save manpower are the key to improving the economy so that more money can be used for more research .
New form of or improved transportation could help to reduce costs and save time .
Teleportation is the ideal form of transportation in most of our dreams .
Although it is indeed unrealistic and impossible , we can never know if it can be realised .
No one thought that mobile phones were possible hundreds years ago too .
However , realistically , we could improve our transportation through better public transport design systems .
One example would be replacing drivers with automated computerized transports .
By replacing drivers with automated computerizations , manpower could be saved and public transports would be less costly .
With cheaper transports , people would have more money to spend , improving the economy .
In cities around the world , large amount of energy are consumed by electrical appliances every day .
By designing better electrical appliances that could perform the same function with lesser energy used , we could save a large amount of energy .
One example would be designing a fridge that uses less power to run .
With lesser energy used , costs of living are reduced and the economy would improve with more people having more money to spend .
Another way to improve the economy would be through the designing of new form of energy sources .
As the natural resources are depleting , price of using it as source of energy is becoming increasingly costly .
One such example would be the price of petrol .
Therefore , through discovery of new form of convenient and renewable energy , the price of energy could be more stable .
With a more stable price , it reduces the chance of a big change that could lead to economy problems .
Given the current shaky economy , another big upset would have an adverse effect on our lives .
Therefore , a stable economy is essential for us to progress in technology and having a more reliable source of energy is the key to it .
With a population of 1 .15 billion , a total area of 3 .2 million square kilometers , twenty eight states  , seven union territories , diversity in culture and around a hundred different languages  , India , has certain significant problems in the hampering of engineering design processes for innovations .
Though engineering design is considerably well established in the country , some practical problems , play spoil sport .
Despite having the manpower , she is still not technologically advanced in comparison to the other developing countries like China , Brazil and Egypt .
The two main causes for this problem are population outburst and corruption .
The population of India is rapidly multiplying , increasing from 1 .147 billion in 2008 to 1 .15 billion in 2009 , in a course of just one year .
This makes it difficult to implement innovations , especially in relation to engineering design .
Having a literacy rate of 61 percent , it is quite difficult to introduce new technological innovations , as not all the people in the country would understand and know how to utilize the product well .
Another problem is 'Brain Drain' or "human capital flight"  which began taking away India's brain power at a rapid rate .
This is because the job opportunities are better in foreign countries in comparison with the state of unemployment in India .
"This concept of taking education in a country but earning for another is known as brain drain ."
The western countries open up more job opportunities as they acquire cheap and hardworking labour .
Problems such as second highest population , vast size , low literacy rate and 'Brain Drain' have made it difficult for India to take a step towards technological innovations in the field of engineering design .
Currently , corruption is wide-spread in India .
"India is ranked 85 out of a 179 countries in {Transparency International}'s{Corruption Perceptions Index} , although its score has improved consistently from 2 .7 in 2002 to 3 .4 in 2008 ."
.
The revenue involved in this widespread mishap is very high , thereby affecting all the facets of the country .
Even the poverty stricken section of the society is forced to bribe the officials for their living .
Right from education every other field in India is flooded with corrupt officials who primarily work with a self centered mindset to misappropriate and amass huge amount of money .
These individuals are indifferent to the fact that majority of India's population is below the poverty line .
While the rich get richer , the poor keep getting poorer .
The 'black' money does not get released into the economy for the fear of law and hence hampers the economy , widening the bridge between the 'haves and have nots' , pulling more people under the poverty line .
This multi faceted economic problem poses as the main hindrance to India's technological development and is the mother of all other social and political problems that India faces .
Despite having morbid and influential problems , population and corruption , India is still a fore runner in the economic scenario and has a steady development rate .
The reason for this is its integrity .
Furthermore the young generation is well informed and is taking several initiatives to rectify the previously committed mistakes , thus causing the country to accelerate in a path of new economic revelations .
How do we invent products or systems ?
Do we simply just think of an idea and create a product to try and solve a problem ?
As engineers , most of us will use a process identified as the engineering design process .
The design process is a 5 stage process which includes defining the problem , gathering useful information , finding multiple solutions , narrowing down the solution and testing and implementing the solution .
The 5 stages are sequential which means that an interruption in any of the 5 steps can hamper the engineering design process .
In Malaysia , engineering design processes for innovation have not been evolving as much as the government would like .
The problems that contribute to it is that there are not many quality engineers left in Malaysia and the local society's mindset .
The first problem is the lack of quality engineers left in Malaysia .
Most engineers leave for financial reasons .
The value of the ringgit is rather low so engineers tend to favor working overseas as the salary is higher and the working environment is much better .
For example , Malaysians who studied in Singapore are required to sign a bond which ties them to work in Singapore for a few years .
After working in Singapore , most of them will not return to work in Malaysia as the pay is almost double compared to working locally .
The engineers produces in local universities are not able to fill the gap left by the engineers who leave the country .
The second problem is the society's mindset .
Malaysians have a very conservative way of thinking .
They are not willing to take new risks in terms of design innovations .
Malaysians are contented easily and refuse to improve on existing innovations and technologies .
Malaysian societies are also uncooperative in their work .
They are not willing to seek help from foreign countries and source most of the work to unqualified local companies .
Apart from that , it is well known how corrupted the country is .
Corruption can lead to unmotivated work ethics .
The problems listed above can have an impact on all or one of the 5 stages of engineering design process .
First and foremost , the conventional thinking of Malaysians can affect the first stage of the process that is defining the problem .
Their traditional thinking will not be able to identify what the needs of the country are .
The uncooperative nature of the country can influence the design process in terms of generating multiple solutions .
We need to work together with other nations to tackle a problem because other countries may have different views to a problem solution .
Most significantly , because of the insufficient amount of engineers in the country , we are just not able to source enough manpower to accomplish the design process .
In conclusion , the progress of engineering designed is being disrupted by local society and the lack of engineers .
As the rest of the world continue to improve technologically , we advance at a slower pace .
There is a need to have an attitude change in both the government and society .
Engineers should remain in the country and not just leave for personal benefits .
They should consider helping improve the level of design innovation in the country so that we can compete globally .
Incredible as it seems in such a resource-rich earth , the energy crisis has become one makeable problem .
But the fact is that the shortage of energy has affected the whole human society and our further development .
As Tennessee Valley Authority disclosed that the normal 60-day store of coal now can only supply ten to twelve days  .
This means that our resources cannot fulfill our increasing demand .
The most pressing issue is finding a replacement for fossil resources .
One of the most suitable replacements is nuclear power .
However , there are some concerns about it , such as security , costs and performance , which have limited the popularization of this promising substitute approach .
In order to resolve these problems , a new generation of nuclear energy system which is called the Fourth Generation reactors is under test .
One of the six approaches that named as supercritical-water-cooled reactor can give us a way for our future energy with further researches .
Supercritical-water-cooled reactors share the benefits of Generation IV and some further benefits compared with other kinds of reactors , SCWR may also resolve some concerns about safety and cost with some further development .
Not only does design entail magnificent facade or a weird opinion of a maverick , but it also involves pragmatism , cost and efficiency .
All these requirements are fully passed just by those who are well educated .
Quite the opposite , while there is a highly increasing demand in engineers with acuity of design , even in the education system of my own country , there are two major setbacks for engineering students getting adequate design skills: the lack of practice in school and the insufficiency of co-curricular activities .
Firstly , students in high schools do not have enough useful practice time in their schedule .
Although the curriculum has recently been continually improved to gradually reduce the conventional teaching method , the reality is still a void in students' lab skills .
The reason is that the equipping of new device needed for experiments is not in tandem with the changing of textbooks .
Only in the urban areas can students have opportunities to get access to the required equipments .
Regarding students in other places , they can merely see the teacher do a sample experiment in the lecture but cannot try by themselves .
Even worse in some remote areas , students can only listen to the description of the experiment by the teacher .
According the Labor Newspaper , Hung Yen , a south province of Viet Nam , there are thousands of students are studying without sufficient lab equipments due to the delay in project of purchasing new equipments and corruption .
In these regions , another factor that breaks the camel's back is the exodus of young lab teachers to cities where they can have a conducive environment to develop their own job and earn a better living .
The residue of this migration is an old generation teachers who do not much familiar with modern device in labs .
Consequently , students do not have chance to learn the priceless pragmatic experience of how to design in work .
Secondly , students do not attend enough efficient co-curricular activities in school .
This can be accounted for the fact there are few organizations in almost all schools .
There was , in fact , one organization , namely the Youth Union , in my secondary school .
When I went to high school , luckily we had three organizations: the Youth Union , Harmonica club and PTNK Soccer league .
Though activities held by the above organizations ranged from learning history , stance to acquiring leadership , not many students were benefited from them .
That is due to the fact that the number of attendants for one activity just covered a small portion of the whole students in school .
Moreover , since co-curricular is not compulsory in our country , and the studying in other learning centers takes up almost all time of students , they tends to drop co-curricular activities in school .
The Youth Newspaper recorded a New Zealand professor that Vietnamese students spent so much time to study academic knowledge that co-curricular activities became something "luxurious" .
In brief , what impedes engineering process design for innovation in my country's education system is the lack of practice and co-curricular skills .
However , with efforts to reform education , I optimistically believe that we can overcome these obstacles to be competitive engineers in global market .
Second , it is due to the time taken to create a full design product .
A design process is not a one-night outcome .
It might take days and months to perfect the design so as to ensure that the end product is good .
Thereafter , more problems may arise such as finding and building of the parts and materials that are not readily available in Singapore .
For example , a lot of stress tests had to be done during the process of making NEWater  .
This includes tests on human to confirm that it is fit for drinking before it is produced for public consumption .
Those tests were not done in a day or month .
It took more than a year to complete .
This leads to other effects and impacts the market .
People will tend to go for simpler designs , because of the long time required to create a proper full design .
Reason being , it will be much easier to design and time required would be much lesser .
This will result to poor designs produced in the market .
Hence market users will not be tempted to buy the product , which would cause the sales and market to be low .
Additionally , this will also lead to loss income to the designer as they might not earn their production cost back .
Eventually potential designers will have second thoughts and step out of designing .
In conclusion , the lack of creativity and the time to create a design could cause impacts to the market in Singapore .
These problems that may hamper the engineering design would impact the market causing the unavailability of new products , designers taking shortcuts in design and changing mindsets about design .
In addition , this would lead to market downturn .
I personally feel that the most common problem originates from every individual's mindset , when they have already made up their mind .
It's hard to change once it's fixed .
I believe that if an individual takes up the courage to change , and design a proper design , it would resolve the problems that are hampering the design process for innovations .
In your home country some problems significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
Describe two of these problems and explain their impacts on effects on certain stages of the process .
We humans always dream .
We have never been satisfied with what we want .
We are always out there looking for something better .
It might seem that we are greedy  , but the fact that I am writing this essay sitting comfortably in an air conditioned room is fact enough to validate our greed and curiosity .
If we weren't greedy for more always just imagine how different the world would have been .
Just an hour without the majestic invention of electricity just drives everyone crazy .
The boom of innovation and technology in the past few decades has just been tremendous .
Every country wants to be technologically forward and pumps in enormous amounts of money and resources into leading innovations and research developments .
However the standard of research and innovations being administered in every country varies to a great deal .
This is influenced by the different social and economic atmospheres prevalent .
Now I am going to talk about the various issues that hamper engineering design and innovations in my own country , India .
The first thing that jumps right into your mind when you read about India is its vast size and a whooping population of over 1 .1 billion  .With such a vast population the onus on the government to ensure the welfare of the people is tremendous .
With a large part of the population depending on the government for subsidies and food  , most of the annual budget is spent in ensuring that the people are well fed .
With India being a democratic country the major revenue for the government is taxes paid by the people .
With the standard of living not being quite high the revenue earned by the government is also quite less .
Therefore the amount of money the government can afford to spend on the research projects is quite less comparatively .
India spends only 450 million USD per year on research  .
However in the cities the quality of education is world class .
The people educated in the cities are now exposed to the entire world .
They are quite well learned .
Some of them tend to leave the country in search of better prospects in the developed countries .
The chance of earning huge sums of money and a quality lifestyle just makes them leave their country as though they are leaving their house to take a leisurely stroll .
With the government spending huge sums of money on them and these people not even repaying the government by working here and paying taxes here  , it is a huge blow for the government .
More than 300 ,000 Indians migrate to the United States and over 75 percent of these people have had tertiary education  .
With such highly educated individuals leaving the country the scope for leading research becomes quite limited ,scarce .
Another factor is that a lot of the developed countries attract foreign talent in addition to their own population .
India is not able to do that .
With the standard of living and environment not meeting that of the developed countries we are unable to attract brilliant individuals from different parts of the world .
With all these factors playing a role  , the engineering design and innovation is hampered quite a lot .
Steps have been taken to minimise the effects of these factors  , but there is still a long way to go to see all these factors vanishing all together .
Several private organisations have started helping the people in what little way they can .
Innovation engineering has been a commonly recurrent phrase among the industries in the recent years .
However , exactly how many engineers fully understand the full meaning and implications behind the simple phrase ?
Furthermore , how many understand the long and exhausting process required for innovative engineering operations to be executed and optimized ?
The process of concept generation , product testing and product implementation requires lots of resources .
These resources come in the form of time , which translates to financial terms , and experience in the process .
In the Singapore society where it is relatively result orientated , people tend to be afraid to try out new ideas as they are afraid they will lose out to the intense competition they face from the others .
Hence , engineers will rather stick to tried and proven methods that are seen to be effective , instead of explore for more alternative methods .
However , these engineers fail to realise that failures are the key to innovation .
Without having gone through failures , new and better processes would not be developed properly , and thus failing to achieve optimisation .
The environment makes it hard for companies to allocate resources for innovation , and at the same time , keep the company's competitive edge in the market .
Due to this problem , fresh ideas would not even have a chance to be developed , least to say , move towards the implementation of the idea .
This gradually develops into an inflexible culture , whereby our workers choose to stick to current beliefs rather than try out new ideas .
Generating new concepts do not just require a single day of effort , as what people believe , but instead require a longer thought process which may take days or even months .
The culture in Singapore does not even allow our workers to make time for this crucial concept generation process .
Another problem we face in Singapore is the lack of experience our country has in the innovative engineering field .
Compared to developed countries , which have years of experience in the field , our nation has just begun to prosper .
Previously , public policies have guided our nation towards the manufacturing arena .
This has brought rise to various government bodies efficient in international operating and manufacturing standards .
However , it has only been in recent years that our government has moved towards research and development .
Therefore , it would take quite some time to gear local engineers towards an innovative mindset .
Engineering processes not only rely on theories , but a lot on the engineer's experience .
Chief engineers who have been in the field for a period of time would be valuable resources .
However , it would take years for a new generation of engineers to be trained in innovative engineering .
Innovative engineering requires the engineer to venture into areas which have yet to be explored , which makes the experience even more vital , as it would allow problems to be identified even before they occur .
These problems would most probably yet to be explored by current engineers .
In conclusion , Singapore should open up to accept more challenges and failures especially for the younger generations of engineers .
The younger engineers should be more daring and dare to venture into the innovative world to discover new ideas .
As the third biggest country with the largest population in the world , there are still some unavoidable problems of engineering design processes for innovations in a developing country , China .
Two major problems among these are: the low acceptance of engineering design and the complex verification before licensing procedures for engineering projects .
The problems all above are related to people's attitudes towards engineering design and the political situation for engineering innovations , implying the heavy going improvement of engineering design .
Even though , it is a journey of hardships for Chinese innovations in the field of engineering design , which really suffers quite a lot at the moment , the future for Chinese engineering innovations is still bright with the government striving to achieve the goal for a healthy environment of engineering supervision .
Moreover , the primary purpose of nuclear energy is to generate electricity .
Unlike energy produced by burning carbon , nuclear energy is clean as no greenhouse gases is produced from nuclear plants , where nuclear energy is made .
Using more nuclear energy and less carbon-generated energy to produce electrical energy could mean a significant decrease in greenhouse gases and a cleaner earth to live in .
Countries like France rely on nuclear power as much as other countries that rely on carbon to generate electricity .
Hence , nuclear energy might become essential in the near future as the world seeks to solve the problems due to global warming .
At the same time , just like any other forms that could be used to generate electricity , nuclear power is not a perfect source of energy too .
The danger of radioactivity is always imminent as critics often refer to the nuclear accident in Chernobyl that resulted in many deaths and serious repercussions such as unnatural births many years after the accident .
In addition , even if nuclear accidents do not occur , spent nuclear fuel would remain radioactive for decades .
As a result , land space has to be sacrificed to accommodate waste storage .
In conclusion , nuclear energy would probably play an important as the Earth's carbon resources are used up .
However , nuclear countries should only encourage research on nuclear energy production for peaceful purposes .
They should not use it as a weopon in war as this could spell the end of the world .
The creation NEWater , a technology where used water is treated to become potable , is one of the few examples of success in the research of technology in Singapore .
Prior to this achievement , PUB  faced many obstacles and that includes the lack of engineering technology which made the cost of implementation unrealistic .
As a result , this plan was shelved in the 1980s .
Similarly , Singapore is currently facing problems that hamper its ambition of coming up with great innovations .
One of these problems is the rigid education system that is restricting the growth of the minds of young Singaporeans , mainly the teenagers .
At the same time , the comfortable state of living in Singapore has posed the challenge on provoking the minds of its people to improve their current state of living .
All these may then lead to the slowdown of the technological advancement in Singapore .
The Ministry of Education  in Singapore adopts an academic based education system , where excellent examination results are prioritized over the creativity of one's mind .
Parents and teachers emphasized a lot in obtaining 'A' grades and hence students have a misconception towards education .
They have the impression that doing well in examinations equates to success in their future endeavours .
Moreover , academy promotion mainly requires students to reproduce the knowledge conservatively without much consideration .
As such , lesser time is made for attending brain teasing courses and for almost all cases , they are made optional to students and their importance is not highlighted .
Hence , 'students from Singapore tops result in Mathematics and Science among their peers from other 41 countries but when it comes to designing , Singaporeans are way behind their foreign peers'  .
It is then evident that Singaporean students are proficient in examination questions yet failing in creativity .
In view of the restrictions set on one's creativity , there is no doubt why designing novel engineering processes is beginning to be seen as outstanding talent in our society .
The other problem Singapore faces is , ironically , its high standard of living .
More importantly , the efficient system of governance in Singapore lives up to most of the promises made to its people during general elections .
Given their comfortable lifestyle they are enjoying , the idea of bringing about a change is not of their priority .
For instance , they have upgraded the facilities in housing estates , such as the implementation of the Lift Upgrading Scheme , and this brings about the 'tardiness' in Singaporeans to think about further improvements to their life .
Their focus , instead , is directed at their routine occupational job and their own family matters and therefore , the element of creative is not part of their daily life .
The result that consequently led by these problems is the failure to generate creative ideas as a solution or improvement to their surroundings .
The scope of their thoughts is relatively narrow and hence they usually fail to come up with innovations that are beyond their imagination .
Surprisingly , what Singaporeans have in mind as the ideal solution may not be in tandem with other fellow foreigners .
Eventually , without a niche in designing , they will then lose out to the 'brains' from other countries when it comes to employment for 'a designer is a planner with an aesthetic sense' .
Not only do we need to be knowledgeable , originality , too , plays an important role when it comes to being a great innovator .
In conclusion , Singapore has to move away from its current mindset and practices in order to succeed in coming up with engineering design processes for innovations .
For example , Singapore needs to , and have already begun to , deviate from its regimental approach of learning .
MOE has been 'moving in recent years towards nurturing young Singaporeans who ask questions , and who are willing to think of new ways to solve new problems ,'  in an attempt to inculcate the positive mindset of learning at a tender age .
In the meantime , Singapore has also declared that it will increase its investment in research and development  to 3% of its GDP by 2010 .
The bold decision to invest billion of dollars into R&D will make people realize the importance of innovations to the sustainability of Singapore and no doubt open up more avenues for new discovery to be made .
All in all , both measures that Singapore's government is taking clearly reflect on its intention to drive Singapore to become one of the leading countries in terms of technology .

"Think outside the box" .
It is the sentence that we all heard many times before when it comes to innovation .
Singapore , as a young nation with no natural resources , depends heavily on its human resources to survive .
To be able to capture the consumers in the market , we have to be innovative in product designs .
However , I think problems like the fixed mindset of the person and the lacking of resources may hamper with engineering design process for innovations .
Firstly , many people have a fixed mindset .
They tend to worry what other might think and are afraid of criticism by others .
Self-criticism is also another issue that hinders creativity .
Most people believe themselves to be lacking in creativity and think that others will not like their ideas .
Hence during the presentation of ideas , they will present it with little or no confidence because they are afraid of making fools of themselves .
Therefore , others will take it that there is a lack of enthusiasm in the idea .
Also if someone has received a negative response , there is a high chance that they will not pursue any innovative attempts anymore .
Sometimes , people have the tendency to make products too complex and too focused on factors like usability that it results in a design barrier .
Not everyone encourage new ideas .
Often their reaction to new things is negative .
These will also further hinder creativity .
Secondly , since Singapore is small , it is limited in resources .
We often have to import materials from other countries .
As a result , the cost of production will be expensive and people rather choose to design a simple product and not to invest in the product innovation and research .
Also we have a small talent pool of people with innovative ideas .
Hence , most people do not possess the skills that are able to design any innovative products .
As a result of the problems that hamper with engineering design process for innovation , many fail to identify those unmet needs of the market , causing the market to suffer .
Instead of having new type of products in the market to capture the attention of the consumers , the market ended up with many different products having similar features and functions .
As mentioned by Chan in his lecture , many people are also willingly to pay more for design as well as for new products that they think are simple , practical and useful .
For instance , Apple iPhones were in high demand in the market during its launch because of it design , simplicity and reliability although the features of the iPhones are generally the same as many other smartphones in the market .
In conclusion , it is possible to avoid all aspects which will hamper with engineering design process for innovations by changing the mindset of the people as well as to find alternative ways to solve the problem of lacking of resources .
We should attempt to make changes to our way of life in order to begin a larger change in our lives; be more innovative .
Engineering design process plays an important role in innovation and creativity .
Since the resources in the world are limited and decreasing , many countries are making efforts to develop the designing process to use the resources more efficiently and improving the standard of life .
However , in my country there are still some problems that hamper the creativity and design , especially the lack of resource and the behavior of customers .
In this essay , I will discuss about these obstacles and how they affect the design process .
First of all , one of the biggest obstacles that hamper the engineering design process in my country is the lack of resources which includes both factors: the human resources and natural resources .
Human resources , in this case , can be known as the labor force needed for design with skillful abilities and knowledge .
Without knowledge , an engineer cannot start his designing process because he does not know where to begin and what to create .
As a result , the lack of human resource affects the design process at the very first stages .
Another factor that also deteriorates the creativity is natural resources , as known as the space , time , materials  . . . for designing .
For example , in my country , many projects had to be postponed because there are not enough materials to make the products .
When waiting for importing the resources from other countries , these projects were still on the paper .
Therefore , natural resources are important at the stages of implement the ideas to create the products .
Secondly , the behaviors of the users also cause many problems when providing the products to the market .
Customers are usually afraid of changing the current product to new ones when they think the old one is satisfactory .
Once they are used to with the current product , it is hard to persuade them to switch to the new one because they have to learn how to use the new device .
This may not be a big matter of the young but with the old people , the problem is much more greater .
For example , my mother just want to use the traditional line-phone than the cell-phone because making a call with the hand-phone is quite complex than just picking the line-phone and dialing .
Consequently , a new product , although has been well and functionally designed , could be easily refused if it was not friendly to them .
In this situation , the behaviors of the customers are the key factors which directly determine the successful of the product in the last stages of the engineering design process-making the product and bring it to the market .
In conclusion , the two factors : lack of resources and behaviors of the customers cause great problems to the engineering design process in my country .
They affects most stages of the design process as they can postpone the process or even though stop it .
Unfortunately , these problems cannot be solved in a short-run , it needs much efforts to bring back the knowledge and materials into my country .
Ever since the first vending machine appeared , many companies adopted this idea as the public welcomed such invention .
Convenience it brought has definitely played a big part in its success .
In the consumer's view , cumbersome long queue can be avoided when we only need to have a can of drink .
Furthermore , the simple manipulation of vending machine and hygienic storage is widely accepted by masses .
On the contrary , the vendor viewed it as favourable because they allowed selling of stocks that have very long shelf life .
Frequent updates can be avoided and the reliability of these vending machines is guaranteed .
Practically , it can be placed at any places , whether it is rural location .
This introduction of vending machines has improved and revolutionized the conventional way of merchandising .
In countries like Japan and Singapore , where there is a lack of space , the need for a condensed merchandiser which allowed space efficiency is furthermore amplified .
As time gradually goes by , the population density of many countries increased .
A device that free out more available spaces is gaining more recognition .
In Japan , the available vending items range from instant noodles to cars !
CITATION Nat091 \l 1033  The need to concentrate all stocks in a small space imparted to the invention of more variety of vending machine .
In conclusion , the rising wage costs , demand of a more convenient way of vending process and lack of space have shaped this technological innovation .
In addition , the advancement of vending machine has never come to a halt as it continues to accommodate more human needs .
In years to come , more improved version of vending machine will be introduce to the society and bring more benefits to human kinds .
Commercial nuclear power industry had witnessed the worst nuclear power plant accident in its history: Chernobyl .
Reports pointed out that the disaster killed 56 people and caused about 336 ,000 people in contaminated areas in Russia , Belarus and Ukraine to evacuate and resettle  .
The accident raised the question about the safety of the nuclear power plant and the ways that people can avoid such case .
From an article by Bernhard Wilpert from Technical University of Berlin , Germany we can see that if we apply psychology in design process of the nuclear reactors , the disaster might not happen .
According to the news report by Rita Zahara  , "Singapore is only rank 15 in the world for its innovative capabilities .
Singapore firms still lag greatly behind their counterparts in the US , Finland , Israel and Korea ."
Despite having high GDP and a pool of savvy engineers , there are still quite a number of problems in Singapore that are hampering its engineering design for processes for innovation .
There are many social and economical factors in Singapore that are hampering the country's engineering design processes for innovation .
Comparing to other countries , although Singapore do not have much technological constraints , there are still a lot of factors hampering inventions and innovations in Singapore .
Two main problems are Singapore's small economic market and its population holding a resistance to change attitude .
Firstly , a small economic market can greatly hinder a country's engineering design process for innovation .
Due to the small geographical size of Singapore , its population is only less then six million people .
As a result , Singapore's economic market is not large .
Most inventions , be it new or improved from previous inventions , takes a vast amount of time and money before it might become an innovation .
Most engineers or designers are reluctant to even try inventing or making innovative products as they know that their inventions will most likely not make much profit , or even worse , a loss .
Secondly , Singaporeans' refusal to take risk and their contentment with their current lifestyles are also causes for the hampering of engineering design processes for innovation in Singapore .
The mindset of resistances to change in Singaporeans greatly prevents good innovative ideas and the acceptance of such ideas .
Most Singaporeans are resistant to changes as they are too used to their current lifestyles .
They do not want any changes to what they already had .
Therefore , this will cause them not to expect for anything more or better and thus , not thinking of new ideas on how to improve what they already had .
Furthermore , Singaporeans have strong refusal to tolerate risk .
Most Singaporeans do not dare to try new ideas as they fear of failing , in which most probably results in time and money loss .
Singapore's small economic market and its population holding a resistance to change attitude will have some bearing on the engineering design processes for innovation .
According to the book by Ullman , David G .  , there are ten building stages in the engineering design processes .
Namely "Identifying a need , Defining the problem , Conducting research , Narrowing the research , Analyzing set criteria , Finding alternative solutions , Analyzing possible solutions , Making a decision , Presenting the product , Communicating and selling the product" .
Singaporeans' refusal to leave their comfort zone will greatly affect the very first stage of the engineering design process , "Identifying a need" .
It will be very hard for Singapore to discover what it still needs when its people are content with what they already had .
On the other hand , Singapore's small economic market is affecting the second and third building stages in the engineering design processes , "Defining the problem and Conducting research" .
A small economic market is preventing engineers and designers from defining problems and conducting research as they fear it will most likely be non-profitable or at a loss .
According to the Maslow's hierarchy of needs pyramid , physiological need is the most basic tier of the pyramid .
It was viewed as the most important need among others .
Therefore , I think human health need or medical needs are the one which I should give priority on .
Engineers are very important role on designing new medical product to suit these human needs .
There are many different medical research is where engineers could lay their hand on and design products according the requirement .
The most recently leading research on medical area is medical imaging , tissue engineering , pharmaceutical engineering , stem cell engineering and genetic engineering .
In my opinion , medical imaging is the most important area where we need to spend time and effort .
Medical imaging technology refers to the method or process used to obtain graphic images of the human body structure or organs .
It helps the doctor to diagnose diseases or illness of a patient at an earlier stage .
Throughout the years , various types of medical imaging technologies were invented .
There are two main type of classification on medical imaging , invasive and non-invasive .
Invasive imaging includes nuclear medical imaging and X-ray imaging .
Invasive imaging method require radioactive means to produce medical scanning which would have a possibility on causing harm to the patient body but could be used on majority human body parts .
On the other hand , non-invasive imaging techniques like MRI and Ultra imaging would do the same job without causing any side effect on the patient .
The only set-back of such techniques is the high operation cost and constraints on the type of human body parts which they can be used on .
Engineering design process could be used on the invention of a new imaging technology .
This new imaging technology must have both the advantages of the non-invasive and invasive imaging .
Furthermore it had to tackle the operation cost problem and the type of human body parts where the imaging device could penetrate to .
Another major concern in the engineering design process of the new imaging technology would be providing higher resolution 3D/2D clinical image .
This will help the doctors to analysis a potential ill patient with improved detailed image .
Since modern computers continually increase on processing speed and volume of memory , it will provide a huge support on designing better resolution image devices .
The only portion which engineers would need to figure out is how to lower the operation cost of such imaging device .
In my opinion , materials of the films and the simplicity of the devices would be important
With the presence of the new resolved imaging technology , more humans were being able to make use of such technology since it will be cost- reduced .
Better clinical image will also be provided to the doctors , as a result doctor will be able to have a clearer diagnose of the diseases/illness on the patient .
Eventually , the average lifespan of a human will be prolonged with such benefits since early detection of illness prone to be easier for treatment and cure .
Lastly , Engineering should view medical imaging area as their priority since it could resolve a lot of medical problem exist in the modern world .
Good health is still the most crucial area where everyone would wish to achieve after all .
In order to successfully hold the 29th Olympic Games , the Beijing municipal government had done all they can to optimize the transportation system in Beijing .
However , take one of the most developed cities as example , it was reported that the time every resident in Beijing spent on transportation per day reached five hours and five minutes in 2008 .
Obviously , nowadays there is nearly no more space for transportation system to improve but people still have to pay more than one fifth of their lives for it .
However , the problem is basically that people only make changes according to the traditional system , while in most cases a better system has to be built with the old one totally destroyed .
Therefore a big revolution in transportation has become one of the current human needs , which can be appreciated as one way to save human lives .
Started from human needs , a new idea obtained by comparison can make transferring happen possibly in few seconds .
What exactly is this new type of transportation ?
The following ideas are what I speculate on transferring in the future: The first step is to store the information of the people , more generally , is to break up human body into atom-size particles and make a rearrangement of particles .
The second is to translate the information to alternating current with energy stored and released then load the current on the electromagnetic wave .
The third step is to transfer the electrical messages via electromagnetic wave to the destination .
Finally , the signal will be acknowledged at the destination .
Then the same people will be rebuilt there with the accurate human body information .
Is this design realistic and feasible ?
Everything is possible .
Honestly , it is impossible to find a person who is willing to risk his whole life rather than waste five hours on streets every day .
However , the fact is that every organic body is made up of finite kinds of elements and every human activity is based on the same chemical foundation .
Therefore it will be possible to decompose and recompose organs or tissues sooner or later .
As for the problem of energy reduction in transmission , it can be addressed by diversifying and complicating the structure of the body information .
In conclusion , engineering design should base on human needs , which was recently called "Human Oriented Design" or "humanization" .
Moreover , creativity stems from overall analysis on what we have now , what we need to have in future and most importantly what the differences between them are .
Actually , all the above are just writer's personal point of view .
Though most of them sound like fiction story , the dream is still achievable .
We are now just like our ancestors thousands of years ago thinking that step onto the moon is impossible .
In fact , the idea of travelling by light is close to the imagination of transporting in time which most scientists are doing research on now .
That is why we should have confidence in our technology and ourselves because impossible is nothing .
Ever wondered how many cars are there in the whole world ?
According to the article , "World's Most Congested Cities"  , there are about 750 million vehicles  in the world , and at least 50 million cars are being manufactured in the world each year .
And out of the 750 million vehicles , 240 million come from The United States of America  , and 850 thousand come from Singapore  .
From the above figures , the ratios of human beings to vehicles are approximately 5 .4 , 1 .3 and 8 .8 respectively .
And all these figures are crucial in pointing out that vehicles , gasoline-powered vehicles to be more specific , are important and have blended into our lives .
Although this technology is important , many do not know its history and the development of the gasoline-powered vehicle was actually heavily influenced by political , economical and social factors .
The second set of factors were the political factors , and one of the main factors was the convenience the gasoline-powered vehicle brought about in World War I .
During World War I , the military realised that gasoline- powered vehicles were more convenient to use as compared to the electric- powered vehicle because it was difficult to charge the battery of the electric-powered vehicle right in the midst of a battle where there was no electrical source .
This convenience was the fact that gasoline was portable and could be brought around on vehicles which allowed vehicles to be re- fueled at any time and place and that it could be done very quickly .
Apart from the influence by the military , the government had a part to play as well , because the government implemented biased policies that involved building more gas stations and roads to cater to the gasoline-powered vehicles .
These implementations brought more convenience to users of gasoline-powered vehicles because gasoline was made more available , and places once inaccessible became accessible .
On the contrary , there was no "charging" station and roads were not very ideal for electric-powered vehicles to move on; basically , there was nothing done to cater to the electric-powered vehicles which made it difficult for people to utilise the electric-powered vehicles without having any worries .
As a result , the electric-powered vehicle continued to lose its support , and gasoline- powered vehicles took another point home .
The next set of factors that further developed the gasoline-powered vehicles were the social factors .
And the presence of this social factors actually determined the fate of the electric-powered vehicles .
However , these social factors , which were partly caused by the overpowering economical and political factors , "pushed" people to choose the gasoline- powered vehicles .
The people were made to believe that the gasoline-powered vehicle was the "byproduct of market competition and engineering advancement , not a product of compromise and negotiation"  , which , in actual fact , was not .
Due to meritocracy and freedom , people "chose" the gasoline-powered vehicles eventually , and brought electric-powered vehicles to eternal rest .
The above factors gave gasoline-powered vehicles its place , even though electric-powered vehicles were better in terms of the technical aspects .
For instance , electric-powered vehicles were cleaner because it did not produce any harmful byproducts from combustion , were quieter , more luxurious and safer because it did not deal with any forms of combustion or heat .
Furthermore , electricity was easily available compared to high octane gasoline  .
Even though electric-powered vehicles were relatively more superior in the technicalities , due to the factors mentioned above , the technicalities were marginal and people were not affected by the potential problems they might face if they choose the gasoline-powered vehicles .
In conclusion , the development of an innovation does not solely depend on how technically superior it is , it also depends on many other factors , as we can see from the above example of the gasoline-powered vehicle .
These factors may vary in terms of the degree of impact , but there will always be an array of factors that will determine if an innovation succeeds .
The more important and valuable an innovation is to the society , the more impactful are the contributing factors , and the more elaborated the impacts will be .
Just imagine if vehicles were not as important , and we do not depend on them to such a large extent World War I would not have such a drastic effect on the extinction of the electric-powered vehicle and banks might not have approved the implementation of the insurances and loans .
And who knows ?
All our cars might be plugged in and getting charged now .
"Engineering is a creative process of turning abstract ideas into physical representations" , says Khandani .
This means , engineers need creativity to make new beneficial things , and this is exactly what engineers in Indonesia lack , along with sense of innovation .
The two main causes are Indonesia's education system which limits the student's creativity and the lack of structured government programmes regarding research and technology .
The first problem , the education system does not allow students to express themselves freely , causing students to be less curious and therefore not creative .
Teachers in school are also not supportive .
Some even too conservative that everything must be done exactly like what he or she has done .
On top of that , the questions given in school are usually too straight forward as the questions themselves do not test the deeper understanding of the concepts by the students .
For example , the questions in the national examination are all multiple choices .
Therefore , to be able to pass the exam , students do not need to really understand as they just need to memorize and use the correct formula or even try their luck .
This kind of rote learning makes defining problems , which is the very first step of engineering design process , hard for Indonesian students .
Furthermore , this forms a habit among the students that they also apply in real life which makes them ignorant on how things work and concern only about how to use those things .
Instead of discovering and solving problems around them , they tend to avoid them and wait for someone to solve it .
With this kind of attitude it is quite impossible for someone to innovate .
To make matter worse , even when someone survived that kind of education and has bright ideas , the government will not give them the opportunities to innovate , such as providing enough budgets for Research and Development  in Science and Technology , or easiness of taking loans for new businesses in these areas .
This is because most developing countries' governments , like Indonesia's , still do not yet realize that a good innovative culture in the country can actually solve other problems like poverty and basic education opportunity .
The minuscule R&D expenditure of less than 0 .2% , in 2001 , of the GDP clearly shows this lack of priority  , especially when compared to Singapore's 2 .19% , in 2002 , expenditure  .
Therefore as they do not have structured programmes regarding research and technology , there are only few job opportunities in this science and technology sector , further discouraging engineers to innovate .
Instead , they prefer to have secure jobs in other more profitable sectors such as finance and banking .
This leads to no improvement in engineering in Indonesia .
Among these two main problems , the latter is actually more important .
Despite the poor education system , there are still a lot of innovative and creative people in Indonesia who wants to become real engineers .
However , without a supportive government , they cannot do anything .
Most of them choose to go to other countries which respect their ideas more .
This make Indonesia loses many of its best people .
Therefore , if only Indonesia's government can realize that research and technology is a really important factor , it is still possible for Indonesia to rapidly improve in terms of innovation .
"Build a better mousetrap , and the world will beat a path to your door" , said by Ralph Waldo Emerson .
The quote can be used to express the significance of the engineering design processes to generate innovations in making a useful product for society and industry .
Among the developing countries , Vietnam is one of the fastest growing economies in which engineering design processes for innovations is now playing a more and more important role .
There are certain problems which are still obstructing those processes , two of them are the weak law protection of patent registration and the lack of entrepreneurship skills .
Nowadays , it is not difficult to look for a fashionable "Adidas" or "Nike" T-shirt on a street in Ho Chi Minh City , the biggest city of Vietnam .
The reason is not because Vietnam is attracting worldwide fashion brands due to its fast growing economy , but because it is not ever easier to make and sell fake T-shirts in Vietnam .
The issue of patent violation has been raised critically in recent years by Government and the society .
There are several problems in the governmental administrative level have been listed as the kernel of the issue .
Firstly , the National Inspection Organ has lacked of skills and human resource in investigating and tracing patent violation incidents .
Secondly , even when the violators are caught , the fines for their serious guilt are sometimes much lower than their unrighteous benefits; this leads to the fact that the offenders would rather pay the fines than give up their business .
Moreover , the critical contraband good problem has affected not only foreign companies but also the local companies with low quality products with lower prices .
This whole bunch of weak supports from the Government policy and law has lead to serious hampers in the local creativity of engineering design .
The effort for researching new social needs turns into the effort for importing foreign products .
These obstacles could make Vietnam become a technology dependent country in the area .
For recent decades , entrepreneur concepts have started budding those first steps in Vietnam for .
However , low skills in entrepreneurship are still making a main issue in training business mindset for young generation .
For instance , the e-commerce breaking out in recent years has made a large number of start-up companies in IT and media communication .
Most of the company- starter had been technicians before deciding to start their business with lacked and weak entrepreneurial skills .
Therefore , the approach of social and economical factors in the entire system of engineering design was omitted .
As a result , a lot of companies have had to resize or change their business .
In fact , the lack of entrepreneurship skills has caused missing stages in the process of engineering design for innovations .
In conclusion , certain problems are temporarily blocking the development of innovations in Vietnam .
However , from what can be observed in these recent years , especially after Vietnam joined World Trade Organization  , strong actions have been taken in reforming the law system as well as promoting the entrepreneurship in universities .
With a positive view , Vietnam is trying to shorten the gap between itself with the area and the world .
Eleven years ago , Singapore welcomes its first Newater plant , which is a turning point in Singapore's technology development history .
Newater represents the technology that purifies the used water to make it clean and drinkable again  .
During the last decade , the number of Newater plants increases to four .
Meanwhile , a new one is under construction .
What is more , in the near future , 30% of the demand of water will come from Newater .
During Newater's history , government , resources and the development of other technology show a significant influence on the development of Newater .
First of all , government plays a determining effect on the development of Newater .
Concerning about the situation of water supply in Singapore , the government officials decide to focus on the Newater technology to meet the water demand in Singapore especially for the industry and commercial use  .
The successful development of Newater is due to enough funds that government has invested .
With the support of Singapore government , the technology of Newater has blossomed and the fifth Newater plant has been successfully set up in the Chanqi area this year .
Besides the support of Singapore government , a lack of water supply pushes the development of Newater .
The shortage of potable water has become a global problem over the years .
What is more , about 40 percent of the population around the world and more than 80 counties are dealing with the problem of lacking of water  .
In consideration of Singapore , shortage of water results from several reasons such as geographic position , climate and increasing population .
Consequently , Singapore needs to import water from neighboring countries such as Malaysia to meet its needs  .
These reasons contribute to the development of Newater .
With the pressure of water shortage , having its own water supply system becomes more and more necessary .
That is how the resource shortage leads to the development of Newater .
Government and resource are not the only factors that affect the development of Newater; the development of other technology also plays an important role in accelerating the development of Newater .
In 1970s , Singapore already paid attention to the technology of its own water supply system; however , the cost was enormous and technology is immature such as the unreliable membrane is not reliable  .
Nowadays , the development of material science makes the technology of microfiltration succeed .
Meanwhile , there are some other breakthroughs in the technology helping the development of Newater .
Futuremore , the telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 and "by 1884 , long distance connections were made between Boston , Massachusetts and New York City ."
Bell was very interested in helping deaf people which leaded him to invent the telephone .
Also , "the telephone came as a direct result of his attempts to improve the telegraph ."
The invention of telephone is not a coincidence , but a lone-term research result .
In nowadays , telephone plays a very important role in our life , we can hardly live with them .
To conclusion , both Penicillin and telephone help people a lot and both of them are the product of hard working and long-term consummation .
The difference between them is whether the inventor has the clear purpose or not , which Bell had and Fleming had not .
But this difference does not decrease the value of either of these two technologies .
Human needs are always unsatisfied .
Centuries ago , providing sufficient food was the most urgent need .
At the same time health problems also created great needs for advanced medical technologies and facilities .
As years go by , industrialization emerged in many countries to meet various people's needs , like job opportunities and economic growth .
However , the big success of industrialization has created a problem for our modern peoplehow to save our fast degrading environment ?
Thus , designing technologies in environmental friendly manner is one of the greatest human needs to protect our living environment and to ensure a sustainable economic development .
After the problem has been defined , which is the first step of engineering design; engineers need to gather pertinent information about the problem .
For example , engineering who focusing on design environmental friendly transportation tools , must have the basic knowledge about the products of different types of fuel combustion and how they affect the environment .
They should also be updated about any latest methods to generate energy in environmental friendly ways , such as solar energy , tidal energy or wind energy , and their respective advantages and drawbacks .
Engineers will move on to next step once they are equipped with necessary knowledge .
The second step of the design process is generating different solutions to the problems .
For example , engineers basically come up with two main ways to make machineries and transportation tools less polluted .
First way is changing the way energy is generated , such as changing petrol engines which produce carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons to fuel cell which only produce water and oxygen .
This solution can be further divided by considering different types of method to generate energy in less polluting ways .
The other solution is dealing with the polluting products generated along the way .
For example , catalyst convertors are installed on cars to convert toxic gas carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons produced from non-fully combustion to non-toxic gas carbon dioxide and water .
Although different ways of solutions have been found out , not all are practical , so engineers also need to analyze and select a suitable solution .
For example , both of the two solutions we discussed before are theoretically correct , but today we only see convertor has been installed .
It is because changing the ways generating energy is very costly and the safety is unpredictable .
For example , fuel cells are very expensive , thus the cost of production will be so high that they will be unmarketable .
Another example , Hydro-powered cars , which actually have been produced but not used widely due to hydrogen is flammable , there are still big concerns of consumers' safety .
In this step , engineers will also look at other factors like economic , social factor to filter the solutions .
Finally , engineers will test their solutions and make continuous changes to their product .
Although it is difficult to have a perfect solution , engineers are still trying hard to meet our needs to save the environment .
When we look around , we can see the efforts put in by engineers , the power saved light bulb , solar water heater , car catalytic converters and etc .
These products are produced only after long and complicated designing process .
We should really be grateful to engineers who work dedicative to satisfy our needs .
Roger  explained the difference between technological determinism and social determinism or the social construction of technology .
Technology is not something that is independent of values .
Otherwise , technology is a product of society and obviously is influenced by norms and values of the social system .
On the other hand , technological determinism is the belief that technology causes changes in society and this implies technology is somehow autonomous .
Roger did not agree with the latter belief .
Technology never stands in itself; it always carries something in it .
Let us take a look at one example of a great human work in the late centuries: nuclear .
We are going to view the definition and some factors that make nuclear become a nuclear .
First of all , let us see the definition first .
According to Wikipedia ,"A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions , either fission or a combination of fission and fusion ."
Let us recall the Nagasaki and Hiroshima tragedies , both cities were destroyed completely because of this thing .
That was the first nuclear bomb executed on earth .
From that time , nuclear production was getting more popular all the time .
Nowadays , not only western countries , but also Asian countries  have nuclear power .
One thing to notice is that this stuff is very expensive .
In "50 Facts About U .S . Nuclear Weapon" , it is stated that the cost of the Manhattan Project  is 20 ,000 ,000 ,000 USD .
That is just the cost of one project in one country .
You can imagine now how much money we have spent to develop this 'nice' technology .
Although it costs great amount of money , but those nuclear countries are still improving their nuclear capabilities .
We must be wondering why people want to spend so much money on such things .
Basically I think the first reason is because humans hate to lose .
Usually when you are creating nuclear power , the main purpose is to make other countries respect and fear you .
This is very useful in military aspect .
My former history teacher one day said that "To create peace , we need big power ."
This means that if I have enough power to knock you , your friends and your family down , then it is very logical that you want to have a peace with me because you know that I am capable of doing awful things to you .
That is why people  want to be strong so that they are trying to develop something .
To conclude , I just want to emphasize that technology depends on social factors .
It is just like a knife; you can use it for good  or for bad  .
This nuclear case is just one of the examples .
The military aspect has contributed a lot to technology improvements .
And there are still a lot of aspects that contribute to technology as well .
Before the 1950s , most of electricity was created by burning fossil fuel , and no one was aware of other energy .
After the second world war , the whole world was busy recovering economics and industry .
So the need of fossil energy became more and more serious .
At this moment , a few countries found that only relying on fossil energy is not enough and there should be another efficient energy to be created .
After a few years in U .S . , the world's first nuclear power plant was set up .
However , when fossil fuel prices fall can any country resist the temptation ?
The answer is no .
During 1970s and 1980s , influenced by excessive industry development , the world's economic cost reached to a high point but at that time , fossil fuel prices were decreasing .
This mad those nuclear power plant which were under construction less attractive .
They just were set aside .
Almost as the same reason in 1973 , France and Japan suffered oil crisis .
Their governments could not pay for such high oil debts and these two countries decided to depend on nuclear technology .
In other words , France and Japan were forced to invest nuclear technology .
What is surprising that today 80% of the electricity in France is supplied by nuclear energy .
In Japan the percentage is also as high as 30%  .
.
But not all the countries can afford the cost to build up a nuclear power plant .
Take the U .S as an example .
The U .S . is the country having most nuclear power plants , and is well known by their technology in this area .
However in the U .S . , to build up an ordinary nuclear power plant will cost as much as $6~10 billion .
And this does not include the expense of repair and maintenance in the future .
So far , only big countries have their own nuclear power plants .
But it is sure that in the future , nuclear energy will give a strong support to the whole world industry economics .
When all the countries are aware this point , it is only a matter of time to make nuclear energy all over the world .
As nuclear technology becomes so important , it is necessary to have an international organization to supervise the process of every country's development .
Then the WANO  was set up .
With the WANO's beginning to discharge its duties , the world's nuclear development goes on the right way .
Now , although not all countries are using electricity supplied by nuclear energy , many parts of the world are benefiting from it .
In 2007 , 14% of the world's electricity came from nuclear power and , it can be seen after a few years the nuclear energy will benefit the whole world .
As many big cities in the world are facing the water crisis , as acid rains becomes increasingly frequent , as the number of lung cancer patients keeps going up , environment protection has become one of the most vital need of human .
To satisfy human's need and make contribution to protecting environment , engineers are to design and invent products in an environmental friendly way .
Through engineering design process , we can see how engineer satisfy that need .
For example , suppose an engineer is designing a process of producing a kind of detergent .
There are some factors , such as efficiency of the product and cost , to be taken into consideration for deciding the final plan .
If he can increase the importance of the factors related to environment protection , he may use substitute of phosphorus , or cleanse the waste water before discharge it .
Then the process and product would be more environmental friendly .
If engineers can think more about environment when designing , the product will become very environment-friendly .
Then our earth will become cleaner and more sustainable .
We will have a more comfortable and healthier environment to live in .
Government Regulations and Public Opinions in the Development of Electric Bicycle in China
In order to meet the requirement of government regulations and public opinions , the development of e-bike has gone through several changes; therefore it was shaped to the e-bike we see now .
Hopefully , the next typical image left by China to the world will be e-bike .
In 1936 , the first public video telephone had been developed .
At that time , people had to simultaneously go to special post office video telephone booths to use this service .
Until 1980s , with the development of chip , transmission technology , digital communication , video codec technology and integrated circuit technology , videophone became truly usable .
Then many predicted that videophone would be very popular someday and it would be loved by the public .
However , in recent decades , there was almost no market for the videophone and videophone has not emerged in our lives .
One of the reasons why videophone could not become popular is that there were technical problems .
Because the communication quality was not that good , users could not get clear and coherent images .
But apart from the technical factor , the development of videophone mainly limited by some social and economic factors .
Second reason is due to the privacy issues .
People sometimes do not want the other side to see their tired face .
When they are talking , they want to be relaxed and feel free .
Videophone users also commonly look at the video screen and not at the video camera , causing the eyes to take on an unnatural awkward glance , as the camera is usually just positioned away from the screen  .
Third , there was no unified standard .
For a long time , although there were some companies producing videophones , different kinds of videophone from different companies could not communicate with each other because they did not share a standard .
Another reason may be that people actually desire less fidelity in their communication , as evidenced by the popularity of written conversation  .
Nowadays , with the fast development of the internet , more and more people accept to video chat through some internet chatting software .
The necessity of using videophone is becoming lower and lower .
According to E .M .Rogers , the pioneer of diffusion of innovations theory , there are basically six stages in the innovation development process: needs/problems , research , development , commercialization , diffusion & adoption , consequences .
Specifically , in the development stage , there are two categories of organizations to generate innovation: conventional R&D  organizations and skunk works .
Conventional R&D organizations are "bureaucracies , structured to provide stability and continuity to nurture innovation"  .
On the other hand , skunk works are "small and often subversive units within a larger organization that are created in order to pioneer the development of a technological innovation"  .
Technologies generated in either organization require the dedication of researchers' hard work and basic capital support from the company .
There are some differences , however , between the technologies generated in these two organizations , in terms of time of accomplishing innovation , cost of generation , the maturity of products , etc .
One big difference between the technologies in the two organizations is time of accomplishing innovation .
Normally skunk works generate innovations more quickly than the conventional R&D organizations , for workers in skunk works work "on a crash basis to create an innovation" .
The well-known example is the development of Macintosh .
In the early 1980s , Steve Jobs , president of Apple Computer , established a particular skunk works .
Only after four years did the revolutionary new computer be displayed at Apple's annual stockholders' meeting  .
On the other hand , conventional generated technology probably takes a longer time; for example , another revolutionary invention , light bulb , was first generated in the 1800s .
Until the 1850s , after Thomas Alva Edison and other engineers' improvement , light bulbs became prevalent  .
In recent years , skunk works are mostly generated due to commercial or marketing competition .
Workers in the skunk works have stronger motives than those in the conventional organization .
The result is that researchers in the skunk works generate innovation faster .
To generate innovation in a comparable short time as mentioned previously , normally skunk works assemble more outstanding personnel and more capital as opposed to conventional R&D organizations .
Therefore , people highly selected can accomplish the task without much trouble in capital .
One example is the Xerox Corporation , then the world's leading document copier manufacturer , which founded its skunk works Xerox PARC with the investment of $150 million , which generated the mouse and other important personal computing technologies due to its brilliant personnel  .
Although Xerox failed to transfer those technologies to the marketplace due to its poor commercial strategies , it is significantly meaningful that in a short time , Xerox PARC attained so many technological breakthroughs that were adopted later .
Besides the differences of time and cost , nevertheless , when coming to the commercialization stage , products transferred from technology in skunk works are sometimes not so mature as those transferred from conventional R&D organization due to the time limitation .
Actually , the Macintosh was announced before 1984 , but then postponed several times for immaturity in technology  .
On the contrary , Conventional R&D organizations have more time to make their innovation more customer-friendly and more mature in technology .
In a nutshell , on average , skunk works generate technological innovations more effectively and efficiently .
However , it has higher requirements for the personnel and capital , which are difficult for some companies that are in shortage of capital .
Nevertheless , conventional R&D organizations can generate innovations stably and continuously , which is still essential to the development of the company .
The technologies generated in both organizations help build a better world .
Prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century , the needs of people are just basic-food , clothing , air and last but not least , shelter .
Now , the needs have just expanded from the basic four needs to other needs such as entertainment , communication , and transportation .
However , the question is which need requires more attention than the others in this modern era ?
The answer would be transportation .
Well , in order to have a better transportation , design processes are needed to fulfill the need .
Transportation which is cheap and safe , environmentally friendly and uses alternative source of energy has the utmost importance in the need of transportation .
One of the imminent problems faced by the modern transportation is to depend less on fossil fuels .
At the rate of usage of fossil fuels -at three billion barrels per year-now , it will not take long before the fuels deplete .
According to a presentation made by Osman Chughtai and David Shannon , fossil fuels will mostly run out in 17 years minimum or a maximum of 50 to 70 years .
Nevertheless , other transportation problems like producing too much pollutant such as nitrogen oxides .
Pollutants produced have been proved to have an enormous effect on the Earth ozone layer , corroding the ozone layers and exposing humans to the deadly ultraviolet ray .
To add to the problems stated above , the world currently needs a better transport , in terms of safety and functionalities as well as its cost .
As an example , cars produced must be durable , meaning that the cars must be able to withstand great momentum struck on them .
Besides that , weather must not be an obstacle for good cars .
In addition , cars must be low in cost despite having all the functionalities .
Therefore , in order to counter all the problems , engineers need to go through design processes .
First of all , engineering processes provides the foundation for researches to get a new state-of-the-art design .
Engineers have to identify the problems such as producing a transport that does not run on fossil fuel .
Then , they can brainstorm to come up with a new design that meets all the criteria for a better car .
Recently there was this groundbreaking news stating that engineers found a technology called H2CAR process , a process for producing fuels from plants or what they call the process-biomass . 
Besides researches , development processes enable engineers to produce designs that will be tested on real ground .
Effectiveness , durability and functionalities of the designs will be tested .
In this case , transportations like cars must be able to withstand extreme weathers and must be aerodynamically shaped for maneuverability .
Car safety must be included in the blueprint of the car as well .
Previously , engineers managed to come up with a design called catalytic converter with a function to reduce the pollutants released due to combustion .
In a nutshell , design processes are the main essence for a better future transportation , in terms of fuel type , environmentally friendly , functionalities as well as its cost .
This need must be taken seriously in order to secure a brighter future- a future people do not need to travel on bicycle or on foot .
"Chinese mobile phone users total 703 million" this is reported at 4th September 2009 .
But seven out of ten of the mobile phones users holding are not Chinese brands .
How can Chinese enterprises compete against foreign mobile phones ?
Innovation !
History witnesses that mobile phone markets are always broadened by new features of the phone .
Motorola 8900 which was available in market in the year 1995 was firstly featured with a cover so that miss-press of button was avoided .
At the same year the first self-chosen ring tongue was heard from Ericsson GH398 .
The first folding phone was Motorola 328C born January 1999 .Nokia 7110 is the first mobile phone with a wap browser which was released in October 1999 .
Hagenuk CH9771 was the first mobile phone put its antenna inside the phone .
All these new features brought a great raise in revenue .
Innovation shows great power in mobile market .
Function design has an endless way to go .
Basically a smart phone can have music player , video palyback , camera , GPS , wi-fi and so on .
There are plenty of functions now but the new the better .
A phone can act as a telescope in Birdnest during Beijing 2008 Olympic Games by using the camera and its zoom function .
It can also design a diet for its owner for here to lose weight .
A phone can be a weatherperson , an e-pet or whatever .
As technology develops and society changes , more and more functions will be possible and wanted .
Innovative mobile design is important also because designers can harvest both copy right and market .
A new design is protected by its copy right so that for the producer meet slight competition entering the market .
To conclude , China mobile industry need to work on innovation of phones' appearance and function .
Another very important problem in practical production is corruption .
And the corruption often causes more serious problems than other problems .
It is a so serious problem that exist almost every area .
For the leaders in the companies and factories , if they were corrupt , they will only care about their own benefits and ignore many others .
There are many cases that the leaders corrupt lead the whole companies or factories to go bankrupt .
And there are also some cases even more fearful .
Some of set up a company just want to cheat , all the actions that the companies make are all want to cheating for money from consumers or other companies .
For the staffs , if they were corrupt , they would not focus on their jobs any more .
Furthermore , they will envy others who have a higher position or make more money or make greater contributions .
In such case , they may do a lot of bad things , maybe to frame others , in order to make more benefits for themselves .
For workers , they will only care about how to please their leaders to get more benefits and not care about the production .
What the worse influence is the corrupt people will affect the general mood of a company or a factory .
To conclude , there are many problems existing hampering engineering design processes for innovations .
And the state of information communication and corruption are two most serious ones in my home country .
We should seek ways to solve them .
In this era of globalization , engineering design has been emphasized by the governments of the countries all over the world , such as United State , Russia and France .
This is because the development of engineering design could bring many advantages to country's economy and also in social aspect .
Actually , the scientists may perceive a future problem and launch some researches to overcome it .
If we observe our surrounding , we could see many inventions of technological creativity such as computer , automobile and other electrical appliances .
Nevertheless , there are some problems which significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations in my home country , Malaysia and cause the impacts on certain stages of the process of engineering design .
Other than financial problem , we are also facing the problem of lack of professionals in certain engineering fields such as mechanical engineering , chemical engineering and electrical engineering .
Many of the researches of engineering design which were carried out in the modern countries had been done successfully .
This is because there are many professionals in their countries .
In fact , the lack of professionals in engineering field results the failure of many researches .
For instance , some of the automobile researches have been failed due to the lack of the professionals .
The stage of analysis of design solution has been constrained because of the limited knowledge and lack of professionals .
Hence , some forums of the engineering design should be held between our country and other modern countries such as United State , United Kingdom and Germany .
For instance , the forum on how to manufacture an eco-car can be held in order to help us exchange our opinions with the professionals from modern countries .
In a nutshell , financial problem and lack of professionals in my home country should be solved as soon as possible , so as to improve our engineering design processes innovations .
Hence , private sector , the government and also citizens should work hand in hand in order to get more investment for engineering design researches and produce more professionals in the field of engineering design in the future .
Indonesia , a country hosting more than two hundred and thirty million citizens , is South East Asia's largest country and economy to date .
Yet Indonesia still trails behind its neighboring countries such as Malaysia , Thailand , and even The Little Red Dot: Singapore , in terms of advancement in design based technology .
It is commonly believed that the slow rate of technological growth in Indonesia is caused by two major problems , which may hamper the innovative engineering design process .
Firstly , Indonesia lacks culture of innovation .
According to the statistics published by UNICEF in 2007 , only fifty percent of Indonesian citizens are urbanized , which means the other half live in rural areas with little exposure to modern world and technology .
People living in traditional villages live very simple life .
They stick to their ancestors' traditions , and sometimes prefer traditional way of doing things to labor saving modern devices; for example: some farmers prefer buffalo driven ploughs to tractors .
Moreover , the farmers still rely on the government supplies and subsidies , which encounters a lot of logistics problems , instead of innovating their own way of solving problems .
Besides , most universities in Indonesia are more teaching based , less research intensive than those in Japan or The States; that makes Indonesian university students less creative and innovative in problem solving .
As a result , Indonesian engineers usually provide less possibility of solutions in tackling a problem compared to those who are trained abroad .
The second problem that may hamper the engineering design process in Indonesia is due to its both excessive and cheap natural resources , space , and workforces .
As mentioned before , Indonesia hosts more than two hundred and thirty million citizens , and its unemployment rate is considered high at 9 .1%  .
Thus , Indonesia needs to create jobs for its people; one way is by developing its agricultural businesses , which has been a hot topic lately during the presidential campaign .
Prabowo Subianto , son of Sumitro Djojohadikusumo , former minister of economics for both Indonesia and Malaysia , during his vice presidential campaign opposed a solution to current Indonesian problems; he promised to create jobs by developing bio diesel producing palm plantation in Indonesia , which may absorb about 6 million workforces .
It's apparent that innovative and labor saving devices will not work in Indonesia; the new invention seemed to be more expensive compared to the traditional way .
In conclusion , Indonesia still faces several challenges in developing its design-based technology .
To tackle them , Indonesian government has to work hard in developing innovative culture in the society , and decreasing the people's dependability on the government .
According to Khandani's statement "What distinguishes engineers from painters , poets , or sculptors is that engineers apply their creative energies to producing products or systems that meet human needs" , all engineering designs aim to meet human demand to become successful products .
Now , when the society becomes widely and continuingly developed , people are looking for new designs to satisfy their comfortable lives .
Those new designs may be the demands of entertainment , education or even something beyond our imagination .
However , in my opinion , one of the main concerns in our society is finding a new energy supply to alter the old ones , which become exhausted due to the overexploitation of human .
In order to solve this urgent demand , engineering plays an important role in finding the other alternatives such as nuclear energy , solar energy and geothermal energy .
Evidently , energy becomes vital and indispensable in our life , relating to most of everything we are working .
Because of the influence of energy , the natural resources have invisibly caused wars and conflicts between many countries over years and years .
The recent war between United States and Iraq in 2000 might be considered to be a typical example .
Although U .S . has been saying that this war was for the anti-terrorism , or more importantly for keeping the peacefulness of the world , it is clear that one of the reasons why American troopers stay in Iraq is the benefits of petroleum .
This is a typical example of showing how important energy is since it exerts a grave impact on our daily life .
Due to the non-renewability of the natural "fossil" resources , the more demands the society needs , the more exhausted they become .
According to the online newspaper Financial Times  and USA today news  , the oil reserves in Trinidad and Tobago will run out in the next 20 years and the world oil reserves will become exhausted just in 40 years .
These figures partly show the urgent necessity to find a feasible alternative energy source which will never become exhausted .
The process of finding a new alternative energy source , which is not only renewable but also environmental-friendly , has been conducted for a long time and regarded as an ultimate goal for engineering .
Another solution is the perpetual resources as known as solar , geothermal energy and etc . . .The solar energy is drawn from sunlight's energy by many solar panels which are designed to fit the house proof .
This energy will be converted into electric or thermal energy to serve our life .
Geothermal power takes the thermal calorie in the entrails in the earth and translates into other energies which contribute an important role to operate turbines and machines .
There are three basic types of geothermal energy plants  .
Geothermal energy is considered as the most potential alternative for the nonrenewable energy resource in the future .
Though the perpetual resources are always there for us , their use may be constrained by the lack of technology for control and delivery , and also by investment and willingness to pay .
Also , those resources may not be applied and used everywhere on earth due to the geographic differences .
In conclusion , I content that energy problem should be classified on the first priority in human must-solves not only because of many huge benefits it provides for people but also because of the critical shortage of energy resources .
In this context , engineering design process meets these urgent needs by finding many feasible solutions such as nuclear energy , solar energy and geothermal energy sources .
Although this process has just gotten initial achievements , it promises a fully potential energy source in the future which may permanently serve human kind .
Nowadays , the petrol price has fluctuated a lot .
Thus , many countries spend more money and time on developing new resources which can be used as a substitution to petroleum .
Energies such as solar energy have been promoted to fulfill this purpose .
This can be seen through the increasing in research and development of the solar cars or other products .
The using of the solar energy related goods has been highly encouraged by the environmentalists .
So I would like to discuss about the reasons of innovation of these technology in the following factors , named economic factor , government factors and environmental factor .
First of all , as what I have mentioned before , the petrol price was fluctuating in recent years , this makes many factories start to worry about the cost and the profit they can earn .
Most of them feel unsecured because the cost of petrol may lead the low profit or even red deficit .
Thus , they are keen to find out more substitutions .
So we can see many firms and companies start to invest in solar energy areas .
As solar power is actually inexhaustible and reproducible , they can use it whenever they want and it is free of charge as well .
However , the start-up cost is pretty high .
It is because of the cost of the batteries .
Presently , there is limitation of the amount of energy the batteries can store as we can only "use solar cells to generate up to 240 watts of electrical power in full sunshine" .
As long as we can find a way to increase the amount of the energy the batteries can store , the cost will not be much a problem anymore .
So I think , although they have to spend much more on researches now , they can definitely save more in the long run .
Secondly , petrol resources are not evenly distributed around the world .
This means that some countries control more petrol while some may not have it at all .
This results in certain countries feeling unsecured as they are afraid that their potential enemies may use this as a weak point to harm them .
For example , their enemy may cut down the inflow of the petrol provided to their land .
Without petrol , the economy in the country will be affected badly .
Lastly , solar energy is free of pollution .
It is commonly known that burning of petroleum will release carbon dioxide , nitrogen and some other gases which will cause air pollution .
This will in turn cause many harmful results include acidic rain or global warming .
On the contrary , solar energy will not lead to such pollution .
And as solar energy comes from the sun , it can be regarded as reproducible and we do not need to worry about if it will be used up one day .
In conclusion , I think we should decrease the using of petrol related product and slowly switch towards using the products which need new resources .
Only if we show our interests and demands on these products , those researchers can have motivation and more funds to do their projects .

Engineers are indispensable .
Their achievements are influencing the developments of every industry .
As the application of engineering spreads , few can tell the exact range of engineers' work .
But one task of all the engineers is common: to meet people's needs .
People's need is so various that one prime need must be given priority to avoid distractions .
In today's world , this need should be people's demand of fresh water .
As is known , water is a resource that human cannot live without .
Its uses range from climate regulating , industry application to food processing and daily drinking .
Water is even the sign of life .
Scientists often use it as the first criteria to judge whether there is life on a new landed planet .
This means that water is probably the first thing creatures need to maintain life .
Therefore , water is also one essential need for people to survive .
Back to a hundred years ago , water was never a concern .
While , today it is different .
It's now commonly recognized that fresh water will be the scarcest resource in the follow century .
Some people even assume that the next world war will be fought for the limited fresh water on the earth .
In order to ensure human's survival and the peace of world , engineers should respect the human's need for water most when designing products .
One aspect engineer should work on to meet people's need of water is to reduce the pollution in engineering process .
Pollution is one main reason for water scarcity .
To be exact , there is never a lack of water on the earth , but pollution damaged most of the available water sources , such as rivers and lacks .
Pollution in water is often caused by waste emission generated in industry processes .
To solve this problem , the best way is to emphasis environmental friendliness when engineers design machines or develop new procedures for industry use .
This can stop pollution to water more thoroughly than government's fine on water pollution .
In addition , engineers can design device that can save water .
People are using water everywhere in life other than in industry .
Therefore , if device can avoid wasting water in daily life of each person , it will surely save considerably large amount of water .
Small device like taps , water coolers , washing machines , can all be the targets of engineers .
Engineers should attach importance to water-efficiency together with other efficiencies regarding designing device , so that enough water can be conserved to meet people's need .
To sum up , engineering should give priority to people's need for water first , as water is necessary for human's survival .
In order to highlight this need , engineers should emphasis on environmental friendliness and water saving in designing .
For the next 10 years or more , Singapore would have a high percentage of population consisting of the elderly .
There are a few factors leading to ageing population , where some of them are low birth rates and increase in the cost of standard living .
With the increase number of elderly , there would be a need in safety areas , thus products or services should be designed to meet this need .
For example , one of the current market products is called "MEMSwear" which is produced by National University of Singapore engineers .
This product is a smart suit that is equipped with array of microsensors which are able to detect falls suffered by the wearers and to send alerts to their caregivers .
Besides these functions , the engineers have also included an "impact-reduction" system to reduce the damage does to the wearer when he or she falls .
For the product , we have seen that the engineers have make use of the engineering design processes to meet the need .
Firstly , they have defined the problem , which is the ageing population and they have seen the need to invent a product which could gives extra safety protection to the elderly .
Secondly , they have brainstormed on the preliminary criteria for a better design for the product ) .
For example , for the first version of the product , they have not included the "impact-induction" system .
Without this feature , the wearer might suffer a serious accident if he or she falls .
Thus , through the use of engineering design processes , they have come out with a better design of the product .
Next , this is another product which works alike as the previous product .
But other than the features that the "MEMSwear" has , this product has additional functions ) .
One of the functions is that upon receiving an alert when the user has a serious fall , it would dial for ambulance immediately .
This would greatly reduce the consequences of the fall if actions are taken within a shorter time .
Another additional function is the implementation of a temperature sensor .
For instance , in the case of a fire , the temperature sensor will be alerted and sends warning alerts to their caregivers or call for Civil Defense Force immediately .
Furthermore , when considering the design of the product , there is a need to make special considerations that are suitable for the elderly use .
Those factors that might need to take into consideration when designing the product are inflexible movements and slow response time .
Engineering would have to use the engineering design processes to list out multiple solutions the designing of product ) .
For each solution , they would have to analyze and select one of the best solutions that suits most of the criteria listed .
In order to make sure the product works well , engineers have to test it before they launched the product .
In conclusion , we have seen that the problems of ageing population could get more serious for the next few years , thus there is a need to design a product that could help to reduce the risks and impacts faced by the ageing population .
By the example of these two products , we could see that both of them have make use of the engineering design processes to meet the need .
And thus , it proved that it is really important to follow through the engineering design processes when inventing a new product .
Humans' activities on Earth have always been depleting Earth's valuable yet limited amount of natural resources and at the same time damaging Earth's environment .
This will cause Earth's natural resources to be depleted and modifying Earth's environment so much that it is no longer suitable for human life .
Therefore humans have to give priorities to conserving Earth's natural resources and protecting its environment .
This can be achieved by completely abolishing already available engineering processes , modifying and improving these old processes , or correctly identifying the reasons for the rise of that need .
Secondly , instead of removing available engineering processes , they can also be modified so that its original function is still available but at the same time satisfying the need to reserve natural resources and protecting the environment .
For example , transportation systems like cars require fuels like fossil fuels which is processed from a depleting natural resource , fossil fuels .
Furthermore , greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are produced from these cars which will contribute to the notorious greenhouse effect .
To solve this problem , engineering processes like the designing of the car's engine can be changed .
For instance , the introduction of electricity cars by General Motors , uses electricity to power the car's engine instead of fossil fuels .
This satisfy the need as electricity can be generated from renewable sources of energies like solar and wind energy .
Furthermore , greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide will not be emitted also .
Thus , we can observe how modifying available engineering processes can satisfy the need .
Thirdly , the need can be fulfilled by correctly identifying and analyzing the reason for the rise of that need , so that the correct decisions can be made in engineering processes to fulfill the need .
For example , CFC gases in the past is a by-product of many of our industries .
These gases causes the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer in the atmosphere which causes more harmful ultraviolet , UV rays to penetrate the atmosphere , causing health problems like skin cancer to humans due to these UV rays .
Therefore a worldwide policy was implemented to ban the emission of CFC gases into the atmosphere by industries .
Thus , we can see how making the correct decisions to prevent pollution to the environment can fulfill the need .
In conclusion , to ensure a sufficient supply of natural resources and a healthy environment for us and our future generations to live in , engineering processes can meet our need by removing and introducing or modifying available engineering processes and making the correct decisions in engineering processes can fulfill that need .
According to Khandani  , engineers design products or systems that meet human needs .
Out of all the human needs in the world , to have clean water should be given priority compared with others .
Despite the fact that the amount of water on earth is quite large , nevertheless , we can only drink a very small part of it .
It is because most of the water in the world is sea water , which is not potable at all .
In addition , due to the global warming , the sea level rises .
Therefore , some precious sources of drinking water , like underground water is polluted and not drinkable any more , which makes the situation even worse .
In some regions in the world , such as the Middle East and Africa , the shortage of clean drinking water is very serious , which even causes wars sometimes .
To solve this problem , there are two ways in which engineers can contribute .
The first way is to design a system to recycle used water .
Water we daily use can be divided into two categories , which are respectively for drinking and not for drinking .
For example , water we use to flush toilet , to irrigate farmland and to wash cars is not necessary to reach the same hygienic level as the drinking water .
Hence , we may use recycled water to do these jobs so that we can save more clean drinking water for people to drink .
Actually , this idea has already been adopted by many countries to relieve the pressure caused by the shortage of water .
Moreover , some developed countries , such as Singapore , have mastered this technology so well that recycled water can be drunk directly , which really helps a lot to solve the problem of shortage of water .
However , this method may not suitable for those developing and undeveloped countries because it costs a lot of money , and the technology required is also very high .
The other way to get drinking water is the desalination of sea water .
As mentioned before , the amount of sea water is truly vast; therefore , humans can certainly take sea water as another source of drinking water .
However , the process of desalination of sea water is very difficult .
It requires highly advanced science and technology , and of course , it is very costly .
Another limitation of this method is that it can only be applied in seaside countries , like Singapore , which means that it is not the first choice to many inland countries .
But since it also has its advantage , like the huge and widespread source , it is still worth trying .
According to Khandani  , the net result or purpose of most engineering designs is to produce a product that generates a profit for the company .
Therefore , since the two methods mentioned above are both costly and difficult to apply , they can be restricted by the economic and market and thus , they may be not able to solve the shortage of water in a short period .
But what is important is that , at least , these two methods give us hope .
It is this kind of hope that motivates humans to develop , to improve , to pursue our dream , and finally to have such a beautiful world today .
Hope is the most significant contribution which engineers have ever made to the world .
Environment-friendly car is a current humans' need which should be given priority .
Humans need to travel from one place to another easily .
The current car's technology , the fuel injection has satisfied that need , but dissatisfies environment's need .
Humans need a car which not only able to transport them easily but also friendly to the environment .
It is engineers' job to apply their creative energies in designing a solution which meets humans' need .
First of all , the current car's technology , the fuel injection has satisfied humans' need to travel .
For example , the time taken to travel from one place to another with a distance of a few hundred kilometres has reduced from 2-3 days to 2-3 hours; as a result , humans are able to travel instantly .
This is indeed makes human's mean of transportation rises to another level .
Second , in contrast with the benefit which the fuel injection has contributed to humans' life , it has polluted the environment .
This is due to the fuel processing in the car .
For example , the fuel injection is exhausting Carbon Dioxide  as a result of incomplete burning of fuels .
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps the earth's heat and contributes to global warming .
Lastly , Japan's engineers had followed engineering design processes , Khandani  , to design their first eco-car .
They started by defining the problem of the fuel injection system .
They defined that the fuel injection system's problem lies on the fuel it uses .
Therefore , Japan's engineers started to look for alternate fuel for their eco-car .
They gathered information in order to arrive successfully at the right fuel's source; subsequently , they decided to use electricity as the fuel .
The road to success is not smooth; likewise , Japan's engineers had gone through a lot of challenges and tests before they arrived at their final prototype of Japan's first eco-car .
Humans need to care about the environment's condition , in order to preserve it for the new generation .
The new generation deserves to live in the same environment as we do .
To conclude , by using engineering design processes , engineers can design product that meets humans' need .
Healthcare is a basic essential in every country .
It compromises of the people's living condition , availability of medical treatment and prevention of disease .
Emphasis on healthcare services differs from country to country .
For instance in Singapore and Japan , healthcare is emphasized on the elderly due to their aging populations but both execute their policies in a different way .
Hence , we will look at the principle of healthcare of the elderly in respective countries and the solution to the healthcare needs of an aging population .
The aging community has become an eminent issue in Singapore .
With a replacement rate of 1 .5 children to 2 adults and estimation that by 2030 , 18 .4% of the population will be make up of the elderly , it is no wonder why Singapore government is promoting reproduction in young couples .
As the population ages , the main users of hospital services will be the old aged .
Therefore , improvement in healthcare services for the elderly is essential .
Mobility of the elderly is a factor as well , as they have problems walking and moving around .
According to a survey in 2004 , Singapore is named one of the unfriendliest countries towards the wheel chair bounded .
Hence , there is a need for us to better the healthcare services of our older citizens .
In Japan , nearly one quarter of the population is made up of the old aged .
This is mainly due to the speed of industrialization in Japan .
Being one of the economic giants , Japan industrializes very fast at an early stage .
This causes an imbalance between work and family .
The fast paced society force citizens to place work as priority over family resulting in a declining population .
In addition , in Japan , pay increases with the age of the workers .
Hence , companies tend to seek younger employees causing the older workers to lose their jobs and their health pension benefits .
Since the number of old aged is increasing , it is important to cater to their needs in terms of healthcare .
The first concern is the living condition of the old aged .
Home care facilities such as hospice; day care centre and nursing home are built to look after the elderly especially when their family members are unable to do so .
For example , in Singapore , one room apartment with specially installed emergency buttons and lifts are catered to the elderly .
These apartments are created in such a way that they minimize the risk of the elderly injuring themselves .
The second concern is the mobility of the elderly .
Shopping malls and other common places should be equipped with more ramps and handicapped friendly escalator .
Furthermore , on trains in Singapore , certain seats are allocated for the elderly .
Last but not least , health benefits for elderly should be protected .
They should be offered free medical checkups and treatment if necessary .
In conclusion , healthcare services should not be neglected especially in countries , which face aging population .
More need to be done to improve our healthcare sector so as to achieve a healthier and wealthier society .
Over the past century , numerous research breakthroughs and creative innovations have allowed engineering design processes to meet various human needs .
According to Khandani  , engineering designs are systems that are introduced by humans through combining different technologies and innovations to satisfy a particular human need creating ability for humans to complete a task faster or more efficiently .
To produce these systems , design processes are carried out over a period of time , ranging from months to years , and they are conducted based on a series of steps .
For example , water supply has been a main concern for the Singapore government as Singapore has no natural sources of water .
Consequently , after years of research and design in aim to alleviate this problem , the NEWater technology was invented .
This technology allows used water to be reusable after undergoing treatment through microfiltration and reverse osmosis .
This is an example in which a particular human need has been satisfied by an engineering design system .
Even though engineering design processes have been aiding humans in meeting many of their needs in the past , many others have yet to be satisfied; and the need to tackle pollution is one of them .
Pollution has been an ongoing problem for the past few decades or so and thus far , little has been done to alleviate this problem .
Global warming , as a result , is becoming more and more an issue of raising concern as little has been done to eliminate or tremendously reduce pollution .
Temperature has been increasing due to the excessive release of greenhouse gases; and sea levels have been rising due to the melting of ice caps in the North and South poles .
Time is running out and to protect the sustainability of life on Earth , necessary actions have to be taken immediately if not , as soon as possible and the help of engineering design processes should not be left out .
First and foremost , vehicles have been a main source of pollution and a large contributor to the emission of greenhouse gases .
In the past , vehicles used to emit harmful gases such as carbon monoxide .
Subsequently , engineering design processes have made possible the invention of catalytic converters which convert the harmful gases emitted by vehicles into non- harmful gases .
On the flip side , although the problem of the emission of harmful gases has been handled , vehicles today are releasing carbon dioxide , which is a greenhouse gas , instead .
Consequently , a new engineering design process has to be carried out to rectify this problem .
After years of research , then comes the idea of inventing an environmentally-friendly car; also known as an ecocar .
For example , a group of Engineering and Design students from Singapore has invented its first environmentally-friendly car which does not emit any amount of carbon .
This is an example of a great breakthrough of an engineering design process which will be able to tackle the problem of pollution .
Another area of concern that is contributing much to the pollution of the environment is energy generation .
Power stations , also known as power plants , are common sources of energy in most countries and they make use of the combustion of fuels to produce energy in powering up the whole city .
Due to the combustion of fuels , pollution occurs; and taking into consideration that many countries have adopted the use of power stations , the effects of polluting the environment occur on a large scale .
Therefore , cleaner sources of energy generation have to be discovered and engineering design processes can do just that .
An example of a clean method of energy generation would be the invention of solar technology .
Solar technology makes use of heat and radiation from the Sun to produce useful forms of energy; and this is made possible by engineering design processes .
To conclude , pollution is an ongoing , serious problem in which swift actions need to be taken .
It is a human need to neutralize this situation because Earth's and human's sustainability is at stake .
With engineering design processes , the benefits of gaining control over pollution are tremendous .
However , engineering design processes take a certain period of time as factors such as safety and other side effects have to be put into consideration too .
Moreover , we humans cannot be totally dependent on engineering design systems only .
We have to be socially-responsible as every living person has a part to play in tackling pollution .
Throughout the years , there has always been a debate on whether technology shapes society , a technologically determinist perspective , or does society shape technology , a socially determinist view .
One such technology that is closely related to this debate is the invention of the automobiles .
Without this invention , we would probably still be riding the bicycle to work or school .
Looking back at history , we can see how this important technology has been shaped by societal factors as well as technological factors .
Due to the influence of these factors , the gasoline powered cars have won over the electric cars for years .
Firstly , societal factors like the expansion of cities favor the gasoline cars over electric cars .
As cities grow bigger , it becomes impractical to have an electric car for travelling .
For example , the gasoline powered cars can travel an average of about 300km on a full tank of petrol as compared to a maximum distance of 150km for a full charge on an electric battery .
In big cities like the United States , travelling to and fro from work can easily surpass 100km .
Also with the expansion of society , time becomes money .
No one is willing to spend 8 hours a day waiting for their car to be charged fully before they can make use of it .
Next , technological factors current available technology and limitation of resources have also helped shaped the automobiles .
With current technology , more hybrid cars are showing up on the market .
Hybrid cars involves either part gasoline part electric or part gasoline part compressed natural gas  .
This is made possible only with the advancement of technology as compared to the past .
For instance , the regenerative brake system has been invented whereby you charge your battery just by braking .
Car manufacturers like Chevrolet are cashing in on this possible new market , and coming up with new models like the Optra Magnum CNG in 2008 .
With a cleaner and efficient hybrid car , more people are opting for the switch .
The gasoline powered car has finally seen a worthy competitor .
However , technological restrains like limited resources has been a set back for hybrid users .
Looking at Singapore for example , there are only 5 CNG refueling points around the country .
To get your vehicle refueled would be troublesome if the nearest CNG petrol station is far away .
This constrain makes consumers think twice before purchasing a hybrid vehicle .
Also , the fact that hybrid cars are a relatively new technology , car repair shops might not have the knowledge to repair hybrid cars yet , and any repairs must be sent back to the car manufacturer .
This makes it inconvenient if the shop is located far away from the consumer .
In short , these few factors have played an important role in shaping the automobiles that we know today .
Imagine if there no technological restrains and that we could create a self replenishing battery .
The possibilities are endless , but it proves one point .
Technology and society co-exist and affects one another .
Even till now , we are shaping many other technological inventions .
Only the future can foretell the impact of these factors on technological advancement such as in the automobile industry .
Who knows , hybrid cars might actually manage to successfully dethrone the gasoline powered cars in the near future .
Electronics such as lights and cars have become essential to the human beings over the past years .
These electronics though wonderful , but they consume a huge amount of energy .
Given that the global price of fuel is on the rise , users of these electronics are incurring higher cost .
One current human need that should be given priority for engineering design is to have cost saving electronics .
Firstly , the problems with lights is that , in order to save electricity , the user will have to manually turn off the lights upon leaving the area , which is rather impractical in places such as offices , toilets and classrooms which require the lights to be constantly turned on .
The idea of electricity conservation on usage of lights was to have the lights automatically turned off when the area is empty .
As a result , the idea sparked off the concept of integrating motion sensors to lights .
The milestone in having a motion sensor light to automatically turn on and off the lights with the presence of a human being was how to accurately identify the presence of a human being in the area monitored by the sensor .
To overcome the milestone , the motion sensors use infrared energy to detect human beings .
In addition , these sensors are also highly sensitive to human body temperature , therefore resulting in a highly accurate detection .
Today these motion sensor lights are used almost everywhere , in offices , toilets , classrooms and even homes .
In Singapore , public transports such as taxis , buses have converted to CNG .
In addition , according to Channel NewsAsia , there is an increasing number of private cars owners converting their conventional petrol fuel powered cars to CNG cars .
Engineering designs have improved the designs of lights and cars , which used to consume a huge amount of energy in the past .
To sum up , with the depletion of natural resources and high electricity and fuel cost , engineering designing should be given priority to cost saving electronics .
Engineering design is the process of creating a system or products to meet the desired needs of people .
Usually , engineers face difficulty in designing a product or coming out with ideas that are of demand by the public .
As an engineer , he needs to define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate and analyse multiple solutions and finally , test and implement whether the solution works .
However , the two most disturbing problems that may hamper engineering design processes for innovations are the inability to generate multiple solutions to convince their superior to implement their products or ideas and the failure of constantly creating a product that are of demand .
Firstly , in the aspect of generating multiple solutions , engineers often face the problems off lacking of funds and unable to convince their superior that their idea is feasible .
In most cases , their design will be rejected because the product or idea is not conventional .
Their idea or product is a total new concept which people may find it hard to accept because of traditional idea or product that may have etched in their mind .
For example , in the Singapore National Service , the professional nature of the military officers , using its portion of dominant influence , typically make most of the important decisions about innovation .
In addition , the low ranking cadets usually fail to convince the high ranking officers that their innovative products or ideas may improve the military .
One example is the introduction of unmanned combat air vehicles by the engineers in the military .
This unmanned combat air vehicle may be potent enough to replace the ubiquitous manned fighter in the near future .
However , due to the higher officer not having enough trust over the air vehicle being piloted by human , this unmanned combat vehicle project did not succeed in carrying out .
Instances such as the above example will significantly affect the morale of the engineers .
Hence , it is imperative to address the issue of engineers unable to convince their superior to implement their products or ideas .
As an engineer , if their ideas or products face constant rejection by their superior , they will stop coming up with new ideas or products as they see no purpose for coming up with new ideas or products and constantly opposing their superiors .
Thus , the superiority in company will significantly hamper engineer morale and their design .
Secondly , the other problem that restricts engineer design is the lack of confident to implement ideas or products that are of demand .
Although in the initial stage the surveying of their products response may be good , when it comes to implementing their ideas or products , the response may be of the reverse .
Engineers spend efforts in developing the products , but the final products that they design may not be of popular demand .
Society always strives for useful and economic products .
Products that are not practical and expensive will face rejection .
For instance , in the 1960s , Singapore developed a phone that was able to see the other caller .
This type of phone faced rejection because the phone was expensive and users found it infringing their privacy .
As a result , the sales of these phones were low , affecting the morale of the engineer who design this phone .
As an engineer , facing multiple failures may cause them to be disheartened and put them on high alert as they will be more careful when they want to design a product .
They will tend to feel disappointed because they need to solicit a lot of funds , putting in their utmost efforts when developing the products , and only to find out that their products face rejection by the public .
This will seriously restrict their innovation because they may be afraid to face constant failure .
The "best" design solution is always hard to develop because it is one that most completely fulfils the client's requirements .
Therefore , engineers may just stop at gathering pertinent information , and not go into generating multiple solutions as they are worry that their products may not be of demand as expected , which again hamper their design processes for innovations .
In conclusion , it is usually the lack of ability to convince the superiors and the constant rejection by the public that significantly hamper engineering design for innovations .
Traditional mindset should be changed and let engineers have a chance to develop their ideas .
Furthermore , engineers should do their research and marketing of their products effectively , such that product that they develop will be of marketing value .
Scientific technology has been developing rapidly since the first industrial revolution .
Meanwhile many new kind of innovative inventions come out almost in every day changing the way people living .
There exists a remarkable fact which is that a technical innovation is viewed different between different groups of people .
A wonderful invention to a group of people may be dislike to the other ones .
In general , the justification of the utility of a specific technology or invention depends on the specific perspectives from different group of people .
Space technology is a good example to explain the reason how different views come out .
Space technology is a kind of high innovative , high compositive and also high cost technology .
Its aim is to find out the unknown scientific questions and for military use .
The beginning of space technology derives from America and Russia .
Then it quickly spreads out to all over the world .
Nowadays European countries , China , Japan and India are all have a high development in space technology .
Toward this new technique , there are two opposite opinion exist in these days .
Government and scientists think it is worth to spend money and people working on this , and it will benefit the whole country .
However , many people look it in another way that it is a waste of resource which can be used to improve people's living condition .
If we look a little deeper into the causes that lead to the opposite solution , we will find that the focus that specific group of people pays attention to is , obviously , quite different from each other .
In the government and scientists' point of view , space technology is essential that it is the fundamental things we need to do to protect our country and fulfill future needs .
They pay lots attention to keep technique developing moving and more concentrate on the huge issue , like military demand , and the future .
That is also the reason why every country tries their best to improve the space technique .
Former president of America Regan even state the announcement of star war program , although it was given up at the end .
In conclusion , judgments towards a technical innovation or development always tend to different directions when these are made by different group of people .
All in all , the difference does really derive from the different thinking perspectives .
Because people tend to think about things associating with their own experience and life , different justification come out .
Why is the petroleum so important ?
Petroleum can be extracted and refined to produce fuels including petrol , paraffin , and diesel oil .
Without these extracted products from petroleum , cars cannot run , planes cannot fly , and ships cannot launch out .
The world may not run any more .
What's more , petroleum is a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons which is present in suitable rock strata and is not reproducible for now .
It is said that after 60 years , the world will run out of petroleum .
How are we going to solve this problem ?
There are two ways to solve this problem .
One way is to conserve and save the petroleum .
Engineers have brought out some solutions for saving the petroleum .
The greatest consumption of petroleum is in the transportation operation .
One of the engineer's solutions is to mix the alcohol and petrol together to provide the energy .
This solution is now in the test and implement period .
In Wuhan , one of the biggest cities in China , all the taxies are operating using this mixture fuel .
Another solution , which is almost the same concept , is the Hybrid-Electric Vehicle .
This kind of vehicles uses both electric power and fuel and is different from the previous version .
It combines the electric power system and fuel system together .
When the vehicle starts , it consumes the electric power .
After the speed of the car reaches a certain range , it will switch to fuel power system .
When using fuel power to start the car , the fuel is not fully burned .
That's why we can smell strong petrol when the car starts .
To do this concept of power system is to let the fuel fully used in order to save the fuel .
However , conservation alone cannot solve the problem .
The other way is to develop new energy resources to replace petroleum .
Hydrogen fuel cell , solar power and nuclear power are the three hottest topics that interested engineers most .
The research of fuel cell on vehicles was started in early 1960s and it gets well developed until now .
Most of car makers have come out with their own hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles .
But hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are still in the test and implement phase .
There are some prototypes running on the road .
But for finalized product , the cost should be reduced and the efficiency of the cell should be increased .
Solar and nuclear power are the more advanced technology .
Solar power is in the experimental phase .
The key point to increase the efficiency of solar power is how to concentrate the sunshine .
If this point can be solved , the potential of solar power is prodigious .
For nuclear power , actually it is using the power generated by the nuclear fusion .
Nuclear fusion is the same way as the sun to generate its power .
The research of nuclear fusion has been processed for decades , but the progress is not so obvious .
In brief , the energy problem is one of the most serious problems to us now .
So we need to be step by step , follow the right rules , to get the best solution of this urgent problem .
We live in an era of great change , an increasingly global society as a result of rapid growth in information and communication technologies .
However the above only holds through for those who are not stricken with poverty .
Surely the needs of these people , most of whom are based in developing countries , are endless .
The need for basic infrastructure ranks high on their priorities .
This is because basic infrastructure is the basis for any country to develop essential facilities like transport , housing and education , to help the poor .
The engineering design process is an effective way through which the needs of these people could be met comprehensively .
According to Kandani , the very first step in any engineering design is to identify the need and to define the problem .
The word 'need' refers a man's desire for a certain product or system .
This need is usually identified by the society and may vary from society from society .
Thus needs which are considered a necessity to some might actually be a luxury to others .
For example , infrastructure is a real need for those living in the rural villages in Asia but not for the nomads in Africa , although both groups are affected by poverty .
The nomads would prefer to conserve the forests and wildlife so as to be able to carry on their nomadic lifestyle .
This example clearly illustrates the importance of establishing the need accurately so that engineers would be able to work effectively towards solving the problem .
The second step of this engineering design process is to gather essential information .
In this step , engineers analyze the existing solutions and pick out the pros and cons .
Economic , environmental and safety factors are also analyzed .
Many developing countries have made big plans on establishing infrastructure in the rural areas in an attempt to bridge the gap in the standard of living between the urban towns and suburban villages .
However , these plans tend to get hit by delays after delays because of various reasons .
So it's vital for engineers to collect as much information as possible so as to not repeat the mistakes and go down the same slippery slope of their predecessors .
Once this is done , engineers can start to formulate multiple solutions .
This step urges engineers to temporarily throw the rulebook out of the window , open up their minds and explore many different ideas and possibilities .
Dr . Kandani suggests that a team with professionals from different fields be formed .
This team can work together and share their knowledge and expertise to come up with a few solutions .
The most logical step after you have come up with a few solutions is to pick the best one .
This is actually the decisionmaking process , after studying the various solutions .
For instance , if a school is being built , based in the land available , few designs would have already thought off .
Certain schools might be able to hold more students while not proving to be as stable as another that hold fewer students but is very much stronger .
So it is in this step that engineers make the decision of which design to adopt while weighing in all the factors to come up with a viable solution .
In conclusion , I would like to recommend the engineering design process because it's very complete in its steps to provide a solution to those in need .
The establishment of basic infrastructure in developing countries through engineering design will give the poor an avenue to success fully escape from the vicious cycle of poverty .
The world today is undergoing global warming which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation .
The solution to this problem is the harnessing of an alternative form of energy called kinetic energy in wind .
An example of a product created for this purpose is the wind turbine and it is created using the three main steps in design process to address the problem which are problem definition , information gathering and testing and implementing of solutions .
The first step in the design process is the problem definition .
Following this procedure helps to generate more solutions to the problem addressed .
Tapping of kinetic energy in wind is a good solution as wind is abundant due to the frequent changes in the atmospheric pressure .
It announces to the engineers that Earth is in grave danger , thus giving them more motivation to think of a solution .
For example , by defining the problem as the fast decreasing quantity of fossil fuels , it gives engineers an insight to create a product which can be used to tap kinetic energy in wind .
Referring to the earlier models of windmills like those built in Sistan , Iran , from the seventh century , which were used to grind rice grains , engineers used the same concept to create wind turbine which converts kinetic energy in wind to electrical energy .
The second step in the design process is the gathering of information .
The credibility of the problem needs to be addressed after the problem has been defined .
The important factor which determines the efficiency of the wind turbine is the general wind flow in the area where the wind turbine is built .
Since the wind turbine heavily depends on the wind to generate electricity , it is important to study the wind flow pattern before the wind turbine is built .
For this study , past weather forecasts and also the internet play vital roles in providing information needed to improve the efficiency of the wind turbine .
The overall gain in electrical energy needs to be calculated to decide whether the building of wind turbine is worth its value .
The last step in the design process is the testing and implementing of solutions .
The testing and implementing solutions is closely related to the analysis of the design solution .
The main factor which contributes to the analysis is marketability .
For example , the Matilda built at Goland , Sweden produced a surprisingly high sixty-one gigawatts per hour of electricity in fifteen years which produced more energy than the other typical wind turbines .
However , the Matilda was demolished on June 6 , 2008 .
In conclusion , the main three steps in the design process help to create a guideline for the engineers to follow .
Problem definition requires knowledge of wind and thus making full use of it .
In terms of information gathering , the efficiency of the wind turbine is of paramount importance in determining whether it really solves the problem .
Lastly , the testing and implementing of solutions consists of marketability , ergonomics and safety which serve as a check on whether the product is deemed suitable to solve the problem .
Nowadays , engineering design products are cores for everything .
Engineering systems play important roles in all the fields; for example entertainment , healthcare as well as education .
Although it is essential for all the fields , engineering products and systems in healthcare and medical fields should be given the highest priority since health is the most important thing for all human beings .
Designing of medical products which can make all human beings; young and old as well as disabilities easier and safer is obviously important .
Moreover , some medical products like "Fall Detection System" and "Posture monitoring system" can even help people save life in some ways .
On the other hand , people spend much more time normally for entertainment than healthcare .
As a result there are mass products for entertainment because of high demand .
Instead , healthcare products should be widely available and used .
There are many healthcare products which are available in research organization but not widely available in current market .
For example , "Fall Detection System" which can detect the fall of person especially elder people and can send instant message via sms to relatives so that the person can get immediate help in critical situations .
As mentioned in "Global action on aging" website that the number of senior citizens are rising and the action for this should be taken , it is obvious that increasing number of elder people and taking care of them has been necessary to be considered .
It is also mentioned that since the number of elderly people increases , the burden of caring is also increasing for young people .
Hence , engineering should consider the situation of increasing number of elders and come out with the solution which can take care of situation in order to help elder people safe as well as make youth work without worry .
Although there are R&Ds for healthcare products for monitoring and taking care of elder people , these devices are not widely used in the market .
So , in order to get this situation , engineers should think about the ways that can make the design process meet the need of the market situation .
In order to make engineering design product meet the needs , first of all , clear and unambiguous definition of this problem should be defined .
Problems should be widely and well defined by engineers , elder people as well as adults so that more innovative products and ideas come out .
Moreover , it is also necessary to make sure that there is enough information to generate clear problem definitions that addresses the real need .
Once alternative solutions coming out , engineers need to analyze and decide bested suited solution to implement  .Government and organization are also responsible to support R&D process in order to gather information needed , generate multiple solutions , analyze solutions and test as well as implement solutions which are the necessary steps for the design process .
In conclusion , engineers should try to get preferable situation in the market for the products , for example , "Fall Detection System" which can take care of elder people and "Posture monitoring system" which can help people of all ages to maintain best posture with the help of government and organizations as well as consumers .
And the goal can also be achieved by developing most suitable design engineering process for the system and products for healthcare .
A human need is a necessity that human required in order to survive .
One main necessity is food .
According to the World Food Program's 2008 report , 25000 people are dying every day due to famine and related issue .
A large portion of the deaths comes from the Third World Countries like Africa and India .
By using the Engineering Design Process introduced by Seyyed Khandani , a professor at Diablo Valley College , we can reduce the famine .
Some factors that play a part in of famine include political , technological and environmental issues .
In 1970s , the WFP has been providing food to India to temporarily solve the famine .
During this period , they have been analyzing the situation to generate other solutions to permanently solve the famine .
According to the design process , the second step is to gather related information , then generate various solutions .
The first off solution is to provide genetically modified seeds and fertilizers to the farmers , so that they will obtain higher yield .
Before this solution was implemented , they did a further study , and realized that the solution will not work; as the farmers are using traditional farming methods which are not yield efficient .
Hence , the WFP provided machines and farming education to the farmers in the 1980s .
These aids have improved the famine situation as the famine dropped by about 20% in a WFP's 1990s report; On the other hand , these solutions are not applicable to all the lands in India as various areas have different types of lands .
For the dry lands , the WFP has do further researches on water irrigation methods .
One of the solutions is to construct a drainage system from the Indira Ghandi canal to irrigate the dry lands in the region .
Some events like drought , flood and earthquakes are causes to famine .
These types of events are unavoidable .
Nevertheless , events like deforestation and overgrazing has affected the fertile lands and caused the yield to go down .
While governments spend millions and billions of dollars on entertainments and military expenditure yearly , these large amount of money can be put to good use in helping their own people .
India has increased the military spending by 50% in 2008 , bringing the amount to 40 billion dollars; despite that 35% of the people are still affected by famine .
The famine caused by these situations is preventable .
That large amount of money can be invested in the agriculture sector , like having the technology to plant seeds that will grow on dry land , which will greatly solve the famine .
In conclusion , the WFP can do more researches and analysis , like creating genetic modified seeds that can survive in dry or wet land , or an indoor farming center that will shelter the crops from natural disasters , which will resolve the famine issue .
In addition , the governments can try to allocate more budgets to the agriculture and research center than invested tons of money on entertainment sector , which is redundant when people in their own country are suffering without having a basic need .
The last step of the design process is to test and implement the solution .
By moving a small step forward , will reduce the famine .
Poverty is unavoidable , but famine is preventable .
Thus , we should do more to help the people that are suffering from famine .
Another value of radio was its ability to perform mass communication .
As the average cost of production declined steadily , radio set was mass produced leading to the birth of radio broadcasting .
Broadcasting allows single directional flow of communication where important information can be disseminated to the mass quickly and effectively .
Warnings and announcements regarding weather or disaster evacuation can be made via broadcasting will greatly help in minimising the casualty rate in a disaster as the mass can receive vital and timely information and instruction even when the cable lines are damaged .
The other factors that influence the development of radio will be military demands .
The need for communication between joined military operations across forces and formations lead to the development of powerful signal set .
To prevent enemies from tapping on their communications or disrupting their signals , technology such as "anti-jamming" was developed by the military .
Besides improving on communication , military demands had also led to the invention of radar which uses radio wave in detecting distance objects and getting information such as their location and movement .
The technology of radar was soon transferred to civil usage such as by the commercial planes and ships due to its usefulness in navigation .
Another development of radio by military is guided weapon which arises from the need to raise accuracy of weapon in decreasing the chances of damaging and injuring civilian or allied forces .
In conclusion , radio is an important technology that is still being developed and improved continuously .
From its communication values to other discovered usages , economic factor and military demands have played a positive role in its overall development .
Invention and development of radio has better the society in numerous ways .
A need refers to what is required in order to do something or achieve some state of being .
'Human needs' , for example , have been taken to describe requirements which must be satisfied if harm to an agent is to be avoided .
Overpopulation is one of the current human needs that should be given priority .
Size or Density of the population affects the overpopulation .
In the world where the human populations are growing , we should focus on solving the problem of insufficient land to maintain the life on earth .
The houses today are stronger , and some of them can withstand natural disaster .
For example in Japan , a country where earthquake happen often , their engineer is trying to solve the problem of building a building that can withstands earthquake .
By using the Khandani Principle , the engineers gather pertinent information about the earthquake and manage to implement a solution after several test had been conducted , called Seismic retrofitting method , where Seismic retrofitting is the changing of existing building to a structure that is more resistant to ground motion  , soil failure due to earthquakes or seismic activity .
Engineers try to solve overpopulation by combine many houses into one building , thus building multi-unit housing or also known as attached dwellings has been invented .
Apartment , barracks , tenement and terrace house is good example of multi-unit housing .
Engineer applied Khandani principle that time , they define the problem and has gather enough information to make sure the building will not collapse .
For example , in Singapore , where the land is very small , engineers build a lot of condominiums and apartments to solve the problem of insufficient houses and manage to save some of the land for other purposes .
In the future , the population will increase much more , and by building more multi-unit housing cannot solve the problem effectively .
In my opinion , engineer should focus on upgrading the building .
They should implement the solution of building multiple level basements for multi-unit housing and building since we don't really use a lot of the underground space .
Building multiple level basements may cause some other potential problems and engineer should try to solve these .
Engineers have to analyze every possible problem that may occur like water seepage , internal condensation , underground virus and bad acoustics when building more underground level .
That is why building more underground level , we need to use Khandani principle 2005 ,that is require engineer to gather a lot of pertinent information from any sources available before implement it .
In addition , engineers can also improve the stability of the building so that more levels can be built above the building .
The stability of the building depends on the wideness of the base level , the material of the structure and the method of building the structure .
Engineer can increase the wide of the base of the structure to support extra level of building build on it .
Engineer can improve the structures by using more strong material like diamonds , gold , and etc and finding more suitable method for building a structure .
Nobody can create a perfect solution with just one try .
Engineers need to test the solution before they started to use it .
Hidden problem can be found out testing it under real condition . 
In conclusion , with Khandani's engineering design process , engineers can generate a perfect solution to solve overpopulation .
If we compare the house 10000 BC to the modern house today , engineering design process is apparent .
If in the world we don't have engineering design process , engineers may generate solution that is ineffective or it may cause harm to other life form .
There are many human needs in the world and the engineering design process can help to meet those needs in a better way .
The issue of the depletion of earth's natural resources have been raised repeatedly throughout recent times .
The earth's natural resources are not well distributed across the globe , and hence some countries face the problem of the lack of certain natural resources .
Singapore , due to its small land size area also face the problem of the lack of natural resources .
In particular , the issue of the lack of water has been the headlines for many times .
In order for Singapore to be self-reliance on water , there is a need for Singapore to create portable water resources for its people .
Singapore had tried a number of ways in its bid to shift towards self- reliance of water .
This includes desalination and damping up of rivers to form water catchment areas .
However , these methods are still short of providing for the growing need of water of its people .
In recent years , the nation's engineers have come up with a purification process which can purify waste water into portable water for use .
The product of it is called New water .
New water is treated waste water that had undergone stringent purification processes using advance dual membrane and ultraviolet technology .
The product can be bottled for consumption or be mixed with reservoir water and then going through the usual water treatment to produce drinkable water .
Currently , New water is supplying Singapore with 15% of its water demands .
There are plans to scale up the project to contribute 30% of the water supply by 2010 .
The quality of the product is even assured by many international experts .
This is indeed a product of system which is engineered to meet the human need for natural resources .
The design process of the system has undergone 5 design process stages as illustrated by Khandani in his Engineering Design process paper .
Firstly , the team of engineers working on the New water project identified the problem which is the lack of water resources for Singapore .
Singapore has been buying water from Malaysia , its neighbouring country in order to supplement its own water supply .
However , the water agreements with Malaysia are expiring soon in 2011 & 2061 .
The agreements have been providing for 40% of the country needs .
Therefore , the engineers identified the need for Singapore to shift towards self-sustainability in terms of water resources .
Secondly , they gather pertinent information on the technologies and usage of water that is purified from waste water .
However , the first masterplan was shelved because of the great cost and unreliability of the process .
The cost incurred will offset the benefit that it may bring .
Hence , the team decided to wait for further technological advancement before building its first plant .
They eventually build its first plant after the technology of dual membrane purification has matured and the production cost has come down .
Thirdly , prior to the implementation of the New water technology , there are also multiple solutions to the problem of lack of water resources in Singapore .
Solutions include desalination of sea water and damping up more rivers to increase the water catchment area .
The desalination of seawater will require large amount of fossil fuel to run which is another natural resource that Singapore do not have .
Furthermore , the desalination plants will also leave a larger carbon footprint .
Despite these , a desalination plant is still build because of the growing demand .
The damping up of rivers to form water catchment areas is in fact being implemented .
Marina barrage the newest kid on the block was formed by damping the marina channel to form a large water catchment area capable of meeting 10% of Singapore's need .
However , as Singapore has limited land , we cannot go on forever creating water catchment area from our land .
Therefore , New water is decided as a solution needed to meet the need for water of the Nation .
Finally , in May 2000 , the first New water plant is completed .
Currently there are 4 New water plant in Singapore with a fifth on its way .
Together , they will be able to meet 30% of Singapore's need .
Bottled New water were also given out during National events , promoting the use of the New water in our daily life .
In conclusion , New water has been a engineering design which was designed to meet the human need of the lack of water resources particularly in Singapore .
Throughout the history of human , there are a lot of successful products which have great effect on human life , just like television , cell phone and so on .
It is not only their high level technology that makes them so successful , but also that they meet the need of the people .
Electric car , which is first invented by General Motors Company  , is such an interesting case .
The invention of electric cars is both successful and failure .
We can analysis it in both social and technological aspects .
Electric car is the product of social reasons .
As we know , ordinary car's fuel is gas which is used since the first car has been produced .
While there exists a problem that the burning of gas gives off poisonous gas and large amount of carbon dioxide which cause serious air pollution .
Furthermore , as it is mineral resource , the storage of gas is becoming less and less which directly leads to the rise of the price .
Because of the reasons stated above , people want to invent a kind of vehicle which can use cleaner and cheaper energy instead of gas .
That is why the electric cars came into being .
Another direct reason social reason is that in the early 1990s , the California and Arizona state governments had raised a policy which said at least 10 percent of the cars produced in the automobile companies should be environmental friendly , in another word is nonpolluting .
This promoted the research of electric cars .
In the mean time , GM also wanted to use this opportunity to restore their position in automobile world .
This is the social reasons that do favor to electric car .
While , there are also some negative social sides .
Thanks to nearly a hundred years developing , the foundation of the gas industry was quite strong .
There were a lot of big gas companies tried a lot of methods to promote their products in order to push electric cars out of the market .
For example a gas company even asked for the President of America , Bush , to appear in their advertisement .
So you can imagine the difficult situation electric car's companies met at that time .
The technological aspect is also very important .
At that time , the electric car was mainly made of aluminum which gave the car lighter weight and the shape was aerodynamically styled which could reduce the air resistance .
Both of the two features provided the electric car faster speed .
As it was powered by electricity , there was less noise .
Driving such a car could be quite an enjoyable experience .
While , technology was not fully developed at that time and the battery could only support the electric car to run at most 100 miles .
Furthermore , most of the gas stations did not offer the service to charge the electric car , so it is very inconvenient for people to travel long distance .
So , the electric cars couldn't be widely used .
While recently the companies of electric cars have realized the importance of social and technological factors and they start to fight back .
In social aspect , the environment situation becomes more serious than twenty years ago .
The crude oil production rate reduces .
The price of gas goes higher and higher .
Again people become interested in electric cars and the companies also take these advantages to promote their products .
They also invited some superstars , like Tom Hanks , to help advertise the car .
In technological aspect , new kind of battery has be developed .
The travelling range has been expanded to 500 miles , nearly five times farther than before .
Many functions , like GPS and ABS , are also applied to the electric car .
The performance of electric car can be as better as normal car .
Through the case of electric cars , we can see that whether a product can be successful or not is decided by both the social and technological factors .
The change of these conditions directly influences the position of the product in the market .
So when engineer produce a new product , taking these two aspects of factors into consideration is important .
With the development of the technology , people have more comfortable and beautiful clothes to wear , more enjoyable entertainment to participate , more delicious food to eat and more convenient transportation tools to use .
However , one of the most important factors seems to be forgotten by human beings: the place we live - the earth .
Nowadays , as our Earth Mother becomes hotter , human beings' living condition is greatly threatened by the global warming , the issue which is discussed fiercely among scientists .
As an engineer , we must also take this responsibility to protect our Earth Mother .
It is commonly known that global warming is caused by frequently industrial activities these years; in detail , it is due to the emission of green house gas  .
However , this idea is not acceptable for some people; they consider the climate change as the natural phenomenon .
Actually , if we refer to the figure of "Temperature VS CO2 Emission" , we can straightaway reach a conclusion .
We can surprisingly find that the two curves match each other , in other words , it implies that the growth of temperature has some kind of tendency toward the growth of the emission of CO2 .
So , it is hard to say that there is no relationship between these two issues .
In recent years , due to much more frequent industrial activities , the curve of emission of CO2 consequently jumps to a very high point , so does the curve of temperature .
Nowadays , the rising temperature has been paid much more attention because of some sudden , striking surprise , for instance , the melting ice in Antarctica , the rising sea level .
In conclusion , the threaten of global warming has come , we engineers need to face it bravely and design products against the climate change .
We have only one Earth Mother , we will never lose her .
As the progress of our society , human beings get stuck in a dilemma of energy .
On one hand , the energy resources we use now which are mainly fossil fuels will be exhausted soon if we continue to consume as current rate while the use of fossil fuels trigger out a series of environmental problems .
On the other hand , the development of society calls for larger and larger amount of energy , which makes us in desperate need of energy .
In order to develop our society without exhausting all the fossil fuels or sacrificing our environment , we have to find new energy resources to take place of traditional fossil fuels .
In this case , solar energy stands out becoming our first choice .
Engineering design play a significant role in the use of solar energy , especially in the system of solar heating .
In the first stage , engineering design mainly contributes by clearly defining the problem and gathering pertinent information .
In fact , humans began to utilize solar energy to heat water as early as 3000 years before .
However , the efficiency of solar energy was very slow .
The question how to make a efficient and effective solar heating system is addressed by engineers .
In order to find the solution , engineers spend large amount of time to collect the relative information , from which they can generate inspiration while draw lessons from the previous work .
Though this preliminary stage appears simple , actually it not only takes a lot of time and calls for patient , but also is the crucial fundamental of the solution .
That is not the end of engineering design .
What engineers do next is to test the system and make possible improvements .
Although solar energy has certain advantages compared to other kinds of energy , it has an inevitable disadvantage .
The solar energy is limited by various natural conditions , such as day and night , seasons , and places .
It is not stable enough so that people may not be able to use solar energy to heat water whenever they need .
To improve the solar heating system , engineers add accessorial energy equipment to it such as electrical heater .
This improvement makes it possible for people to get hot water fast and conveniently even when there is not enough sunlight .
In the current world people depend more and more on technology to improve their life , which stimulus the development of science and technology in reverse .
However , among so many kinds of human needs , some of them should be given priority because of their urgency .
In my opinion , we should pay most attention on the development of clean energy such as solar energy .
The reason why we should focus on the research of solar energy is that the atmospheric pollution caused by the consumption of fossil fuels is severe , there is enough amount of solar energy to be used on earth , and the diffusion and adoption of solar energy product is satisfying .
In fact , the research of solar energy can be traced back to the year of 1900 .
Although at that time they only focused on solar power plant .
Later , because of the decrease of petroleum and natural gas , the scientists paid attention to solar energy again .
Until today , the process of solar energy research is still quite difficult .
However , because of the severe pollution problem , we have to focus on the development of solar energy .
Nowadays , there are already various kinds of solar energy product in the market .
For example , people use solar energy converter to heat up water , which will save amazing amount of energy acquired from other ways .
Besides , the usage of solar panel should become more and more important in the future .
It is said that if we can cover a place of 40 ,000 square miles with solar panel , the demand for electricity of the whole world will be satisfied .
Also , solar energy is inexhaustible and we can use it without worrying about polluting the atmosphere , which really solved the problem brought by the consumption of fossil fuels .
Moreover , since the price of solar energy panel is decreasing recently , more and more consumers will think about the usage of solar energy panel .
In the 1980s and 1990s , the research of solar energy fell into the low tide because that the price of petroleum fell down and the solar energy product was too expensive and there was no important breakthrough about the development of solar energy product .
However , since the environmental pollution has become one of the most important topics in the world nowadays , we also should pay more attention to clean energy such as solar energy .
The usage of solar energy product will not only save large amount of energy and solve the problem of energy crisis but also give us a clean world with little pollution .
With the developmemt of the society , our demand for the various commodity keeps increasing .
We want to make our lives more comfortable and convenient .
However , without enough energy to manufacture the products , how can our desire be satisfied !
Therefore , the current human need to find endless energy source is becoming more and more urgent so that it should be given priority .
To satisfy the current human need , we ha better use Roger's Engineering design process to work out a supreme solution .
This process contains five steps: define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , test and implement the solution .
As we know , most of the energy we are consuming is fossil energy such as coal and oil which is limited .
If we just depend our future on fossil energy source , how can we live on after hundreds of years !
Just a few years ago , America declared a war against Iraq with the justification that there were bio-chemistry weapons in Iraq .
Obviously , it wanted the oil in Iraq .
This war alarms us that if we do not solve the energy problems , more wars may be declared in the future .
That is really disastrous and horrible .
However , there are many other kinds of energy source on the earth such as nuclear power , water power and solar power .
Now the problem is how to use these power to substitutde the fossil energy , which means how to convert these power into the energy that can be used by us such as electrical power .
To solve this problem , building electrical powerhouse may be the best choice .
The reason is that the electrical power is clean , easily transported and easily stored .
Therefore , different places can share the energy source .
The problems brought by the unbalanced energy source distribution are solved .
Although making use of nuclear power , water power and solar power seems feasible , there are some reasons that make solar power be the most appropriate .
Nuclear power can be very clean and can generate large quantities of electrical power .
Nevertheless , it can generate so huge power that it is very unsafe .
For instance , in 1986 , a nuclear powerhouse in Soviet Union exploded , which destroyed many buildings and claimed many people's lives .
The strong radiation of the explosion even influenced all the North Hemisphere .
What a tragedy it is !
Depending our future on nuclear power , we cannot guarantee there will be no such kind of explosion any longer .
Using water power can just slightly reduce the pressure on the energy .
That is because the consuption of energy is so large nowadays that even though we make full use of water power , it is still far less than the consumption .
Undeniably , the technology of solar power convertion today is still not perfect .
Many improvements should be made to increase the convertion rate and lower the cost of the equipment so it can be pervaded .
Nevertheless , this does not affect solar power to be the most ideal energy for the future .
Compared to other energy , solar power has three big advantages .
The first is that it is very clean .
Actually , the sunlight is electramagnetic wave .
During the convertion to electrical power , there is no emission of poisonous gas or water .
The second is that soalr power is very safe .
Unlike the nuclear power or water power , we never need to worry about the explosion of the powerhouse nor the collapse of dams caused by the strong water stream .
Nowadays , we already have built some solar powerhouses but we never hear anything unfortunate happens .
Last but most importantly , solar power seems endless .
Only if the sun disappears will the soalr power be used up .
However , as we know , the life of the sun is more than billions of years .
Therefore , for the three advantages above , we can find it really meaningful to develop the solar power tachnology .
Furthermore , during the development of solar power technology , we should pay more attention to solving the difficulty of the pervasion .
This means that we will apply the technolgy to every household so that most solar power shining on the earth can be converted .
Lowering the cost of the application is also very important , otherwise nobody is willing to adopt this technology .
In conclusion , to maintain the sustainable development of our society , we should give priority to the current human need to develope more energy from various source of human society .
Among the diverse energy source , solar power has the brightest prospect for its non-pollution , safety and infinitude .
Hence , it is really worthwhile to develop solar power to make our society development sustainable .
Moreover , during the development of solar power technology , we should try to increase the efficiency of the power convertion and lower the price of the products .
From a luxurious entertaining appliance in the early stage of development , television becomes an indispensable and ubiquitous thing within every family nowadays .
With millions of viewers around the world , it is used for various purposes not only by broadcasters and institutions but also businesses .
Television had to go through a very long way of development with reciprocal influences on society .
Advertising has become the most effective way of promoting sales of products .
The use of them is the most influential factor contributing to the development of television .
The cost of a television commercial depends upon the popularity of the channel and the time when it is broadcast .
These costs are the financial backing of broadcasters' programming .
Another way is to weave advertisements into shows .
This practice has begun in film .
For instance , a character may be driving a particular type of automobile , wearing a certain kind of clothes , or eating at a particular chain restaurant .
A brand or trademark sometimes is used .
In terms of advantages , I strongly believe that the benefits television brings to our society are undeniable .
Meyrowitz , a professor of communications at the department of Communication at the University of New Hampshire in Durham , deduced that television is the "secret-exposing machine" , and it opens up the "biggest secret of all , 'the secret of secrecy'" to children .
It is even claimed that television has replaced printing to become the main way to access information .
Researchers suggest that children who were exposed to educational programs , positive models preferred reading books , were more artistic and got higher grades .
Nowadays virtually all the broadcasters have at least an educational program for their own .
That's because of the high demand of parents , institutions and educationists .
However , television also brings more negative influences on our society as many as the positive ones .
A lot of findings showed that people tend to imitate the language and behavior which are inappropriate in society .
Children addicted to televisions are associated with obesity , passiveness , heath's problems and sometimes bad grades .
Inappropriate contents are deemed as another type of dangers to the youth .
Violence , sex , drugs abusing , nonsense comics , etc .
cause a lot of controversies over the right age of watching them; and the youth are subject to parental television control , especially when it influences their self-esteem and body image .
With carefully-nurturing parents , a child can greatly benefit from television programs; whereas the child may encounter inappropriate contents if the parents let him or her freely use devices .
Adults who spend too much time on TV viewing seem to be the unsatisfied people because they try to look for happiness in those programs after a hard struggling day .
However it is usually short time happiness .
In addition to this , broadcasters often have some shows and programs addressing women in the new century .
Television played a vital role in the feminist movement .
It is in dispute whether television has been changing the norms of society .
In conclusion , television has obviously contributed a lot to determine and shape our society , owe the strong links between its development history and the human's one .
That is the reason why we always have to improve it , to nurture it .
We have to balance the pros and cons as well as the relationship of television to our present and future generations .
In the 21st century when people around the world get more opportunities to interact with each other , the ability to speak and understand other languages has become more and more important .
Most people choose to hire a translator .
However , the well-trained ones are hard to find and they are not always available at times when you need them immediately .
Moreover , some people feel that their privacy is not preserved with a translator involved .
Thus , we have initiated this product called "N-in-1 Auto- translator" which can help solve all those problems mentioned above .
In the following paragraphs , the design process of our product will be illustrated to show how we fulfill people's need to communicate with people speaking different languages .
Having talked about the modifications , we have made efforts to minimize the cost , change the charging method and improve the portability .
As a brand new product which people do not have much faith in , it has been made reasonably affordable .
As batteries are not environmental friendly , we make use of the DC chargers instead .
This is very convenient for the customers and they do not have to change batteries all the time as the lifetime of the chargeable battery is purposely made longer .
In addition , we have had the device more portable by minimizing the size and weight .
For example , our device has many components consisting of a scanner , a speaker , a printer and a recorder .
This allows our product to be multi-functional in contrast with an electric dictionary which has many limitations .
Customers do not have to bring them all .
Instead , they can just selectively plug-in any component they need in order to make it much more portable .
Form this example , we can see that we engineers always think from customers' point of view and try our best to fulfill their needs .
Moreover , we should also take care of the interests of small groups of people .
Our target customers are businessman , travelers , international school teachers and students and other people who have needs to understand other languages .
However , after reviewing all those feedbacks on our official website , we found that the blind also need it .
After numerous research , we found that they recognize things by touching , smelling and hearing .
Thus we made modifications on our device such as the Braille-mini- printer .
This mini-printer can print in Braille so that they can understand by touching the paper after they scan the documents in other languages .
We can see that just a little change can benefit a large number of people .
To sum-up all the points mentioned above , we would conclude that engineering design processes can meet people's needs by qualified products and services , continuous modifications and the attitude to think for customers .
There is an old saying goes , "Customer is the god ."
We totally agree with it .
We engineers must always keep ourselves upgraded and think for the customers all the time so that we can make upgrades and modifications to meet their needs .
While one is looking for A , he may discover B accidentally along the way , and this process is called the serendipitous discovery .
It is very different from the normal technologies we have , which are resulted from developments aiming to solve specific questions .
They are also different from each other in terms of level of success and how well they cater to solve a problem .
Nonetheless , besides so many differences , they are also similar in the aspects that they are both important and can only be discovered by prepared minds .
One obvious difference is how each technology is discovered .
The normal technology is found and developed by following certain procedures .
For example , a problem or need is always first identified , and then people start to brainstorm and think of solutions for the problem .
They always have a clear purpose or goal in mind which leads them in a certain direction to resolve the puzzle .
Nevertheless , for technologies found through serendipitous discovery , they show complete randomness .
They are absolutely unexpected .
While one is solving some physics question , he may derive a solution for a biological problem in an approach which no one has thought of before .
There is nothing like a plan or preparation for this .
Hence , the two technologies differ from each other greatly in the ways how they are discovered .
Another difference between them may be the desirability .
Most of the time , serendipitously discovered technologies gain more recognition and greater success in terms of economic or scientific aspects , compared to the average normally developed technologies .
This is just lke what Lawren Block said , the thing one found while looking for something else , usually suited his needs more .
The reason behind this is that serendipitous discoveries cater to solve the problems in more ingenious ways , as they may be the results of some unknown happenings , and they are produced by following some rules of the nature we have yet to gain an understanding of  , which are mysterious but also powerful .
A simple example would be the success of Dichloro- diphenyl-trichloroethane , compared to other insecticides .
Nonetheless , apart from the differences , there are also similarities between these two kinds of technologies .
One major similarity they share is that both can only be discovered by prepared personnel .
As what Louis Pasteur has said , in the arena of observation , opportunities favor only the prepared minds .
This is indeed very true .
When people see some new products or discoveries , especially those close to our daily lives , sometimes they cannot help but ask themselves why when they have experienced some similar things , they failed to turn them into innovations or products .
In our daily lives , it is true that we may experience this or that kind of things , but it is only those careful ones , prepared ones , those who always pay more attention to tiny things happening around them and treat things seriously , come up with ingenious discoveries .
One needs to be prepared to identify a potential serendipitous discoveries , as well as to develop a normal technology , so that he does not miss out any important details and gain success in the end .
In conclusion , these two main problems basically hamper the research and development area of engineering design process , Singapore engineers could only at the moment upgrade of modifies existing innovations .
Thus they are the reasons why local Singaporean engineers have failed to come out with a stunning innovation yet .
A serendipity found is defined as accidently and unexpectedly discovering something fortunate .
One technology that was discovered by serendipity is sound-powered telephone .
Unlike to a serendipity invention , a product or system that is created or developed , not coming from accidents , but through a series of engineering design processes is a research invention , and a technology developed via research is the mobile phone .
For these two technologies , there are several similarities and differences in the aspects of their usages , the power supplies they need , the communication efficiencies and health concerns .
Firstly , compare the usages for both the sound-powered telephone and the mobile phone , they are similar in the way that both are used for communications .
However , the ways they are being used are different .
The sound-powered telephone is now widely used in naval vessels , and also in emergency communication systems for high-rise buildings , airports and ski lifts etc , whereas a mobile phone is designed for calling contacts .
Unlike to a sound-powered telephone , extra functions are included in a mobile phone , providing games , music and camera for use .
Secondly , the sound-powered telephone differs from the mobile phone in power supplies they need .
The speaker's voice , through its microphone unit , supplies necessary power for operating the sound-powered telephone .
Batteries or power connections are not required .The circuit is always live , thus a user simply begins speaking rather than dialing another station .
On the contrary , the mobile phone could not operate without the use of an external power , normally a battery must be included and charged , so that the mobile phone can be switched on .
Lastly , for engineers , design a safe product is a big concern .
The mobile phone emits electromagnetic radiation , which may harm one's health if using it for long period of time .
However , the sound-powered telephone does not pose any health risks to human beings due to its relatively simpler circuits compared to the mobile phone .
For the past few centuries , engineers and scientists have been working together , resulting to numerous great discoveries and inventions benefiting mankind in various aspects .
However , as science and technology evolves , they had also brought up numerous problems .
In this essay , I will be focusing on the environmental issues that were brought about by the improvement of science and technology and how can engineering design processes meet the need .
From the late 19th to early 20th century , there was an outburst of great discoveries and inventions , coupled with worldwide expansion of industrialisation , creating many machines to aid human needs , and wants .
The sudden out-break of these events had caused several negative impacts on Earth .
One of the most prominent examples is global warming , a result due to the existence of greenhouse gases .
Global warming causes the increase of the average temperature of Earth , which results in major problems such as melting ice caps at both poles , rising sea levels , heat waves and depleting ozone layer .
During the golden period of invention of machineries and industrialisation , machines running primarily on fossil fuels emit large quantity of greenhouse gases during incomplete combustion of fuels .
These harmful gases have resulted in the vast pollution of the globe .
And , the situation continues to worsen .
It was only until the late 20th century when the environmentalists discover that the greenhouse gases are harmful and have resulted in adverse conditions on Earth and started countering the pollution .
Kyoto Protocol , a treaty signed among the countries to lower the emission of greenhouse gases to the environment which started in the 1990's , was quite a success .
However , even though there was a decrease in the percentage of the greenhouse gases emitted worldwide , the greenhouse gases still exist in our atmosphere , depleting our ozone layer .
Engineers , on the other hand , invented a product called the catalytic converter that helps to convert the harmful gases to gases that is less harmful to our environment before releasing them out to the environment .
This was a better cure to the problem .
Currently , as engineers , we should work on an advance model of catalytic converter , with a higher efficiency and better compatibility with different models of engines which may emit harmful gases .
Even though the process might be time-consuming and expensive , the improved version of the converter will be very useful to us .
Alternatively , we can look into the possible problems that might arise before the release of the product .
During the brainstorming stage , engineers should have looked at the product in various angles; the possibilities of doing harm to the environment while creating and testing the product , the ways to dispose off any toxic or radioactive wastes and the possibility of exploitation of product on immorality purposes .
In conclusion , engineering design processes can meet the need of solving global warming by the improvement of catalytic converter and execution of cautious planning before any other procedures .
Prevention is always better than cure .
Safety is a primary need for all inventions even to this date .
However safety has been overlooked or neglected on many occasions and brought harm to its users .
One example would be the injuries caused by can openers .
In order to overcome such injuries and keep users out of harm's way , we need a logical design process to design a can opener of high safety standards .
Once the analysing alternative solutions , the most suitable product has to be chosen .
Design process uses the decision process to select the best solution .
Firstly , the desirable attributes such as safety , function ability , marketability and ergonomics are ranked in order of importance .
Followed by this , a value factor is assigned to each attribute .
For instance , in this case , the success of safety is twice as important the success of market analysis , a value factor of 20 will be given to safety and 10 to market analysis .
Value factors are assigned on basis of 0 to 100 relative to the importance of other criteria for success .
Next , a rating factor is assigned to each new solution .
This will indicate how well the proposed product satisfies the particular criteria .
For example , if a product satisfies the criteria of safety to the maximum it will be given a rating factor of ten and if satisfies the criteria of marketing by only half it is given a rating of 5 .
Substantial knowledge of the product and its users will allow engineers to make an accurate evaluation which involves rating factors and value factors .
The value factors are multiplied to the rating factors and summed up for each product .
The proposed solution with the highest score will be chosen as the best design .
The final stage in design process is to implement the solution .
This would include prototyping , concurrent engineering , documenting and applying for patents .
These procedures would have already been done by existing products .
The new product for opening cans has these four processes before it is introduced to the market .
One such product in the current market which is safe for opening cans , handy , environmentally friendly and ergonomically stable is the one touch can opener .
It leaves the lid of opened cans without any sharp edges .
It is battery operated and uses a magnet to attach on to the lid and while cutting the edges away using an ultra fine blade .
Unfortunately , it is not very affordable and hence not marketable enough .
Future inventions would have to give more importance to the marketing aspect of it .
It can be seen that the design process is tedious , time consuming and sometimes even never ending .
No effort will go futile if executed in the right direction .
Design process suggests a safe path for engineers to take to achieve success .
The never ending need of safety to humans is an obligation for engineers of tomorrow to fulfill .
Increased confidence in consumers is seen whenever safety is beefed up for products .
In the case of can openers , making opening of cans hazard free will be able to draw a large consumer audience .
Constantly placing an emphasis on safety will serve as a reminder for all other manufacturers to meet and will in turn benefit mankind as whole .
The first stage of designing a product would to define the problem using three key points .
They are to identify and establish a need , develop a problem statement and establish criteria for success .
The first two points have already been looked into by previous manufacturers .
However , the criteria of success have to be relooked at for a safer product .
A new can opener has to be safe , light , environmentally friendly and low cost .
After defining the problem , the data relevant to the need , safety in this case , has to be gathered .
Statistics research to find out how many are affected , on which part of the user the injuries occur , when do injuries normally occur and who are the affected has to be done to get a better idea of the situation .
Besides that , material research has to be done to understand to what extend can the material harm the user and what are the alternative materials available .
For example , for the lever type can opener is made of cast iron which makes it bulky for users who end up injuring themselves in an effort to use it .
In addition , interviews on affected users can be done to understand how the injuries occur .
Manufacturers should also be interviewed to explain their reasons for overlooking the safety aspect if they had done it knowingly .
Once all the information has been compounded , the third stage of design process would be to generate multiple solutions .
Multiple solutions can be from the users as well as manufacturers .
In design process existing ideas are torn apart to find the fault in them .
For instance , in the lever type , its unprotected knife-like sickle is too dangerous for domestic use .
As for the rotating wheel , the necessity to pierce the first is a nuisance for users and the butterfly opener produces sharp edges on the lid .
There after , new ideas , tools and methods are combined to propose a new solution .
Such synthesis will seek to improve the weakness of previous solutions .
After the brainstorming and gathering ideas , the fourth and most crucial step of design process would be to analyse and select a solution .
The evaluation of proposed designs would be an overlap of the suggestion given by users and manufacturers and the information gathered .
Four main analyses are used for the designing of a safer product .
They are functional analysis , ergonomics , safety analysis and market analysis .
Being safe is the primary need of the product .
However , the functionality will determine the ultimate success of the product .
The three existing products have satisfactory function ability .
The first electric can opener was able to remove lids from more than twenty cans per minute without any risk of injury but was not put into practice because it was not handy .
Klassen Enterprises of Centreville introduced a wall-mounted electric model which was safe .
Unfortunately , this complex design was unpopular among users .
In functional analysis , the practicality of the product is put to test .
Next would be the ergonomic analysis of the product .
A safety device has to be able to fit the hands of the people utilising it to provide comfort and confidence in handling it .
Design process looks at the geometric properties of the human body to determine the dimensions of the safety product .
A good design will be able to fit ninety percent of its users .
Currently the lever type is mainly suitable for adults due to its large handle and considerably high mass .
As for the wheel type , the pliers-type handle allows a firm grip of the can edge and suits most users .
The butterfly opener is easy to grip but its metal frame makes it uncomfortable for the user .
The third analysis , safety analysis would determine which product has a leading edge over the other products .
The human need of safety is still not addressed in many can openers .
The lever type opener has a sharp edge which exposes the user to potential hazard and the other two openers leave sharp edges on the lids of cans which are threat to safety .
The new product has to de void of sharp parts as well as be able to not leave any sharp edges on the lid .
In design process , engineers have to keep records of calculations and methods used and foresee other ways people could use the product .
As a result , safety considerations must be included in the manual of the new product .
Description of inherent dangers should then be displayed on warning labels .
To make profits market analysis has to be done .
Just like the existing openers , future products have to be evaluated against criteria such as sales features , cost of manufacturing and advertising .
Failure to do this will results in unpopular products like the wall-mounted electric model mentioned earlier .
When you go shopping , do you usually see same kind of products which almost have the same functions or even same appearances ?
According to the research done by U .S . Customs and Border Protection , in 2004 the total amount of illegal copying products is 1 .39 million and 63% products come from China .
In China now , huge amount of products do not contain any innovation elements and the manufacturing companies just copy the existing patterns .
As these companies manufacture products which are copied the basic design from others , the product design process is no longer for innovations .
There must be some reasons .
Obviously copying ideas and reducing manufacturing cost should hamper the innovative design process .
Secondly , reducing manufacturing cost hampers the innovative design process as well .
In order to reduce input and gain more benefits , some companies pay very little attention to design process because that design process always cost lots of money .
Therefore , they have to simplify their products or just copy from others .
Even though there is an innovation idea , designers will not consider it .
As a result , design process just follow the privious pattern and no innovation is created during the design process stage .
In today's global competitive market , products' functionality is not the only thing customers are looking out for .
Products not only must serve its functions but must look good on the surface .
No doubt there are products with solely excellent functions out on the market .
These products are appreciated by few .
It does not take long for one to realize that products must have its own unique design in order to be relevant in the market .
Engineering Design Process , written by Professor Seyyed Khandani from Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill , California , aims to guide engineers and aspiring designers to design their product through a sequential thinking process .
Engineering Process Design brings the reader across different aspects of engineering design , such as the marketability of the product and the testing of products .
Designing itself is a creative process and in some cases , readers may find certain aspects of Engineering Design Process are not applicable at all .
In Singapore , the small elastic market and the lack of facilities and flexibility for product testing may hamper the design process .
According to Khandani  , the purpose of designing is to generate profits .
Afterall , who will want to waste their efforts on something that does not reap benefits ?
This is one of the reasons why engineering design process is not all that easy in Singapore .
With only a population of 4 million , Singapore has a relatively small market .
The remuneration is simply not enough to lure players into the market to product and design their products .
Engineers will often find themselves limited by the consumers' needs .
In addition , engineering design process in Singapore is often faced with Singaporeans' preferences for foreign goods .
Firstly , foreign goods are often established brands which appeals to the local market .
Secondly , certain goods , especially technological products are much cheaper when imported overseas .
In recent years , with the explosive number of online shops emerging and the increasing popularity of B2C  websites such as Amazon .com , it is not difficult to purchase foreign goods .
This resulted in the low demand for locally designed products and often discourages engineers to continue in their innovations .
Before the product is implemented , it is important that the product is being tested first .
Singapore , a small country has only 650 square kilometers of land area .
Much of the landscape is covered by skyscrapers and public housings .
The lacks of land area to build suitable facilities to test products are an obstruction to engineers .
Since 2004 , the National University of Singapore  , School of Engineering's Formula Society of Automotive Engineers  has been building racing cars and representing Singapore in competitions against other universities from other countries .
Associate Professor Seah Kar Heng commented that one of the difficulties faced by the team is the lack of a suitable venue to test drive the cars .
Beside the lack of facilities , engineers are constrain by the strict regulatory imposed by the Governement .
The team from FSAE could only test- drive their cars within NUS' compounds and in United States where competitions were held .
Currently , there are only laws governing the use of conventional cars on public roads .
The team from FASE will have to seek approval from different agencies which are often very time-consuming .
In conclusion , Engineering Process Design is a comprehensive guide for engineers who have no idea on how to go about designing a new product .
However , in Singapore , engineers will find that they will meet into some problems that may hamper the design process .
Due to the small market in Singapore and Singaporeans' preference for foreign goods , many may give up their innovations eventually .
For those who successfully designed their products , they are met with another problem the lack of facilities to text their products and the inflexibility of Government's regulatory .
Engineering design process is a tedious one and by analysing the problems that hamper it , one may be able to make the process a smoother one .
Our world is experiencing amazing changes every day .
It cannot be denied that some people in certain areas are still struggling around the poverty line , however , most of the citizens of the world believe that our living conditions are becoming better and better .
But behind the prosperity , we are facing some great challenges , or , in another way , some urgent problems which may affect the rise and fall of mankind .
Among those problems , the limitation of resources has raised a lot of concern from our society .
Engineers are playing an important role in finding and using renewable resources such as wind power and solar power to satisfy the increasing demand of resources .
Firstly , scientists and engineers have been focusing using wind and solar power for decades of years .
Many solutions have been tested and implemented .
The most well known examples may be the solar water heater and wind power electrical generator .
These two inventions can not only meet our daily needs , but also protect the environment and save the existing resources like coal and petroleum .
To put it more specifically , solar water heater can take place of other kinds of water heaters based one coal gas .
So besides the reasons above , it is also very cheap to use these renewable resources so users can get a lot of economical benefits from that .
Secondly , some of the technologies are still under testing .
Engineers are trying to generate multiple solutions to some problems .
And these problems are mainly caused by restriction and immature technology of wind and solar power .
For example , scientists and engineers have found that the wind speed and hours of sunshine are not steady so that the generating energy is also not very steady .
These two resources are restricted by the geographical position and climate .
Besides , the efficiency of converting wind power is very low .
So the focus of engineers is to design and test new technology .
For instance , car is one of the most important transportations in the world; however , new research has proved that the existing extra petroleum can only be used for another eighty to ninety years .
Engineers are trying to solve the problem that what we shall use after the petroleum run out .
Thus a new kind of solar-powered car has been invented .
But even engineers have reached certain success; the solar-powered car they can produce is still far from the standard of civil transports .
So engineers still have a long way to go to test and find solutions to make better use of wind and solar energy .
So to sum up , we have a bright future for renewable resources and problem of limited resources will worry people no more .
Water is an essential part of human life .
Everyone needs it for survival and also for many other applications such as industrial usage .
Even though water is readily available , however , the process of purification to make it portable is tedious , technologically intensive and most importantly , expensive .
According to statistical figures from a United Nations Organisation  publication , the global population consumes approximately 3000 kilometric of water daily .
As a result , there is an increasing need for newer , greener and more cost-effective purification methods so as to provide massive amounts of clean and affordable drinking water for all parts of the world especially in less-developed countries .
Hence , the ever-increasing need for cheap portable water should be given high priority in global research and development initiatives .
The following case study illustrates the importance of modern technology and engineering design in water purification process , especially in countries that do not have self-sustainable water supplies .
Engineering design and modern technology assists these countries by first identifying the specific problem and in the process of doing so , possible solutions will be generated .
The final stage of the design process involves the testing and implementation of a particular chosen solution .
For example in Singapore , the government identifies that she has to be more self-reliant and self-dependent on her water supplies so as to mitigate any difficulties faced in times of contingency and emergency .
In addition , being a small 'island' country surrounded by close neighbours , the idea of desalination of sea-water to meet her water demands is not a viable long-term option .
As a result , NEWater , a sewage treatment plant , was set up a few years back to look into the possibility of converting 'used' or sewage water into clean drinking water via reverse osmosis technology .
As such , large emphasis and investments have been vested into this initiative since then .
Through the application of the engineering design framework and modern technology , purifying sewage water seems to be highly viable and successful .
According to statistics from the Public Utilities Board  , NEWater will meet 30% of Singapore's current water needs by 2010 .
Hence , this example has shown that through the proper implementation of engineering design framework and application of modern technology , the current human need of securing clean and cheap drinking water can be achieved with a high degree of success .
In conclusion , engineering design process and modern technology will no doubt aid in solving and realising various human needs such as that of water purification .
However , prudent and appropriate usage of the world's natural resources still has to be practised religiously and conscientiously as engineering solutions do not guarantee complete success in any application .
As a result , both human and technology has an important role to play in the quest of satisfying human needs .
According to Rogers , E . M , writer of "Diffusion of innovations" , in general , there are six stages of innovation-development process .
They are awareness of the needs or problems , basic and applied research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and finally consequences  .
During the process , there are many factors that would affect the outcome of the development project .
Some of them are determined by the technology perspective or social factors , whereas some includes government involvement .
One important technology that Rogers mentioned is the innovation of refrigerator in 1930 for electric and gas refrigerators .
When people do a comparison on both types , latter has a better advantage on the first and they were expecting for the gas refrigerator .
But it did not captured in the consumer market .
The main reason for this is because of the investment , consideration and decision made by the corporations involved in this project .
They believed that they would make more profits from electric refrigerator and thus market it to the public .
As a result , it turns out that technology in electric refrigerator is available to the consumer in stead of the consumer choice .
Another example on social problem lead to government involvement and scientist is the safety issue with automobile in the United States .
In 1960 , the annual fatality due to vehicle reached 50 ,000 that drew the government attention of the safety issue on the transport system .
Survey conducted between the specialized researchers and public's view of the traffic safety problem .
It was found out that the research team didn't agree with the public view and claimed that it was individual-blame perspective .
As a conclusion from conductive researchers , professors , government officials and insurance company executives , the research on safety measure became due to system-blame perspective and thus redesigned auto vehicles and restructured highways .
As a consequence for above both cases , the technology did not become the way the consumers expect and the solution for solving social problem was redirected .
It did not follow the stages mentioned above for the successful completion of the process .
Most of them will be varied along the process due to several factors and thus lead to different type of innovation .
From my point of view , no matter on the sequence of innovation-development process , as long as there is a new invention , it is invented to benefit all the mankind .
If the world is not growing enough food to support its population , the process can be speeded up through the development of Food Science and Bio- Engineering .
Certain types of food such as rice and fruits can be genetically modified to grow faster and increase food yield .
Animals such as cows and chickens can also be genetically altered to grow faster and produce more milk or eggs respectively .
By designing and engineering certain genes of these plants and animals , food production can be increased to meet the increasing needs of poor countries .
There are strict regulations and quality control for genetically modified food before it can be used for human consumption .
Engineering design processes are tedious , complex and require much creativity for the generation of new ideas .
Therefore , genetically modified food created from such processes would be able to pass the strict requirements and thus able to meet the needs of reducing food shortage in Third World countries .
In spite of the increase of research and development in recent years , there is still a significant amount of discoveries and innovation are still been made by people outside of laboratories .
These kind of unconventional environments are commonly referred to as skunkwords environment .
However , we would define it more broadly to include all researches done without the aid of external aid .
Though the environments are very different , there are also many similarities between them .
In contrast , conventionally generated technology such as NEWATER progressed much slowly .
The research on NEWATER started in 1998 as a joint initiative between the Public Utilities Board  and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources  .
Its aim was to find a way to provide a sustainable means of providing water for industrial use and consumption for places where water is scarce .
This research took very long to carry out and commercialise as it has to go through a long corporate structure for approval .
Also , care were taken to ensure all the of the water treatment procedures are widely acceptable .
Although it has resulted in a sounding success , the technology has not been widely implemented due to patents of the technology being filed by the parent companies .
On the other hand , neither conventionally generated technologies nor discoveries made in skunkworks have an absolute success rate .
For example , the engineers of General Motor's  R&D unit in Detroit were able to create astatically pleasing and highly efficient automobile that runs entirely on battery power  .
However , limitations of the technology and failures of publicity resulted in a weak adoption of the new technology .
Similarly , bio fuel studies made by independently by many researchers found that it could be used to replace fossil fuels .
One of the techniques involves developing fast-growing trees that can grow to size in just 10 years to generate the bio fuel .
Similarly , lack of publicity and technological constrains prevented it from becoming a popular technology .
In conclusion , in spite of the various inherent differences of conventionally generated technologies and innovations from skunkworks , such as revolutionary or conservative , both share various similarities such as providing possible but not definite solutions to our problems .
It is by complementing each way of research's advantages that we may is able to discover ways to solve future problems .
AT&T picture phone in the late 1960s was invented and marketed as an additional function on top of voice call capabilities of a telephone .
It allowed user to 'see' each other as they talk .
This innovation was not one that had been thoroughly surveyed before the Research began , and users' feedback was that it was bulky , controls too unfriendly and picture too small  .
The society could not accept the new product of the market due to several socio-economical and governmental factors .
Firstly , the picture phone aims to allow both users on the phone to feel closer to one another , as they can now see each other over the phone .
However , it was this very concept which backfires , as users of the phone felt privacy intrusion to their way of life .
The concept was not easily accepted by the more conservative society back in 1960s and hence it failed its primary purpose .
Secondly , it was not economical to own such a phone , as data transmission was not as developed as it is today .
It was way more expensive to own and upkeep such a phone , and even with the monetary ability to own such a machine , technology at that time did not allow for a smooth transmission of data to the phone , as pictures were transmitted once every 2 seconds .
This generally played a part in the declined in product demand in the market and hence less consumers are willing to fork out the money for the phone .
Concluding the above , the world today are better equipped with the relevant infrastructure and network to facilitate the use of such a device , a 'picture phone' .
This spin off effect from such development has proved to us that social determinants have definitely been playing a huge role on moulding the development of our technology .
In modern society , what we can see and hear surrounding us is always about technology and science .
Humankind has been inventing more effective and useful equipments by applying advanced techniques .
For example , since the first airplane successfully flew in the sky , people have been master of the theory of flying which makes the dream that people can fly come true .
Then , in the following years , many better planes are produced to satisfy people's requirement .
According to Rogers , technology is defined as a design for an instrumental action that reduces uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships with achieving an advantage or useful result .
In fact , the majority of these technological innovations cannot be reliable without human creativity and research .
However , some technologies were invented serendipitously .
Generally speaking , intended research to pursue development is similar with serendipitous discovery in terms of the aim and contribution to the human society .
The main difference between the two kinds of invention is the process and the effort .
First of all , the aim of technology which was developed with research is to explore some useful things and attempt to reach the unknown scientific area in order to solve the problems in real world .
For example , people spend a great amount of money to reach Mars to explore the mysterious outer space even though the probability to help make improvement for the Earth is low .
However , this is doing research for improving human's standard of living and making life more convenient and comfortable .
Similarly , the serendipitous is the effect by which one accidentally discovers something fortunate , especially while looking for something entirely different .
Hence , the result of serendipitous also helps explore the unknown things and places .
In addition , both of technology that was discovered by research and serendipitous discovery contribute to the human society .
However , in terms of process and effort , the research to develop new technology is different from the serendipitous discovery .
Specifically , the majority of technological innovations are developed by scientific research which based on knowledge , research and application in practice .
In order to make achievement , it requires a lot of work to do thus it would take a long time .
Even so the result is still unpredictable .
On the contrast , serendipitous discovery seems very fortunate because people receive unexpected things which are always beneficial for human society .
For example , Sir Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibioticpenicillin when he was doing research on the biological materials occasionally .
Similarly , DDT was also discovered by accident in the 1930s , when a Swiss chemist , Paul Muller , was trying to find a way to protect wool clothes against moths .
Hence , serendipitous discovery is more convenient and fortunate but it is much more difficult than doing research to develop innovations .
In conclusion , people always try their best to make inventions to solve problems encounter in real world .
Keep doing research on different scientific area is one main aspect to discover what humankind desire .
However , it is true that people sometimes find new things or make inventions unexpectedly , which is considered as serendipitous discovery .
Both fulfill useful function in human society .
For instance , DDT was widely used as a mosquito killer during World War II .
Truly speaking , people may prefer to serendipitous discovery for its convenient , fortunate as well as the same award , whereas it is more difficult to achieve .
Innovations are made every single day and we keep progressing .
But the most interesting part of innovation of technologies often turns out to be the set of events/situations which leads to the innovation .
Innovations may be planned to meet a purpose or to complete an objective .
These are the conventionally planned research based innovations .
Few technologies get innovated serendipitously .
They happen through work of wisdom combined with blind luck .
Comparison and contrast of two technologies innovated in these two different ways gives us many interesting features of innovations to ponder about .
When we look at these two technologies which were innovated differently we find that research based innovations are according to the famous proverb "Necessity is the mother of invention" .
The driving force becomes the desperate need for solving a problem .
However in the case of the serendipitous innovations there is no exact driving force .
Set of experiments accidentally yield results which prove to be significant .
Who could have thought that an apple would be enough for a man to develop the concept of mechanics and gravitation ?
The technologies innovated in this fashion were never meant to be innovated .
But today without them our survival seems questionable .
It is hard to conclude which type of innovation outshines the other .Infact it makes no sense as both are special in their own ways .
But it is important for us to acknowledge these innovations , respect them and strive to do many more things to make life better ! .
Engineers have been designing products or systems to improve the everyday life .
The process that they used is called the engineering design process .
Constantly , the process has developed new technology that helped to solve problems to human like making travel to countries faster and comfortable by planes .
Engineers have been trying to solve a human problem for many years .
That problem is to make drinkable fresh water to everyone in the third world countries .
Engineering process involves defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting solution and test and implements the solution as quoted from Khandani .
Second , in the design process is to gather pertinent information on why the problem still exists as stated by Khandani .
Third world countries' government knows that there is a need to solve water shortage problem .
However , developing new and clean water technology needs large amount of money .
This money can be put to better use like getting medications for their people .
Another possible reason for the problem to be existed could be pollution from industries .
Inland water sources are being polluted by factories which dump chemical waste products into the water sources which make the water source not fit for usage .
Lastly , Engineers can do some testing on desalinating seawater into drinkable water after they have drafted out a cheap and affordable desalination process for the third world countries to purchase .
The results from the testing will be sent to WHO for approval to desalination plant to be build for producing drinkable water in the area .
If the technology is newer than the previous old desalination process , the engineers might able to get it patent so the price for this new technology will be affordable to everyone .
In conclusion , the engineering design process aids engineers in developing newer technology to help meet the needs or solve the problem of the global population .
This process is able to apply in producing clean water from seawater which helps solve water shortage problems in certain countries .
The process able to identify the problem , understand why it is still not solved , produce solutions to it and getting it work in an engineering way .
In the context of the innovation development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view , also referred to as the social construction of technology  .
The construction of technology believes that the innovation of technologies is limited and controlled by social factors .
One technology that was socially shaped was the invention of automobile cars .
Automobile vehicles played an important role in this modern world as human rely heavily on it as a main type of transport for travelling .
This technology is shaped by various groups of engineers according to social constraints .
Firstly , the raise of the automobile industry started as early as the nineteen centuries and the First World War acts as a catalyst to speed up the research and development processes of automobile vehicles .
This is so as during the war , there is a raise in demand for automobile vehicles to transport soldiers and supplies to front line .
It is also used for combat purposes .
Funding and incentives were given to companies to improve automobile technology as whichever countries with the more advance technologies have a higher chance of winning the war .
As a result , faster , more durable and improved energy efficient vehicles were developed during the war period due to the demands from the military .
Finally , all the research and developments of technology depend on economic factor .
This is so as no investor would be willing to fund a project that does not make money .
Hence , when engineers make improvements to enhance the technologies aspect of automobile vehicles , they have to consider the interest of the company .
The technical aspects of car depend heavily on production cost .
If the production cost increases , carmakers would either see a reduction in profit or potential buyers of the product would see an increase in the price .
These two scenarios are not desired and this is the reason that cars are still running on petrol rather than powered by electricity or natural gases despite the fact that they are cleaner energies .
In conclusion , the research and developments of technology depends on social constraints such as economic factors , military demands or government policies .
Hence technology is actually a product of society and is influenced by the norms and values of the social system .
The biggest priorities of companies were to ensure that projects that they are involved have great profit potential .
Toshiba is the first brand to have laptop known by many people .
But did you ever know that the invention of laptop is not support by the top executives of Toshiba at that time .
Indeed , there are always some innovations were created in a skunk works environment .
However , many other innovations are created in a conventionally generated environment .
This essay will focus on two examples of these two environments respectively and analyze the differences and similarities of these two different environments .
The first example is the engineer of Toshiba who wanted to create a laptop ) .
Although he discovered the eagerly need of smaller and portable computer in Japan .
However , at that time , Toshiba's marketing situation was not good and the company did not want to risk for a new concept of product .
Fortunately , our hero Mizoguchi did not give up .
Otherwise , our laptop may not be as good as now .
Moreover , he diverted funds and found engineers himself to fulfill his idea of creating laptop .
After two years of hard work , they finally worked out their laptop .
However , Toshiba still did not accept the laptop because they did not think it could have good market share .
The good thing is that after all his hard work , he finally proven to Toshiba that his invention very useful and sells very good .
After that , he became one of the chief of Toshiba .
On the other hand , for a conventionally generated technology , like the development of electric cars in California and Arizona , it is regulated by government  pp .
87-89) .
Company had to do research on how to manufacture it and make it be loved by consumers .
Although the whole process of making the car is very tough , the engineers were supported by company , government , and society all the way .
In conclusion , the first differences between a skunk works environment and a conventionally generated environment are the differences between financial , technology , equipment , resource and people's attitude towards them .
The second difference the source of the idea .
The similarities are those innovations all promoted the development of society and they do their best for the creation of their product and dream .
With the spirit of innovation and passion for innovation , our life will become better and better .
In Singapore , innovations in engineering design had been in the cold when compared to leading countries like Germany or Japan .
From my opinion , I can identify two problems that lead to this situation: Our education structure as well as the shallow engineering heritage that we have .
Firstly , the education structure in Singapore is too structured and does not promote the creativity of students .
Majority of our Singaporean kids will go through primary school and graduate with a PSLE certificate; follow up with a Secondary school education in either the express , normal academic or normal technical stream .
This streaming system; however , was largely based on the students' abilities to cope with the standard subjects on language , math , science and humanities instead of the interest of the students in terms of arts , science or other humanities like literature .
As a result , there was an unhealthy emphasis on the children's results in the standard subjects which they learned .
Parents wanted their children to score well in order to advance to university and have a bright future .
In their eyes , creative students who want to make it into the art streams were just rotten apples who couldn't do well in their standard subjects .
Indeed , this was very discouraging for the young minds .
As a result , creativity which is the key to innovation isn't developed since young for many Singaporeans .
Singapore's emphasis on commercial gains rather than innovations was largely influenced by the fact that we were a trading hub since British's rule .
Chinese Merchants , Indian Spice traders and Malay Rubber traders involved in the trading market were the backbone of our country's growth .
On the other hand , the Europeans had the Romans who created the wheel while the Japanese made the Katana for their Samurai .
Therefore , we cannot blame our forefathers for not being innovative when it comes to engineering .
Our innovations came in the way that they do business instead .
In conclusion , if we are able to solve the education structure problem , it will still take a few more generations of Singaporeans before we can start to see results for our engineering innovations .
We are after all , a very young nation when compared to the rest of the world .
Perhaps in future , there will be Singaporeans who can create engineering wonders to revolutionize the world .
We will then be able to catch up to countries like Germany or Japan and be labeled as a country with innovative engineering .
In the past few centuries , humankind has taken giant leaps in technology .
The creativity and need for ever improving lifestyle have led to new inventions to ease our lives .
These new inventions are discovered when there is a need or a problem; and when an invention would help solve the problem .
However not all innovations are popular , even though the product would have a technological use , it may not be socially approved .
Therefore an innovation cannot simply be put into the market and expected to be sold , even though it would have a use .
Instead , the product should be accepted socially .
Even some of the products we use everyday are socially determined , for example , the electric refrigerator .
During the 1930's two types of refrigerators were at the prototype stage , one the electric refrigerator and the other the gas refrigerator .
The gas refrigerator was superior to the electricrefrigeratorin several ways .
The gas refrigerator uses and ammonia refrigerant which is vaporized by heating with a gas flame .
Then therefrigerantdissolves in water , hence cooling the refrigerator .
On the other hand , an electric refrigerator has a compressor that condenses the liquidrefrigerant and releases the heat , which wasabsorbedby therefrigerantwhen itvaporized , into the outside surrounding . 
The gas refrigerator , though using the same principle as the electric refrigerator , has a few advantages over the electric refrigerator .
The electric refrigerator has acondenserand motor to drive it , in contrast a gas refrigerator does not contain any mobile mechanical components that could breakdown , and hence would require less maintenance .
This would mean it would be less expensive to maintain agasrefrigerator compared to an electric one .
In addition to this advantage the gas refrigerator makes lessnoisethan the electric refrigerator as well .
Typically , one would expect the gas refrigerator to capture the consumer market .
However it did not , the main reason being that powerful companies such as General Electric , General Motors , Westinghouse and Kelvinator spent huge sums of money on research and development .
These companies realized that larger profits can be made by selling electric refrigerators and they aggressively marketed the product .
Even though smaller companies tried to compete in the market with the gas refrigerator , they could not stand the might of companies such as General Electric .
Hence the use of gas refrigerators never popularized and instead today we continue to use the electric refrigerator despite it having several flaws . 
In conclusion it can be noted that this technology was determined by companies such as General electric rather than it being the consumer's choice .
Also it goes to show that for a product to be approved and accepted by society , it should be socially determined rather than technologically determined .
As we all know , engineers build this beautiful world .
They apply the complicated theories and knowledge into practice to benefit our life .
It is the engineers who have done the greatest job and made the biggest contribution to human beings .
Although my home country , China , has been developing very fast and achieved tremendous success since the implement of open and reform policy , especially in the field of engineering design processes of innovations , there are still a lot of problems or obstacles lying on the way to further success .
Among all the problems , corruption and education rank as first and second .
According to the Oxford Dictionary , corruption means that dishonest or immoral behavior of activities .
In my home country , a large number of great ideas or inventions are made almost every day , but few of them are made into practice and benefit us .
What is the reason ?
Corruption .
In some cases , when a research group comes up with a new plan or idea , he has to report to his boss to ask for fund to develop the idea .
Then the boss has to report further to a boss on a higher level , then all the way up .
Finally , the report reaches the "super boss" , but if corruption exists , the standard for the "super boss" to judge whether this idea should or should not be developed further is whether it can benefit himself , instead of the majority of people .
If the research group is lucky enough to get the fund , the money has to be passed all the way down to the group through a lot of institutions in between .
As the money is passed from one to another , it will become less and less , the other goes to the bosses' own pockets .
Finally , the research group gets the money , but no use anymore , because the remaining money is not enough or the arrival time of money is too late .
When such things happen again and again , people will have no desire to innovate because they know they will not succeed .
Just in this way , corruption hampers the execution stage of engineering design processes for Innovation , killing numerous of engineering design processes for innovation .
The other problem which hampers the engineering design processes for Innovation is the education system .
As we all know , China has the largest population in the world , so students suffer a lot in order to get into a higher education institution .
They are forced to focus on how to get high marks , but not care about the creation .
PRC students are said to be "full marks , less ability" .
They just repeat what other has done before , and have little idea what innovation is about .
Of course , repetition cannot lead us to innovation .
This is the big problem that hampers the thinking stage of engineering design processes for Innovation .
Although the government is try to improve it , so far the result is not satisfied .
In a nutshell , the two main problems what hamper the engineering design processes for Innovation in my home country are corruption , which will probably kill the innovation on the process of execution , and education , which makes the youth less creative that their peers in other countries .
These two problems are very difficult to solve in a short time , but we can improve a lot and make the engineering design processes for Innovation better and better .
Human need is something that is necessary for humans to live a healthy , convenient and comfortable life .
Are the needs that meet/fulfilled human need come from no way ?
The answer is No !
Have you ever observed your surroundings , for examples telephones , computers , fans , iPods etc .
Those are all came into being through the creative application of technology , and do not appear from nowhere .
Majority of the engineering designs are categorized as inventions-devices or systems , it doesn't exist before or are the improvements over existing devices or systems .
Those inventions or designs are processing under a term called: Design activity .
The solution to the design problem requires step-by step methodology , and normally the activity is often an iterative process .
Next I will illustrate more in details how engineering design processes can meet that need by using one of a current human need that should be given priority - Eco Car .
Collecting information is the next thing we are focusing .
We need to collect all the information that relevant to the problem .
In this stage , develop a problem statement is necessary .
A broad definition will help in the sense of allowing you to look at alternative solutions .
We should keep asking ourselves for questions , in order to discover mistakes and false and also to help in redefinition of the problem , such as: is the hydrogen is only the material we need to consider ?
What are the existing solutions to the problem ?
etc .
Searching for information resources for examples , using internet , electronic catalog or indexes will also broaden your view on your design problem .
Thirdly , generate multiple solutions .
In this stage , creativity plays an extremely important rule here because in generating new ideas that may solve the problem .
We could start with an existing solution to the problem , and from there can find out more weaknesses about our design/product and focus on improving the weaknesses .
For examples , the top speed of the Eco car can only reach 40km/h , which is consider "slow" for a normal driver .
So how can we improve from this issue ?
Thus , combine new ideas , methods , finding more weaknesses could help in producing a totally unique solution to the problem .
When come to analyze and select solution , here we need to decide which solution is the best suited for implementation to the problem .
Analyzing the best solution is essential before deciding which design solution to implement .
For examples , functional analysis .
We need to ensure the given solution will function the way it should .
Even thought it meets all the criteria but fail at one of them , it is still consider failure .
Product safety and liability , we also need to consider the Eco car that we design doesn't cause injury to humans , property damage and environmental damage from the use of your design .
Besides that , economic and market analysis , to analyze how people feel in this Eco car , are they willing to pay for a car the top speed has only 40km/h ?Lastly is the decision making and give rating to each design alternative against the stated criteria .
For examples , safety: 30 percent , efficiency: 30 percent etc .
Now we've reached the final stage - test and implement the solution .
There are several considerations have to be taken part , such as prototyping , concurrent engineering and the distinct activities that might happen during implementation like , documentation , applying for patents .
Finally testing and verification , you have to test all steps in the process work .
Because without having a proper testing at all stages in the process , you may find yourself into trouble later on .
As a conclusion , follow the engineering design process is an important guidance as it can guides your design into more details of implementing ideas , more effective way of problem solving .
Design activity is cyclic and iterative , it will continually repeating to the five step processes , until the best design has appeared .
Basically engineering design process includes of five-step process .
It is usually used in a problem-solving works for design problems .
As the example given by Khandani's article , Wright brothers are actually gone through this five-step process , to show that design problem may require backtracking and iteration .
The five steps used for the solving design problems are:
* Define the problem
* Gather pertinent information
* Generate multiple solutions
* Analyze and select a solution
* Test and implement the solution
10 students from our school , NUS also involving in the Eco car design .
On 17 Aug 2009 , they successfully launched the first Singapore-designed urban concept car with zero carbon emission .
Let's talk about how they use the five-step process to work out such an impressing job !
Firstly , definition of the problem .
Before we can develop a problem , we need to recognize the need for a new product , system , or machine .
We all know that the vehicles are running by the petroleum fuel , because of the rapidly increasing of the petroleum prices due to lacking of the material , and it is predicted will running out in few decades , this issue lead us to look for a new material to replace petroleum has become enthusiastic among the engineering fields .
Besides , establish criteria for success is important as well .
We should consider the preliminary criteria before move into next stage .
For examples , the design must be low cost; the design must be user friendly etc .
There are several issues that may affect negatively an engineering design process .
Two main problems faced by Singapore engineers are financial issues and social factors .
Singapore is a modern globalized city utilizing cutting edge technology for its growth and development .
Thus , much emphasis is placed on the designing engineers to develop innovations to further improve the well-being of our society .
Even with strong government support in nurturing designer engineers , the problems are still very much prevalent .
For large scale engineering design processes , a huge amount of resources is required .
A large amount of money is required to purchase these resources .
Financial problems may start to arise at the start of the design processes .
An aspiring innovator will usually face financial problems and find it hard to kick start their research .
Thus , he or she has to find companies or organization to finance their work in return for partial ownership rights over their research .
Without proper funding , designer engineers will find it hard to complete their innovations given the iterative nature of their work .
Furthermore , funding is required to apply for patents .
Pursing patents are not easy as they will take long period of time to process , requiring large amount of money .
The engineers have to be confident about their innovations and understand the improvements their work will have on society .
.
Even if the financial problem is resolved , the innovations have to be socially acceptable .
This applies to the design processes as well .
That is , the design processes must not goes against proper ethnics and morals , nor result in any negative third party effects .
For example , some processes of bio-engineering are involved with life human cells research and the use of living test specimens .
These may offend the general public as these actions are seen as 'playing god' , going against common religious beliefs .
Engineering processes that result in environmental issues will also face pressure from environmental groups or the government .
Another social reason would be the government factor .
In Singapore , there are several policies governing the ongoing design research processes .
Engineers are required to seek approvals before carrying out their work processes to meet safety regulations .
These may result in crucial time loss .
Time is a pressuring factor for designer engineers with date lines to meet .
Tedious 'red tape' in all the government processes would slow down the progress of research , resulting in lower working quality and efficiency .
In conclusion , the social and financial factors are main issues hampering the design processes of engineers .
The problems are even more so in the Singapore context .
However , realizing the importance of designer engineers in today's society , Singapore government has implemented measures to encourage innovative engineering .
Development funds are set up and the many guidelines for designer processes are clarified .
It helps to alleviate the situation , but the problems will still continue to persist .
Technology and inventions are not strangers in this fast developing world .
Things that people had never imagined 2 centuries ago have become a formality nowadays .
In 1876 , Alexander Graham Bell invented a telephone .
Today , we cannot live without a hand phone whereas people from 1900s did not have one for their own .
Furthermore , sharing of information has never been easier with the invention of Internet after another century , in 2000s .
All these inventions have been contributed by a lot of people of different expertises .
Most of the time , new technology and innovations are being developed based on existing technology while some individual or group may discover technology serendipitously .
There are certain similarities and differences between those two methods of discovery .
We will discuss about computer technology compared to the discovery of penicillin which is a serendipitous discovery .
For every discovery or technology to be accepted by consumers , it has to meet the demands of users .
This is the same for both technology via research or a serendipitous discovery .
An example of this is the discovery of penicillin in 1928 which was one of the earliest antibiotics available in the market .
The use of penicillin extended from killing disease-causing bacteria to saving lives in the battlefield during the World War II .
Therefore , this discovery was a success and used by people all around the world .
This fact illustrates that not only the discovery has to be success but also it has to be accepted by society .
Technology developed through researches has often been influenced by economical and profitability factors .
Most of the products created in computer technology are based on this factor .
For example , the companies have been developing different models of electronic devices every month to boost their sales .
According to Rogers , although gas refrigerators has overwhelming advantages  the extensive investment in R&D by big companies had made electric refrigerators better products .
On the other hand , a serendipitous discovery does not depend on those factors .
An individual or a group of researchers can make discoveries which may be useful to society without following the influence of companies and investors .
Other major differences between the two technologies are the availability of funds for research and the facilities used by researchers .
Technology developed through researched usually has ample funds allocated to them whereas the individual researchers will have to find the fund for their own .
Nowadays , Computer Technology has become so popular that every potential research will be funded sufficiently and thus researchers can produce more innovative ideas and products .
In conclusion , technology , whether it is discovered accidentally or purposely , is the main ingredient of new innovations and products .
We have to make the technology useful to society because they are the main users of the end-products .
In the end , a serendipitous discovery will be just as good as a technology discovered by research as long as it serves the purpose of contributing to the society and making lives better .
Energy source is the key factor that will affect the development of any country .
It is required especially for industries , agriculture , and even domestic uses .
However , due to the large consumption of energy , most countries are facing serious energy crisis .
One of the reasons may be also due to the increasing population and resulting in people consuming energy more than the amount of energy produced .
This serious shortage of energy is affecting industries as well as the daily lives of people .
According to an article written by Khalid Chandio  , he says that "Pakistan is presently facing a serious energy crisis" and "the demand exceeds supply" .
Therefore , it is crucial to find possible solutions to solve the problem before it gets fully depleted .
Many countries now are trying to increase the cost of energy to prevent people from misusing them .
According to an article by Musse Mohamud Ahmed  , he says that solar energy is world-wide recognised renewable energy sources , cost free and clean energy .
Environment impacts are also negligible .
However , one problem that may hinder this invention is the use of costly equipments and the selection of the wrong peak sunshine data .
Therefore , exact calculations for the solar power production are very important before any actual implementation of solar energy scheme to ensure proper performance and reduce cost .
Cost depends heavily on the size of solar power system .
Weather conditions are important for high performance as solar energy depends largely on the sun .
Cloudy weathers will produce lesser power as compared to sunny weathers .
Engineers need to calculate the required solar panels needed for certain hours use of energy .
Selection of solar energy components is another issue that engineers need to take into consideration when using solar energy .
To conclude , solar energy proves the best solution to solve energy crisis in term of cost and high performance , except for the cost of the solar power system .
Proper choosing of solar power system is therefore very important .
Solar energy also stands out in terms of commercial purposes due to environment impacts .
This will result in negligible pollution produced .
Hence , solar energy provides a remarkable invention to the earth .
"Education is not the answer to the question .
Education is the means to the answer to all questions" , William Allin did define the final purpose of studying , which becomes more and more essential in this 21st century .
Education is such an indispensable part of our lives that need improving to catch up with others; overall , it should be given priority and development .
Although our common education system is generally sufficient , it still contains some shortcomings that spread out all over the world .
In developing countries , education is even a far-away concept though a lot of governments' and outside donors' have been made .
As a glance: "In sub-Saharan Africa , for example , the average student-teacher ratio in primary school is 47 to 1 , compared with 17 to 1 in developed countries .
And that masks even worse conditions in the early grades , where this ratio can be as high as 100 to 1 .
As a result , too few of these new students are mastering the basic skills necessary to begin lifting themselves out of poverty"  .
The education issue also involve the cost of schooling , "Even when schooling is ostensibly 'free' studies have shown that parents incur other direct costs such as activity fees , uniforms , paper and pens  , transport , lunches , expenses for boarding and others which often result in the exclusion of poor children from school"  .
Other problems are equity and gender issue , cultural and religious attitudes , efficiency and quality .
In developed countries , the cost of study and also the efficiency of education are the main points which considerably need observing .
"Another observation in the report that we find is those with college degrees are facing the highest unemployment in two decades since records started being kept .
With college costs going through the roof and in many cases , costing nearly $50 ,000 a year at private schools many are asking whether some college degrees are even worth pursuing"  .
In short , the education shortcomings mainly focus on the equipment and management issues .
The problem seems to need help from social workers , but indeed , it also relies on engineers .
Processes to solve the above design problem include several steps .
According to Khandani , they are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution , testing and implementing the solution .
Specifically , when focusing upon the education problem , it can be inferred that the key words are "cost" and "efficiency" .
Then perhaps a multi-purpose tool is the good starting-point .
The tool should be sufficient to reduce the cost and enhance the efficiency .
For example , it could be an interactive learning device , an all-in-one electronic book , a real-time network or even a virtual intelligent teacher .
Whatever it is , the tool must be affordable by either governments or best individuals , helpful to students' studying progress and feasible for popularization .
Also and importantly , it should be a new and creative invention .
To achieve this aim , a large group of engineers are recommended to establish and work together .
People coming from different places all over the world will bring along their own view for the issue , understand what their country's need and contribute both their academic and social knowledge .
Co-operation among engineers will make an innovation in the end when the abstract idea is turned into physical equipment .
Education today should be given more priority and improvements .
That could be carried out by engineers who hold the key to solve design problems .
"Design activity occurs over a period of time and requires a step- by-step methodology" , said Khandani .

Standing in the Third World , China has taken the challenge to improve the development step by step in the past few decades .
Yet there is a long way to go , especially for those designing engineers , because creative design and integrated innovation really play vital roles in one country's development .
However , lots of realistic problems which are like obstacles hampering China from enhancing the economy in design process , lie in the way .
Specifically , two problems from social and technological aspect are emphatic .
The Examination-styled education limits the creativity of potential persons .
And furthermore , China is losing those talent people who are good at designing because of the unbalanced policy .
Firstly , Examination-styled education cuts down children's creativity .
Due to the huge population in China , Chinese education system has to select talented people by setting one universal examination which is called GaoKao for candidates all over China each year .
According to the ministry of Education of PRC , all together more than 10 million candidates will have to attend Gaokao for the entry to universities every year .
However , China has only 720 higher education institutes offering degree program  , which means that those 10 million candidates have to fiercely compete for the deficient universities in terms of their marks in exam .
Under such an stressful circumstance , students learn knowledge only for examinations .
In order to gain a best result in GaoKao , they have to do thousands of tutorial questions for practicing .
Their goals are getting more marks in each test rather than trying to learning and applying knowledge to solve problems .
Therefore , most students neglect practicing their capacity of learning , communication skills , using logical method to get information , and so forth .
Moreover , the most horrible thing is that they can not thinking creatively especially for design process .
Engineers as they will be , their job is to be skillful at applying knowledge to solving problems they meet effectively , which is irrelevant to getting full marks in examinations .
Secondly , more and more talented designing engineers leave China behind .
The policy of reformation and opening pushes China into a new global position she has never met before .
The designing engineering can get touch with foreign developed companies which may provide attractive remuneration .
Chinese government also does not take measure to keep resources of human talents .
As a result , approaching 600 thousand students has gone out overseas for further study since 1980s .
But only a quarter of them come back to serve China in economic development  .
In the same way , China lost lots of design engineers which may contribute innovative ideas about construction either on specific field like civil engineering , or on the entire development of Chinese economy .
However , only minority of the experts can make efforts on design process in China .
Thus , the acceleration of enhancement of engineering will be reduced at a large scale .
Additionally , every country nowadays is trying its best to protect human resources as well as technology and design ideas .
Less highly educated people staying in China will be a disadvantage on this protection .
Good designing ideas may be lost from China , or even not created in this country .
In conclusion , my home country China now faces two challenging troubles .
Examination-styled education kills children's creativity .
And , Chinese government does not manage well on resources of human talents .
Both problems will sharply hamper the design process of innovation of China .
Obviously , it will be an extremely heavy load on our generation and hopefully , we can handle this issue and change the situation .

Problems Hampering Engineering Design Process in China
Nowadays , technology and science in China is growing rapidly .
As the economics develops and China is more connected to the global environment , the government has placed much emphasis on science and technology to make it an integral part of the development of the country .
Engineering design is an crucial part of technology .
However , since China is a developing country , the systems and regulations are not sufficiently advanced .
Lots of problems existing in different areas hamper the engineering design processes for innovation .
Among them , the most serious two are from education system and financial investment .
In order to solve these problems , we must first know how these problems come from and the negative effects they have caused .
In this essay , I will discuss these clearly .
First and foremost , education system in China is not conducive enough to cultivate students' ability of innovation .
Especially for engineerings , hands-on , practical ability and independent thinking are the most important capabilities .
However , the education evaluation system in China is based on examination .
Using examinations to recruit the most outstanding students results in that a large proportion of engineering students are only good at rote memorization but not innovative thinking .
This caused the shortage of talents on both quantity and quality .
Based on statistics on 2004 , the number of researchers per million is 708 in China , while it is 3750 in developed countries  .
Engineering creation and innovation can not go without talents .
Moreover , to create a new product need the cooperation of many people .
If there is not enough talents , the design process can even hardly be started .
So the problems in education system is the main obstacle to the engineering design process .
In addition , funding remained a major problem of technology development because science and technology study and every steps in an engineering design process are expensive .
Compared with the world average education and technology input of 5% , the spending of China is only 3%  .
The funding for technology is far from enough .
To develop a new technology needs advanced equipment , instruments , venues and special materials .
Besides , for talents , subsidies and welfare are necessary .
The design process of every invention needs large amount of expenses .
For some of the complex scientific research projects , it need a long time to go .
When it comes to some design for specific purpose , it may not receive any economic profits in a short-term .
If the government cut off the financial support halfway , the task can't be continued and everything come to naught .
It is precisely because there is not enough money input , a lot of good ideas can not be implemented .
And because of no good treatment , many talents go abroad to carry on their study and work .
Without strong funding support , the engineering innovation can not develop well .
This has seriously affected the engineering and technology innovation in China .
In conclusion , the problems from education system and technology funding have hampered the development of engineering design process of innovation for a long time .
To be a powerful country , China should develop in a comprehensive way .
Technology and innovation is the soul of a nation's development .
So the government should reform the education system and provide more funding on technology to develop engineering design processes for innovation .
In this new era of globalization , design and innovation plays an important role in changing the world into a better place to live .
From ice age until this modern world of technology , many inventions and innovations have been made so as to suit our lifestyle .
For example , mobile phones have become smaller and lighter with the miniaturization of digital components and the development of more sophisticated batteries .
Inventors realized the risk of not taking a risk and dare to challenge an outdated product .
However , in my home country- Malaysia , there is some obstacles that hold back engineering design processes for innovation .
The first problem is the current economic model for one off development .
In our country , we are unable to achieve commercially significant levels of reuse beyond platform .
This is because the engineers design and develop most products as individuals in isolation from other products .
Eventually , all the products such as computer software are more or less have the same functions , it is just that return on investment in product development would be far higher if multiple versions or multiple products were taken into account .
Hence , organizations rarely make commercially significant investments in identifying and harvesting the reusable assets , unless it is explicitly planned in advance .
This problem causes us fail to recognize the opportunity to convert resources optimally so as to meet our objective , which is to meet desired needs of the public .
And of course , this need can sometimes be considered a necessity to some people but a luxury for others .
But the most important reason is , when engineers do not investigate a reusable product , they will eventually creating the same structural product without improving its properties .
Thus , these products do not fulfill different needs of the public .
The second matter that significantly hampers engineering design processes for innovations in my home country is the limitation of human resources for designing new products .
Human resources are an important factor for a country to come up with lots of creative innovation .
For instance , the younger generation dares to challenge themselves and think out of the box to generate new ideas .
They have the initiative and determination to turn their dreams and imaginations into reality .
Unfortunately , these expertises tend to work in other countries instead of staying back after graduation .
This is because foreign companies willing to offer them higher position and satisfying salary compare to local companies .
Consequently , there is no new blood in research and development prospects .
Lack of human resources brings great impact on our country's economic growth .
This is because outdated products will be eliminated from the market and when there is no invention of new products , sooner or later other countries will stop importing products from us and head towards those with higher technologies .
As a result , our country will fall into inflation and recession will occur .
In conclusion , engineering design process for innovations plays a crucial role in our society .
It is very important for a country to sustain its products' marketability by enhancing its design and functions .
Hence , current economic model for one off development and limitation of human resources should not be obstacles for our country's progress .
Don't multitask , multithink instead .
Think out of the box and be creative so as we can keep on path with the fast paces of life .
With the constant rise of sea level , many countries face the danger of being submerged underwater .
If this happens , we may not even have sufficient rice for survival .
More than a third of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam , where nearly half of the country's rice is grown will be submerged underwater if sea level rises by one more metre  .
Vietnam is the second largest rice exporter after Thailand and this will put the rice on our table at stake .
Global Warming has been a persistent problem that engineers should step in and help .
Engineers should adjust their designs creatively; like constructing more green buildings and including more greeneries in any future plans for redeveloping Singapore .
Firstly , engineers should design all buildings in accordance with the Building and Construction Authority  green mark scheme .
The scheme would provide advices on how a green building should be built and what additional features should be included .
All these guidelines will save electricity wastage and reduce environmental impact as well .
For example , although the air conditioning system in a library cannot be switched off at night due to the moisture content in the atmosphere , they can be set to a higher temperature or partial of the units can be switched off automatically at night .
Hence , it will help in decreasing the Chlorofluorocarbons  gases emitted which harms the ozone layer .
In short , engineers should adopt the green mark scheme for all the buildings they design in the future to reduce the environmental impacts that are harmful to the earth .
Secondly , engineers can dedicate more green areas to future plans on redeveloping Singapore .
Some of the emission of negative gases that affect the ozone layer are beyond our control , certain plans to recycle the harmful gases should be considered .
For example , trees and plants can be planted at strategic locations of Singapore as they will reduce pollution by photosynthesising and producing oxygen in return .
This is an ideal method which can be adopted especially in congested cities like Singapore .
Other than dedicating land area for greens , gardens can also be built on the balconies , outer facade and even the roof of buildings !
The multi-tier idea will definitely increase the intensity of green areas , thus reducing pollution and help to recycle cleaner air for our atmosphere .
To sum up , there should be gardens in every town and park in every estate to allow a good ratio of renewing air supply in the atmosphere .
In summary , all buildings in Singapore in the future should be built in accordance with the green mark scheme by BCA and include a certain minimum percentage of green areas for all future town plans .
All engineers should design creatively and innovatively not only for decorative reasons , but to tackle the global warming problem as well .
So do you know why Singapore's Minister Mentor , Mr Lee Kuan Yew wanted Singapore to be a garden city since she gained independence ?
Nowadays , the living standard of human has been improved due to the changes in time .
Everything has changed drastically from the past untill now .
Therefore , the requirement of people to the technology is enhanced .
For example , in the past mobile phone has been designed to the size of a brick , and now mobile phone has been designed into a small and stylish design with high technology function , such as touch screen function .
However , the engineering design process for innovation has been hampered in my home country , Malaysia .
According to the The 6th International Malaysian Studies Conference 2008 , "it is true that Malaysian SMEs do not see innovation as part of their business" .
In my home country , I feel that the 2 main problems that affect the engineering design processes for innovation hampered are the lack of government support in engineering innovative design area and social problem .
In my home country , I feel that social problem could be one of the main problems that lead the engineering design process for innovation hampered .
For the people who live in the urban area , it is quite obvious that most of the houses are designed in the same design by the developer , as the society doesn't have high expectation in unique houses design , as long as it meets their basic requirement , low price and large housing area .
Same to other engineering sector , as money remain the main concern in everybody's mind .
Many people feel that engineering design is not very important in their daily life , as it cannot help them to earn big money .
With this , the older generation feels that a functional product is more important compared to a well designed innovative product .
Old generation also do not encourage young generation step in designing area because they feel that designing cannot bring a good future for them .
Hence with this , the young generation will follow the pathway of their parents , for example , work as businessman .
Next , the other main problem is the lack of government support in this area , as the resources in the engineering design process for innovation and the expertise in this area are very limited in my home country .
People who are interested in engineering design area do not have any opportunity to explore in this area .
For example , the PETRONAS Twin Tower , the iconic building of Malaysia , government has bought the design from a Japanese architect and built it , as we can see that opportunities are given out to foreigners instead to local people .
These 2 problems may lead to some of the future local talented people give up on pursuing their interest in engineering design processes for innovation .
Some may seek for other solution such as for those who can afford big sum of education fee will go oversea for better education , and work there , as there have more exposure and opportunity to explore in designing area .
According to the Australian Education International , "There were almost 21 ,000 Malaysian student enrolments in Australia as at the end of October 2008 .
This is 1 ,000 more enrolments than the same period last year , and represents almost 7% growth" .
Whereas for those who could not afford to study in oversea for higher education , may end up in give up their ambition .
Besides that , the export rate of Malaysia's product would also be heavily affected , such as the automobile sector , as it would slowly be outclassed by other innovative products from other country .
In conclusion , innovative designing doesn't come into consideration in designing a product for most engineers in my home country and their main target is to meet their client requirement .
With this , if nothing has been done to solve it , in future the engineering sector in Malaysia would be seriously affected , compare to other more advance country .
Technology is the power to make one country strong .
Since China has developed a lot in the last decade , its economic strength has increased significantly .
However , as President Hu  says in the Seventeenth National People's Congress , China is still weak in independent innovation .
Since then , it became a big task to implementing the strategy of putting a lot of efforts in technological advancement .
China has learnt a lot from other countries , but is lack of its own inventions .
The reason why my country does not make a big progress in innovation area is because of the weakness in education system and limitation in economic support .
In this paper , I will discuss on two basic causes: education problem and economy problems , and explain the effects these two problems cause .
First , education is a big issue that government should improve to make citizens more talented and creative .
Exam-oriented education is the main education system in China .
It inherits traditional education from thousands years ago: "life depends on one examination" , which pushes a lot of pressure on students .
China is a crowded country with limited jobs .
The only way to get a good job is to enter a good university , which makes the exam becomes more and more difficult in order to find most talented students .
However , students lose their creativity and innovation since they have soaked in the exam paper for a long time .
Moreover , teachers and parents only care about the exam results instead of their talent , which will make students only good at exam .
Furthermore , the education in university is not good .
Some universities want to increase their popularity , so they approve more master degrees and PHD degrees , which decrease the level of master degree students .
In recent news , there is no difference between the employment ratios of graduate students and masters .
This will bury a lot of talented people .
Finally , many student choose to go oversea to finish their education or start their careers , which made China lost many talents .
In short , the education system in china killed talent of innovation .
Beside the education problem , the lack of money for design projects is also a big problem .
As President Hu  writes in his NPC report scientific development should depend on the situation of country development .
Overall saying , the productively level in China is not high , and the socialist market economy has established initially .
However , the gap between rich and poor tend to increase .
Government has spent lots of money on urban and rural development .
Moreover , as China become more open to the world , she faces constant intensifying international competition .
Comparing to some developed countries which have advantage in economic scientific , we will suffer more predictable and unpredictable risk .
Because of the limited money for research , many people have to do their experiments in a small place with crude equipments .
All of these make the development of engineering design stuck in a difficult situation .
In conclusion , education problems and economy problems hinder the development of design technology .
Government should advocate the education for all-round development to all the schools , and put more money into scientific development .
This will increase people's independent innovation ability , and make the country more prosperous .
Being country with a relatively small market dominated by large companies and a low spending consumer base , it is extremely difficult for new products to penetrate into the market and capture consumer attention without insufficient financing .
Thus , government financing on such new ventures is essential for its survival .
However , there has been a lack of government support to such projects mainly due to defense expenses .
Over the past three decades Sri Lanka has witnessed the longest civil war in the country .
Billions of dollars was spent every year for purchasing weaponry , rehabilitating refugees and for wages of defense personnel .
A record USD 1 .82 billion was spent in the year 2008 only on new weaponry which is a twenty percent increase from the previous year  .
Although decades long war finally came to an end last June , estimated 280 ,000 refugees have to be relocated , 30 ,000 disabled soldiers have to be looked after and a 6000 families of dead army cadres have to be compensated .
All these require financing which the government aims to gain mainly through taxation which makes it even difficult for new products to survive .
Due to insufficient funding many new engineering products and ideas face difficulties in marketing , advertising which is required to reach to the masses of the population .
Also , some new products require the expertise from other fields and even from other countries and extensive research in order to make their product marketable and competitive however absence of proper funding makes it challenging to gain such expertise .
Due to these reasons many products even fail to launch into the market .
The second reason that I feel makes it difficult for new engineering innovations to be successful is due to large number of professionally qualified Sri Lankans migrating to other countries .
Sri Lanka has the highest literacy rate in South East Asia with over 96% population being able to read or write , this is mainly due to a free education system introduced in the late 1940 s  .
All Sri Lankans enjoy a free education up to university level thus , a large proportion of the population gain high professional qualifications which are recognized all over the world .
However , there is no proper system such as the MOE grant system in Singapore to retain these individuals with in Sri Lanka resulting in most of these professionals leaving the country for better paid employment opportunities .
Reports show that over 8000 Sri Lankans have migrated to India from January 2009 to August 2009  and over 100 ,000 Sri Lankans are currently residing in Australia making them the 16th largest ethnic group in Australia  .
These numbers show the magnitude of the seriousness of this problem .
Due to this high rate of migration a vacuum of knowledge and expertise is gradually being developing with in the country which eventually has lead to a decrease in fewer innovations especially in the field of engineering .
These professionals also make up most of the high spending consumer base in Sri Lanka therefore migration of these professionals contribute to the reduction of sales of new products indirectly .
In conclusion I believe lack of financial resources especially low amounts of government spending and migrations of professionals are the two main reasons that cause lack of product innovation and idea generation in the field of engineering in Sri Lanka .
It is rather unfortunate because these problems could be rectified through careful planning and strategic management .
What is engineering process ?
Engineering process is a process to find out the solutions to improving the performance of a system .
Engineering process can be divided into many stages from the initial stage identify the need research on it until the final stage presenting the products .
Engineering design process is important processes that have to be carefully done before the product send for mass production .
However in our real life there engineering process is not hundred percent perfect , during the design process there are minor and major problems .
In Malaysia there are two major problems that significantly hamper in engineering processes and their impact .
First problem that significantly hampers engineering design processes for innovations in Malaysia is financial issues .
Due to the global economic crisis , currently Malaysia is under economic downturn .
This economic downturn led to great decline in the engineering sector field especially in engineering design process .
In the past few years , Malaysia's company was dismissed their worker in order to reduce their labour cost .
The workers they have dismissed not just only the operators , part of them are research engineers .
In addition , to lower their expenses they even temporary suspend all the research and develop process .
The employee may think research and develop is a costly investment and a lot of uncertainty process .
For example The Bakun Dam project was suspended due to lack of the fund in 2001 .
Second problem that hampers engineering design in Malaysia is lack of technology systems .
In Malaysia there are many small enterprise companies which are lack in technology systems for their manufacturing process .
Due to the lack of technology systems in their factories they do not have a good exhaust for the waste gases .
Most of the waste gases are contain a lot unhealthy chemical compounds that harm for human body and pollute the air quality .
As a result , their factories were not allowed to continue all the manufacture process .
The process involve can be either manufacturing process or an experiment process .
Furthermore due to lack of the technology system in my country a lot high technology research have to be postponed .
They need wait for few months to few years to import the new system form other country to continue the research process .
The effect of the financial problem on engineering process for innovation will result engineering process stuck at the research stage .
Due to the lack in fund , there is money to hire research engineering , research equipment and materials on experiment .
In addition , lack in fund also will affect the initial stage identify the need of the consumers there is no fund for conduct survey .
Beside the effect on financial problem , outdated technology systems used in Malaysia also will cause the research process either defer for a long period or stuck there .
In summary , financial problem and lack in technology was two major engineering design problems in Malaysia .
Engineering design will affect the development in Malaysia , thus government should to pay close attention to this issue and find out the possible solutions .
Such as they can conduct workshop to help small enterprise company on improve their technology system .
Ever wondered why some brilliant engineering creations are not as involve in our life compared to creation like the microwave oven ?
The microwave oven changed our way of living for a better , providing us with so much convenience , with just a click of a button plus a considerably short waiting time , we could stir up a dish with no mess and no hassle .
Innovation is the word for creations which have made it this far , widely adopted and used by the public .
One such life example of a failure creation yet ingenious piece of artifact would be the solar panel powered vehicle .
Without a doubt , the solar-panel powered vehicle would outweigh with exceptional advantages over the conventional gasoline powered vehicle , such as , zero emission and zero refueling , going green and saving the Earth from global warming .
The question is why this creation not popular with the public or attracting investors to further develop this product ?
There are two main causes for this lack of acceptance from the society which hampered the engineering design process for innovation: limitations and ownerships .
To begin , solar panel powered vehicle runs on the concept of converting sunlight energy into mechanical energy which propels the vehicle .
In another word , on a particular day which is cloudy or rainy , the vehicle will have no source of energy to tap on to produce output energy to run the vehicle .
To further discourage users , the location of this solar panel powered vehicle is very crucial , if the user resides in countries near the poles; they experience lesser daytime , thus minimizing the chance to utilize the vehicle .
Speed and power of solar powered vehicle is low in nature because of the way it's built to tap the energy from , compared to gasoline powered vehicle , another turn off factor .
Also , in aiming to be energy efficient , the design of the vehicle requires large area surface , which generated space limitation , being too big of a size to maneuver around on public roads .
In short , the limitations of weather , location , speed , power and space deterred the public from accepting this creation as part of their convenience list .
Next up , solar cells are what make up the solar panel and it is not surprising that this new technology is of high market value .
The initial cost of this type of vehicle is very high compared to what it can offer in return , which is also why patrons are discouraged and rather decide on the conventional gasoline vehicle .
Since the cells are of high value , and as long in Singapore's context is concern , most vehicles are parked in the open and not in a garage; the solar panels on the vehicle are very prone to thievery for personal benefits or vandalism for self satisfaction .
To add on , solar cells are of delicate piece of engineering , environmental pollutions can degrade the solar cells and the lifespan of these cells are of no better , they can be very random from few months due to loose connections or two decades if properly taken care of .
To sum it up , solar cells are of high market value due to its scarcity , incurring a high cost in every aspect , such as , repairing because mechanics with knowledge of solar cells are limited and the infrastructure for this product is not widely available commercially , thus the high cost .
To conclude , for a creation to evolve into successful innovation , the acceptance from the society is the utmost importance , only then it will create a market demand for service provider such as organizations to bring in and further market or develop the product .
Users being the society and providers being the organization , the absence of either one will not lead to an innovative engineering design .
Like an old saying goes , "It takes both hands to clap" .
Do you know that India is crowned the most corrupted countries in the world ?
In many developing countries , there will be some kind of problems or obstacles that may hamper engineering design processes for innovation .
So , what are the problems in India that prevent engineers from their design processes for innovations ?
When we look at the problems that India has which hamper engineers , there are many to list but there are few most important or dangerous obstacles like political corruption & political parties not only affect the engineers work but also the growth of the country .
The result of political corruption has bad effects .
Firstly , the development of the country is inhabited .
When good & innovating projects are proposed , the projects are not identified by the authorities or they get delayed as the authority officers do not get bribe .
Secondly , public officers approve unsuitable projects if they get bride for it .
For example , shoddy construction and substitution like mixing sand in cement while submitting expenses for cement , results in roads and highways being dangerous and sometimes simply washed away when India's heavy monsoon season .
Hence , thousands of people & kids get injured or get killed when structures collapse due to poor construction .
The second problem in India is the political parties .
There are too many political parties for different states in India .
There is no one strong voice to lead the country in the right path .
In July 2008 Washington Times reported that nearly a fourth of the 540 Indian Parliament members faced criminal charges .
At state level , things were even worse  .For example , in Utlar Pradesh Assembly election in 2002 , candidates with criminal records won the majority of seats  .
When the ruling party comes up with an innovative idea to improve the living standard of the people , the opposite party will come up with statements that will oppose their plan .
For example , water shortage is a huge problem in many parts in India .
Karnataka state does not let their river to flow into Tamil Nadu .
The political party in the both states does not have good understanding with each other .
The effects of the problem are mostly on the people .
When the political parties in Karnataka & Tamil Nadu does not come up with plans to solve the water issue , the public starts riot to solve their water demands .
When there is a riot , the normal routing life of the public are affected .
Innocent people & children get hurt in the riots and even cause death .
Engineers cannot carry on with their water projects to solve the problem because different political parties have different views & comments on the projects .
Hence , engineers are unable to continue their work .
In conclusion , the political corruption & political parties' problems in India are highly affecting the work of an engineer .
When an engineer works hard to create an innovative or creative design projects , their works are delayed or rejected due to political corruption & misunderstanding between political parties .
The dream of an engineer is destroyed as there is no one voice to lead the country .
Engineers cannot provide good services to the public when corruption is involved .
Innocent people get affected by these problems too .
Public cannot get better living standard because of political corruption & political parties as they stop the engineer's projects & ideas for better living lifestyle .
To solve these problems , India has to form a good & strong politics .
The current political parties are mostly occupied by senior citizens & uneducated members .
Young & educated members should join the politics to lend the country in the right path .
In that way , most of the engineer's hard work & innovative ideas will be fulfilled .
Engineering design is the process of an attempt to improve the current system by analysing the needs of users , researching , finding solutions and presenting the final product  .
However , the engineering design processes for innovation might be hampered because of different problems that are faced during different phases of the process .
Some of these problems are great enough to result in a failure as a whole .
We shall discuss two of the problems and their subsequent impact on engineering design in the next few paragraphs .
Disapproval of ideas due to fiscal reasons is one of the problems .
The primary objective of having a business is to earn profit .
Therefore , if a given idea is not believed to produce substantial earnings , the management of the profit driven companies would tend not to approve it as the funds could be channelled to some other more profitable ideas .
Hence , the development of the idea will be stuck at the research stage as resources such as manpower , raw materials and financial support are not allocated .
If the engineer is passionate enough , he might be able to implement the idea using his own time and expenses .
However , this would also mean that the duration of the implementation will be increased relative to one with sufficient support from the management .
One such example would be how Tetsuya Mizoguchi , a brilliant engineer in the 1980s , managed to see through his idea of compacting a desktop sized personal computer into in the form of a laptop which was highly condemned by his management  .
Even with the support from the management , the amount of funding allocated is limited by its assigned budget .
There are certain constrains given the limited budget .
In addition , the company will also expect the engineer to show some tangible results for them to continue funding the project .
However cost , time and speed are related .
Therefore to be able to show some achievement , the speed of research would need to increase thereby increasing the total cost incurred .
With the significantly increased cost , less people would support the idea of continuing the research .
Hence , we are now trapped in a catch-22 situation where faster results would mean more cost and more cost would mean less support .
The engineering design process would then be stranded at the research stage if the support garnered is insufficient to justify its funding .
In conclusion , the problems that pose the largest threat to the engineering design process would be the disapproval of ideas due to fiscal reasons and also the need for quick results for proper funding to take place .
The latter is a more challenging problem as it not as straight forward to solve as the former .
According to Mr . Il Houng Lee , representative of International Monetary Fund  organization in Viet Nam  "To reach Singapore pace of growth , Viet Nam will need 158 years more" .
That affirmation had caused a tumult in public opinion and forced each Vietnamese people to question "Why was our country growing in such a slow pace like that while possessing plentiful resources and abundant young labour ?"
From my point of view , the main and deep causes are the outdated system of education and the insufficiency in governmental management , which not only affect Viet Nam growth in general but in fact , to be more specifically , hamper its key , the engineering design processes for innovations .
Firstly , the problem of the system of education is always existing as an obstacle for many aspects , especially in Engineering where creativity and innovation should be privileged , where the personal and original opinion should be highly respected , that is why we have to analyze to its core .
In Viet Nam , the traditional ways of teaching and learning which are still currently applied in every establishments are too passive: teachers read out loud or write on the board and students copy , all information must be memorized exactly the same in the manuals , the syllabus for teachers must be 100% respected , etc , . . . thus there are no creative ideas , no new thing to teach , no spontaneous students and no active classes where personal opinions could be freely express .
Therefore , real engineers hardly glow from that kind of environment .
So how can this outdated system still survive until this moment ?
Whose fault is it ?
Many scholars when analyzing and criticizing the weakness and lag of the current system of education often compare or justify by saying: "In the past , our time were this .were that .
but now  . . . " however they forget that comparison has already become outdated" .Now we know , the whole system has been outdated from the past to the present , because of that mind set , no one seems to like the idea of changing , no innovations could slip in that traditional-so-called system of education .
Moreover , the quality of material for the studying environment is also degrading , which in fact is another factor that hampers the overall development of innovation in design engineering process of Viet Nam .
Among the latest series of newspaper with many comments about the system of education in Vietnam , including the Chronicle of Higher Education of USA who commented that the slow progress of the system of universities in Viet Nam is no different than the one from 20-30 years ago .
This specialized in education newspaper said: "Economists indicate that Vietnam does not even have one university which is considered having the international quality ."
.The quality of infra-structure and education serving tools are that low , same goes for the quality of teaching , but the main point here is the ones who have the right to change and improve that entire thing hardly taking a concern .
As a result , the bad effects seems to outweigh all: the source of workers flows to foreign countries where they can find an ideal environment for studies and works , most never come back to mother country; it is too easy to hold 2 or 3 degrees/diplomas/certificates but in fact the holders have no professional knowledge and experiences; not only lack of professional workers but the their quality has also gone down .
That is the reason why the outdated system of education in Viet Nam plays an "essential" role in destroying potential and talented engineers .
If we only change the educational system , it is not sufficient enough to solve the growth retardation in technical design and innovations of Viet Nam .
Indeed , the slow development in engineering design process of Viet Nam is also seriously affected by the weak management of government .
Although Viet Nam is rich in natural resources but its government does not have suitable methods to impulse the development of business and economy .
For instance , the strategy of Viet Nam to attract the investment from foreign and local companies is not really effective .
According to a statistics of World Bank  organization on "Doing business in 2010" , Viet Nam has dropped down two levels due to the complicated procedure of export and import duties , in which it costs too much time to complete the whole formalities  .
Besides , the statistics shows no reduction in the number of times a company in Viet Nam has to pay taxes , which can reach up to 32 times per year  .
The complication in the official procedure causes the hesitance of investors , and it subsequently affects the development of design process and innovations of engineers , who need investment to execute their projects .
In addition , the weak in governmental management is also reflected in the brain-drain problem of Viet Nam .
This problem has happened for a long time due to the lack of investment of Government in young-manpower .
From a website discussion on the quality of education in Singapore , Vietnamese students studying in NUS insisted "Innovation and creativity of young human resources has made Singapore become a very strong country in both commerce and technology; Singapore always consider attracting the talent manpower as top priority , while government of Viet Nam does not focus on encouraging creativity and intelligence to speed up the development of whole country"  .
Therefore , developing innovation and creativity in young manpower is also the main factor which affects the design process of engineering .
From all the analyses above , we could see through the direct causes which influence the engineering design processes and innovations are the weakness in the administration of education system and governmental structure .
As a Vietnamese student who is studying abroad and receiving the advanced education of Singapore , I myself realize that for Viet Nam to be able to catch up the World's developing pace , we must find a wise way to reform and improve considerately also uniformly in every domain .
The privileged goal is to renovate the system of education and government; because these are the essential elements which can help Viet Nam achieving certain breakthroughs in science-technology , from that found a powerful and prosperous country .
There is a common catch phrase in the Singapore educational system - think out of the box .
Essentially the concept of 'thinking out of the box' revolves around the idea of innovativeness .
Some people find it difficult to do so and interestingly enough , they even took courses to learn to be creative .
Little did these people know that they are already embedded with this ability ever since they were born .
Indeed , we unknowingly use our innovativeness to fill ourselves with excuses for doing or not doing something .
In engineering context , engineers use their creativity to create new products and according to Khandani  , "What distinguishes engineers from painters , poets , or sculptors is that engineers apply their creative energies to producing products or systems that meet human needs .
This creative act is called design ."
Nevertheless it is often easier said than done , as there are always factors hampering creativity .
Once such obstacles are overcome , it becomes easier for one to innovate .
The first problem that a prospective innovator will face is actually his ability to accept failure positively .
This is because the process of creating a new product often requires the innovator to continuously modifying it .
It also implies that an engineering design often requires many failed attempts before a breakthrough is obtained .
In the process of doing so , the innovator may at times , needs to challenge the conventional way of doing things in order to obtain a new approach in solving a problem .
As such , some risks need to be taken .
Unfortunately in Singapore , many of us do not have this mindset in the first place .
Probably due to the fact that we are overly result orientated that we do not like the idea of risk taking .
Risk taking is often seen as undesirable as it does not guarantee a result that we expect it to be .
A successful inventor will at some point of time , take some calculated risk to make their idea a reality and if every risk is minimized , it may not be possible to do so .
For instance , the Wright Brothers risk their reputation to fly the world's first aircraft .
If they were to think like a Singaporean , it would be unlikely that we have airbus flying in our skies .
The result of being so negative about risk taking is that many plausible ideas may not have taken flight .
As such , the chances of getting another Singaporean innovator like Sim Wong Hoo , is low .
This does not borne well especially when our economy is heading towards being knowledge based .
Hence if we were to change our attitude towards innovation and risk taking , perhaps , we might see a new technology conglomerate originating from Singapore someday .
Another obstacle that potential innovators will face is the process of identifying underlying problems they might face even before embarking on their project .
Many people often focus their attention on the product itself but failed to look at other issues like cost management , marketing , product's aesthtic and safety requirements .
These problems are related to each other and neglecting them will lead to the possible failure of the product as a whole .
For example , although the raincoat is more effective than umbrella in protecting people from rain , many adults still refuse to use raincoat due to its poor aesthtic .
This further illustrates that in order for a product to be successful , innovators need to pay attention to other factors as well .
In Singapore , many of the people tend to frown at problems and justify their actions in the form in complaints .
In doing so , they are not being objective in resolving the problem instead; they are trying to give themselves a false sense of disillusion that the problem is caused by others .
While there may be some truth in it , it just goes to show that Singaporeans place their priority in shifting the blame to others before identifying theirs .
This does not meant well for any new Singaporean innovator seeking to engineer a new product design .
By shifting the blame on external factors , the underlying problems will never be resolved .
Therefore , in order to be prepared in all aspect , innovators need to be alert to all possible problems he might face .
In conclusion , it is clear that there are many factors that will hamper engineering design process for innovation .
More often than not , many people succumbed to these obstacles and never had the chance to realize their ideas .
Ultimately it boils down to the amount of planning that an innovator does .
The more work he does in anticipating problems , the less he will encounter .
After all , people who fail to plan , plan to fail .
Undoubtedly , China has emerged as the world's technological and industrial giant since the last two decades .
Engineering professionals and scientists have definitely contributed significantly to the country's advancement .
Even though the country recognises the importance of such progress , there are still some problems that significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
Firstly , the rigid education system in China is one of the main obstacles which hinder engineering innovations .
Education is one of the crucial factors which determine a country's might .
The education system in every country plays a key role in moulding the future of the country .
The rigid education system in most parts of China , however , places more emphasis on books and academic results , rather than promoting creativity in the classrooms .
There are millions of students in the country and it is therefore very competitive to stand out among all .
Perhaps , the only best way to distinguish one is through a series of examinations .
Due to such reason , there is simply no room for creativity and innovation in the class .
Students or rather the young generations grow up with the mindset that achieving excellent results is much more important than being innovative .
As a result , without promoting and inculcating the significance of being creative , engineering design processes are hampered at the beginning stage .
In addition , raising enough funds for engineering design purposes has always been a problem .
Even if the passionate engineers get together and plan to launch a project , it is very difficult to get sponsorship .
Most of the time , the designing processes may require sophisticated equipments and materials which may not be easily available within the country .
Sometimes , the engineers have to import the necessary resources overseas .
If the project would be carried out over a few years , the funds would be running low very fast .
Therefore , the engineering design processes may most likely end half way due to the lack of funding .
Moreover , there is also lack of role models for young engineers in China .
The country has just started her technological and industrial progress in the recent decades .
Unlike the US and the European countries , China does not have a long historical record of her own engineering precedence .
For example , China has become the one of the largest semiconductor industry in the world .
However , those semiconductors are still not as good as those in Silicon Valley .
A group of computer engineers created the powerful search engine Baidu which is another modification of Google .
Thus , there is a lack of the originality of the idea during the designing processes .
Finally , the country has vast land size with the world's largest population size .
This means that it is rather difficult to have a centralised authority to control and regulate private engineering design sectors .
As a result , intellectual property has become a sensitive issue in China .
In fact , China even has a poor reputation for protecting intellectual property .
This has in turn discouraged engineers , both local and international , to conduct any research or experiment in the country .
Moreover , the issue of intellectual property even dismay many foreign investors to provide sponsorship for engineering design in China .
Therefore , the external factors may also undermine the engineering design processes .
All in all , although there has been significant progress within China as a whole , there are in fact many problems that hamper engineering design processes .
If some of these obstacles can be solved or overcome , the country would benefit even more significantly due to the contributions from the engineering design sector .
Many people usually consider Singapore as a hub for Engineering and Innovation .
We have a strong economy , a stable social system , as well as a relatively uncorrupted government .
Moreover , Singapore's ongoing push for a "Knowledge Based Economy"  to "sustain growth and help keep Singapore competitive1"  allows us to be the forerunners in today's demand for design and engineering .
Even so , we still cannot assume that Singapore is the ideal place for Engineering and Innovation .
We know that no country is perfect , and no country can fully adhere to the Engineering Design Processes that Khandani has postulated in his article "Engineering Design Processes" .
Khandani states that the five major processes are: "Defining the problem" , "Gathering information" , "Generate multiple solutions" , "Analyze and select a solution" , and finally "Test and implement solution2"  .
Although Singapore has the means to encompass these above processes to produce innovative design , certain problems arise to hamper our design processes .
Two of the biggest problems lie in our lack of experience , as well as our cultural mindsets .
These two problems are interlinked , and they hamper the above five Engineering Design Process in many ways .
The first problem , as I take to believe , would be our lack of experience and development in engineering and innovation .
Although Singapore is a developed nation with a developed education system and economy , our development is very recent in comparison to Europe and the United States .
Thirty years ago , our industry was still predominantly based on manufacturing .
The engineering sector only took off in the 1990s , along with the initial conceptualization for the KBE .
Therefore , although our students in colleges , polytechnics and universities are equipped with critical thinking skills for design invention and innovation , we do not have any experience and still remain as 'Engineers on paper' .
True knowledge is epistemic and empirical in nature; and according to Khandani , expertise in the Engineering Design Process requires an iterative critical inquiry on practical problems and solutions  .
Indeed , Singapore recognizes this problem , and is currently focusing on further development in the Research and Development sector .
Also , our leaders encourage creativity and entrepreneurship in our people .
Yet , this ideal will not be realized for the time being .
And in the meantime , our lack of experience and development in engineering and innovation continues to pose a problem for aspiring engineers , as well as design processes for innovations .
Why is the ideal for practical development not going to be realized in the near future ?
A very plausible reason would be due to the Social mindset of Singaporeans , and it is also this very factor that hampers the Engineering Design Process for Innovations .
As Singapore is an Asian country , many Singaporeans tend to adopt Asian values and mindsets- which advocate adhering to social norms and not go against convention or 'the textbook' .
Also , the value of family before self results in many Singaporeans not wanting to risk themselves for a breakthrough in personal achievement .
Fuelled by the recent economic crises , many Singaporeans prefer to 'play it safe'- to stick to stable , routine and high paying jobs; than to get creative , take risks and be curious of the unknown .
It is from this reason we have the aphorism: 'stick to the iron-rice-bowl' .
While such mindsets ensure a relatively stable life for us and our families , it promotes contentment and impedes self-improvement .
We know that the Engineering Design Process requires the continuous process of construction and tearing down of existing schemas .
To do so requires great flexibility of mind , as well as a certain zest for personal breakthrough and risk taking .
It is in this respect our mindsets greatly impede on the philosophy of Engineering , and hence pose a problem on the designing process for innovations .
Now , we know that the Engineering Design Process in essence produces the ideal methods of inquiry and processing into any engineering design .
But with our lack of empirical knowledge , added on to our fixed cultural mindsets , such processes cannot be holistically considered .
For a start , our mindset fixation adversely hampers our ability to "Define the problem"- the first step of the engineering process .
Our unwillingness to seek for problems in life leads to an inability to recognise a potential improvement when it comes .
Also , the second process of "Generate Multiple Solutions" is affected .
The value of 'going by the book' may render us so accustomed to stick to the fail-safe solution we learn from textbooks we do not want to write books anymore .
This problem can be seen from the way our students consider education .
To the Singaporean student , education is primarily aimed for the passing of examinations and to acquire a job , rather than to join ranks of our leading Engineers in development and innovation .
If we were to persist with such static frames of mind , then we can never breakthrough our existing achievements; be it through innovation and Engineering via the Engineering Design Process , or even by any other way .
Moreover , our lack of establishment in engineering research and development may pose further problems to the Engineering Design Process .
Professor Seah has given a classical analogy of this issue when he narrates his personal endeavours to design the NUS car .
According to him , one of the greatest problems the NUS team encountered during the design process was the inability to seek advice from experienced people on how to build a car; due to the absence of an existing car industry in Singapore .
"Testing and implementation" would hence be based on trial and error , and the pool of knowledge we base our future innovations upon is greatly limited to foreign talent and textbooks .
We would be unable to "Gather Information" effectively , as well as select the right solution to our problems if we were to encounter any .
We have seen how the problems of our lack of experience and expertise , coupled with our static mindsets , can affect multiple stages of the Engineering Design Process for Innovations , and ultimately innovation itself .
Unless we strive to break our existing conservative mindsets- to be inquisitive in mind and daring in heart as our government calls for; then can we bring to life the true knowledge of engineering .
We would then be able to impart the full knowledge of engineering to our future generations: the experience , mindset and example of true engineering philosophy .
In Singapore , there are various problems that may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
These problems comprise of , insufficient funds , insufficient resources , design may not be aesthetically pleasing to be selected and copyright infringement .
Of these four identified problems , I would highlight two of them and the effects that they had on certain stages of the process .
Insufficient funds and resources are two problems that may significantly hinder engineering design processes for innovations .
The completion of the process might be slowed down due to financial constraint and the parties involved in the engineering design process might have to seek financial help .
For example , in the case of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort , the engineering processes were affected due to financial constraint .
According to Channelnewsasia , it was reported that the shares for Las Vega Sands Corporation have lost an astonishing of more than 90% in a year , and it was US$8 .8 billion in debt .
As a result , many feared that Las Vega Sands Corporation might go bankrupt .
Therefore , the opening of the Marina Sands Integrated Resort had to be delayed .
The above example was an illustration of lack of sufficient funds to keep the innovation design going .
Lacking in funds can lead to the disruption of the progress of an engineering design process .
The engineering design process will be disturbed when there is not enough money to buy relevant resources required .
Insufficient funds may not allow the engineering design process to proceed .
For example , the innovation design of the race car from National University of Singapore may not have been so successful without sufficient financial support from the school .
Therefore , shortage of funds and financial help may hinder to the progress of the engineering process , as in the case of , the Marina Sands Integrated Resort and also prevent an engineering process to begin , as in the race car example .
Another problem that might hamper engineering design processes for innovations would be insufficient resources .
Insufficient resources would mean , not having enough raw materials or materials needed for the engineering innovation design process .
Resources need not be mainly on materials , but also manpower or labour .
For example , in the case of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort , there was a shortage of materials such as sand and steel .
There was sand ban on sand exports and contractors could not get sand that was needed from the fabrication of concrete .
Secondly , there was a lack of manpower and the construction process was slowed down as a result .
These two main factors , lacking in manpower and materials had hindered to the progress of the engineering design process .
In conclusion , as illustrated in the case of the marina sands integrated resort and the engineering innovation design of the race car , we can see that lacking in funds and resources are two obstacles that engineers had to consider .
The impacts that each problems had , can affect gravely on the progress of the engineering innovative design and they should be well- planned .
During innovation development process , there are two groups of people; they are technological determinism and social determinism .
Which one should we accept ?
The development of telephone tells us that socially determined rather than society being technologically determined .
Firstly , the most obvious change we can see is the size of the mobile phone .
Since the first generation phone which was invented in 1973 until now , the weight of the phone from 1kg was greatly reduced to the lightest mobile phone of merely 40g .
This tremendous change is due to the population demand; the mini sized phone is so much more convenient compared to the 1kg phone .
It is so light and small that we sometimes , even forget that we are actually carrying one .
Following that the world is becoming more and more of an intensive developing cyber-epoch and global village is also seeing a faster pace of life .
The people claim that modern life is facing enormous time-constraint .
A lot of people even work 24-7 .
So the internet surfing on the mobile phone was invented .
You can surf internet anytime and anywhere as long as connection is available .
So now you can even work even on the way home !
A new innovation is the GPS on the mobile phone .
This function served many purpose , example , family members can now know whereabouts of their disability family members when they are lost .
For user who likes to go hiking , they can even navigate their direction in the wild .
And of course , during an emergency , paramedic personnel and rescue people can locate their victim more easily and accurately , thus saving precious time .
Lastly , the whole world is facing the proliferation of aging population in this contemporary world , so caring for old people is many developed countries' top social priority .
This leads to the invention of the big button cell phone .
The big button phone designed with big numbers and bright text is most welcome by many of our elderly friends .
It is quite similar to the normal desktop phone , but big button telephones that are special designed for the elderly population make sure it is simple to use and safe .
The design is also carefully thought of so as not to confuse or annoy the users , like leaving out any unnecessary features .
There is even a button for emergency call , users can simply press that special button when anything happen .
In conclusion , the idea of having a small size phone and internet came from the social people , and the GPS function and big button telephone is the idea which are proposed by the government .
The telephone is definitely both a big business and a successful technology story which and the society definitely played a big part in it .
Technology cannot change society , only the society can choose how the technology develops in a feasible way .
Engineering design process may be defined as the process where engineers apply their creative thinking to produce products or systems that meet human needs .
In the process of engineering design for innovation , there is no doubt that a lot of problems and difficulties will be faced .
Although there are problems and obstacles , the development in engineering design for innovations is crucial and essential .
My home country , Malaysia , also try to develop it but several problems are met .
Among these problems , the two major problems are financial problem and technical problem .
First and foremost , money plays an important part in the development of engineering design process .
Malaysia is still a developing country from every aspect and the finance of Malaysia is not robust enough to make a significant leap in the development of engineering design .
From the last few decades till now , many countries include Malaysia have been facing financial crisis and economic storm .
As a result , The Federal Government of Malaysia tends to emphasizes more on economic progression and development but only little attention is given to the development of engineering design .
Without adequate amount of capital , development of engineering design becomes very difficult and inefficient .
Advanced technologies used in foreign country cannot be introduced into Malaysia because of insufficient capital .
Maintaining and repairing the high-technology machines and devices require high costs , too .
Furthermore , talented people are hard to be attracted as there is no good working environment and no sufficient capital for those skilled people to carry out their researches .
Moreover , it costs a lot to build modern working environment and high-tech facilities .
The next problem is technical problem .
Malaysia has not reached the high-technology level to design an engineering product and there is no working environment culture for engineering design .
There are too few technicians or people who are specialized in engineering design .
Education system in Malaysia show too little concern for the engineering design academia .
People lack of knowledge and information in engineering design , thus they are not able to deal with current and future practical problems .
Also , technologies in Malaysia still need improvement , as most of the technologies are introduced from foreign countries .
The facilities for experiment and researches have not met the basic level of performing .
The lack of technical skills has brought much effect on the development of engineering design in Malaysia .
On one hand , the facilities and devices used are not excellent enough to perform good experiments , resulting in inaccurate results with more errors .
On the other hand , Malaysia lack of skillful labor and this has resulted in an inefficient production of creative innovations .
Both low accuracy experiment results and inefficient production cannot be solved easily .
These technical problems have caused slow progression of development of engineering design .
To sum up , financial problems and technical problems have significantly hampered the development of engineering design process .
Although there are still obstacles and problems exist upon the road of development of engineering design , I do believe that my home country , Malaysia , can overcome them as time passes .
With the world's population increasing , it is expected that there will be a growing demand for food .
Hence , one current human need that should be given priority is to have sufficient food for the world population because we all do not wish to be in the Malthusian trap of over-population .
According to Khandani  , engineering design processes can meet this need through the systematic application of the five main steps: defining the problem , gathering relevant information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing a solution and lastly , testing and implementing the solution .
The first step of defining the problem by identifying and establishing the need , ensures that we have chosen a 'real' need and not a 'perceived' need to work on .
Indeed , having sufficient food is a 'real' need because we have seen how Thomas Malthus's ghost stalks many of the poverty-stricken areas such as Ethiopia , Somalia and Niger where starvation due to famine has led to the loss of many lives .
More importantly , this step reminds us that we are addressing the 'real' need of having sufficient food for basic sustenance which deserves more attention and not the 'perceived' need of having food for relaxation , personal fulfillment or interest .
Next step of defining the problem involves developing a problem statement which allows us to specifically address and successfully meet the need to have sufficient food .
In this case , it would be to increase food production by designing a crop that is able to withstand adverse environmental conditions so that more land can be used to grow crops and a crop that can be harvested all year round so that the amount of food produced is not limited by seasons .
The crop designed must be low cost so that even farmers living in poverty can also afford to buy the seeds of the crop .
Moreover , the crop should not rely heavily on the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in order to grow well as this will have detrimental effects on the environment .
The next step of engineering design process-gathering relevant information enables us to be aware of the types of crops currently being manufactured and used , from which we can assess their effectiveness and improve on the current crops used .
Information regarding current research efforts on crops development can also provide us with an invaluable insight .
We can also utilize our creativity to generate alternatives to meet the need to have sufficient food such as devising new irrigation methods or new ways to make barren land fertile again .
Furthermore , analysis of the design also makes sure that the design can really work and people are willing to use the design .
For example , we can test the feasibility of the design by first implementing it in a small field and see whether the crop designed actually matures faster .
We can also carry out market surveys or make industrial visits to obtain people's responses and opinions on the design which we can take into considerations when improving on the design .
All these will help us to make an informed decision whether to implement the design on a larger scale .
In conclusion , through engineering design process , we ensure that only 'real' need is being addressed , relevant information is gathered to serve as a basis to generate multiple solutions and the design is analyzed thoroughly before it is implemented to meet the need of have sufficient food .
What determines a technology to be good or bad ?
Well , technologies are there to supposedly improve our way of life .
We assume technologies are constantly changing for the better .
However , this may not always be true .
A technology that looks seemingly practical and useful to our everyday lives may not function well in the society .
In other words , technology is a product of the society .
It may be technically sound but may not be well received by the end users .
We have to understand that technologies not only have to be shaped around technical factors but also around social and economical ones .
One important technology that was shaped as such was the electric refrigerator .
Electric refrigerators have been competing with gas refrigerators that are technologically better and have overwhelming advantages .
These gas refrigerators are quieter and have no moving parts and thus tend to last longer than electric refrigerators .
So why do electric refrigerators still manage to spot better sales in the market ?
Firstly , the constant adoption of electric refrigerators was greatly influenced by economic factors .
According to an article on diffusion of innovations by Rogers E .M . , large companies like General Electric and General Motors had an economic advantage over smaller companies that produce gas refrigerators .
For example , Kelvinator , a large electric refrigerator production company had a budget that was 33 times more than the Common Sense Company , which was a smaller gas refrigerator production company .
As a result , these larger companies can afford to pour huge amounts of funding into electric refrigerators as they had earlier decided that larger profits could be made from them .
Moreover , with economic advantage , these larger companies can afford to spend a huge sum of money to intensively promote their electric refrigerators to gain better advertising .
Smaller companies were unable to match these giants and thus remain stagnant .
With lack of advertising , their products were poorly accepted in the market .
Besides companies being influenced by potential profitability and having gained access to better funding , social factors also played a part .
Better advertising by larger companies has led consumers to believe that electric refrigerators are still the product of choice .
This is an example of how larger companies socially shaped the product .
In addition , consumers also have an issue with gas refrigerators .
Most gas refrigerators use ammonia as coolants .
These coolants are not use by electric refrigerators .
Consumers did not like the idea of storing their food products in gas refrigerators as they thought the harmful coolant might contaminate their food .
As a result , gas refrigerators were not favourable among consumers and that led to an increase in sales of electric refrigerators instead .
The battle between these two types of refrigerators is still happening today with electric refrigerators having a competitive edge over the other .
In conclusion , companies and even individuals have economically and socially shaped electric refrigerators , making them a preferred product over technologically better gas refrigerators .
In this new era of globalization , we must not deny the importance of implementation of design into engineering problem solving processes .
These two are strongly related and without designing mind , engineers definitely could not solve a problem based on engineering knowledge .
In fact , engineers are taught to consider engineering design during their tertiary education .
Nowadays , people are having a misconception that design is just simply the planning that lays the physical shape and pattern of every object or system .
But the truth is that engineering design is the decision-mailing process , in which the basic sciences , mathematics , and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective .
For instance , in designing a car , internal combustion engine are specifically configured to work optimally and therefore the design of components such as cooling system and piston engine valves should be taken into consideration .
However , in our very own country , Malaysia , some problems have arisen in which significantly hamper the engineering design processes for innovation and these have resulted in severe impact on certain stages of the process .
The most common factor which contributes to the failing of the process is the insufficient fund provided to complete the whole process and by means , the process includes definition of problems , narrowing of research , finding of several alternative solutions , determination of the most possible solution and lastly the making of decision .
If no fund is provided , such process could not be completed .
This could be explained because in order to determine the most possible solution in engineering design process , we have to conduct many experiments and these experiments require materials in which money must be injected into the project .
For example , over in Malaysia , we have our own national car corporation , which is known as Proton .
However the selling of their cars simply could not bypass the sales of other imported cars such Honda and Mitshibitsu .
This is simply due to the fact that it is not efficient and well designed enough to compete among all car retailers , which is the cruel truth that recognised by every Malaysians .
Based on the fact it reflects the insufficient investment by Proton's shareholder in Malaysia compared to total equity owned by big corporation .
With the money big corporation possesses , they are able to conduct Research and Development of their own product and at last launch out the product which is efficient and generates greater revenue compared to other smaller competitors .
Another root problem that hampers engineering design process is the lack of education to engineers about engineering design knowledge during their tertiary education .
Universities play an undoubtedly significant role to educate future engineers to execute engineering design process in future while at work .
Unfortunately in Malaysia , design-centric knowledge is not given much emphasis .
Knowledge taught during lecture is not enough to develop student to think creatively and determine alternative solutions from problems arisen .
Furthermore there is none or simply only a few research laboratories are set up in campus to encourage undergraduates to determine problems generated themselves during experiment .
Therefore exposure to definition of problems is not greater enough to let students to find other possible problems by themselves .
In conclusion , engineering design process is important to meet complex challenges in the world such as global warming and all types of pollution .
Fund must be injected to project in order to execute the process .
Lastly , education system must be reviewed in order to solve such challenges and bring us a new generation of engineers who are able to devise innovations guided by the perspectives of a true designer .
China has been developing very fast these years .
Along with the expansion of industry and the growth of national economic strength .
Chinese entrepreneurs have gradually abandoned the mass-but-cheap production mode .
On the other hand , they swicth their attention to production mode which involves much technological innovation .
However , there are still numerous factors which hamper the innovation of engineering design in my country .
For example , the lack of fund and talents .
But , I would like to unveil two essential factors , which are the managerial problem of state-run entrepreneurs and the lack of intellectual property protection .
Regarding to the first problem , it is of high importance that we investigate the background of leaders in state-run entrepreneurs .
The leaders are directly appointed by central government .
Interestingly , the criteria is not about how well marketing experience or managerial ability the person has .
It is about whether the person is loyal to the government .
Thus , many importance positions in an entrepreneur belong to government officers , which as a result , makes the entrepreneur like government .
The bureaucratic style in a company will create rigidity during the process of management and production .
In this way , innovation of engineering design will be affected .
In addition to the problem of leadership in state-run entrepreneurs , the problem created by the monopolistic status of state-run entrepreneurs also can not be neglected .
As far as I am concerned , monopolism is prevailed among state-run companies .
Many of them fully control a certain type of resource .
In this way , they are not subject to fierce competition in a markect .
As a result , many state-run companies do not have incentive mechanism or the mechanism of selection through competition .
The consequence is that a large number of the employees treats theirs jobs as "iron rice bowl" , which means a job is secure .
There is no worry for being kicked out due to laziness .
In this way , the whole company corrupts and becomes obsolete .
In conclusion , the factors that hamper the innovation of engineering design come from both inside and ouside of the entrepreneurs in China .
From the inside , we need to change the criteria of leadership appointment and raise the awareness of protecting intellectual properties .
Similarly , from the outside , China has to create a competitive environment and a legal system which helps innovation of engineering design prosper .
The development of technologies may be viewed differently .
Traditional analysis of technology has been looking at the past to analyze the present .
The social science system approach challenges the way we look at technology .
It suggests that acceptance of a new technology depends not only on the technical factors but also on the economic , political and social ones .
We have to understand the system as a whole and not looking only at one aspect of the system to try to understand it .
In the past , the solar energy is not readily accepted because of its technical challenges such as , weight of the integrated chip , expensive research , lack of technology know how , shortage of device as some devices need to imported .
However , it is safer , cleaner and considered more environments friendly .
With the increasing of oil prices , there are many technologies have been created to solve the climbing of black gold .
There is a need to look for alternative resources .
The discoveries and the development of solar technology have become an agenda in most country .
Governments have been encouraging and giving away incentive to company to develop the alternative energy efficient products like solar technology .
However , when the oil prices drop , government and company slowly stop to pursue the alternative as they can continue their business with cheaper oil .
With cheaper oil , companies reduce research fund on innovation and development .
Economic challenges have moved the shift from solar technology to the cost of building it .
Company has been trying to get the market share by pricing their solar cell at extremely low price .
In order to survive , another company cut their price for the same technology product .
In the cut throat competition , less revenue is generated and less fund is put to the research .
These will slow the development of solar technology and the innovation of it .
In addition , some company has created solar technology advancement on military weapon and working greatly with the governments .
These technologies are for military demand and don't bring any improvement to life .
Instead , it is used to destroy human and bring misery to certain people .
Technology is the product of negotiation and compromise .
Social and political decisions play a part in determining the technology .
Most of the technology failure is not because of technical problems , but because it is not accepted by the consumers .
In the context of technology , most innovations and inventions are shaped without aiming at addressing a specific or general social issue .
However , there are exceptions .
One of the best known socially shaped inventions is Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio , which was initially designed for communicating information about AIDS to people in Africa .
Apart from the major social issue , there were several other factors including economical problem and technical problem , which also contributed to the final prototype of the mass production on the assembly line .
The wind-up radio was intended to halt the spread of the mortal epidemic AIDS by education and information sent by broadcasts .
AIDS is the most horrible disease that spreads across the continent of Africa , affecting millions of people , most of who are undereducated and still struggling below poverty line .
After a series of surveys and researches , abstinence , fidelity , promotion of condom use and risk perception were identified as the most significant issues concerning the prevention of AIDS .
One step further , BBC , later with other African local radio companies , launched many HIV and AIDS public service announcements in English , French and other African native languages to educate people about AIDS .
At that point , Trevor Baylis came up with the idea of wind-up radio , making idea of broadcasting education possible .
Putting aside the original social objective and economical constraints , designing the wind-up radio also required to solve several practical technical problems .
First , the charging up process should be stable enough to avoid damage to the components of the radio .
Second , the output current must be very stable and enduring for avoiding distortion of the signals .
Last but not least , the charging-up process should be efficient .
Unless the charging-up process can be done within seconds , the annoying process of charging up would finally hinder users from frequent use .
In Singapore , there are actually many issues to consider for an engineer in the engineering design processes for innovations .
The two issues I feel are the most important are in terms of economic and technical challenges .
Economic challenges will affect the process of engineering design because we need to consider the financial status for the majority of the people .
The products being made must not be too expensive .
As a result , people will tend to think twice before they decide to purchase the products .
The economy downturn also prevents consumers from buying things that they think are not essential .
Manufacturing industry suffers the most from this recession .
Due to the financial constraint , consumers will go towards buying pirated products instead of purchasing the original .
This causes a decrease in demand for it .
They do not mind the products for not being able to perform as good as the original .
To them , it is worth it since it is cheaper .
Even if consumers do not go for pirated products , they will still go for second hand products .
This is because the products are still usable despite some minor wear and tear .
The budget given by the company may cause engineers to think of ways to cut down costs in the production so as to gain extra profits for the company .
As a result , the products may not last long enough and have to change it quite regularly .
Technical challenges will need to consider the demands of the consumers .
It must be useful to the majority of the consumers .
We must also cater the needs to the different age group .
It must also provide comfort and convenience to the people .
For example , hand phones , computers , mp3 and cameras have make communication between people in a distant more easily simply just by a click or a press in the button .
Information and data can be transmitted easily by the use of internet .
This was definitely not possible in the past .
Engineers also need to consider whether the consumers will be able to accept the products being designed .
We also need to consider the commercialization of the products .
This is because the way of commercializing will affect the sales of it .
As a result , engineers will be forced to come up the modification of the products in a short period of time .
This will cause the products to be less effective because there is a lack of testing .
Although the gadgets have included more functions , it is less durable .
For example , hand phones nowadays are prone to defect when it is accidentally drop on the floor .
In conclusion , Engineers need to understand the issues that are not related to engineering profession directly but will affect them in the production process .
That is why engineers need to think beyond their job scope .
"{Great innovators and original thinkers and artists attract the wrath of mediocrities as lightning} ."
Nowadays , the ability of engineering designing not only determines one's own future but also a nation's power , wealth , and influence .
However , in my home country , China , engineering design process for innovations are always stifled by political , social , and economic reasons .
Firstly , in China , the designing and innovating process are always hampered by some political factors .
And these factors always result in some management problems .
In China , nearly all the research institutes and universities are state-owned and controlled by the ruling communist party .
Therefore , academic institutions are difficult to escape from acting like a government department .
For instance , the head of research groups and the presidents of universities are all assigned by their superiors in the party .
So when selection processing , the academic achievement of candidate is not the priority to be considered but their loyalty to the party .
Therefore , in some institutes , the head tends to know nothing or have little knowledge upon the field which he is in charge of , which will certainly misguide the research directions and disturb the atmosphere of researching and studying .
Further , the rules of regulating institutes are mandated in a dogmatic and quantized way .
All the boffins are required to attain some academic objections per year .
For example , they need to apply and get a project of how much money per year , or how many essays they should publish in public scientific journals , and so on .
If they cannot meet the requirements , they will not get promoted or get enough salary they are supposed to get .
However , in such a short term , there seems to be impossible to discover significant results .
Hence , many researcher have to 'make up' essays on their own sake , or simply plagiarize other's works .
In addition , in most of institutes , the funds of science are given by seniority .
As for some young but creative engineers or scientists , it may be very hard for them to get financial support to carry on their own researches , which will stifle their creativity and make them have no place to fulfill their potentials .
Secondly , some social reasons also exert detrimental influence upon the designing and innovating process in China .
To start with , it seems to have become a consensus that China does little on the protection of intellectual properties and patents .
What is worse , in china , nearly all the people have formed a habit of buying pirated discs and illegal downloading from the Internet .
From a research by BSA , about 93% software used in china are prated , which costs 3 .6billion dollars loss every year .
And according to Microsoft , about 29% of computers in China are illegally installed with windows system in 2008; especially 5% are computers for government use .
Moreover , the protection is also inadequacy in terms of patent .
According to the statistical figures , about 30 percent of patents are illegally used without authorized .
But it is very hard for the victim to prosecute the infringers .
According to China's law , it will take about 3 years to finish the lawsuit; and it will consume more time and money to execute the verdict after they win the case , especially for most of trespassers , who are usually in small business or manufacture their illegal stuffs in a family workshop , it is even harder to trace and penalize them .
Lastly , the designing and the process of innovation are sometimes detrimentally affected by economic mode in China .
On sake of the High GDP index , the government sometimes only cares about how many investments they can attract from overseas and other places; And Most of enterprises in china only focus on manufacturing , processing , and exporting goods .
What they need do is just transferring the raw materials to finished goods .
So it is no need for them to invest a multitude of money to establish research and development groups to design or invent new technologies and sciences .
At the same time , they also assert that designs and innovations are not their business but things cared by some leading firms in US or other countries instead of China whose enterprise not only lack of funds but also core technology .
And now most of the enterprises are quite satisfied with this economic increasing mode and think that it is no necessary to change the industrial structures .
So when some original designs and innovations come out in China , it is more likely for them to be ignored and discarded .
So in this way , the impulsion for designing and processing innovations has been greatly encumbered .
To conclude , there are many problems which obstruct the process of engineering design and innovating in my home country , China .
And China still has a long way to improve its regime and the value of whole society towards designing and innovating .
However , I am still optimistic about the engineering design processes for innovations in China and I believe it will be made better when the globalization becomes more prevalent and China becomes more open .
The innovation of laptop from desktop pushed Toshiba , a small company unknown to most , to the focus of IT world and helped it make a lot of money; British , being driven by the inventions of steam engine and railway , became the most powerful country in the world .
Engineering design progresses are so important that they determine the rise and decline of companies and even nations .
As the biggest developing country , China has shown the world its power as well as shortcomings .
Among the shortcomings , the lack of engineering design progresses for innovation is serious and the two significant obstacles are the bad environment for reach and the brain drain problem .
The environment for research is bad in China is because at first , there is not enough capital given to do researches .
According to China Research Environment Report , Science Observation  , the average funds for national researchers are less than 100 ,000 RMB  a year , to say nothing of other researchers .
Without enough capital , how can researchers buy the necessary equipments and do the necessary experiments to make science and engineering progresses !
Another fact is that the talent in China waste a lot of time doing things that irrelevant to research .
One significant phenomenon is that the doctors , masters and graduate students in university call their tutors 'boss' , which is because instead of teaching them new knowledge or doing researches , tutors often ask students do tasks from companies to make money .
Furthermore , many administration jobs in universities and science institutes are done by scientists and engineers who are not good in administration in deed .
Because of the good treatment of administration jobs , a lot of talented scientists and engineers waste time competing to get them , leaving the research jobs behind .
To move the distractions , it needs to apply certain regulars to retain the talent in their positions and also , improve the treatment of research jobs .
According to an essay in Sina .com  , China has sent 1060 ,000 students to study overseas but only 275 ,000 of them have come back and contribute to their motherland .
The rate of brain drain is near 70% .
It is astonishing .
As known to all , students who manage to get the chances of studying overseas are usually the top students .
They are the ones who can make great contribution to engineering design progresses and other kinds of innovations .
Losing these top students means losing engines that can promote the country to a new height .
To solve the problem , again we should create a good environment for study , research , work and living to attract the talent overseas to come back .
The road for China to become strong in innovations of engineering design is still very long .
We Chinese should work hard together to make China strong and we would grad to see that one day , the logo of 'make in China' can change to 'create in China' .
I believe the current human need that should be given priority is the need to reduce traffic congestion as it has always been a problem left unresolved for many decades .
With the help of engineering design process , many of such problems that we face in this present world can be minimized and resolved .
Engineering design process flows through these stages of defining the problem , gathering information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and finally testing and implementing of solution .
Firstly , on defining the problem of traffic congestion and also gathering vital information on this human need .
The problem of traffic congestion is constantly happening throughout the world everyday and it is affecting the way we carry out our daily routines .
This problem leads to the lost of precious time that could be put to good use and it also affects the progression of work and major projects .
With this lost of precious time , we often have to make use of extra time to make up for the time lost in traffic congestion .
Thus it will also create an impact in the financial losses and holding back economic growth throughout the world .
Secondly is the generating of multiple relating solutions , analyzing and selecting of a suitable solution .
One of the solutions that I came up with is to have a signboard attached to all traffic lights; this will indicate to all the drivers whether they should avoid travelling on certain roads that may have traffic congestion .
Although there are radio stations to report on traffic congestion , however some drivers may not tune into radio stations or may not know of other alternative ways to redirect their paths .
This results in accumulating the length of traffic congestions as the numbers of cars keeps piling up after it occurs .
This solution of indication can prove to be very useful , when an accident or traffic congestion occur .
The sign board will have the three arrows mainly representing , left , straight and right directions .
For example in an event of traffic congestion , the central transport system will be notified in the shortest possible time .
Signboards that are in area of traffic congestion and other possible affected areas would be updated and give suggestion to the drivers to redirect them away from the traffic congestion .
This central transport system would also provide an update for the traffic police; so that they may go down to rectify the situation .
Lastly is the testing and implementing of solution .
With this idea of solution , I would build a 3D replica of this system to test on the effectiveness of the reducing traffic congestion .
I would continue to improve on the design with more stringent tests and experiments which will give me the most suitable configuration for a specific area on the island .
In conclusion , I see the need to improve on the transportation system around the world .
Using engineering design process , we could design a specific solution to allow the transportation system to have a faster and smoother flow of traffic .
As we advanced into dramatic change of technology , the world has made a breakthrough in science and achieved a milestone of success .
It is veracity that engineers are those who are playing crucial role in the society while the world is expanding unremittingly .
This is because engineers are quintessential in designing products that meet human needs .
They utilize their knowledge to come out with new innovations which will give a fresh impetus to enhance the development .
In my opinion , current human need that should be given priority is having electric vehicles that operated entirely on battery power .
As we all know , petrol is non renewable natural resources and hence changes of its price has a big influence to the world economic as all main transportations are using it as fuel .
Therefore , it is necessary to design vehicles that move by low cost electricity .
Electric vehicles can receive their power from a number of renewable sources that then transmitted into the vehicle through the use of electrical cable and stored in battery .
Through this , the dependence on the crude oil can be minimized gradually .
In addition , air pollution is deteriorating nowadays .
By using environmental friendly electric vehicles , the pollution problem can be alleviated by decreasing the smog level .
Furthermore , electric vehicles typically have less{noise pollution} .
According to Seyyed Khandani , Ph .D . , there are 5 steps for solving design problems so that the process meets the need .
Firstly , engineers must recognize the need and define the designing problems such as how far the driving range of a fully charged electric vehicle is and etcetera by gathering enough information , running experiments and perform computation .
After that , engineers should start gathering pertinent information to reveal fact facts about the problem .
This step is quintessential as it make sure that their efforts and time of are not wasted at the wrong place .
Then , engineer will use creativity to generate ideas that solve the problem by starting with existing solutions then try figure out and improve the weakness in those solutions .
Later on , engineers will combine their new ideas and tools into the existing solutions and finally unique solutions will be formed .
At this stage , engineers might have multiple solutions .
Hence , they have to analyzing their solutions and select the solution which is best suited for implementation .
The last step is test and implements the solution that involves testing , construction and manufacturing of the solution to the design problem .
If the car passes all the tests , a new electric car is finally formed and will definitely meet the need .
Besides , engineers need to consider about the electric car's safety , cost and effects to the environment so that this engineering design meet the need .
For instance , since electric car design's cost is over budget , engineer might rather design combination electric-gasoline vehicles to cut down the cost .
In addition , safety of the car should be given priority in order the design process meet that need .
Thus , engineers have to confirm that the car is safe to be driven by running few tests before the cars are supplied in the market place .
Engineers also have to run experiment on the emission from electric car so to make sure the car is environmental friendly .
To drive home the point , the engineering design processes will definitely meet that need if engineers preserve stoically whenever they meet failures during the process .
Engineers have a constant need to upgrade current technologies to keep up with the ever-evolving world .
Being a problem solver had only meant that they will constantly face a slew of problems that abound in the world .
Changes in the climate in recent times show that the Earth is embroiled in what is called global warming .
The need for more sophisticated technologies to reverse this damage caused to our environment has set engineers racing against the clock .
The war on terror never ceases as well .
The need for state-of-the-art weaponry and stealth vehicles has posed a tough problem to engineers as well .
However one human need that is most prevalent and disconcerting is widespread hunger .
The need for engineers to come up with food technologies that may fill the bellies of hungry children is overwhelming .
Indeed , we have to solve this pressing problem before it becomes too late .
Another way to increase food production is to engineer grains and seeds so they produce more within a shorter timeframe .
They are genetically modified with desirable qualities to meet the needs and conditions of the place they are grown .
Crops are more robust and can withstand harsher conditions like strong winds , while carrying more grains atop their stem .
By genetically engineering many of our foods , we can actually increase food yield from the same plot of land in a shorter amount of time .
However , Khandani mentions that the solution isn't perfect and we should keep revising and "going back to the drawing board" .
Our solutions are not one off .
We need to constantly modify them even as they bring about more problems .
In short , man will always find ways to solve our daily problems through engineering .
When people around the world are dying from hunger , engineers can be called to present possible solutions and find the best and most efficient way to deal with them .
Global warming is an exceptionally severe problem facing the world today .
It is a process whereby the Earth's temperature increases which are attributable to the use of fossil fuels , and industrial or agricultural processes .
Man-made emissions release great amount of carbon dioxide which causes a large buildup of "greenhouse gases" .
One factor which contributes to the buildup is from power plants or factories .
Another major factor will be the carbon dioxide emitted from cars .
Though it may only contribute a small percentage to the buildup in the gases , but as time goes by , the increase in the utility of cars will become a big threat to global warming .
Thus a group of students from NUS came out with an idea of creating an eco-friendly urban concept car with zero carbon emission .
This group consists of students from the School of Design and Environment and also the school of Engineering .
This car was built from scratch with its body designed and manufactured by the students themselves .
It runs on a hydrogen fuel cell that drives the electric wheel hub motor .
In this way , it will achieve twice the energy efficiency compared to the burning of gasoline in the internal-combustion engines .
In addition , with the design of the eco-car , mechanics will have easier access to the components for trouble-shooting .
With such attractive advantages installed in the eco-car , it might slowly be introduced to the society as a form of transport so as to solve the problem of global warming .
Because the eco-car runs on hydrogen gas , this will lead to the reduction in the usage of petroleum and thus saving the natural resources for better usage .
However , there will also be disadvantages with regards to the creation of the eco-car .
Though the eco-car may seem to be the perfect solution to solve the problem of gasoline combustion cars , it will cause conflicts with many car manufacturers such as Toyota or Nissan .
With this invention , the governments will strongly recommend civilians to replace their current vehicle to the eco-car .
As a result , there will be a negative impact on the sales for the current car manufacturers .
When all of these happen , it will also affect the economy and also the jobs of the sales personnel .
Another disadvantage of the eco-car will be the resources that it uses .
Take gasoline combustion cars as an example , when it is running low of fuels , the driver can easily top up his vehicle at any petrol stations nearby .
But as for the eco-car , the resources it uses may not be readily available , so it will not be very convenient .
Although the eco-car may be a great invention to remedy the problem of global warming , we should not solely depend on it .
Instead we should put more focus on the other factors which have greater impact on global warming
Most of the products today are created using a conventionally generated technology but there are a few products were invented in a skunkworks environment .
For example , the first laptop computer was produced in a skunkworks environment because Toshiba , a Japanese electronics company , have taken huge losses with its failure in the desktop computers' market in the 1980s .
So , the company refused to invest in the research and development of the laptop computer  .
Even though conventionally generated technology is more popular nowadays , both ways of production have its own advantages and disadvantages .
Both ways of production are similar in its motive .
The intention of the teams is to research and develop their product hoping to come out with new invention or make the existing products better .
For example , a research and development team with financial support from the company research on the company's product and try to improve the existing products and create new products for the company .
It is almost the same for the team working in skunkworks environment .
They believed that the products they are working on will be a success even though they are not supported by company .
However , there are differences between the two of them .
Firstly , they differ in financial aspect which is the main aspect .
Productions using conventionally generated technology have full financial support from the company .
With the financial support from company , the research and development team can have comfortable and productive workspace .
On the other hand , there are no or very few financial support for the team working in skunkworks environment .
Therefore , skunkworks environment usually are not comfortable to work in .
Besides mentioned above , the team using conventionally generated technology can afford state of the art devices which will increase the efficiency of research .
In contrast , the team working in skunkworks environment not only do not have those devices , but they have to bring their own equipment to work .
The second difference between productions using a conventionally generated technology with those from skunkworks environment is the creativity of the team members .
The main problem of the team in skunkworks environment is the financial problem as mentioned earlier .
The lack of money causes them to consider other options when inventing a product .
For example , they might look for used items to be use as inputs for its production .
In contrary , the team with full financial support do not really need to consider the cost of research therefore they most probably could not come up with products which are more cost efficient .
Finally , after comparing both the ways of production , we will realize that both also have their pros and cons but in my perspective , production in the skunkworks environment is better mainly because of the freedom in inventing new things .
Without the supervision and control from the sponsor company , team members are able to explore new ideas that might not be parallel to the company's main objective .
That is why there is a significant number of people are willing to work in the skunkworks environment despite the problems they faced .
This is because these people believed that their inventions will benefit mankind .
Helen Keller made her miraculous breakthrough as she spelled W-A-T-E-R when water ran over her hand .
The importance of water lies where it comprises 70% of a person .
Without food , one can still live for a few days .
However , without water , life will be shortened to one day .
No doubt water is the basis of life in this planet .
In the Maslow's Hierarchy of needs , water , together with breathing , food , sex , sleep , homeostasis and excretion are the ground basic of human needs .
Therefore it should be given priority as a current human need .
However , in real life , a problem may not be solved as expected by implementing a standardized model .
For example , for an idea of water conservation to be developed further , scientists need the financial support from government/corporations .
Self-funded projects are usually carried out in skunkworks environment where researchers have to bear the consequence of failure .
Further more , the whole process in the model which Khandani has proposed may take many years to be completed , making self-funded projects less viable if there is still no support along the way .
Another kink in the process is the selection of solutions .
Corporate bodies tend to look for solutions with maximum profitable returns .
Government entities also need to justify themselves if they opt for more expensive solutions which may/may not generate returns .
For example , comparing to the water transfer project from another location with more abundant water supply , distillation of sea water will be a more expensive solution though it has the potential of solving the problem in the long run .
In conclusion , water is the urgent need for human .
To solve water scarcity with the engineering design processes is viable , but limited in its actual application .
Many things that surrounds us today makes our lives a lot easier .
From kitchen appliances like refrigerator to home entertainment systems , these are things which we often take them for granted .
They also did not appear at our homes overnight like Christmas presents .
All the many inventions at our homes are developed by engineers which took a long time to develop .
It started from identifying the needs of people , followed by coming up with various solutions and then implementing it .
This is called Design Process in which engineers use to approach problems .
According to Khandani , there are five basic steps used in a design process .
This five basic steps can also be applied to problem solving .
The first step is to identify the problem , which usually involves the process of knowing what the customer wants and what problems are they encountering with existing products .
Secondly we need to gather more information , like previous failed attempts of solving similar problems , whether a need for a new solution is needed or not and the problem with existing solutions .
Thirdly coming up with many solutions , fourth after analyzing all the solutions , one is chosen .
Lastly testing and implementation is done on the solution .
All the steps are important as safety , reliability and economic factors are included and may have a huge impact on many peoples' lives .
Currently , there are many engineers in our society today .
They solve solutions to needs of people , for example an army general wanting a better and a faster tank for his army .
But more priority should be given to things like health care .
In the past , people who wants to see a doctor have to wait in long ques .
More often than not , those people who are waiting in the line were in urgent need for medical attention .
Time is often wasted in the administrative part of the process .
Nurses in a clinic have to flip through archives for a patient's information manually .
Therefore a more efficient way of allowing people to see doctors are needed .
Engineering process can be applied to meet the needs of people and solve the problem .
After the problem is being identified , more information needs to be gathered .
Khandani said that inexperience designers will skip this step and proceed to finding solutions , but efforts spent in gathering information will pay out later in the design process .
Engineers found out that in clinics , human errors of the nurse is present , resulting in longer ques .
So solutions like computerizing all administrative work and the processing of patient's medication is being implemented .
In this way , human error is eliminated and people can see the doctor and get their medication in a faster way .
There are many problems than can be solved systemically using the five design process that Khandani mentioned .
Health care is only one of the many pressing needs for engineers to solve .
Many useful feed back is needed in order for more problems to be identified .
In the 21st century , with the development of the world's economy , people's living standard keeps advancing .
However , because of overeating high protein food , being lack of exercise and many other relevant reasons , various kinds of disease is threatening us human beings , especially the heart disease .
Till now , heart attack has become the top one killer among all the disease which threatens the human's health .
According to a research conducted at 2000 , the number of people dying from heart attack accounts for almost one-third of the total number of deaths around the world , and even worse the percentage is expected to be greatly enhanced by 2020 .
As a result , WHO says heart attack as the 21st century's plague and calls for more attention on the heart disease .
Fortunately , the appearance of a kind of engineering design product helps huge amount of patients who suffer a lot from heart attack .
That is heart pacemaker .
What is a heart pacemaker ?
Basically , it is a medical device which uses electrical impulses , delivered by electrodes contacting the heart muscles , to regulate the beating of the heart .
With the help of pacemaker , patients whose heart rate is too high or too low can maintain an adequate heart rate .
According to classification , Heart pacemaker belongs to ergonomics which is a study of how people interact with machines .
As an ergonomical design , the primary requirement is safety .
Because the heart pacemaker should be implanted into patient's body before it can work well , it asks for higher safety requirement .
The material used to make a pacemaker is silicon , titanium steel and special artificial plastic , both of them is quite friendly to patients' internal environment and will not cause injury or other diseases to humans .
What's more , nowadays , the heart pacemaker is quite small with thickness only 10mm and weight only 40 grams .
Such kind of little size ensures a low possibility of hurting the human organs .
All in all , proper material and suitable size make the pacemaker much safer to use .
Overview , the coming out of the heart pacemaker makes a tremendous contribution to the patients who suffer from the heart attack .
We have to say it is really a commendable achievement among all the engineering designs .
Let's expect the prospective heart pacemaker can be more convenience and more powerful features at lower price .
I'm sure it will be fantastic news for the whole human beings .
Technical innovations are essential to the development of a nation .
However , making innovations is not just as simple as thinking about new ideas and carrying them out , but something requiring complex engineering design processes .
According to Khandani , the process of solving design problems can be generalized to five steps: "define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , and test and implement the solution" .
In most cases , it is not easy to go through all these steps successfully due to the hindrances from various facets .
In this essay , I will talk about two problems which have been greatly hindering such engineering design processes in China .
One is the brain drain problem and the other is the capital problem .
Since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy in 1978 , uncounted promising students have gone abroad for further study .
China has spent a lot of resources to educate them and expects them to reward the society after further education .
Unfortunately , lots of these talents are unwilling to return to their motherland because of the much more superior conditions in developed countries , which causes the brain drain problem .
As we can see , the five steps of engineering design processes for innovations given above all involve qualified well-educated people .
Such a brain drain makes China fall into a severe shortage of talents whom are necessary for the implementation of any stages of the process .
Since there are not enough people for engineering design processes , China is not capable of making enough innovations for higher living standards in a short time .
Then more educated people will go abroad , which deteriorates the brain drain problem in turn and exerts a greater negative effect on the process .
Secondly , China is still struggling to meet its people's basic living needs as a developing country .
Every year China has to spend most of its revenue on fundamental infrastructure and national defense , etc .
Therefore , unlike US and European developed countries , not much capital can be spared for engineering design processes for innovations , which arises the capital problem .
As we all know , it is often costly to gather sufficient valuable information in this information age and carry out a new policy in today's materialistic society .
Thus in the course of engineering design , one usually needs lots of money for getting pertinent information and testing and implementing the solution .
Without enough useful information , people cannot come up with best solutions .
Even if they have made it , testing and implementing it is still impossible without sufficient capital .
Besides , when people are aware that not much capital is available , they may not choose the most efficient but more costly solution in the course of 'analyzing and selecting a solution' , which may bring about bad effects in the long run .
Therefore , the capital problem hampers engineering design processes to a very great extent .
Actually , the brain drain problem and capital problem have been restricting China's engineering design processes greatly these years .
But the government has done much to relieve these two and other similar problems .
I have the confidence that China will overcome these hindrances one day .
At that time engineering design products or systems will boom to meet people' needs .
Einstein once noted that"the god doesn't play dice ."
From his perspective , since every natural event happens as a result of a cause or collective causes , I'm not sure if it is proper to refer the discovery of LSD , short term of Lysergic acid diethylamide , as an accident .
At least it is not an intentional consequence like the discovery of risperidone , a medicine for mentally disordered people .
In the following paragraphs , I shall touch on the similarities and differences of their pharmaceutical effects , controllabilities and consuming groups .
Firstly , despite the fact that they focus on different aspects pharmaceutically , LSD and risperidone actually share some similarities on medical effects .
They both have strong corrective influence on mental disorder .
In 1993 , by the United States Food and Drug Administration , risperidone was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia , and bipolar disorder in 2007 .
Especially for pupils with age 13-18 , risperidone is the only approved drug agent in America .
On another hand , LSD was once widely used for treatments of mental disorder as well before it was approved with devastating side effects , which would be illustrated in the second paragraph .
However , LSD affects people in alcoholism in a positive way which unachievable for risperidone .
Secondly , the controllability of the both of short term and long effects of LSD and risperidone varies greatly .
Risperidone always gives a constant performance .
Beside its expected medical effects , the side-effects are also predictable .
The most common side effects include severe anxiety , akathisia , sedation , dysphoria , insomnia , sexual dysfunction , low blood pressure , muscle stiffness , muscle pain , tremors , increased salivation , and stuffy nose .
But for LSD , the physical and psychological effect varies greatly from one to another , and is highly depend on the amount of dosage , consumer's personality , mood , the surrounding environment and other variable factors .
Most importantly , the social issues aroused by consumption of LSD are unexpected .
The typical physical effects are dilated pupils , higher body temperature , increased heart rate and blood pressure , sweating , loss of appetite , sleeplessness , dry mouth , and tremors .
Rather than physical and psychological effects , LSD also triggers intense spiritual experience which leads consumers to illusory images and feelings .
There is a great number of people believe that LSD serve as divine vehicle which transport the consumers to the outer-space where the god lives .
Several suicides were conducted before the United States government banned LSD in 1966 .
Lastly , the consuming groups of LSD and risperidone consist of different people with different purpose , resulting in different social problems .
Normally , the consumers of risperidone are psychological patients who are seeking effective treatment .
However for LSD , it was mainly regarded as a mean to get high by the American hippies .
Even the poets , painters and musicians tried to seek inspiration by consuming the LSD .
As a result , the consuming group of LSD is rather complicated than that of risperidone .
According to above , even though riperidone and LSD share some similarities in their pharmaceutical effects to certain extend , they are different from each other in terms of controllabliities of side effects and their consuming groups .
The sport is one of the most important things in human beings life .
But , unfortunately , it is inevitable to get injured when we do sports .
Knee injury is a common injury in many sports , for example , basketball , soccer , skiing and etc .
And also , it is difficult to recover because of the complexity of the knee .
Among the various knee injuries , the anterior cruciate ligament  injury happened in most cases .
If the sick do not recover completely , it is likely for him to get injured again at the same place .
Even worse it could affect his daily life .
So  ,the treatment of the ACL injury is considered as a very important problem in sports medicine .
To make the artificial ligament meet the need , scientists considered it in many aspects .
First , the artificial ligaments should not cause rejection reaction  .Second , it should be very strong  ,flexible and anti abrasive  ,so that it can ensure that the patient can play sports in the normal level .
Third  ,it should have the ability to grow and combine with the reptured ligament .
After a few years research , an artificial one called LARS ligaments came out .
The LARS ligament is made of industrial strength polyester fibers .
The polyester fibers and the original design of the knit have been tested for rupture , stretching and wear .
The result has showed that the LARS ligament is extremely resistant to flexion , traction , torsion , and residual stretching .
Also , the design has biocompatible properties to human beings tissues , because the intra-articular longitudinal fibers allow for tissue in growth .
Compared with the human ligaments , the LARS ligament is much more tensile .
Futhermore , if we use LARS ligaments in the reconstruction of cruciate ligament , the time of recovery can be reduce a lot .
The professional player who uses LARS ligaments can return to the court in 3 or 4 months after the surgery while the classic method will cost 6 to 12 months to recover .
This technology shows its advantages with the classic method .
And the invention of it gives the players and sports enthusiasts a better choice when they suffer the injury .
At the same time , there is also a pitfall about the artificial ligaments .
Because it appeared less than 20 years and we can not predict what could happen after 30 or 40 years , which artificial ligaments have been used for .
I think as it improves a lot in the future , it can take possession of the classic method finally .
STS , Science and technology studies , is the interaction of scientific research and social , political , cultural values .
Having taken shape in the 1960s , STS provides us another view of the innovation-development process in terms of social construction of technology .
Among thousands of technologies , laptop , one of the most important innovations in twentieth century , is a good example of socially determined technology .
The laptop , firstly manufactured by Toshiba in 1985 , ten years after the birth of the desktop computer , has again brought about a tremendous revolution in our lives .
The idea of making a laptop was inspired by mainly three social factors: demand of customers , support of technical stuff , and source of funding .
Secondly , the man power that provides technological support plays an essential rule to the innovation of laptop .
The idea of designing laptop was first not approved by Toshiba  , while Mizoguchi , the chief designer of laptop did not give up .
He organized a group of talented engineers who were selected from the military projects with strong professional skills and knowledge and started the research secretly .
After 24 months of hard work and thousands of times of practice , the first laptop was born .
The support of technical stuff brought a successful step towards the final goal of promoting and producing laptops .
Lastly , but not the least , the source of funding made the production and sales of laptops possible .
Though the research team has made the idea of laptop came true , the laptop would not be finally put into production without a large amount of money .
To the disappointment , the plan of producing the laptops had again been rejected due to the small potential market estimated by the company .
A new obstacle was in the way of Mizoguchi's laptop plan .
Fortunately , the potential of this innovation drew the attention of Nishida , an expert at marketing .
With his cooperation , the sales of laptop had been guaranteed and the production was finally executed .
To sum up , the innovation of laptop cannot be separated with the three main factors .
The demand of customers inspired the designers , the support of technical stuff put the idea into practice , and finally , the source of funding ensure the sales .
Without any of these three factors , the dream of owning a laptop will be still a dream now .
Have you tried to live with fire as your light source and use fire to cook or heat food ?
It must be terrible .
Fortunately , Thomas Edison created lightbulb in 1879 and Percy LeBaron Spencer discovered microwave energy after World War two .
It is amazing that Edison picked up a fifty-year-old idea and made it come true , while Percy brought microwave oven to light by an accident , indeed .
These two wonderful discoveries have lots of similarities and difference .
In the first place , the two inventors discovered lightbulb and microwave oven in totally different ways .
Moreover , the idea of microwave oven was totally new , while someone had worked on lightbulb before Edison .
Finally , the inventions and innovations of lightbulb and microwave oven are really great creations for human beings .
First of all , Edison and Percy made the two considerable discoveries in two completely different ways .
Edison achieved this unbelievable task by thousands of various experiments .
To choose the suitable filament for the lightbulb , Edison tried more than 1600 kinds of materials with different heat-resisting .
The result showed that platinum was the best material to be used as filaments , which was not satisfying due to its high price .
After many setbacks , Edison decided to use carbon to make filament .
Nevertheless , Percy lighted on microwave energy by pure coincidence .
When he did some experiment focusing on radar waves , the melt of a candy bar in his pocket excite the surprise of him .
After deeper research , Percy concluded that microwave heating could raise the internal temperature of many foods far more rapidly than a conventional oven .
Last but not least , lightbulb helps us say goodbye to darkness and microwave oven provides us a pretty convenient way to heat food .
Both of these two remarkable inventions help us to lead a much better life now .
Because of lightbulb , the big world becomes brighter and more colorful .
Also , we can read , write and do lots of things in the night .
Lightbulb has brought us easier and more convenient life .
In the same manner , microwave oven has become one of the many modern conveniences nowadays .
It provides us a better way to heat food .
Not only can it save time but also can be operated in a safer manner .
15th August , known as "Victory in the Pacific Day" , is celebrated by people all around the world to memorize the surrender of Japan in 1945 .
What we need to emphasize here is that the atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 6th and 9th August respectively definitely speed the surrender of Japan .
In the history of warfare , these are the only two nuclear weapons used for attacking .
Nowadays , more than sixty years passed by , nuclear weapons are still the most destructive weapons invented by human beings .
Surprisingly , when the nuclear technology is firstly discovered by scientists , it was seemed as a method to satisfy human's needs of energy .
If there was no E=mc2 or World War Two , nuclear weapons may never be invented .
But everything also seems very natural and has its inevitability .
This is history .
Maybe for the nuclear technology itself , utilizing it to make weapons is unfair , but we must agree that it is the social needs , or specifically the military demands , and government priorities at that time that decide the direction of this innovation .
Just like every year people celebrate the "Victory in the Pacific Day" , there should be some others memorizing the nuclear weapons .
There are two different perspectives for the development of technologies: technological and sociological point of view .
When viewed from the technological point of view , it can be seen that the technology , consisting of hardware and software , is shaped according to how technology has improved .
However , that is not true as it can be seen that considerations like market and cost are not taken into account .
Therefore the sociological factors like affordability and user-friendliness are used to determine the development of technologies .
An example of such technology is the Global Positioning System  .
The technology consists of numerous satellites that orbit around the Earth that provide its users with various functions ranging from navigation to prediction of weather , thus , widely used in transportation industries .
The military also use GPS in various methods from missile guidance to enemy tracking .
Besides that , the public has also benefited from this technology as it can be used for search and rescue purposes and also as a navigation aid .
Numerous factors have brought about the development of the GPS mainly the government , military and public demands .
First , the government had a great part to play in the development of the GPS .
In 1983 , the U .S . President Ronald Reagan decided that the GPS will be made available to civilian uses after the Soviet Union shot down a commercial airliner which had navigational difficulty , bringing about the death of more than 200 passengers .
Since then , the government realised that the GPS is the key to providing a dependable way of navigation and thus , pushed for its development .
Currently , the GPS is widely used in the aviation and maritime industry so that similar incidents can be avoided .
Second , the military brought about revolution in the usage of GPS by integrating missiles and other artilleries with GPS which improved the accuracy and efficiency of the weapons .
Besides that , it allowed the soldiers to do scouting and accomplish their tasks at night through GPS- receivers that coordinated their movements with command posts .
When the GPS is paired together with satellite cameras , enemy tracking and identifying targets are made convenient .
Next , the public demands have pushed the benefits of the GPS greater when gadgets are integrated with GPS to provide constant relative motion and time coordinating .
Using such products , users are capable of navigating in any part of the world .
At such , even the user's estimated time of arrival can be calculated .
Such products have saved lives when rescuers tracked the GPS signals from their gadgets to locate the victim's whereabouts , bringing the success rate of search and rescue mission to a higher level .
Today , the GPS is a widely used technology in not just the transport industry , but also in military and civilian purposes .
It has also since developed into a cost saving technology as it saves not just petrol and gasoline , but also time and effort .
Besides that , many victims owe their life to GPS when rescued from disasters and accidents .
It has been published that the GPS will fail in the year 2010 , however , with its wide range of purposes and benefits , efforts are being put in place by various governments around the world to not just keep it functional , but also to improve its capabilities .
Therefore , we can expect to see more GPS-related technology in future .
The development of technology has benefited human beings in both scientific researches and daily life of human beings .
With the invention of microscope , scientists are able to observe molecules which form all matters .
Besides scientific researches , inventions and new technologies have indeed brought convenience to human beings .
With mobile phones and Internet around , individuals are connected to the whole world with a simple click .
As Rogers stated in his book , development of technologies is stimulated either by scientific research or by social reasons .
One important technology which was socially determined is the invention of laptop in Toshiba , a Japanese electronics company .
The invention of laptop was originally designed to fit crowded offices and small homes which were typical in Japan .
At that time , dozens of workers shares one desk and desktop computers were too large in size .
Laptop was then invented by an engineer in Toshiba Company called Mizoguchi , whose braveness and wisdom has been recognized in the process of inventing laptop .
However , because of lacking resources and unpromising market , the innovation of laptop in Toshiba was nearly aborted .
Fortunately , the designers of laptop were strong-minded so people nowadays are able to access internet anywhere with laptops that were first invented by them .
In the process of inventing a laptop , the design team was lack of human resource and money .
At first , the idea of designing laptop was disapproved by the Toshiba Company , which at that time has just suffered from huge loss in the business of personal computers .
Corporate leaders of the company then were no longer interested in computer-related businesses and thus refused to provide fund and experts to the designing team .
Although the team survived due to the insistence of Mizogushi and finally came up with the first laptop in the world , lack of resources has had an impact on the design team , which made the team 'stressful'  in the designing process .
After the laptop was invented , it was forbidden to be sold in Japan since the company was not optimistic about the market of its new product .
Thus , the designers decided to present their production in Europe first , where they had a great success .
After that , laptops were introduced to all parts of the world and had brought convenience to people .
To wrap up , the invention of laptop was affected by the lack of resources and unpromising market which ultimately came from opinion of the authority in Toshiba Company which turned out to be incorrect .
However , the result is that laptops were eventually invented and brought convenience to human beings .
It is true that sometimes technology innovation may be affected by some factors , but hopes are that determined engineers such as Mizogushi will eventually come up with inventions that can improve our quality of life .
Serendipitous scientific discoveries often refer to those unexpected surprises scientists came across fully by chance in the area of science and technology .
These unplanned serendipitous "accidents" often turned out to be good results .
Actually a lot of major discoveries made by excellent scientists are unexpected gifts from good luck .
Some of them did change the course of history and still have a significant influence on the entire human race today , even the whole environment where we settled in .
For instance , the discovery of cosmic background radiation , the invention of the first microwave oven and the discovery of electromagnetism are all serendipitous .
In particular , pharmacology perhaps the most common fields where serendipity occurs .
The discovery of penicillina fairly common antibiotic in drug storesis one of the most famous .
Alexander Fleming was a British bacteriologist  who served as a captain in an army medical corps during World War I .
He had been searching for antibiotic substances that can attack a variety of bacteria since his graduation .
When he served in the army , he noticed that a lot of soldiers died from simple infections caused by small wounds .
In fact , at that time doctors had no cure for infections .
Every day hospitals were filled with patients who only got infections from a small cut or a scratch and more seriously those who were contracted with pneumonia or tuberculosis .
However , doctors and nurses could do little to save their life .
Fleming spared no effort to carry on his experiments and research in this area , hoping that he could find a cure for such simple but lethal infections .
After the discovery of the new substance , he came to the problem of how to cultivating the mould and how to isolate and purify the antibiotic agent .
Both of them seemed to be quite difficult .
Fleming continued his research and trial for a long period of time with his assistant , but to no avail .
During World War II , the work was taken over by two other scientists and they soon found a technique to purify penicillin and started the mass production .
It saved a lot of soldiers' life in the war .
Of course Fleming's contribution was never forgotten .
He shared the Nobel Prize for physiology/medicine with the two scientists .
It is quite interesting that penicillin was once discovered by a scientist serendipitously .
However , what would have happened if Fleming had never been concerned about the search for the cure or he had had no interest in this area at all ?
What would have happened if Fleming had ignored the contamination and just dropped it into the cleaning mixture ?
The whole world would have waited for more decades to see the discovery of penicillin .
It is just because Fleming was intrigued by his research that he could notice the mould contamination on the bacteria culture and stretch out further reflection on it , while others couldn't .
Hard work finally pays off .
Serendipity only favours those with high aspirations and determination who whole-heartedly dedicated themselves to their beloved career .
Century after century the engineering design processes for innovations speed up all-round social progress and create the civilisation we have today .
As far as I am concerned , the so-called engineering design processes for innovations actually means that the whole industry depends on the creative and passionate engineers to design new products or systems which can perfectly meet the society's demand .
In this way , the society is pushed forward .
That is why we say that scientific and technological process and innovation is the basic motive to promote productivity development .
However nowadays , we may find that these processes seem not so significant .
Perhaps some people will say that it is reasonable that the society is now in a relatively stationary stage since the modern scene was marked by tremendously and ever-accelerating change in the past few years .
But it is not the main reason in my opinion .
Just take my home country for an example .
The most serious problem which hampers the innovation process is that the technological base is relatively lower than the developed world .
Since industry innovation is a process with very high risk .
In other words , it runs a high risk of failure .
From the research report given by the government we can see that more than eighty percent of the companies involved in the research have some experience of breaking off or failure .
Because of the low technological base , the possibility of coming across with some bottlenecks in the innovation process is higher .
In this way , companies may dare not to pump money into the development of new products .
As we all know , enough funds are the basic guarantee for innovation .
Once the process is lack of funds , there is little hope for the process to continue .
Thus , the money we have already pumped in just becomes sunk cost , which means the company losses .
Then , this becomes a vicious circle .
High risk means less money pumped in .
Less money leads to higher risk of failure .
Finally , fewer and fewer companies will be willing to go for the innovation process .
Another very important factor in my opinion is about the lack of researchers .
As is known to all , the key to technological innovation is talents , especially those high-quality compound talents .
But the fact is that the lack of researchers has become the 'bottleneck' restrictions for most of the companies in China .
Statistics suggest that the R&D teams in companies tend to reduce .
What is worse , there are many companies which even do not get a R&D team yet .
Besides , the not so high salary can hardly attract high-quality talents to join the research team , which is also due to the lack of funds which I have mentioned before .
All these make it even more difficult for the innovation to born the fruit .
Anyway , we are living in such a world where everyone is down-to-earth .
People are always tending to do things that will benefit .
As a consequence , R&D may become the last choice for some talents .
All in all , it is the low level of technological base and the lack of excellent researchers that significantly hamper the whole process for innovation .
To improve the present situation , it is better for the companies to pump in more money to the process and attract more talents to contribute to the technology progress .
Additionally , companies should import the advanced ideas and skills from the developed world to improve the technological skill of themselves .
Only in this way can we expect a better environment for innovation and more significant scientific and technological progress .
Recently , along with the rapid and sound development of China's economy , China has made world-acknowledged achievements in technological area .
However , some obstacles still hamper the process of technological innovation of China , as the technological development is in its infancy .
In my opinion , there are mainly two big problems for us to overcome in the next few years , which are the decentralization and shortage of sources and the lagging of technology transfer .
Source refers to human capital and financial support .
Actually , decentralization of human capital and delayed financial support hamper the stage of research and development to a quite large extent .
Compared to other developing countries , China does not have a standard innovation centre where a lot of talented scientists and engineers can discuss and develop a creative project .
Take Silicon Valley as an example , a lot of new technological products are developed and promising companies are founded there every year , which is a result of the cooperation of many talents .
But China does not have such a base for technology development .
Chinese talents are spreading all over the world .
How to call up them and work out some big projects is a tough task for our government .
Lack of financial support is another problem faced by some existing research departments .
Every year , China raises a large quantity of money to support technology development .
However , if the financial support is divided into small parts , these departments will not get enough money to do a large scale research .
What's more , some research projects must wait several months for financial support , during which time scientists may lose heart and give up .
As a result , research and development , which are the first steps of innovation , becomes more and more difficult .
China should try hard to solve the problem of source .
Another problem is the lagging of technology transfer , which is a headache for a lot of research departments .
As we all know , technology was born to meet human's needs .
Therefore , transforming technology into human lives is significant for an innovation .
Some new technologies may be born as well as die in laboratories as a result of lagging of technology transfer .
Take computer as an example: it is said that the development speed of the computer is quite fast .
Maybe it takes about a few years to generate a new generation .
But can most of us change our computers every few years ?
Impossible !
What's more , as China does not have a system to link these new techniques with manufacturing departments , I think most manufacturing factories cannot make full use of these innovations .
Therefore , we'd better to build a sound system to do the technology transfer .
As far as I am concerned , the two problems are crucial as one refers to the beginning of innovation and the other determines the destiny of this innovation .
I think there are some ways to solve these problems .
Firstly , we'd better develop some technical centre to bring talents together and do research .
Secondly , we must develop a complete system for technology transformation .
If we can overcome these problem , I believe the design process of innovation in China will develop farther more .
Nowadays , innovative engineering design plays a significant role in technology development .
A smart design , sometimes only involving a little change , can improve the work efficiency by several times , which can produce a much more attractive profit .
Obviously , cultivating engineers' innovative abilities is very important .
However , in my home country , many problems exist as huge barriers for engineers to apply their innovative ideas into practice .
The improper education model and the unsatisfying experimental conditions stand out among many reasons .
After all the above , we can see the improper model and the unsatisfying social conditions really act as obstacles to innovative engineering designs .
This may be a reason that China's technology is still behind many countries in certain fields .
However , we must also see things are changing .
As China is carrying out education reform in a large scale and putting more emphasis on technology innovations , we can predict China's technology has a good perspective .
In the old days , taking photos was a complicated process which was almost performed solely by professional technicians .
A photographer had to not only adjust all the settings manually , but also print the films with chemicals called film developer in a darkroom .
However , the recent two decades witnessed astonishing innovation in photographythe development of digital cameras which has made taking photos accessible to non-specialists .
This development came as a result of people's demand for more convenient photo-taking techniques .
Consumers' desire for more convenient usage and better photo quality shapes the development of DC technology .
Consumers' pursuit of better photo quality also drives the innovation of advanced DC technology .
The quality of a photo is mainly determined by the resolution of a camera .
To improve resolution , a company needs to conduct a considerable amount of research , including generation of new ideas , technology breakthroughs and repetitive experiments .
The process is hard , but companies are still willing to sacrifice their time and labor for the development , since the better the resolution , the more customers will be attracted , and the more profit the companies will make .
Original digital cameras had a very low resolution .
For example , the first commercial DC , Dycam Model 1 , provided only 90 ,000 pixels  .
After half a decade , the number changed to 1 ,000 ,000 .
The most advanced DCs today support more than 12 million pixels , which is over 100 times that of the original ones .
Such remarkable improvement shows the strong impact of consumers' requirement on pushing forward the DC technology .
After telephone was invented in the late 1800s , people were thinking about ways to improve such communication technology to extend the range of social network .
The original idea of mobile phone came from combining telecommunication with radio technology which was considerably improved during the World War 2 period CITATION Spe90 \l 2052  .
However , since radio telephone at that time was too heavy and expensive , the number of mobile phone users was limited .
Until the 1980s , due to the cellular idea , the portability and the quality of communication of mobile phone were improved and mobile telephony started to play a part in mass market CITATION Tom07 \l 2052  .
And with the advance in internet technology , the third generation mobiles phones are digitized nowadays CITATION Wei05 \l 2052  .
This essay will examine three major factors in the development of mobile telecommunication in different stages .
First of all , the post-war economic recovery demanded a better way of communication in order to expand the network of free trade between different countries .
The need of communication is always vital , especially for business .
In 1946 soviet engineers Shapiro and Zaharchenko CITATION Spe90 \l 2052  launched the first radio telephone which was equipped inside a car and could connect to local telephone network within the range of 20 kilometers .
Besides , as water transportation was developed rapidly during that period , radiotelephony service was introduced to harbor and coastal vessels CITATION Spe90 \l 2052  .
In the past , radio telephony was the only way to connect to telephone service when people were mobile .
Hence , the demands to achieve economic growth pushed mobile technology forward in the early days .
Last but not the least , the increasing number of mobile users requires digitized mobile phones with special features .
After the born of GSM , mobile phones started to more attract private users .
Unlike the business usage , private users demand a user-friendly environment to communicate with friends and family as well as some additional entertainment features .
Such demands by the public encouraged mobile developers to create new functions for cell phones such as delivering ring tones , SMS and voice mail CITATION Wei05 \l 2052  .
Besides , mobile phones became digitized at the beginning of this century , which brought a revolution of mobile telecommunication .
Mobile phone today is no longer a phone that was mobile; it can be a MP3 player , a game player and even a personal computer .
Thus , consumers' demands motivate the development of mobile telecommunication in the digital age .
The technology of nanorobotics  is a modern invention that deals with the making of robots at an atomic level .
The development of nanobots came from the advancement in nanotechnology , and the idea of nanotechnology was proposed by physicist Richard Feynman in a speech in 1959 .
Nanobots are programmed to do specific tasks , and they are small enough to enter a human body .
These tasks are increasingly needed to improve the level of technology in medical treatments today .
Research in nanobots is intensively carried out in this area .
Hence , development in the technology of nanobots today is largely shaped by the demands of patients with illnesses that require better treatments .
The development of nanobots today is largely affected by the increasing medical needs in cancer treatment .
There are many injuries and illnesses that originate from nano-scale processes .
For instance , cancer cells damage the cells within the human body , and they cannot be treated effectively with the conventional treatment like chemotherapy .
Today , drugs for treating cancer are delivered to specific tissues by nano-particles within the body .
According to a journal by Amir Gur  , "small-sized robots are already involved in spinal surgeries , and the use of nanobots allows minimising damage to the tissue in the procedure ."
The introduction of nanobots in medicine and biomedical research creates possible solutions to treat illnesses that macro-scale techniques would be impossible to achieve .
Furthermore , the early boom of nanobots was largely dependent on the policies of the government .
Research on nanobots requires huge funding .
Without the help from the government , the advancement would be slow .
According to a journal article by Vincent Dusastre , "the lobbies convinced the Clinton administration to launch the National Nanotechnology Initiative in 1999 ."
This was the catalyst that accelerated the development in nanotechnology .
For fear of losing to other nations , the government increases the funding to private and public sectors in the R&D of nanotechnology , and this in turn brings to the global development and innovation of nanobots .
Another important factor that is changing the landscape of nanobots is economy .
Our economy is greatly dependent on energy and raw materials .
Nanobots would be helpful in making materials that is efficient in storing energy and converting energy sources .
There are many benefits in developing nanobots .
They can be used to create a system that is affordable , fast , and compacted .
Nanotechnology has ventured even further recently .
It is described as a new and important way of solving the problem of storage system and energy crisis .
According to an article , $20 million was granted to Stanford - one of 46 Energy Frontier Research Centres - to help the engineers to find energy down at the nano-scale .
In Conclusion , the technology of nanobots is a modern innovation that allows human to process task that is beyond our bear-eye can see .
This technology is largely applied in the field of medical treatment today .
With the continuous development , nanobots would improve the lives of millions in the near future .
In Singapore , there are many creative ideas to solve the problems that are encountered in daily lives .
However , only limited number of the creative ideas have successfully completed their engineering design processes and hence launched in the market .
A large number of the creative ideas have failed in their engineering design processes because there are some problems in Singapore which may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
The main problem , however , is time constraint and this problem can be seen to significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations in companies such as Creative Technology .
Another problem is that the designing process must be able to keep up with the rapid developments in technology , otherwise by the time it is completed , it may already been rendered as obsolete .
Such case can be seen in St . James Press  that Creative Technology began manufacturing its own CD-ROM drives when it could not keep up with the rapid developments in drive technology , however , it was forced to abandon the effort , dumping its inventory and taking a loss of more than $30 million in 1995 .
From here , we can see that the Engineering design processes must be constantly be updated , otherwise more problems may occur and this has caused many engineering design process to be abandoned halfway and hence , it is a problem that may significantly hamper engineering design process for innovations .
In conclusion , the two problems discussed earlier are just the few of the many problems that may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
That is the reason why it is never simple to have many innovations in Singapore .
However , still , there are many people who stood up to the difficulty and successfully completed the engineering design processes for innovations and I hope more people can learn from their experiences .
Since the 1970's , communication technology has made great advances , offering capabilities that were unthinkable a decade earlier .
The last decade of the 20th century saw a flood of new communication technologies entering the market , office and home according to the Central Statistical office .
This was the result of a better of a better understanding of people's needs and what technology they really want to use .
One such technology was the mobile phone .
In the past , communication was slow and unreliable as it was done over a distance by physical transportation such as the use of pigeons , boats and messengers .
In the most unfortunate cases , the information would not even reach the desired destination .
As a result , people wanted a form of communication which was fast and reliable .
This all changed dramatically with the introduction of the telephone .
Firstly , it took away the necessity of a transport medium which made it more reliable .
Secondly , the telephone used electricity which was literally accessible to every household and this provided messages to be passed around more quickly .
However , this was still not enough .
People then saw the need to be able to communicate on the go .
The society wanted to be able to communicate anywhere and anytime and to anyone they wished .
This resulted in the invention of wireless telephony , commonly referred to as the mobile phone .
The introduction of the mobile phone allowed people in the society to have the ability to pass messages to one another quickly and accurately whenever they wished .
This meant that office workers were able to speed up communication and circulate information faster to allow new ideas to be conceived quickly .
Having to do this would result a great benefit to an individual's company and finally , it would have a positive impact on the economy .
Furthermore , even the military benefited from this wireless telephony .
Through the use of wireless communication , soldiers were able to communicate with each other swiftly and with 100% accuracy when information was passed around .
Due to the convenience of having a mobile phone , the number of mobile phone users increased drastically over the years .
By 2002 , Japan had 55 million mobile phone users  , China had over 200 million mobile phone users  and about 90% of Finland's population had a mobile phone according to BBC in 2003 .
The mobile underwent further developments to enhance its features to suit its consumers .
As a result , by 2003 , the mobile phone was presented more than just a tool for calling someone .
By integrating a variety of functions in a single handset , the mobile phone became a multimedia information processor fitted with an array of conveniences .
In 2003 , Nokia had a vision that the mobile phone will become a life management tool for business , work and leisure .
It will also take on roles and an anchor point , a digital navigator and a lifestyle accessory that will help individuals control and enrich their lives  .
Looking back at the evolution of communication , the mobile phone is one that was shaped by social factors .
Constant demands from the society caused mobile phone companies to continue developing newer phones that would satisfy their consumers and allow them to bridge space and time to such an extent that people can communicate more efficiently .
The health ministers of various countries have shaped the development of the new vaccine .
The virus is very contagious thus leading to a rampant spread in the society .
Thus there is a large demand for the vaccine by the various government bodies .
This could be seen in the following , whereby the governments of France , Belgium and Finland intended to purchase 50 million , 12 .6 million and 5 .3 million doses , respectively  .
Another reason the government bodies is concerned about the development of the new vaccine is the fear for mutation .
As experts have predicted that many more is going to contact the diseases , there is a higher the chance that the diseases will mutate into a stronger virus .
The health ministers around the world are influencing the development of the vaccine so as to cure the diseases before it spreads too widely or mutates .
The public and the H1N1 patients are the other group that shaped the development of the vaccine for H1N1 .
Although figures of the WHO have shown that out of the 160 ,000 cases only 1 .200 have died , this could not contain the fear in people .
This is due t0 the previous outbreak of another flu virus which took many lives .
Due to the fear there is a high demand for the vaccine , as such the pharmaceutical companies are trying to seize this rare business opportunity .
Thus they became very concerned with the development of the vaccine .
Besides , the large demand , any new development would also bring about a rise in the respective pharmaceutical companies share price .
For example , in April 30 2009 when Lipoxen announced positive preclinical results for the delivery of an enhanced influenza vaccine , adding that the technology should also work against the new swine flu strain , Lipoxen's share price when up from  6 .62  to  21 .75   .
Nowadays , most mobile phone can take pictures .
Many people have already got used to use cell phone to take pictures and transfer to their friends , so that they think that the camera phones are born like this .
However , camera phone changed a lot after coming out at 2000  , compared with the first camera phone , camera phones nowadays are quite different .
During the nine-year development of camera phone technology , we can see that the great market demand , customer requirement , and government regulations of different countries have once affected this technology a lot .
Hawk-eye is a computer system used in cricket , tennis and other sports to visually track the path of the ball and display a record of its actual path as graphic image .
In tennis and cricket , Hawk-eye system has become an important reference for judgment and even the decision maker when dispute come on the scene .
When the Hawk-eye system was invented , it got prizes including Science and Technology Innovation Award presented by The Royal Television Society .
However , even for now , the popularization has not become widespread .
Hawk-eye's development is limited due to its high cost , some errors it made and some opposing ideas from the public .
In addition , not all the Sportsmen value Hawk-eye system very much .
Even in tennis , one of the sports that Hawk-eye is the most widely used , some of the world's most popular players still cannot accept Hawk-eye system .
Roger Federer and Lindsay Davenport think that Hawk-eye system forgets the true meaning of tennis and makes tennis disinteresting .
As is widely known , those world-famous players have a great influence on the development of the sport .
If those players do not accept Hawk-eye system , it may be very difficult for Hawk-eye system to develop and spread out further .
In conclusion , the reasons why Hawk-eye system does not spread out and develop further are the high cost , the weakness of Hawk-eye system itself and the social opposing ideas from some influential world-famous players .
Since Iphone's first introduction on June 29 , 2007 , it has become the best- selling smart phone in the world1 .
After a series of hardware and software development , we can now enjoy the latest 3GS Iphone with a lot of improvements , including Internet , 3G , music , video and photos .
In the Iphone's development process , we cannot deny that the user's demand for new functions and user's financial problem in economic crisis have a great influence in changing the Iphone .
The second factor that affects the Iphone is the user's budget during economic crisis .
During the crisis , the sale of smart phone in general decreases because people do not want to spend money on unnecessary thing .
Worldwide sales of hi-tech "smartphones" grew at their slowest pace yet in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the financial crisis hit demand , a research firm said Thursday2 .
There is no way for Apple to encourage people buying their products except making them more valuable .
In 2009 summer , Apple introduces the new version of Iphone , the 3GS , with the same price as the older version .
The new one has higher speed core and bigger RAM , which lets Iphone runs faster and can even display High definition movie .
Apple also reduces the price of 3G version to make it reasonable and affordable to more users .
The result is "California-based Apple was the third-biggest player with iPhone sales of 11 .42 million units , more than triple the 3 .3 million sold when it launched the device in 2007" .
After all , user's financial problem in economic crisis and user's demand for advanced technology have contributed to the development of Iphone through several years .
Iphone now can serve many purposes of users like entertainment , video conference .
Although Iphone is the best smart phone in the market at the moment , but it will have to be developed more and be offered at a lower price to satisfy the customers .

Both the military and civil demand for precise navigation promote the development of Global Positioning System
Military demand for precise navigation is the original cause for the invitation of GPS .
After the WW , the US military realized the weakness of navigating by the stars and the radio signals and started to seek for a more precise positioning system to guide their fighters and warships globally .
In late nineteen fifties , the scientists in USA realized the possibility of accurate positioning by satellites and finally in 1960 , a satellite navigation system called Transit is tested in USA navy to meet their intense requirement for precise navigation to avoid unnecessary shipwreck .
Since then , in order to grasp the precise position information of its army all over the world , United States Department of Defense allotted millions of dollars in the GPS R&D which eventually resulted in a complete Global Positioning System with the operation of two dozen of polar orbiting satellites . 
Besides the military demand , the public appeal for a safe civil navigation also promotes the development of GPS .
In 1983 , a US civilian airliner KAL 007 was shot down by the Soviet Union air force by mistake when it lost its way and flied into the airspace of the Soviet Union without authorization , thus making the US civilians intensely blame the government for the ignorance of the safety of civil navigation .
In order to calm the mass and avoid such disasters in future , the then president Ronald Regan promised to apply GPS to civilian users as well as military once it was completed .
And due to the immense pressure of the public , the US government turned off the SA  in May 2000 , which maked GPS develop from a critically military supplied technology to a real dual-use system for both civilian and military use .
The idea of GPS is firstly put forward in the nineteen forties .
Afterwards , both the military and public demand for precise navigation promote the further development of GPS and make it like what we see today -a precise dual-use global positioning system for both civilian and military .
Similarities and differences between technologies developed via research and via serendipitous discovery
Technology is the practical application of knowledge especially in a specific area .
Many technologies were developed via research or the interplay between scientific investigations and practical problems while some were serendipitously invented .
This essay will compare and contrast the discovery of penicillin and the development of embryonic stem cells these two technologies , in terms of impetus to the invention , researchers involved in the innovation development and the effects on society .
There are similarities and differences between technologies developed via research and via serendipitous discovery in the aspect of impetus to the invention , researchers involved in the innovation development and the effects on society .
In the future , more and more useful technologies will be developed and they can give us a lot of benefits .
One of the many innovations that how made our lives convenient is "Refrigeration" .
This was a technology that had been shaped by the society in the past who were desperate to preserve their food .
They used blocks of ice as cooling aids to preserve their food .
Ice from mountains or snowy areas were transported to warmer regions where it was wrapped in cloth and placed in cellas .
Soon ice box , which was made up of a metal linked box insulated with cork or snow dust with one compartment to put the ice and another to store the perishables .
However , this system was not very efficient and was inadequate .
The civil ware in US interrupted the ice trade .
Successive warm winter for a period of time created severe ice shortages leading to an unprecedented demand for new methods .
The desperate need for a way to preserve food as well as the idea of cooling to prevent the food from spoiling helped to shape the technological innovation of refrigeration .
The idea of refrigeration was built based on the principle that when a liquid changes to a gas , it absorbs heat as it expands in a self contained cycle , the air or other fluid surrounding the device can be reduced in temperature .
With this principle , soon the gas refrigerator and the electric refrigerator was built to carry out the ideas of regrigeration .
Economic factor also contributed to the success of electric refrigerators .
Since it was believed that greater economic profits could be gained from electric refrigerators as compared to gas refrigerators , large firms started investing huge amount of research ad development  funding into the electric refrigerators as well as promoted the product aggressively .
Therefore small firms producing gas refrigerators could not compete with the strong competition and with insufficient resources for R & D , further developments to the refrigerator was not possible and it was also difficult to keep the prices of gas refrigerators were forced to go out of sales and the sales of electric refrigerator continued booming .
Therefore , economic profit grained from the product also affects the technological innovation .
The length of tank's history is almost one hundred year since 1916 when the first time tank was used as a secret weapon of British .
If we trace back further , we can find that Leonardo de Vinci already drew a similar picture of tank in 15th century .
Although we are not sure what kind of materials and technologies Vinci was trying to use when constructing his "tank" , we are still astonished by his ingenious imagination .
However , tank is not a usual vehicle for the majority .
Most people never have a chance to drive a tank , but it seems that many people are very familiar with and interested in it .
Tank is tightly related to war since the first day it was born .
Inevitably , government and military demand play vital important roles in its developing history .
In conclusion , tank is a great engineering-design product which government , global politics and military industry shape it together .
It is a "weapon of mass destruction" but still ingenious .
Its quick development and adaptability in battle field is incomparable .
It is the main role in land battle in modern war .
The success of a technology not only depends on how well it resolves the targeted need but also the social considerations it incurs when introduced to the consumer market .
Based on "The network of power" , a book by Thomas Hughes , it addresses one pertinent problem on the way we view technology .
The associated issue is that we tend to be blinded by the benefits of a technology and oversee the importance of understanding it as an entire system .
By looking at the development of automobiles , from electric vehicles to gasoline-powered cars , we are able to understand how economic factors influence oil magnates , car manufacturers and the government who ultimately shaped this technological innovation .
To sum up , oil companies , car manufacturers and the government considered issues from the economic view and realised that the consequences of making electric car a success are too drastic .
The oil and auto industry are too lucrative and at the same time crucial to the overall economy such that issues regarding pollution and environment are secondary to it .
Hence , the automobile technology is ultimately shaped by oil magnates , car companies and the government who are largely influenced by economic factors .
In Singapore , there are problems which could hamper the local engineering design process for innovations .
The two problems are attitude and funding which have severe impact on the local engineering process for innovations .
The engineering design process for innovations can be broken down into 3 stages , firstly creativity , secondly process and lastly materialization .
The two problems will be elaborated on how it impacts the engineering process for innovations .
The first problem that will hamper the local engineering process is attitude .
According to "Singapore's innovation journey" an article by Patrick Lambe , Singaporeans cannot innovate because they are conditioned to be followers rather than creative idea generators .
This could be made due to personal and the society's attitude .
We shall begin with the individual attitude and how it hampers the local engineering process for innovations .
Singaporeans tends to have an asian mentality which is prudence and stability .
Being prudent , Singaporeans tends to be less adventurous compared to their western counterparts .
One common scenario would be , parents who advice their children especially those with tertiary education to get a decent job and contribute to the family's expenditure .
If their children , wants to go into the research and development profession example being a researcher in a university or students joining their local science competition that will not add to distinctions in the exams they will be advice against .
This will cause children who later grow into adults not to utilize their creativity the first step to engineering design process .
The second problem that could hamper the local engineering design process is funding .
Often , inventors who use their engineering talents to come up with innovative products fail to secure funding .
A good example is the formula racing car of National University Of Singapore  , the initial stages required the professors and his students to each come up with three hundred dollars to purchase the necessary parts .
It was only with success did the formula racing car received funding from sponsors .
However not all inventors had the luck of achieving initial success and thus receive funding .
Funding affects all the three stages of engineering process for innovations .
Failure to secure funding will turn away inventors with engineering flare from even brainstorming for ideas affect creativity , in the process of coming up with innovations no funding seeks to terminate the inventors progress and with no funding its not possible to publicize about an engineering innovation .
In conclusion , the two problems that could hamper the local engineering process for innovations are attitude and funding .
They will have a severe impact on the three stages which make up the local engineering process for innovations .
On 4 July 2009 , The Straits Times newspaper reported that researchers from the National University of Singapore  invented a chair that turns sounds into vibrations to help the deaf experience music .
This was done as a result of NUS PhD student Suranga Nanayakkara recognising the need for the deaf to experience sound .
The Haptic Chair , which comes with back cushions and a footrest , is embedded with speakers that amplify vibrations caused by sound waves .
The product is made with the understanding that sound waves , apart from travelling through air , can also travel through solid matter . 
The difference between a serendipitous discovery and a researched technology are the resources invested in the development , and how the technology is gauged to be a success .
A serendipitous discovery happens by chance , and has no pre-allocated funds or project timeframe to be adhered to .
The post-it pads came about because the 3M researcher happened to have non-permanent adhesive , and he decided to come out with the new product on his own .
Before he gave the post-it pads to others , no funds or expertise were assigned to him for the post-its development .
In the case of The Haptic Chair , a team of researchers worked together with Suranga Nanayakkara , who also had the support of several working staff from the University .
A lot of time and effort has been put in by the team before they could actually come out with the product .
Research technology and serendipitous discoveries , despite being different , share certain similarities .
Both are by-products of people being able to recognize human needs .
For the 3M researcher , he identified the need to stick notes on paper without leaving adhesive stains to damage original documents; for the NUS student , he identified the need to create a product to aid those with hearing problems .
Both technologies benefit the lives of people , and have potential for profit .
In conclusion , we have come to learn that new technologies can come not just by research , but by serendipitous discoveries as well .
What we do need to bear in mind is this: technologies of both natures serve different groups of people in different scales , but they ultimately bring benefit to the lives of people .
Innovation starts when there is a need or when someone faces a problem and motivates people to find a way to solve it by generating new ideas .
Technology is very much related with innovation .
As we need an equipment to solve problems .
Many technological innovations were formed by scientific research or by the interaction of scientific investigations and applied on practical needs and problems .
A new idea is created through results from rigorous process of research .
Others were serendipitously invented .
Serendipity means unexpected discovery of new ideas when finding something which is unrelated or in the process of researching in new inventions .
These findings are often unpredictable and uncertain .
Serendipitous discovery can happen to anyone as well as in many fields .
In conclusion , innovation occurs anywhere and anytime .
The exchange of ideas and information plays a very crucial part in the process of generating new ideas .
Through constant exchange of information about the problems , human needs and wants , we can come up with better ideas to solve problems and make our world a better place to live in .
Recognizing a problem or need is the very first stage of the process .
In the past , people started to use fire , coal , or heat from the sun to cook .
Stove was invented because people need to cook , which applied heat to prepare the food .
In contrast , the microwave oven that we are using today was a side product of the microwave radio signal in radar for military purpose .
Dr . Percy Spencer discovered the microwave technology by serendipity when he found out that his candy bar in his pouch was melted when he was experimenting with his new magnetron .
The history of the stove and microwave shows that serendipity and researched technology came from a very different beginning .
Serendipity came from a branch of a problem or need , while research technology came straight from the problem or needs .
Next , when the basic and application research of the technology has established , the development of the product will begin .
The first known stove was built on the ground with sticks foaming a tripod to hold the cooking pot above the heat source .
After years of innovations and experiments , the stove nowadays is safer to use and more convenient .
Likewise , the very first microwave oven was very big and bulky .
Today , it has become very compact and light , and features like the automatic functions to allow user to cook with just pressing a button .
Therefore we can see that both the technologies share the similar development path .
One similarity between both categories is achieving the aim of improving quality of life for the people .
For Bionic eyes , it is developed as engineers are thinking of ways to improve visual displays in various fields such as gaming and in the aviation industry .
They hope to develop lenses such that they will allow players to be entirely immersed in the game allowing them to move without any constraints .
For the aviation industry , it is hope that through the new technology , pilots are able to know the speed of the plane almost immediately .
As for 3M's Post-its , it comes in very handy when people want to remind themselves of events or when commenting on essays without having the need to write in the essay itself .
It is convenient to use as it can stick to almost any surfaces and also easy to peel off without leaving any marks .
However , there are also differences between the two categories .
One of the differences was how this technology came about .
For Bionic eyes , it was done via research after seeing it in a movie called 'Terminator' , where a woman is able to zoom on places that are far away .
This gave the engineers the idea of whether what they see in the movie is able to become a reality .
So , they worked towards this goal and developed Bionic eyes .
As for Post-its , it was discovered accidentally by researches who were trying to find bonding agents that can be used to bind papers firmly to a surface .
It was a by-product of what they are trying to achieve .
It was once deemed as "worthless" until people found uses for it and it become one of the most commonly used product in our daily life and one of the products that makes the most revenue for 3M .
In conclusion , both technologies , be it developed via research or resulted from a serendipitous discovery , it has achieved the aim of improving the lives of people .
Though initial acceptance to the two technologies was different and it all depends on the mindset of the public whether the technology being discovered is worth marketing or not as seen from the case of 3M Post-its .
One of the earliest inventions brought about by mankind was the wheel , ever since then we have never looked-back .
We continued to push for technological advances in different aspects of our lives so as to enjoy a better standard of living .
Over the past half decade , a new term "skunkworks" has surfaced .
This term describes the environment where small groups of researchers are not bound by corporate rules and politics .
Whereas conventionally generated technologies tend to require ensuring the survivability of the head company .
There are several similarities and differences between the technologies generated by the "skunkworks" environment as compared to conventionally generated technologies .
Products generated by each environment may appear similar but actually differ in many ways and the environment plays an important part in shaping its distinctive features .
The second similarity is that in both environments , generally large amount of money and support has to be put in by the head company .
This is simply because in order to produce cutting-edge technology , large amount of research has to be done .
Hence long hours are required before any results are visible .
A few examples include , GM developing the first electric car named IMPACT , Apple developing their first Macintosh computer and Xerox's attempt at developing the world's first personal computer .
It is thus evident that huge amount of financing and support is generally required in both environments .
The second difference between the two environments is the working environment presented to the engineers and researchers .
This has resulted in very different products developed by each environment .
The "skunkworks" environment has been able to provide the developers the flexibility and freedom required to break traditional barriers and develop cutting-edge technologies .
Furthermore , "skunkworks" environment is very stressful as compared to the traditional corporate environment due to the lack of financing and hence room for error becomes much smaller .
The last and perhaps the most significant difference in the environments have to be the difference in the features of technologies developed by each environment .
The "skunkworks" environment has generally been able to develop technologies which are well received by the public and continue to bring success to the head company .
An example of such a difference is again present between the IMPACT car and the Toshiba laptop .
Under the stressful skunkworks environment , the researchers from Toshiba are able to think critically and design the product to fit the needs of the society .
On the other hand , the researchers from GM have failed to realize that the public and society was not ready for their invention .
The limitation of their product also meant that it was only open to a small market .
In conclusion , it is clear that the technology churned out by a "skunkworks" environment differ greatly to that of a conventionally generated technology .
The features and characteristics of the "skunkworks" technology set them apart from conventionally generated technology .
An innovation may come from different ways .
The idea of such an innovation can emerge though some research or it may be from some serendipitous discovery .
That is to say , the common viewpoint is not totally true .
On one hand , one technology may be developed and polished through numerous research and experiment with a lot of effort .
On the other hand , some technology may be discovered purely by chance .
Two typical representatives are the electric cars and the Warfarin .
The electric car is invented by some hardworking engineers , while Warfarin is discovered serendipitously .
Although they are initialized differently , there are several similar stages of developing process .
Innovations developed via research and from serendipitous discovery are in no way similarly initialized .
Generally , one technology that is developed through research often begins with the need for practical uses or recognition of a social problem .
The electrical car is not an exception .
As the situation of the earth environment becomes worse , and the energy resources are exhausting , the need for inventing nonpolluting and energy- saving cars is urgent .
Some government encourages automobile companies to produce environmentally friendly cars .
Engineers' motivation to design electric cars is obvious .
However , the discovery of Warfarin is totally different .
It is discovered by chance .
Nobody knew that the chemical in spoiled sweet clover key that led to cattle hemorrhage could actually be used as rat poison until the scientist Link accidentally found it .
He did not do it on purpose at all .
Even he himself was surprised when he found this chemical was highly lethal to rats .
In fact , the general belief that all technologies are initialized with a lot of effort is not quite true .
The solution to a completely irrelevant problem may hide behind the undergoing research , and eventually some great discovery is accidentally made .
To sum up , technologies developed via research and from serendipitous discovery are quite differently initialized .
However , they are similar in the sense that they have to undergo the same process of experiments and research , and both can be very successful and bring benefit to the whole society .
During the process of developing innovations , regarding every little detail seriously and never letting go any chance discovery are most important .
Hopefully , successful technologies are produced by both means .
There are numerous problems faced by the world today .
Governments of different countries may have different agenda list , however aging population is definitely an issue present in the list .
Singapore makes it her top priority to create a safer environment for the elderly to live in .
Engineers play a huge role in assisting the government in achieving the aim of creating a better and safer environment for the elderly to live in .
With a safer environment , the welfare of the elderly will be improved and less social problems will be resulted .
Examples of such engineering design are the building of ramps at the main entrance of the flats , building handrails at the side of the stairs and also the wheelchair bound bus .
The pressing issue is to build a conducive environment for the old .
For example , the Housing Development Board  had implemented several designs to improve the convenience of the elderly , such as installing lifts on every storey and build wider internal corridors and hallways .
The designs had been proven useful by the flat holders who lived in the flat with all these facilities when the HDB first implemented them .
Thus , the government had implemented the Lift Upgrading Programme in 2001 , so that the owners have direct access to the lift at every floor .
According to Khandani  , after each solution is generated , it must be tested and implement to see the effects brought by the solution .
In this case , there is positive effects associated to the engineering designs made to the HDB flats , thus the government had implemented the solution throughout Singapore .
Increasing number of death rate due to traffic accidents have become a major problem in many countries .
The World Health Organisation  states that traffic accidents are in the ninth position among the reasons which leads to death .
When considering European Union , 1 .3 million road traffic accidents occur each year , resulting in 1 .7 million injuries and over 40000 death annually .
Another alarming fact is that , even Singapore which implements strong traffic laws and regulations is also affected by this traffic accident problem .
The accident rate per 10 ,000 vehicles has increased from 2 .34 in 2006 to 2 .60 in 2007 in Singapore  .
So , to reduce and solve the problem of traffic accidents , a new traffic system should be formed and it should be the current human need that should be given priority .
The engineering design process will be able to meet the need to form a new traffic system .
The most important three features in the engineering design process will cater to the need to form a new traffic system .
Thirdly , analysing and selecting the solutions will be the next step .
It is the point where we will be selecting the solution which best suits the current situation and perfectly fits to the road of the country .
The solution is then implemented and continuously reviewed .
In the field of information technology , there is a clear boundary between conventionally generated and skunkwork developed technologies .
Specifically , in the operating system  market , there are two well-known examples , the Mac OS developed by Apple and the free open-source Linux OS .
These two OS reflect the obvious difference between the two ways of developing technology in their hardware platform , interface and price .
The first main difference is their hardware platform .
While the Linux OS is simply no more than a software and runs on PC platform machines , the Mac OS is exclusively designed for the Mac platform manufactured by Apple .
Since Apple designs the hardware for Mac , it makes the operating system perfectly compatible with the machine .
That is one of the reasons why Mac OS has always been praised by art designers for its smooth performance and high definition graphics .
Meanwhile , Linux , coded in the skunkwork environment , does not have that much funds and ability to compare with Mac at that perspective .
However , Linux has its own advantage .
The second difference between Mac and Linux lies in their structure .
As an open source operating system , Linux' users are free to explore and modify the systems .
Mac users , on the other hand , are restricted from the entering system files .
This makes the Linux OS more preferable among computer programmers and others who work in the field of information technology .
According to Forbes , Linux is currently the most popular operating system for supercomputers .
It is agreed by programmers from largest IT corporations such as IBM and Sun Microsystems that Linux is so far the most suitable environment for high-performance computing .
Finally , there is the problem of security .
This is what Mac and Linux have in common .
Despite their different structures and platform , the two operating systems are quite secured .
By not allowing modification of system files , a third party cannot hack into a Mac .
As for Linux , open-source only means users can read its source file .
With its secured configuration , it is still extremely hard to penetrate a Linux server .
On the other hand , the sociology aspect has to be considered as well .
Being a skunkwork project , Linux sure has the advantage of price .
It is actually the only free operating system available .
However , this does not guarantee its popularity .
Its high requirement of computing knowledge makes Linux not popular among average computer users .
Mac , on the opposite , was designed for an entertainment and easy-to-use purpose .
Apple is also very efficient at advertising their product worldwide , so even when Mac and its software are much more expensive than for a normal OS , it is still one of the most wanted .
Furthermore , with the forth coming price drop , Mac is expected to be the operating system of choice for education and business .
It is not possible to define whether the conventionally generated OS or the skunkwork developed one is better .
However , each technology has its own pros and cons .
Therefore , the choice should be made based on the user's needs .
If it is a computer for an IT engineer , the choice would be Linux .
Oppositely , if the purpose is mainly for entertainment or paperwork , Mac would be the option .
Berman  defines a hybrid car as one that encompasses an electric motor together with a conventional gasoline engine , with a computer controlling the interaction between the two .
They use fuel cells that convert hydrogen to electricity , which is then stored in batteries and is used to assist in the power surge required when climbing a slope or overtaking .
But why do we need hybrid cars when we have cars that run just as well on gasoline ?
Gasoline cars are already an integral part of our economy and lifestyle , providing us with mobility and personal freedom .
However , research shows that the world is fast approaches two billion cars  , and this poses a problem in the form of environmental pollution as well as causing adverse effects of our economy .
Besides the environmental factors , cars can affect our economy negatively .
With the depletion of natural resources , funds have to be diverted into researching a cheaper alternative to gasoline as a fuel .
Cars drain our Earth's natural resources , thus inciting political skirmishes over oil , and overwhelming the roads of today's cities  .
Countries with few natural resources have to spend increasing amounts of money to import gasoline and other crude oils for these cars .
According to research on gasoline prices  , the price of a gallon of gasoline was about US$150 in 2000 .
By the end of 2009 , the price for a gallon is expected to increase to about US$250 .
Once again the solution presents itself in the form of hybrid cars that run more on electricity that can be harnessed from the sun or produced in man-made power stations and cost less than gasoline .
While the damage done by our continued reliance on cars and gasoline is severe , it is still not too late to do anything about it .
In order to prevent more serious economic and environmental damage , dramatic reductions in oil use and carbon emissions have to be made within the next decade .
Policy makers and carmakers need to change the vehicles they design and the energy and transport systems they are embedded in .
Relying on hybrid cars might just be one of the most feasible solutions we can look at to save our planet .
When a new virus or bacteria is introduced and the human population has no immunity , a pandemic will occur , causing widespread mortality .
In each century , influenza pandemics have occurred around 3 times , when a new strain of the influenza virus caused simultaneous deaths worldwide  .
Therefore , it is crucial to come up with solutions to prevent the spread of diseases .
For example , Penicillin , which was discovered serendipitously , helps to prevent one from getting bacterial diseases .
Furthermore , during the recent outbreak of the Swine flu , Tamiflu has been developed to treat it .
Comparing Tamiflu with Penicillin , although they work differently on different micro-organisms , both of them do benefit to the human population .
Most species of bacteria have a rigid cell wall , which prevents them from bursting when they are placed in solutions of low salt concentration as compared to the cell .
Penicillin inhibits the formation of cell wall , which is essential for the survival of bacteria , and thus kills them off .
However , the viruses do not have cell walls and thus Penicillin has no effect on them .
In contrast , Tamiflu works well on the influenza viruses .
An influenza virus is able to infect a host cell due to the presence of neuraminidase .
With Tamiflu , which is also known as neuraminidase inhibitors , neuraminidase is inhibited and thus the virus is unable to exit the host cell and dies  .
Moreover , the virus is also unable to spread and infect other cells in the body .
Due to the distinct difference in the structures of virus and bacteria , Tamiflu and Penicillin perform differently on them .
Ever since the introduction of Penicillin , deaths from infectious diseases are very rare .
Nowadays , majority of the people die from circulatory diseases and respiratory diseases  .
Penicillin benefits greatly as it has the ability to cure people suffering from once-fatal bacterial diseases .
Similarly , Tamiflu is also proven to be effective in the treatment and for the prevention of influenza in adults and in children .
Roche announced that two new observational studies had shown that influenza patients treated with Tamiflu had significantly higher survival rates than untreated patients and the analyzed outcomes targeted on two different groups -adults and children diagnosed with the highly pathogenic A  avian influenza and adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza  .
The human population has indeed benefited from both Penicillin and Tamiflu as the survival rates from bacterial diseases and influenza viruses have increased ever since they are introduced .
Regardless of whether the technology is developed via research or discovered serendipitously , they have significant contributions to mankind .
New discoveries and creations are essential for the progress of mankind .
For instance , there is always a need for new and better anti-flu drugs as virus gets mutated very easily and will soon acquire resistance to Tamiflu .
Resistance to Tamiflu has been detected in a patient in Singapore who was down with the pandemic Influenza A  bug and similar cases have also emerged in Hong Kong , China , Japan , Canada , the United States and Denmark  .
Who knows , may be in a few years time , the real cure for influenza virus will be discovered serendipitously and till that day , influenza virus will no longer be a threat to us .
A skunkworks is an especially enriched environment that is intended to help a small group of individuals design a new idea by escaping routine organizational procedures  .
The 5th most influential man of this century and president of Apple Computer , Steve Jobs , created one of the most famous and successful skunkworks .
The fruit of this skunkworks is the popular Macintosh computer , which is in great demand worldwide till date .
According to Macworld , the iMac , i .e .
desktop version of the Macintosh computer , has become the biggest-selling personal computer of all time within three years of its launch  .
In fact , Apple is the number one computer company in both Australia and Japan .
Obviously , there must be a reason behind the popularity of the Macintosh computer as compared to a conventionally generated innovation such as the Sony personal computer .
It would be most appropriate to explain this phenomenon from comparing the key features of the two different types .
The first key feature is the vision of a skunkworks as compared to the conventional way .
In order to appeal to the consumers , the idea or innovation created must be modern , creative , and refreshing as customers are always on a look out for new and up-to-date technology products .
Therefore , it is important for engineers to think ahead , speculate the upcoming problems and expectations of the consumers , and provide practical solutions .
For instant , the engineers of the Macbook Pro , i .e .
laptop version of the Macintosh computer , knew that the consumers were looking for a laptop that has a longer battery life .
As a result , they came up with a built-in battery life of 7 hours and did so without increasing the size of the laptop  .
Furthermore , the sleek design of the Macbook Pro satisfies the need for a trendy laptop .
Although the Macbook Pro is not created in a skunkworks , the engineers responsible for the Macbook Pro have similar vision of a skunkworks , that is to look ahead , and provide feasible solutions and ideas in advance .
In contrast , the Sony VAIO AR , a laptop for Sony that is created in a conventional environment , has a battery life of 2 .5 hours only hence it is not as popular as the Macbook Pro .
Thus , it is safe to say that the vision of a skunkworks ensures that the products have the ability to satisfy the needs of the consumers for the time being and also in the near future .
Also , the next key feature would be the working conditions of a skunkworks as compared to a conventional environment .
About fifty highly dedicated young computer designers worked day and night at a secret lab that was located behind the Good Earth Restaurant in Cupertino  .
The young computer designers did not require any permission or papers to go ahead with the procedures .
All of them were committed and goal-orientated .
With the leadership skills from Steve Jobs and resources provided to the skunkworks , the Macintosh computer was introduced in 1984 .
It only took 4 years for the skunkworks project to be completed .
Therefore , the skunkworks was hugely credited for its success .
However , in a conventional environment , there were restrictions and standard procedures to follow closely .
This will cause distractions and time wastage during the course of production .
On the whole , a skunkworks generated product would have a higher chance for consumers to adopt and accept as compared to a conventionally generated product due to the unique features of a skunkworks .
In addition , there could be an increase in the number of companies that opt for a skunkworks .
The serendipitously discovered technology is the smog-eating cement while the technology found via research is the carbon-dioxide eating cement .
The two technologies vary in many aspects .
One such aspect is the support that these technologies receive among people .
In the case of the smog eating cement , the technology received some negative feedback due to its serendipitous background .
Thomas Cahill who is an atmospheric scientist at the University Of California , Davis , criticized that the final outcome of this discovery is uncertain .
He also said that the advantages of this technology are only applicable in some situations  .
This shows that people question the validity of the serendipitously discovered technologies .
This is because these technologies are invented accidentally , in other words , by luck .
Majority of people look at serendipitous discovery with distrust as the technology was not invented via research .
Technology discovered through research is the norm and serendipitous discovery deviate from the norm .
Most people think that serendipitous discovery was not well analyzed and hence the inventors might not know the side effects that the technology might cause in future .
However , the case is different for the carbon-dioxide eating cement .
It was positively accepted by most people .
In fact , this technology was accepted by cement industries and environmentalists CITATION Alo09 \l 1033  .This clearly illustrates that a well researched technology gathers more support as it is perceived that a technology that has solid proof  have lesser unexpected outcomes in future , compared to a serendipitously discovered invention .
However , there are similarities between the two technologies .
Both the technology aims to improve the quality of air .
Basically , both try to reduce air pollution .
Furthermore , Howard Liljestrand  mentioned that the "cost-efficiency" of both the technologies lies on how the technologies work in the future  .
Hence , both technologies aim to improve air quality and have their own limitations on their performance in future .
To sum it all , a well researched technology receives a lot more support among people than a serendipitously discovered technology .
Furthermore , it also has a wider range of funding partners than the serendipitous discovery .
Although they differ in some aspects , they are similar in their goal: To improve the air quality .
In my opinion , serendipitously discovered technology faces problem when it comes to gathering support and marketing while a well researched technology faces problem during the research and development stage .
Therefore , technologies discovered in both ways face problems in different areas .
There is no advantage whatsoever for either technologies .

Societal structure plays an important role in determining the evolution of a new innovation .
Norms and values from a social system will often heavily influence the technological design process .
This part of the development process is crucial to ensure that the innovation will be readily accepted by society .
The online video sharing website , Youtube , for example managed to grasp this concept and gained immense popularity within six months , hitting a peak 4000 from 200 daily page views per million in May .
Youtube founders targeted the problems that most people faced; difficulty in sharing videos online and came out with many innovative solutions .
This resulted in a platform that enables web surfers to upload and play their videos online easily .
Being community-oriented , quickly catapults it to become the most popular video sharing site on the net .
Many N-generation web users also regard entertainment quality and media accessibility highly .
They access many other internet websites and are adept at using a wide variety of internet media devices .
This prompts Youtube to improve their content accessibility by designing its website to synchronise and be able to be viewed on other web surfing platforms such as the iphone , Apple TV  , PS3 and , Nintendo Wii game consoles  .
Besides that , Youtube also implemented a function to embed their video in social networking websites such as facebook and blogs to allow for better accessibility to their media  .
Furthermore , Youtube offers "high definition" video playback in which videos are shown at a higher resolution and superior sound to cater to high entertainment quality demands where enjoyment takes priority . .
Greater accessibility unfortunately , also has a downside to it .
Since anyone can upload any video on to Youtube and allow anyone on Youtube to view it , many uploaded videos containing inappropriate content were easily accessible to minors .
For many societies , this is especially intolerable since it will violate their moral standing , conservative culture , religion and law .
Consequently , Youtube was faced with much criticism from the web community but it dealt with this problem promptly via introducing its content censorship policy .
Firstly , its terms of service forbid the uploading of offensive materials .
Secondly , adult web users are required to log in to verify their identity to view content classified as inappropriate for minors .
Lastly , it also relies on users to flag videos containing inappropriate content online which will activate a 24 hour review team to deal with it  .
The three prong approach effectively clams down any users that try to violate the rules .
There is also another problem which stems from importance of copyright in society .
The exclusive right granted to its original author to be credited for his work is valued to the extend it became a law in many society .
However , A huge amount of videos posted online consisting of television shows , music videos , movies and animes that were without the permission of their creators .
This entangled Youtube in a series of pressing legal lawsuits from major media companies such as Viacom , Mediaset and EPL in an effort to protect their copyright material  .
Subsequently , this forced Youtube to introduce its "Video ID" system which will check uploaded videos with a database of copyrighted material and denial any uploading if it finds a match  .
In summary , Youtube has managed to attain its dominant position on the net due to its ability to conform to the taste of its mainstream community web users while at the same time adhering to legal regulations .
It is also intensively consumer focused and very flexible , able to adapting to the needs and demands of internet users quickly .
In addition , regular novel upgrades to its website continue to entice more webs surfers as well as generating more internet traffic to their website .
More advertising sponsors will be attracted to employ their services , and hence , sustain YouTube's continual success .
Youtube has grown so much that it became part of many people's media entertainment and web surfing experience .
With its huge influence on the cyber community , it might even become a platform which in turn will help shape our society in the future .
In reality , there are many problems faced by researchers when they are developing innovations .
These problems may occur at various stages of the innovation process  .
In this essay , we will discuss an innovation of a Bluetooth communication system for cyclists and one of the problems that the Bluetooth innovation faces and the impacts the problem has on certain stages of the process .
This Bluetooth communication system  encounters the challenge of a lack of market demand which affects its likelihood of the commercialization process occurring which is being launch into the market .
There are many sub-factors that cause the shortage of market demand .
First , it is the usefulness of bike bug to cyclists .
Although , the number of cyclists who ride in large groups has risen over the years , number of official members of "joyriders" stand at 120 in May 2007  , compared to Singapore population of 4 .84 million people in June 2008  , the number of cyclists that cycle in groups are insignificant .
Therefore , this indicates that the demand is low as cyclists who travel alone , in pairs , or in small groups and those people who do not cycle do not require and have the need for bike bug .
Second , it is the design of the bike bug .
The structure of the bike bug's earpiece does not look capable of fitting snuggly to the cyclist's ear .
Therefore , there is the possibility of the cyclist incurring extra cost to replace the lost earpiece , especially after the earpiece is drenched by the cyclist's perspiration .
The extra replacement cost is incurred because if the cyclist speeds , the moist earpiece with minimal grip is likely to drop off .
Third , it is the bike bug level of acceptance to consumers .
Although , hands-free and Bluetooth devices for headsets are in abundance in the current market , its sales record is not so promising as compared to other Bluetooth gadgets for mobile phone , cars  , and computers .
Even though 33 million of Bluetooth headsets were shipped in 2005 and the figure is expected to increase to over 55 million in 2006 , compared to the world population of 6 ,808 ,515 ,373 people  , people who use Bluetooth headsets are considered the minority .
This denotes that Bluetooth headsets are still not used by the majority .
Hence , as bike bug is a Bluetooth headset gadget , I predict a not so bright future for its sales record .
With this two sub-factors plus the slow acceptance of Bluetooth headset compared to other Bluetooth devices , potential manufacturers of bike bug is deterred as it is not economic practical to mass produce bike bug .
It is therefore shown that for bike bug to be successfully launch into society , much is needed to raise bike bug popularity among the public .
Conventionally generated technology and technology created in a skunkworks environment are methods of technology development which lead to the invention of innovations .
However , the processes that are taken through for developing an invention are different .
There will be two illustrations provided to compare on their development differences .
One would be on Compaq laptop computer; another would be on Toshiba laptop computer .
Another difference is how Compaq and Mizoguchi solved their problems .
Compaq thought of an ingenious way to develop its very own BIOS System  .
18 engineers examined IBM's BIOS system and figured the development their own by reverse engineering .
The engineers were divided into 2 groups one group on analyzing the original codes , another on making notes on how it exactly functioned .
The latter group then wrote their own BIOS which functioned similarly to IBM without risking themselves from a lawsuit with IBM .
On the contrary , Mizoguchi had a different set of problems .
He had to develop his laptop computer by going 'underground' in the Toshiba's Ome factory  .
He channelled funds secretly and shifted 10 engineers from a military project to work on the laptop computer .
The development process was so stressful that the engineers had to make a prototype whereby the components were tightly packed in it .
Eventually , both Compaq and Mizoguchi had successfully built up the laptop computer and generated good sales results .
In spite of these differences , both Compaq and Toshiba flourished in the laptop computer market with innovations that were laboriously created .
In 1983 , more than 53 ,000 units of Compaq laptop computers were sold  .
In 1986 , Toshiba made tremendous sales of ten thousand units within fourteen months  . .
Though Compaq and Toshiba took different approaches in developing laptop computers , they had the same motive of creating great laptop computers and took part of the big pie in the market .
We are living in the flourishing era of telecommunication with hundreds of mobile phone brands all over the world .
However , Research In Motion Limited , or RIM - a Canadian wireless device company founded in 1984 - , with its smartphones BlackBerry , is still one of the most successful brands in the market with the revenue of US$ 11 .065 billion in Fiscal 2009  .
The achievement of BlackBerry is an example of how social construction has led to the triumph of a technology .
Initially , BlackBerry smartphones were introduced for occupied executive , politicians and lawyers  .
Therefore , the emphasized function of the smartphones at that time was to receive and send emails .
Consequently , BlackBerry Enterprise Server  was also released to help the businessmen keep track of their works and keep in touch with their employees .
As the demand of so-called normal users increased , RIM had to evolve .
In fact , according to Dabrowski , the majority of subscribers in the three months ended February 29th was "non-enterprise" users  .
BlackBerry smartphones were made to become more accessible to the users by increasing the memory and embedding entertaining features such as music player , integrated camera , and 65 ,000-color display instead of monochrome display .
The remarkable launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007 was predicted to outdo the success of BlackBerry smartphones in the market .
Nevertheless , "despite the popularity of Apple's best-selling device , RIM still tops the league of smart phone sales"  .
Each group of users had different purposes of using the mobile phones .
The majority of iPhone users were young adults who were fascinated by the appealing appearance and entertaining features of iPhone .
On the contrary , BlackBerry users were into the phone for its outstanding support for working environment together with acceptable features for relaxation .
However , the launch of iPhone "was a boon for RIM as the touchscreen handset raised the public's awareness"  .
In 2008 , RIM introduced Storm , its first touchscreen device instead of a physical keyboard .
The release of Storm marked a milestone of RIM when it gave up its well-known QWERTY keyboard to give way for a new trend .
Sarcastically , BlackBerry Storm did not yield the expected outcome .
Its SurePress touchscreen was a hindrance to fast typing .
It seemed that RIM realized its failure in providing the users with a convenient experience using the touchscreen device .
The latter BlackBerry smartphones were equipped with fully-support QWERTY keyboard , a preferable feature by BlackBerry users .
"Perhaps RIM's success continues to be a surprise because it appears to defy the prevailing model for which companies thrive and which companies fail in personal technology" , "but RIM is an example of how smart engineering and a keen understanding of customers can allow a small company to survive in the shadow of better-financed giants"  .
In other words , RIM has defied all odds and survived due to its understanding of the needs of its users , the risks from its enemies , and other social factors that could shape the success of an innovation .
In recent years , many new technologies which make use of high temperature to produce moderately hard outer coatings for materials have been developed .
It's part of the effort to reduce production cost , improve the durability and increase the forms of applications .
Most of these developments have to go through intensive research with technologies while a minor portion resulted due to serendipitous discovery .
In August 2009 , United States most renowned non-profit organization on applied research and development , Southwest Research Institute  is awarded the 2009 R&D 100 Award for developing a Plasma Enhanced Magnetron Sputter  technology that is particularly meant for coating ,  .
On the other hand , largest independent research university in the state of Ohio , Case Western Reserve University  developed a technology for new applications in packaging via accidental discovery , .
Although both technologies are based on the coating of material , the purpose , the methodologies and the final applications for the both developments are different .
Firstly in the case of SwRI , the main objective  of the development is to produce enhanced exterior coating for electronic components that has to withstand high level of wear and tear .
Some examples on the form of deterioration can be caused by  over exposure to strong sunlight , corrosion by polluted vapour and severe collision with firm particles .
Therefore SwRI wants to develop a technology that can fabricate extremely robust , impermeable and durable coatings .
On the other hand , CWRU wants to develop  a packaging technology to maintain the freshness of consumable product .
In order to do so , there is a need to boost the exterior packaging of a material so that the material is able to prevent destructive gases from passing through it and at the same time minimize the use of the material during production .
Next on methodology , SwRI adapts their  PEMS technology to produce an exceptionally strong and solid nanocomposite covering for the components .
This technology uses global plasma to eliminate unwanted deposits before performing the coating process .
In addition the use of high ion flux allows the layer of covering to be held onto the material more firmly .
Combining this technology  with nitride-based nanocomposite coating , SwRI is able to produce an even tougher coating than by a single-phase coating .
In contrast , CWRU discovered its technology by means of serendipitous finding , the group realized that  polyethylene oxide  crystallizes as a single layer is able to produce extraordinarily gigantic and impermeable single crystals .
This discovery allows the group to minimize the amount of raw material used tremendously and at the same time reduce the passing of particles by more than 100 times ,  .
Lastly , the application for SwRI technology includes  aero-engine components , land-based turbine blades , helicopter rotor blades , military weaponry components , oil and gas productions .
Having a wide range of applications , namely apply outer coating for different kinds of engines from all fields which includes food industry whereas for CWRU's technology , the applications are still quite limited to the packaging of items like  food , medicine and electronic parts .
On the whole , it is not important whether a technology is discovered via research or by serendipity discovery and given a similar technology it is not necessary for them to have similar objectives , applications and methodologies .
This is because the most important issue is that both the technologies are able to improvise the outer layer of materials , making them more durable and long lasting .
For example like the wings of the airplane , with the help of the new discovery they are now more resistible to the air pressure and strong air resistances .
Hence both the developments can be considered big contributions to the world technology .
Robotics technology plays a significant role in the military forces of modern era .
Many nations , especially the United States , are increasingly focusing their research on the field of robotics today for military purposes during war time .
Their research focus is attributable to the change in today's war strategy and tactics where the enemy is no longer easily noticeable in the open as easy targets , as Randall Steeb , senior scientist at Rand Corporation , points out  .
As a result , an important technology called the Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot  was invented in 2006 and the invention was caused by a growing demand for robots to perform more perilous tasks in place of the soldiers , particularly in the areas of search-and-rescue and hazardous materials handling  .
First , search-and-rescue is a crucial mission that is better performed by robots than the combat medics during times of war .
One of the reasons is the way military robots are built and configured .
For example , robots such as BEAR are built to be more robust than a human being to carry wounded soldiers over long distances and are configured to be capable of overcoming obstacles such as stairs or rough bumpy grounds during the rescue  .
Another reason is that it reduces the risk of losing a human's life .
For instance , in situations where robots are not used , wounded soldiers will have to depend on their medics to search for them .
During the search , the movement of the medics might draw the enemy's attention and trigger them to attack .
On the other hand , if the robots are used and they are attacked by the enemy , the military team can just simply deploy new robots at strategic locations where the robots can avoid any chance of encountering the enemy .
Another impetus for the innovation is the ability of the robots to handle hazardous materials .
Due to the unpredictable environment of the battlefield , dangerous materials such as hidden explosives can be planted at any point by the enemy .
As such , the robots are needed by the military to help detect and locate the positions of the hidden explosive devices and then defuse them before they explode .
Robots of such configuration like BEAR have also become a part of the U .S . military operations .
Over the recent years , for example , robots with such capabilities have been greatly used by the United States to disable numerous bombs in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan  .
And as a result of their successes , there is an increase in the demand of bomb-defusing robots .
On the whole , changing demands of war strategy today has led to the increase in the research and development of more advanced and sophisticated technological innovations such as BEAR to perform search-and-rescue in place of the combat medics and to handle and remove dangerous explosives and other hazardous materials hidden on the battlefield .
In the years to come , the world can expect to see the use of the advanced military robots to be an integral part of every nation's military force .
The usage of miniature UAVs in the military are common today with the Lockheed Martin and Aerovironment being the two main competitors .
The Lockheed Martin  has been proactive with skunkwork invention ever since WWII pioneered by L .Kelly Johnson .
On the other hand , the Aerovironment adopt conventional process for invention .
Recent years have shown that the Desert Hawk created under the skunkwork environment has not been performing as well as the Raven made by the Aerovironment .
Lockheed Martin and Aerovironment both built the UAV based on the similar roles and functions for military use .
The primary role is to provide day and night low altitude reconnaissance to provide early warning for any potential threat  .
The secondary role of the UAV is to provide target acquisition for the manned aircraft to minimise the chance of any danger to the pilot .
The UAV are designed to be easily operated and lightweight for the ease of operating it from almost all terrains and conditions .
Apart from the similar roles , the Aerovironment is able to stand out with their functions .
As the UAV are to operate on all terrain , conventional landing method was not used .
However , both UAV has adopted two different ways to land .
The Desert Hawk was design for crush landing  .
This was not very popular among the user as it will affect the durability of the machines .
On contrast , the Raven make use of the advance programming to aid landing by making the UAV to experience deep stalling mode  to greatly reduce speed and impact for landing .
This function helps the user to reduce cost on maintenance .
Both UAVs are able to operate where the user will plot the route prior to the flight via GPS system installed in it .
The Desert Hawk is only able to operate in this mode  .
Whenever a change the route during flight , it require some amount of time before the pre-allocated waypoint can be reset .
The Raven was able to switch between two modes of operation such that the second mode allows user to operate the UAV manually  .
The Raven is able to provide the flexibility in the mode of operation .
The price of the Raven system was also lower than the Desert Hawk system by $50 ,000 even though both UAVs share the same roles and similar function .
The Raven is now operated by eight military forces around world and still increasing .
While the Desert Hawk is the only user still operating the UAV .
With the rich history of the Lockheed Martin's skunkwork environment , everyone would expect them to be above or at least on par with their competitors .
In this example , it was proved that the conventional process of innovation won the competition .
With all the improvement and continuous development , it make the future generation of UAV to be better than what we have today .
Technology has been evolving fast throughout last 50 years .
New products are invented every day .
In fact , these technologies may be categorized into two typesconventional and skunkworks .
One example would be Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop .
Mac laptop was created by Apple in a conventional way whereas Toshiba laptop , the first laptop in the world , was produced in a skunkworks environment .
We may evaluate both of them by investigating their designs , durability , and portability .
As laptop is created for the convenience of the customers , both Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop are similar in their portability .
Being the first laptop producer , Toshiba was successful in turning the idea of portable computer into reality .
The smallest laptop it produced , Toshiba's Libretto U100-S213 , has only the size of 21 .0 x 3 .33 x16 .51 cm and weight of 2 .2 pounds .
Obviously , it is much more portable than many of the other laptops .
On the other hand , Apple has also release its highly portable laptop called Macbook Pro which is the thinnest 17-inch laptop in the world .
Since it has the smallest thickness , its weight is also very small .
Hence , we can see that both Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop are similar in their portability .
However , in spite of being highly portable , Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop have significant differences in their designs and durability .
Apple aimed to make Mac its own unique laptop .
As a result , the corporation spent a lot of time in designing Mac laptop .
Mac laptop is designed to be beautiful in its appearance and advanced in its operating system and software .
Its fashioned design has brought it many customers , especially the young people .
According to a Student Monitor survey conducted in US in 2009 , 43 percent of the university undergraduates in US preferred to buy Mac laptops .
While Apple works hard to ensure that Mac laptop has the most gorgeous design , Toshiba focuses more on the performance instead of the design of the laptop .
Despite the change in size , Toshiba put little effort in changing the appearance of the laptop .
There is no dramatic change in the design of Toshiba laptop over the last 20 years .
Besides , the two brands of laptop also differ in their durability .
Since the lifespan of the laptop might be difficult to measure , we investigate the durability of their batteries .
The battery is the most significant device of a laptop .
Computer engineers always endeavor to enhance the quality of the laptop batteries in order to enable the laptop to work longer without plugging in A/C supplier .
The latest Macbook Pro has achieved the maximum working time of 8 hours on a single charge .
In order to achieve this , Mac has adopted two innovations , which are bigger battery pack of lithium-ion cells as well as adaptive charging .
The battery pack in Macbook Pro occupies the space of the removable battery and obtains a 40 percent more capacitance .
In addition , adaptive charging reduces the wear and tear on the battery and gives it a much longer lifespan .
In contrast , although Toshiba also adopted lithium-ion cell battery pack in its laptop , the longest battery life was measured to be 5 .1 hours , which is much shorter than Macbook Pro .
Therefore , in terms of design and battery durability , Mac laptop has a better performance than Toshiba laptop .
On the whole , there are quite a number of similarities and differences between a conventional technology and a skunkworks technology , just like Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop .
Although Mac laptop seems to have a bigger market , Toshiba never stops innovating new type of laptop .
In addition , without Toshiba , we may not see Mac laptop today .
It is hard to conclude which technology is betterconventional or skunkworks .
They both have their advantages and disadvantages .
As long as the importance of the innovation is highlighted , the development of the technology would be bright .
Before the first laptop was developed , Japanese computer users find it hard to work .
This is mainly due to the lack of space for a desktop computer .
Furthermore , most of the Japanese do not have a computer at home .
These factors clearly show that there are favorable market conditions for the development of a portable computer in Japan .
Hence , this has driven Tetsuya Mizoguchi to develop a portable computer , despite being rejected by his company , Toshiba  .
He recognized the market potential of the portable computer and continued to develop a portable computer without his company's knowledge .
The laptop could have being developed much earlier , if Toshiba took the risk to develop the portable computer .
During that time , Toshiba has just suffered huge losses with the failure of their latest personal computer  .
Therefore , they are unwilling to take risks , and stick to known methods that work .
If the leaders in Toshiba are willing to take the risk to believe in Mizoguchi's idea , the laptop would have been developed much earlier and will not take 2 years to be developed .
The quality of the laptop would also be much better , as they will have more funds and more talented people to develop the laptop .
After the first laptop was successfully developed , Toshiba still refuses to market the laptop .
Fortunately , the idea of the laptop was not discarded , as it was later marketed aggressively by Toshiba Europe , who felt that the portable computer has great market value  .
It proved the Toshiba Company wrong , as the laptop proved to be a great marketing success , with 10000 units sold in just slightly over one year .
This has resulted in the birth of the laptop , as it started gaining popularity .
The laptop's rising popularity led to the continuation of the laptop , as it was a great marketing success .
This has also led other companies to develop their own laptop; so as to gain a portion of the market share .
With more competition , each company is constantly trying to outdo each other by constantly developing and promoting their latest product .
This trend has stayed on even till today , where we can see many different brands of laptops competing with each other .
The case of the birth of the laptop shows us that a good and feasible idea could be discarded and not be used , if they were not given the opportunity to be developed .
In the case of the laptop , we may not be able to see a laptop today if Mizoguchi did not aggressively pushed on his idea .
This shows that an idea , even if it is workable and has obvious benefits , will not be developed properly without the support required .
Therefore , an innovation will only become a product , if factors such as economic , government support and usability of the product supports the development of the innovation .
In Singapore , there are two problems that many Singapore engineers may face when designing and innovating .
The first problem might be the lack of key qualities like creativity and an open mindset caused by the kind of education system we have and the environment we grew up in , while the second problem might be the aging population in our country , Singapore .
These might well be the two factors hindering local engineers from potentially producing creative innovations .
Firstly , Singapore engineers lack the creativity and it might be due to the kind of education system in Singapore .
The lack of creativity will definitely lead to problems faced by engineers when it comes to innovating new products .
Singapore's education system is more curriculum-based or in other words more book-based .
Even though there are "Art" lessons and "Design & Technical" subjects in secondary schools , it is still not enough to allow students to explore and nurture their creativity and designing abilities .
Modules and Subjects that explore a student's designing talent and abilities are only made available during the later years of their studies .
For example , students can only study these modules during their Polytechnic or University years .
Therefore we can see those students are only encouraged to greater explore and express their creativity during their tertiary years of studies .
I feel that a short 3 to 4 years of tertiary studies is not enough to properly allow students to fully develop their creativity .
This will therefore affect them when they enter the working society as professional engineers .
Without enough creativity , local engineers are bound to face problems in their course of work , which is mainly innovating .
In addition , local engineers are also more "traditional" in terms of their mindset , in other words "kiasi" and kiasu" .
Many local engineers possess this kind of mindset and it is probably because of the environment they grew up in and accustomed to .
We Singaporeans are very well protected and taken care off in our country thus it is only natural that the "kiasi" and "kiasu" characteristics manifest in us .
Due to this mindset problem , local engineers are often not willing to take risks as they are afraid of failures .
Local engineers might be able to think out of the box but they usually dare not venture out of it and apply their ideas to their innovations .
Thus this might affect them in a way that by not trying out new and refreshing ideas , the end product of their innovations would definitely be lackluster and unappealing .
Therefore , with this problem local engineers are bound to face problem while innovating .
Secondly , the aging population in Singapore might have contributed to the problems faced by Singapore engineers .
As we know that the aged in Singapore might not be as tech savvy as the youngsters .
With an aging population , it means that older citizens form a relatively huge percentage of the total population in Singapore thus it also applies to the consumer market .
Many older citizens are unable to keep up with the pace of changes taking place in the current society and are usually slower when it comes to learning and adapting to new technologies and innovations .
Therefore , with this problem in mind , local engineers often face challenges that require them to come up with innovations and create products that not only appeal to the younger generation of Singaporeans but also to cater to the aging population .
In all , the problems mentioned above may potentially hamper local engineers from coming up with good ideas and innovations .
Therefore we might need to first look into the causes of the problems such as the Singaporean's "Kiasi" and "Kiasu" mindset caused by the kind of environment we live in and probably the education system for the younger generations in Singapore .
As is known to all , nowadays  ,science and technology are playing a more and more important part in social society .
We can even say that science and technology have been treasured so much that they are almost treated as a symbol of a country' strength .
Design , therefore , as an important source of more advanced science and technology , is being valued more and more by people and even countries .
As the saying goes , knowledge is wealth , knowledge is power .
In spite of such facts , however , there are still some problems appearing in our country which hamper engineering design processes for innovation .
As a result , in the long run , the problems will make a bad effect on the development of science and technology .
The first problem that hampers engineering design is the old education style .
In China , we attend classes just to remember useful knowledge which can be applied in the exam .
We are always adapting such a teaching pattern that teachers teach and students memorize .
That is to say , teachers never value the importance of training students' thinking ability .
Besides , in the examination , we only solve problems with methods that teachers taught us and almost never think about other methods .
In other words , faced with a problem , we cannot solve it using our own methods .
What is more , teachers also do not pay much attention to practical activities , such as social research and experiment class .
In fact , they just think It a waste of time .
To be a designer or inventor , the most important and also the basic quality is creativity .
Only when scientists have rich experience and various methods can they succeed in their work .
Also , before they can begin to design , they must know about their objectives first .
That is to say , before they design and innovate , they must know what to create first .
During the process , they must know how to design .
But due to the current teaching style , students do not have any aim and ability to create and invent .
The second problem is rules in the protection of inventions .
Since China has been built for less than one decade , it is certain that there are some problems in the laws and rules .
As a matter of fact , China does not realize the importance of laws in protection of invention in stimulating development of science and technology .
As a result of the defect in invention law , the production invented by scientists cannot be protected very well .
Therefore , many scientists may make an invention , only to find that it was stolen by others and their works made no effect .
In such conditions , scientists will be discouraged from inventing to some extend .
Due to the above two problems , Chinese Engineering design was harmed seriously .
To help China make great improvement in science and technology , we must pay attention to design .
In other words , we should create a good environment for design and solve problems that hamper the design process .
It is time for governments to take measures to make improvement in education and laws .
In Singapore there are many constraints which hamper the engineering process for innovations .
As of such , engineers have to resort to new means and ideas when they design a system .
The two main problems are the ageing population and the mindset of Singaporeans .
In the National Day Rally Speech 09 , Prime Minister Lee Hsein Loog mentioned about the rapidly increasing ageing population .
This fact is very true and real .
The birth rate in Singapore is not able to support the uprising ageing population .
The impact of it can be very problematic if not dealt with prudently .
Firstly , the majority of the elderly population are often outdated with the newer technologies , most of them are unable to handle modern gadgets .
As of such , they often resort to using more simplified means such as the telephone .
Secondly , they are resistant to change .
If given the choice to send a letter , they would rather manually write the letter and send it via mail then to send an email .
Because they are technologically impaired , they would prefer to use more traditional methods .
Lastly , an ageing population would mean the special care needs to be directed in order to cater to the needs of them .
Devices must be easy to operate and their welfare must be taken into account .
Following that , the mindset of Singaporeans also plays a big role .
Singaporeans are very money minded .
This is due the kind of society we are brought up in .
Electric Road Pricing , Certificate of Entitlement and housing cost all cultivates us to be money conscious .
In fact Singapore is one of the most expensive place to live in .
Hence Singaporeans are more unwilling to take risks as the cost of failure would be very tough to recover from .
We are reluctant to invest in research and explore new frontiers .
In addition , there is a lack of creativity nowadays .
New products in the market are similar to already existing products .
Take Apple's iTouch for example .
Ever since its release , all the major phone companies such as Nokia , Samung and Sony Ericsson have released their own versions of a touch screen device .
This lack of creativity does not only relates to Singaporeans but it is a global phenomenon .
As of such , these two problems can really hinder the growth of engineers in Singapore .
Engineers have to take into account the feebleness of the elderly and their technological constraints .
Extra care and efforts must be provided to consider the safety and wellbeing of the elderly .
Moreover due to the trend , products must be centered on them rather then youths .
Engineers would also need to open up to more ideas and research .
Although getting their financial support might be a challenge , it is something they have to overcome in order to progress .
Our government does in fact provides some kind of incentives to researchers .
In short , although the ageing population and the mindset of Singaporeans may prove to be a challenge to engineers , it is possible to overcome them .
Engineers must be open to new ideas , adept to their target consumers and be willing to take risks .
The movie star , Paul Newman said , "I never learnt as much in the classroom as I did staring out a window and imagining things ."
Generally , design is a process of an imagination being produced by a human .
How creative or attractive the product is which will depend on the imagination of a designer , regardless of which area a designer focuses on .
However , by producing an innovative product on the market , it is not an easy task to achieve .
Most of the time , it is often hindered by multiple realistic problems .
There are two major problems which hamper engineering design processes for innovation .
The first problem is due to government related issues while the second is related to the environmental issues .
First of all , the government related issues will affect the engineering design process .
This is because an engineering design involves a series of complicated steps such as drafting outline , analysis and problem-solving as well as product implementation and the final testing of the product before being shipped to the market .
Furthermore , the designing process is a long term investment as it may require engineers to spend a lot of time and money in order to come out with an innovative product .
Therefore , the support of the government will lead to a different outcome .
A good government will come out with a clear policy to help its people along the way such that financially support the engineers and to provide sponsor for other organizations to assist in the work of an engineer .
On the other hand , a bad government such as a corrupted government will make the design process come to a standstill .
As a result , it may end up in failure eventually .
However , even if the engineers have received a financial support from the government or other organization , the funding may be limited sometimes due to long term processes which involve problem solving methodology and testing for the innovative design to be carried out .
At the same time , the government and the companies will doubt this engineering design is workable or not if it takes too long to progress .
Therefore , the engineers will come across problems due to insufficient funding and eventually it leads to a standstill .
The second problem that hinders the engineering design is the environmental issues .
Frankly speaking , there are engineers who only care about the profit they are going to make regardless about the effects bring to our environment .
Therefore , they may come out with ideas for their own interest and benefit .
For instance , in Taiwan , the most popular transport is motorbike .
Everyone owns one , especially in Taipei .
In order to meet the demand in the market and to attract more people to buy , different designs for the motorbike are also invented .
However , due to the increase in demand for motorbike , the use of motorbike results in environmental problems such as air pollution and resource depletion of fossil fuel .
Therefore , the fossil-fueled motorbikes are forbidden in some countries .
In conclusion , I do think that a government policy and environmental issues will hinder the engineering design for innovation .
A good government has to come out with a clear policy to benefit for its people together with the concern towards the environment .
Otherwise , most of the engineering design for innovation could be a failure without any success .
There are many different types of engineering discipline in Singapore .
Basically , according to Jonathan Dunder  , there are eight different types of engineering .
There are the architectural , biomedical , civil , computer , electrical , industrial , mechanical and software engineering .
Each serves different engineering industries .
For architectural , it is more related to designing of buildings for commercial , residential and industrial purpose .
As for biomedical , it is the design of devices intended to be used in medicine .
Civil engineering is the focus of structuring design for infrastructure such as bridges and roads .
Electrical engineering is the designing of electronics , software engineering is the designing of software applications that relates to operating system whereas computer engineering is the combination of software and electronic engineering which focuses on both the engineering design .
Industrial engineering is the designing of multiple manufacturing products while lastly is mechanical engineering , which is the oldest of the engineering field , is the designing of the mechanical systems .
There are so many engineering fields .
So what is engineering actually ?
According to Jonathan Dunder  , engineering is the designing , troubleshooting and testing of products that science , mathematics , physics and the technology .
Designing of engineering innovation may takes up to several years of process to see the ideal final output product coming to reality .
Innovation involves three different stages of journey .
There is the creativity , when idea comes to mind , follow by the process where idea is slowly turning to reality by the organization .
Finally is the entrepreneurship process where innovations are punch into the new market .
During these stages of innovation , different problems are faced by the engineers , some problems are significant enough that may lead to the closing of innovation .
Problems do occur in Singapore during each and every innovating design by the engineers .
Here , two of the major problems faced shall be discussed .
Engineers are needed in the entire process of every innovation to plan , troubleshoot , build and install the equipments in order to make the innovation a successful one .
Experienced engineers are needed in the organization to speed up with the innovation process .
So here , in Singapore , the first major problem faced in the innovation designing process is the high salaries by the senior , experienced engineers and the freshly graduate engineers from the ITEs , Polytechnics as well as the Universities .
According to jobstreet .com , a statistics report done by 3 .5 million members in terms of the numbers of years working experiences in the engineering world shows that the longer the experiences , the higher the qualification , the higher will be the monthly wages .
As the ageing-population in Singapore over the couples of decades will increase tremendously , as well as only 40-45% of graduates in ITEs , Polytechnics and Universities are trained in some form of engineering ) , organizations in Singapore , in order to proceed with their innovations , they have no choice but to turn their way to the more senior and experienced engineers .
This will in fact slow down the process of innovation as the organizations in Singapore have to think of ways to increase their innovation budgets to pay the engineers .
In conclusion , it is not an easy process for an innovation to be out in the market .
Not only is Singapore , organizations in other countries too met with many significant difficulties during their innovation designing process .
But there too are a couple of successful innovations being done by organizations in Singapore such as Creative Technology .
Now the credit cards are very popular in the world .
For example the circulation of credit cards in China jumps from 3 million in 2003 through 50 million in 2006 to 122 million in 2008  .
We can see the increasing speed is very fast .
However , before 1920s none knew what the credit card was .
How is the magical card created ?
Which factors lead to its production ?
I think there are three factors which contribute to the production of credit card .
Firstly , from the technical perspective , the invention of magnetic stripe card technology makes it possible that credit card itself can record data of receipts and disbursements .
Moreover , computer technology and network technology broaden the range of credit card's service and make a strong link between the card and our daily life .
Secondly , from an economical perspective , it can be summarized in two points: one is the consumption concept implied in the credit card that consumption before payment .
The most important character of credit card is overdraft .
It means even though one does not have money at hand , he still possesses the ability of payment .
So the credit card can solve the instant shortage of money .
Also it to some extent increases the value of goods .
For example , one has to spend twenty days on saving money and then before he affords to buy a nice coat .
But if one has a credit card , everything remains same except that he gets the nice coat twenty days earlier .
So one earns the extra twenty-day usage of the coat thanks to the credit card .
This function of the credit card stimulates people's consumption desire .
So many countries encourage releasing credit cards to stimulate domestic demand and promote economic development .
The other point is that the credit card saves a lot of manpower and material resources .
With globalization going on , more people travel around the world and money circulates more quickly .
The credit card adopts the electronic fund transfer , which reduces banks transferring a large amount of cash from one place to another .
It does save a lot of work .
Thirdly , from a social perspective , credit card brings a lot of convenience to our life .
There are several simple methods of payment by using credit card such as punching the card on POS machine and RFID machine , network payment and telephone payment .
No matter when and where it is , one can get money by credit card instead of carrying a lot of cash .
This character of credit card makes it adapt to the pace of modern life .
China is a developing country .
On her way to be more modern , one of the key points is to improve engineering design ability .
However , in china , there are still some problems humping the developing of engineering designs .
From my point of view , two of the main problems are on the government system and people's minds .
Besides the problems in governmental system , some social conventional concepts can also obstruct the improving of engineering designs .
Many have got used to the old things .
They just want to do the same things every day .
They are afraid that they cannot control changes in their daily life .
These people may never think about inventing new techniques .
Moreover , they may also block other persons' way to innovate , because they think the men are showing off or have bad effects on their lives .
This concept have negative influences , on one hand people do not want to do new engineering designs and discourage others to do so .
On the other hand , even though there are new techniques which can make a difference , people do not want to use it .
As a result seldom designs can be applied into practice .
Inventors become less and less .
The two problems mentioned above are serious in China .
They have bad effects on the developing of engineering techniques in China .
However , as the world becomes more competitive and "smaller" , government and public have realized the importance of sane policy and innovation .
I believe in the near future we can do much better .
From the research , the World Health Organization assumes that about 80% of all disabled people worldwide live in developing countries .
It is also estimated that there are 600 million disabled people in the worldwide , which is about 10% of the world population .
Among these disabled people , 1987 data from the World Health Organization estimate that 27-35 million people are blind in the world , of which about 20% in Africa and 65% live in Asia .
Moreover , 14-17 million people have serious visual damage .
The amount of blind is rising , first because of rapid increase in population size in developing countries; and second despite of increased longevity , as ageing is concerned with visual loss from cataract , glaucoma and macular degeneration .
That is why it is hard to make prediction in future numbers of blind because of unknown quantity in population growth .
Hence , the first solution is to invent and innovate equipments that help combat with blindness .
Building eyes treatment center is another way to reduce blindness .
The last thing that cannot be left out is giving proper jobs and appropriate training for blind people .
Secondly , building eyes treatment center where patients can get treatment and buy the optical equipment .
Additionally , an attempt will be made to work with private initiators in order to build treatment center which is run only by people who are blind and have visually damage .
Since , having the special treatment for blind and visually damage people is a once- only expense , but it is very expensive .
So to finance these expenses , we have to set up community services activities such as fund raising .
In conclusion , blind people should also have same opportunities as everyone else which means to get a freedom from extreme limitation , to accomplish and to be able to having confidence .
So that other people must give respect to them .
Moreover , their passions are same as others .
They too have same dreams and assurance that they can reach their target .
If blind people get the same chance as sighted people , they surely can achieve the same quality of life .

According to AutoCar Magazine  in China , there are about 2600 new gasoline cars on the road everyday in Beijing , Shanghai , Tianjin and Guangzhou .
The rapid increase of number of cars exhausts more carbon dioxide which is actually worsening the Green House effect .
People really need some innovation to solve this problem and save our earth .
Although countries like the US have already spent more than 10 years to do research and development on electric cars  , however , there are still two main problems that significantly affect its growth in the market of china .
In conclusion , government support and bad influence of the environment are two main reasons that restrict the development of electric cars .
For making use of the electric cars in our daily life , the engineers still have a long way to go .
According to a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit , Japan is the most innovative nation in the world , followed by Switzerland , the US and Sweden .
Over the last decade , Japan has created many new technologies and creative innovation in different fields such electronic industry , transportation and nanotechnology .
However , there is not much innovation and invention in my home country , Malaysia .
The proudest innovation might be the creation of our own car , PROTON , which was created quite a long time ago .
In my opinion , I think there are two main problems that hamper innovation process in Malaysia .
The first problem is lack of appropriate source of finance and the second problem would be the mindset of Malaysian .
In year 2003 , Malaysian Science and Technology Information Centre  has conducted national surveys of innovation and discovered that , in Malaysia , there are about 800 innovating companies .
However , 90% of them are self-funding companies .
Hence , lack of financing resources has became the major problem for them .
Obviously , they need help from the government .
Unfortunately , Malaysia is claimed to be a developing country .
Therefore , Malaysia government would concentrate more on agriculture and put most of their budget into it .
This apparently would affect the operation of innovation as financing resources is the biggest concern in an innovation process .
Furthermore , to develop innovation across a nation , mindset of citizen would be a vital part .
Malaysia intermediate past prime minister , Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi  once stated , "The way I see it , the malaise affecting Malaysia that may well jeopardize our way forward is a case of having first world infrastructure and third world mentality ."
This has somehow proven that most of the Malaysians are not improving by all means .
In my opinion , Malaysians prefer to live a relaxing environment instead of an environment that full of challenges .
Besides that , they are not competitive and creative .
This is because they are not taught to think critically since they were young .
Hence , designing and innovation would be a difficult task for them in this moment .
Due to these two problems , some impacts have appeared in the very beginning stage .
Firstly , insufficient funding will lead to a slower pace in the innovating progress .
Innovating companies in Malaysia can hardly create a new technology due to the financing problem .
They do not have the modal to do research even they have a great idea .
Moreover , Malaysians with these kinds of qualities and attitudes also act as an obstacle in the innovation process .
They will just blindly follow the trend .
It is hard to have a new idea pops out from their minds as they will not think out of the box .
In conclusion , the engineering design processes for innovations in Malaysia is still in the very first phase .
Malaysia government should be more concern about these two major problems and solve them adequately .
In my opinion , the problems can be solved if the government thinks of changing the education system .
Besides that , Malaysian should also start to work hard in order to make Malaysia a developed country instead of developing country .
Hence , creating a new gadget in Malaysia would not be a dream; it is just a matter of time and effort .
Over the years , the proportion of elderly  with respect to the whole population in Singapore has increased drastically .
Statistics have shown that over the past decade , the percentage of elderly has risen from 7 .0% in 1999 to 7 .8% in 2004 .
Till last year in 2008 , it has hit the highest proportion of elderly ever seen - A shocking proportion of 8 .7%  .
As seen from these statistics , the needs of the elderly have to be looked into .
To narrow this down , I would like to discuss about the needs of elderly in public transport and some solutions which might help to solve the problem .
As the third option of implementing a fine has already been taken out of my choice , I would like to compare between the first option and the second option .
There are four points of comparisons I would like to discuss .
Option 1 is definitely less costly than option 2 .
In the first option , it requires only 2 - 4 systems in each train station while in the second option , it requires a system in every train carriages for each 'Reserved Seat' .
However , option 1 is less flexible as compared to option 2 .
In the first option , those travelling together with the elderly are not able to enter the same carriage while in the second option , the elderly can be accompanied by their children or grandchildren .
This lack of flexibility leads to the third comparison of safety issues .
As other people are not able to accompany the elderly or those entitled to the 'Reserved Carriage' , they are not taken care of in the carriage .
In case of emergency , there will be a lot of safety issues arising from it .
In the second option , however , the elderly are taken care of by the other commuters even in case of emergency .
The last comparison is the usage of the space .
In option 1 , there will be a lot of standing space wasted in the 'Reserved Carriage' , while in option 2 , it makes full use of the space and no space will be wasted .
As we can see from the above comparisons , option 2 is much better than option 1 except for the costs .
It is more flexible , makes full use of the space around and most importantly , it is safe .
I believe that if the LTA really hope to solve this problem , the cost would not be an issue .
Therefore , option 2 will be a more feasible solution .
In conclusion , whatever schemes or ideas that might be implemented in the future , there will definitely be a lot of discussions and debates regarding it going on .
Forums on the internet will continue talking about it and so will the media .
This issue will never be solved completely unless Singaporeans learn from the culture of Taiwan or Korea for example .
"I saw documentary on CNA and they were showing that the reserved seats in their train remains empty despite the fact that the train was crowded yet no one occupy these seats .
It was mentioned that the Koreans has much respect for the old and also they are more gracious"  .
Singaporeans need to learn how to be more courteous and gracious and care more for the elderly and needy .
The bottom-line is that no matter how many new innovations engineers can invent , they can only reduce such problems but not eliminate them completely .
If you ask me , the one and only way to eliminate this problem depends on us !
In the eastern part of the globe there exists a place called India , renowned for its wide heritage and tourist spots; the country is also famous for one other thing - corruption .
In a country where most of the rural population is below the poverty line , it's not a surprise that corruption exists , however its mere existence has hampered the design process of innovation .
Corruption is everywhere and its not limited to the government alone , but has spread to the greedy private sector as well .
Corruption in India is on a totally different scale , people here don't take money just to do things out of their way but to do their jobs as well !
For example , let us consider a government officer in the housing board development sector , his job is to attest any stamp paper that may come his way for approval , if it were an ideal country he would do his job but this being India , you would probably pay him a handsome amount to just do his job !
As shocking as this might sound , this is nothing but the truth .
Since corruption spreads like wildfire , this practice has ended up in almost every other sector of the government thereby affecting the overall development of the country and its resources .
When a new technology emerges , it first has to go through the government's "tests" .
Basically , it means you have to "satisfy" the higher government officials before your technology can be made available to the public .
Not all can "satisfy" the government , thus some technologies are never made available to the general public , which essentially means it has no chance of becoming an innovation !
These malpractices are one of the reasons for the greedy nature of the private sector as well .
For example , the government demanded a lot of money from the private mobile phone service providers for spectrum allocation during the auction for 3G frequencies .
This hefty price tag has delayed the rolling out of the 3G service in India whilst other countries are moving on to 4G .
Just when you thought corruption is not enough to bring India down , there is another big problem yet to be eradicated - poverty .
About 42% of the population lives below the International poverty line !
This indirectly affects the design process because most new technologies require a lot of takers in the initial stages for it to become a success .
For example , broadband costs in India are still one of the highest in the world , simply because not a lot of people are aware about it and thus not a lot of them want to take it , this forces the ISP  to raise increase the profit margin per person .
Is this because of the lack of IT literacy in India ?
Well , first , the literacy rate needs to improve before we can even start thinking about IT literacy .
The government education system at the primary and secondary level is a total flop , the syllabus is outdated and the curriculum is something of a joke .
India has a long way to go in terms of primary and secondary education although university level education is on par with the international standards .
All in all , poverty and corruption are the weeds in the endless fields of possibilities called India .
Only about five years ago , when people acquired information , they went to libraries or read newspapers .
However , within this short five-year period , there is an utter change in people's response .
The instinct of most people now , when they encountered any problems , is to seek help on Internet .
The first step is always going to any search engine such as "Google" to type in what they want .
According to the survey conducted by Nielsen : 256 million people visited a search engine in December 2006 81% of the global Internet population .
The use of search engines is so ubiquitous today that people often forget the fact that it was commercialized only in recent few years .
This is certainly attributed to the fast advancement of Information Technologies .
Nevertheless , there are some socially determining factors that should not be neglected .
First of all , internet search engine is the kind of tool which requires least cost , to both viewers and advertisers .
With the wide scope of internet coverage and common usage of laptops , it is economically advisable to use search engines for information gathering .
Comparing with going to bookstores or libraries and watching TV , which cost people time and money , it is cost effective to search information through search engines .
For advertisers , the cost of search marketing is much lower than that of the advertisements in other forms like on TV programs .
In this world where profit means so much , more and more advertisers are exploring the new field of search engine advertising .
The economic factor really contributes to the growth and development of search engines .
Secondly , search engine is a relatively easier tool that everyone can accept .
For example , the homepage of Google is very clean and simple .
Without much distractions from fancy designs and display of every piece of information , users can access to what they want to find directly .
Moreover , the sophistication of the search engines enables users to accurately describe the information they want and view them in an assorted manner .
In addition , search engines are mostly globalized .
For example , "Google" has many versions in different languages .
Singapore also has its own "Yahoo !"
search engines .
This helps to expose their people to the outside world by browsing other countries' WebPages through search engines .
Thus the above mentioned features have encouraged more people to use search engines .
The last but not the least , search engines lead people into a realm of information .
It is so resourceful that people basically can find anything they want by typing some words in it .
It really links up the real and the virtual world as people gain knowledge from internet and apply it to the everyday life .
It does no only have a vast database , but also possess advanced functions which classify and sort these information into different categories .
For instance , the "Google" scholar function allows users to search specifically scholastic articles .
Furthermore , as most search engines use "spider" protocol , the information presented is least biased because they are listed out based on their relevance to the user's input .
Without many advertisements to disguise the truth , users can process the information more conveniently .
As a result , the problem of too much irrelevant information present in books and TV can be alleviated .
The development of search engines is thus undeniable and spontaneous .
In conclusion , the emergence of search engines in our daily life is due to the economical , practical and information coverage factors .
It definitely started a new age of information gathering .
Through making the gathering process easier and more reliable , it saves the time , effort and resources of people .
Therefore , it is no wonder that it has remained popular in these years and still dominates the international search landscape .
Singapore has already been facing this imminent problem for decades , and many policies have already been put in place to control these statistics but to no avail .
With the advent of modern technology and sciences , living to a ripe old age was nothing too spectacular .
With an aging population , the ratio of people to proportion being able to work gradually reduces .
This reduction will no doubt cripple on the country's economy , as funds will have to be used to cater to the needs of the older majority .
It is therefore , required of the community to be able to design products to convenient them .
Hence , it is one need of Singapore as a whole country that should be given priority as it is an impending crisis and must not be neglected .
However , if these needs and concerns of the elderly are not taken care of , it may result in dire consequences .
In some areas of expertise , these "veterans" are still an indispensable source of knowledge .
Their guidance can have a great impact upon decisions made , even politically .
Our Minister Mentor , Mr . Lee Kwan Yew , is one such example of a person who provides valued experiences and guidance to the ministers .
Hence , we cannot simply turn a blind eye to the needs of the elderly .
We should do what is within our means so that they will be able to enjoy the rest of their lives .
As there is a significant majority of elderly people in Singapore to date , catering to their needs should also be part of our consideration , as a community .
Through our engineering processes , we can ensure that we can provide tools and devices for the elderly .
Firstly , our engineering processes are structured in such a way that all factors are taken into consideration .
The rigorous nature of the various steps will guarantee that a solution that is most favorable .
Cost effectiveness , efficiency and safety are held in high regard in most cases , making certain that the products designed will not take a toll on the pockets and be a hazard when they use it .
Secondly , even before a certain product design is selected , there will be multiple blueprints that are presented to the 'panel' of engineers and designers .
This is crucial because the design of the product will be diversified , less the innovations and possibilities be constrained and disregarding other important aspects such as safety .
Lastly , the survey that will be included will make sure that the product that is about to be designed will be suitable to the majority .
The information gathered from such surveys will be used in the processing and the decision of the final product out of the many initial designs will be largely based on these statistics .
These are just some examples of how the engineering process can be substantial in meeting the needs of a targeted group , which in this case , is the elderly in Singapore .
All in all , we should not only design products that will cater to the majority of the population and be nonchalant about the needs of the elderly .
A healthy balance of the two should be maintained .
Everyone ages eventually , wouldn't you want the community spare a thought for your convenience when you age ?
Up till 2007 , there are 2 .4 Billion people or 36% of the planet's population actually carry at least one phone , which means there are around 4 out of 10 people carrying a phone !
The number of people using a phone is increasing every year .
How did this happen ?
We should thank the people who thought of the innovation of making this innovative product .
The mobile phone has been a technology which was socially determined .
There are many factors that affect the shaping of this technological innovation .
Such factors are due to economic factors , military demands or government priorities and the private sectors .
Secondly , military demand is also another factor that shaped this innovative product .
Originally , the origin of the mobile phone was the radio phone which was used around the 1940s and during the World War 2 .
During the World War 2 ,Handie -Talkie and the backpack walkie-talkie were what soldiers used during the war .During the end of the war , equipments used during the war , mainly the radio phones were then brought to everyday usage .
The development of the mobile phone was in process over the 60 years and now we have such innovative product , the best example would currently be the IPhone .
As a minor conclusion , we can see that from the military demands 60 years ago plays an important role in today's development of the mobile phone .
As a conclusion , the economic factors , military demands and the government priorities are the main factors that lead to the innovation of the mobile phone .
Engineering design process is usually a cyclic process where decisions making are required .
Often , engineering sciences , basic sciences and mathematics are applied to convert the information available optimally to achieve the desired deeds .
Basically , this process can be divided into a various steps including identifying objective , defining problems , conducting researches , analyzing solutions , making decisions , presenting the products and finally , selling the products .
These are the universal steps in the process which followed by most of the engineers .
Nonetheless , there are problems that significantly hamper the engineering design process for innovation .
In Malaysia , the corruption in the politic system has leads to slow development in design process .
Besides , the education system introduced leads to lack of creativity and innovation on engineers .
In addition , lack of creativity and innovations have been identified to be the main problems in hampering engineering design process , which might due to the current education system in Malaysia .
Most of the students now were so used to be spoon fed .
They were usually spoon fed with dictated notes , and they expect that every solution will be provided .
They were overindulged by teachers as knowledge or information was provided to them in an oversimplified way , causing students to be too relying on teachers .
Students were treated in a way that discouraging independent thought and learning process , thus indirectly hindered their abilities to analyze and interpret problems due to lack of creativity .
In conclusion , corruption in politic system and lack of creativity on engineers , indisputable , significantly hampers engineering design process .
As said by the ex Prime Minister of Malaysia , Dato' Seri Doctor Mahathir Muhammad , "the use of money in politics gain could destroy a country" .
Therefore , action should be taken to prevent further corruption in politic system so that engineering design process would not be hinder .
Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day , teach a man to fish and he will eat for the rest of his life .
Hence , government should encourage independent learning so that students will be more creative and innovative to facilitate engineering design process .
Today , one of the main concerns about human need is the innovation of a more environmental-friendly vehicle .
Current vehicles are producing too much carbon dioxide - the main substance that causes global warming .
About 33% of U .S carbon dioxide emission comes from the burning of gasoline in internal-combustion engines of cars and light trucks  .
Many signs of worldwide climate change have been identified .
If we do not react quickly , the increase in temperature could lead to large-scale food and water shortage and have disastrous effects on wildlife .
Moreover , the rise in sea level could flood many islands  .
With the Earth at its critical state , a "greener" car is of the essence , and engineering design processes can guide us to our goal .
Engineering design processes consist of five steps .
Firstly , we have to define the design problem .
In the process of defining the problem , we have to identify and establish the need .
Then , a problem statement is developed , which in this case is innovation of an eco-friendly car .
After that , we have to establish the criteria for success; for instance , a car that minimizes the emission of carbon dioxide to the environment .
With the problem defined clearly , we carry on to the second step , gathering pertinent information .
The third step in engineering design processes is generating multiple solutions .
We can start by examining the weaknesses of the existing solution and try to improve them , while combining new ideas to create a unique solution to the problem  .
Once alternative solutions to the design problem have been conceived , we proceed to analyze those solutions and select the best solution for implementation , the fourth step in the engineering design processes .
In the process of analyzing the solutions , product safety and liability will also be considered .
Finally , the last step will be testing and implementing the solution to the design problem .
We must also consider the means of implementation such as prototyping and concurrent engineering , nevertheless the distinct activities during implementation , like documentation of design solution and application for patents  .
In conclusion , the human need for the innovation of an environmental-friendly car must be given priority to reduce the effect of worldwide climate change; and the engineering design processes is a systematic method to accomplish this objective systematically .
Immediate action is necessary as the Earth is getting weaker and weaker .
Never let our children suffer for our mistake !
In the contemporary world , preventing heart diseases is inarguably one of the most pressing needs of mankind , which is rated as the top priority for engineering design and innovation .
As years of researches conducted by the WHO  have repeatedly shown , heart malfunctioning is the most killing threat among all health-related problems to our lives .
Given such a life and death situation , engineers have responded and there have been many great inventions , of which the implanted pacemaker might be one of the most significant engineering products in preventing heart diseases .
This essay will explain in detail the working of modern implanted pacemakers and therefore how they have met the need in maintaining a smoothly beating heart .
An implanted pacemaker , in a nutshell , is a tiny computerized medical machine inserted in human bodies , which monitors the rhythms of human heart beats , analyze and rectify them if abnormalities occur .
A pacemaker consists of a battery , a program-based generator and electrical wires attached to the atriums and ventricles , the chambers in our hearts .
The battery , which is a mercury cell , supplies the power needed for the pacemaker to function .
The generator , which works as a computer , has programs written in it and is responsible in sending out electrical pulses in crucial moments .
The first step is to have a pacemaker implanted into the human body .
After having numbed the patient's collarbone area and a small incision made , electrical leads are inserted into the heart chamber with the guidance of x-ray .
The other end of the leads is connected to the generator and a battery that lasts for a few years .
Next , the doctor will transmit a program tailored to the needs of the patient's heart into the pacemaker across the patient's skin .
Now the pacemaker is ready to work .
Under normal circumstances , it keeps the heart beating in a normal rhythm according to the program .
When an abnormality happens , such as a block in the coronary artery or a sudden stop of heart beat , the pacemaker detects it and sends out electrical pulses to the affected location .
The pulses will then stimulate contractions in the heart muscles , which will allow the blood to flow smoothly again or to start beating again , preventing a possible sudden death of the patient .
Besides the serious occasions of heart malfunctioning , pacemaker can also help regulate the heart beat when the patient is performing certain activities , such as exercising and sleeping .
Moreover , the pacemaker records the rhythms of the patient's heart beat in different situations and hence helps the doctor to write programs that suit the patient better .
The reasons why implanted pacemakers have gone through generations of development and enlisted as one of the top 50 inventions in the past 50 years are that they are portable , which means they can effectively prevent sudden heart attacks , and dependable as they run on computer programs which are constantly renewed by having more suitable ones stored in the patients' bodies .
This invention is certainly a masterpiece of engineering design due to its contribution in the enhancement of health through maintaining a functional heart , without which the whole foundation of mankind shall collapse .
In the 21st century , human beings face a lot of serious problems , such as global warming , environment pollution , weather change , and frequent natural disasters .
Among them , the shortage of energy resources is the most urgent one to be resolved .
Our prosperous society is built on automatic mass production which requires a large amount of energy .
As a result , starting a war , destroying natural balance and polluting the environment , they are just the side effects of disputing energy resources .
Since energy resource shortage is the root of so many problems , finding its solution is the priority for engineers .
In general , three aspects can be innovated: they are improving the effectiveness of energy use and production , designing methods to store and accumulate small portions of energy , and finding cleaner and renewable energy resources .
First of all , the most practical part of solution is to make full use of energy .
The phenomena of energy wasting can be found everywhere in daily life .
Even the industrial design cannot avoid it .
For instance , most vehicles' engines can only transfer about 30% of fuel's chemical energy into mechanical energy , while the other 70% becoming heat and polluters .
Another example comes from the solar panel .
Although solar energy has been regarded as the most promising energy form , solar panel is also well known for its low energy exchange rate-less than 16% .
However , if the effectiveness of both energy use and production can be improved , enormous amount of energy could be saved .
The following efforts should be put into storing and accumulating small portions of energy .
As the major energy resources are running out , more and more energy comes from those resources which can only generate a little energy at a time .
Although their power is small , the sum is considerable if they can be accumulated properly .
The best example is the wind power generator .
A single generator produces the power of several hundred watts , even less than a family's need .
But once all energy generated by thousands of generators can be stored and transmitted with little loss , the huge industrial energy need is also able to be satisfied .
From 1840 to 1949 , Chinese people were suffering from World War II and Chinese civil war .
After these battles and wars , Chinese people finally stepped in to a new era , a peaceful but impoverished era .
Chinese people did not have time to develop their economy and technology .
Therefore , Chinese economy and technology was far behind those developed country .
However , Chinese people did not give up; Chinese leaders put forward a series of policies .
Moreover , every Chinese people want to contribute to establishing a new China .
That is why Chinese economic situation was much better than before .
For technology aspect , a group of Chinese scientists and engineers scarified their holiday and worked every day and night in order to improve the technology of China .
Therefore , many excellent and designed technological outcomes appeared in that period of time .
But now , there are two factors hamper the design process for innovation .
One is the students are lack of the innovative thinking system .
Other one there is no co-operation between scientists and engineers .
From a technological point of view , the way to the future from where we are today is either by creating something new or modifying current technology so that it performs better than the way it previously did .
This is where engineering design process comes into play .
In order to come up with groundbreaking innovations to improve the way we live , engineers need to have a design-oriented mind .
However , coming up with a new ideas and innovations are more often than not , easier said than done .
As a matter in fact , statistically speaking , the number of failed attempts at innovation far exceed the ones which made it into the books .
Nevertheless , the process of learning through failures have significant importance in the engineering design process .
One of the main obstacles in the engineering design process has to be financial constraints .
Many great engineering design ideas were halted cold in their tracks just because the cost to realize them outweighs the benefits that they carry .
For instance , the proposed plan to use nuclear energy in Malaysia never came to be due to the enormous funds that is required to carry out research in the technology and even if the necessary funds are secured , there is always the uncertainty if the research will yield any significant results .
On top of that , researchers and investors have all come to terms with the fact that running and maintaining a practical nuclear reactor in Malaysia will take too long for the technology to break even financially .
It is just not worth the effort .
Apart from that , new engineering design innovations need to be benchmarked against their environmental effects .
Engineers need to be sensitive towards this issue and thus , ensure that the impact of their ideas are minimal towards mother nature .
In the case of a nuclear power plant in Malaysia , the idea is not viable as the country has an abundance of forest reserves which needs to be kept untarnished and preserved the way they are .
Constant exposure to radioactive substances may alter the natural ecosystem of these reserves , causing irreversible damage .
Even in Singapore , all engineering projects have to abide by the Environmental Pollution Control Act before being carried out .
Besides that , in the innovations that engineers have come up with has to be safe for the public to use .
In this case , safety measures need to be put in place before an innovation is unveiled to the public .
This cannot be compromised .
As for the Malaysian power plant , The plant , due to the inadequacy of safe uranium containment as well as the skilled labour to handle them , the project is unable to be carried out .
The incident at Chernobyl , Ukraine serves as a good reminder as to why safety is of utmost importance .
In order to cut production cost , several safety precautions have been removed from the initial blueprint .
On the fateful day of April 26 , 1986 , one of the reactors exploded , consequently causing the area to be inhabitable till this day and instantly claiming 4 lives in the process .
In a nutshell , engineers may have great ideas and innovations .
Unfortunately , not all of them can be realized .
In fact , many of them will not .
However , all is not lost .
With small but useful engineering design ideas being introduced daily , serving as a basis for many bigger innovations , it's only a matter of time before the many obstacles which are holding engineers back collapse .
Annex
We need a great change and the most possible plan now is applying the nanotechnology  .
Using the latest knowledge  , engineers can design various type of micro-robot which have the size just like a bacterium  .
With this size  , the normal physical limitation is now removed and we can easily discover every corner of human body .
It not only reduce the material cost , make more accurate diagnosis  , but also make patient less painful and bring scientists a great chance to study about human deeper .
These micro-robot can have many useful functions  .
It can bring a camera and help doctors observer the inner world of human body with their own eyes .
It can be attached with a tiny medicine package and put it directly into the damaged spot  .
It can be programmed to kill any cell that causes the disease  .
This micro-robot is very promising and now is developed by many professional engineers all over the word and will soon be released  , making one of the greatest achievement of engineers as well as humanity .
There is an unlimited possibility to what these cells are able to achieve , but with current technology ,
there is only so much scientist can do , a lot more research will be required in order to bring this ideology to realism and put this cell into good use .
I believe this would be most valuable scientific breakthrough .
Perhaps someday , the human ageing problems will be solved just purely by replacing old organs and injecting new cells to repair old and damaged tissues ?
The world food crisis would be solved by merging these cells with the current cloning technology to create fast and vast range of food supplies .
The world's technology is developing at a fast pace .
Among these new technologies , some of them are developed by research while others are discovered serendipitously , which means they are found by chance instead of studying on purpose .
Take the aspect of electric devices as an example , refrigerator was studied for a long time in the laboratory after people had the desire of reserving things in a cold temperature longer .
On the other hand , the theory of microwave oven was discovered by Percy Spencer by chance .
He noticed that candy in his pocket melted while he was doing another experiment and by using this technology microwave oven was invented .
Comparing these two ways of finding new technology , they have similarities as well as differences .
However , despite of the similarities , they also have differences , which mainly fall in two aspects .
Firstly , refrigerator has a strong purpose in real life before it is invented .
The idea of keeping things frozen to keep them fresh has existed for a long time , so people worked towards this purpose and after trying many times , the technology of refrigerator came out .
As a result , the product will sell well because the aim of the technology is a common desire and meet the demand of the public .
Microwave oven , on the contrary , its function is not known before the theory is discovered and the equipment invented .
Thus , sometimes there will be a risk to produce a large amount of equipment applying the serendipitously discovered technology because the market of this field might not be large since before it is invented , other ways of the similar aim may have already existed .
Secondly , developing the technology of refrigerator in the laboratory needs a long time of work .
Since the idea is brought up , generations of people used various methods to improve the machine and make the technology perfect .
However , the process of finding the technology of microwave oven was by chance and took a very short time , and it might even be ignored if people did not pay attention to the phenomena .
Therefore , developing a technology by research may require more work and developing a technology serendipitously will need more attention to details in daily life .
In conclusion , though differences exist during the processes they are developed , in the aspects of their use and in the marketing potential when the equipment comes out , both kinds of technologies contribute to the development of the society .
In fact , no matter in which way the technology is discovered , as long as it is beneficial to the society , we should appreciate it and enjoy the convenience it brings us .
Do you know that the global worldwide energy consumption was 500 exajoules which is an astounding 5 1020 J ?
Do you also know that 80 to 90 percent of that is obtained from the combustion of fossil fuels ?
As globalization takes place , coupled with an increasing world population , more electrical energy has to be supplied to homes and factories so as to meet the increasing demand .
However , fossil fuels such as coal and crude oil , which is used to produce electricity , will eventually be depleted as they are non-renewable resources .
According to Wikipedia , "Assuming that our rate of usage in 2005 remains constant , we will run out of conventional oil in 40 years  and coal in 154 yrs  ."
Hence , the current human need for energy is one need that we must prioritize .
Engineers have therefore started to work on new technologies , such as photovoltaic systems that can convert solar power to electrical energy so as to ease the need .
By definition , solar energy refers to the radiant light and heat from the Sun .
Every year , the Earth absorbs approximately 3 ,850 ,000 exajoules of solar energy .
This amount of energy is almost twice the total amount of energy that can ever be obtained from non-renewable sources .
As a result , many countries in the world are now tapping into this new source of energy .

The process of converting the solar energy to electrical energy is also known as the photovoltaic effect .
First , when sunlight is shone onto the surface of the photovoltaic panels , sunlight in the form of photons will be absorbed by the silicon .
Next , the electrons with higher energy level in the panels will be separated from their atoms and allowed to flow in a single direction due to the special composition of the cells .
Complimentary positive charges that are produced will flow in the opposite direction of the electrons .
Finally , when both positive charges and electrons flow through the silicon photovoltaic cells , electricity is produced . 
However , even though solar energy has proven to be a very good and efficient way to generate electricity , the electricity produced may not be available to everyone who needs them due to the cost of production .
Many modern countries have been setting up more photovoltaic plants to generate electricity .
However , in most third world countries , the government or private industries may not have the funds to set up photovoltaic plants due to the high initial capital cost .
As a result , despite many people in the country needing electrical energy , the country cannot supply enough to meet the needs of everyone .
Therefore , this shows that the technology of solar energy has its own limitations too , which hopefully would be resolved soon so that it can become an accessible source of energy for everyone in the near future .
To sum up , the most current human need that has to be prioritized is the need for energy .
In the next few decades , the demand for energy will definitely increase exponentially as the world population continues to grow .
Therefore , solar energy being a clean and renewable source of energy will definitely build up its popularity as an uprising source that can be used to produce electricity .
Hence in order to ease current as well as future needs for energy , solar power is one viable source to consider .

Since there are life on the earth ,all the things living depend on the sun .Photosynthesis is the process that green plant turn carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrate .The energy we human need is directly or indirectly come from the photosynthesis .
The petroleum ,coal and gas are the outcome of photosynthesis that the nature gives to us .
Because of the rapid develop of the world ,the energy that nature leave over to us are less and less .This even makes countries begin an energy war .Energy plays a more and more important role .what we desperately need is a kind of resource that can give out high energy and does not do harm to the nature .
Hydrogen energy is this kind of energy .There is only water after it burns and hydrogen contains a lot of heat .So we try hard to invent a machine to make hydrogen energy .
As we know that hydrogen can be made by electrolysing water ,so we need electrical energy .We first convert solar energy into electrical energy .
To achieve this we use plates that are made of semiconductor which can absorb the sun lights .The semiconductor can emit electron after the sun light's stimulate .The whole plates form a battery .So the solar energy have been successfully converted into electrical energy .
After doing this , we will artificial simulate the process of photosynthesis .In this step ,we need to find a highly efficient catalyst to speed up the electrolyzation and make the process to be complete .we let the water into a container and add the catalyst into it ,then take two metal plates into the water and transmit electricity we get before into the water .Finally , we can get the hydrogen gas .
Hydrogen gas has been produced ,but the transmission is still a hard work .We need a high-pressure and low-temperature surroundings to let the hydrogen be liquid .But it is very hard to make that kind of surroundings in normal life .We need a kind of catalyst to make the hydrogen be liquid at normal temperature and pressure .
After the two steps ,the hydrogen will replace oil ,coal and gas ,to be the most useful and important energy in our life .
We will no longer afraid of atmospheric pollution and greenhouse effect .What's more ,the energy we use is renewable .We will not be short of energy resource .
In the process of developing a new idea into a product , all kinds of expected or unforeseeable troubles will occur , making the path fill with struggles and disappointments .
Although the knowledge and technological breakthroughs we accumulated through ages have premised human a solid foundation for putting our ideas into practice , there still existing many inevitable factors due to the advancing capitalization which deter the process of innovation .
Among all those socially determined resistance on the way of innovation , one fatally significant phenomenon is the unfair competition between monopolies and other less competent companies .
On one hand , monopolies that have sufficient capital to back them up can easily invest large sum of money in fields of designing and testing to increase the capacity and ensure the reliability of their products for more demanding tasks .
Meanwhile the dominancy in market share also allows them to popularize and convert their products to revenue in a short time .
It can be perceived as good in the sense of market selection , but on the other hand , such type of rivalship can easily be abused and transformed into one-sided violation if monopolies use these advantages as weapons against their opponents instead of rising the standard of living for mankind .
One vivid example is Microsoft forced Netscape going into bankruptcy by packing its inferior web browser IE with its dominant windows system for free .
It is also common for monopolies to lower the price in a large scale to annihilate their opponents and rise it up latter .
Ironically , being the ultimate form in organizing capital , monopolies seem to be the major obstruction on the road of innovation , and hundreds of 'Netscapes' have been sacrificed over the years because of their pursuit of greater profit .
Innovation still has a long way to go before it can stand up to these giants .
With so many things to consider about , those managers do have reasons to hesitate before they risk the future of a company for the unguaranteed profit .
They will not start simply because they cannot afford to lose the race .
To sum it up , the rules of this society determine that the process of innovation will depend much more on engineers' creativity .
But as the society changes with time , hopefully we can create a harmonic atmosphere for innovation and provide mankind a higher living standard .
In an age of accelerated obsolescence of information and technology , lots of new inventions and design concepts come out from human's mind every second .
Meantime , the demands rising from the endless pursuing for high-standard breakthroughs have boosted and inspired the human's brain to deepen their potential .
During this new innovation-development revolution in science and technology , engineers no doubt play a vital role to beautify and simplify the whole world .
Just like Roger said: in the context of the innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view , also referred to as the social construction of technology .
In addition , numerous breakthroughs are deriving from the audacious imagination .
Reflecting this two innovation technologies , both of it are shaped by a set of factors including the audacious idea and the climate influence etc .
In fact , as a whole , the key factor is still the government policy .
Without Dubai's specific economy transition , there will not be such a mount of fund input .
In conclusion , a new innovation technology is always combined with numerous factors .
In order to make a better life in the future , innovation-development is playing a very important role in our highly developing society .
With the promotion of lives' quality , people require higher and higher criterions .
How to build more convenient and safer facilities ?
How to make less pollution and friendlier environment ?
How to offer better medical treatment and prolong people's lives ?
All these problems are waiting for engineers to solve .
However , due to many factors , there are two types , convention and skunkworks , existing in the process of innovation-development .
The reason why this situation is can be seen from the need of market , the process of research & development , and the product features .
As the first step of innovation-development , the need of market is significantly considered in both two types .
Usually , the determinists of the need of market are defined as technologically determinist and socially determinist .
Although both of them exist in convention and skunkworks , socially determinist takes more than technologically determinist in skunkworks .
This is because that skunkworks is born to solve those very real and urgent problems nevertheless in scarcity of capital .
In contrast , enough capital and technology support are the factors which lead the process of convention .
So convention is more technologically determinist and skunkworks is more socially determinist .
At last , the products of the two , convention and skunkworks , will face to different kinds of consumers .
The products of skunkworks are more practical , and people are in need of those product .
For example , the invention of laptop helped Japanese employee had more space to work .
But for convention , its products are often regarded as the milestone of technology or other purposes .
Like General Motors  dedicated $2 billion to designing , manufacturing , and marketing electric vehicles to reposition GM as an innovative company in people's minds , but the ability of those vehicles were much poor  .
In summary , Convention usually has enough capital and technology , large scale and good environment .
These make it operate stably .
By contrast , skunkworks is more efficient and its products are more practical than that of convention .
But it shares higher risk of no outcome due to the shortage of capital and shabby environment .
However , by taking every point into consideration , both of them can work well in innovation-development , depending on different situation .
Engineers are trained to solve problem and design products to fulfill human needs .
Overcoming a problem requires time and repeating trial to make sure that the product is safe to use and works efficiently .
Products that are designed should be able to suit daily usage .
As turning ideas into virtual products takes an engineer a lot of effort , an engineer should carefully define the problem that occurs in human life and thereafter starts to generate the problem and solve it .
One of the current human needs is to find an environmental friendly vehicle as a substitute for the gasoline vehicle .
Air pollution nowadays has become a serious issue all around the world .
Some countries which are severely affected by air pollution could not even have a clear vision during day time .
According to Gulfnews .com eq \o\ac , more than 75 per cent of air pollution is emitted from vehicles .
Exhaust fumes are bad for human health and will contribute to air pollution .
Thus , an environmental friendly vehicle needs to be created and should be given priority for this creation to save our earth from pollution and to lessen the impact of the air pollution .
Electric generated vehicle can be designed to overcome the air pollution problem .
Electric generated vehicle will not exhaust gases when it is being driven .
On the other hand , it also does not need gasoline as generating material .
This means that mining process for gasoline might also be lesser and therefore the air pollution problem will be less serious .
It is because mining and refining processes of the petroleum will emit fumes that will pollute the air .
To build an electric generated vehicle that can have longer lasting battery power and powerful pickup , it should have a special battery , light weight material and well designed shape .
The battery of the vehicle must be able to recharge within short hours .
It should also be able to store higher amount of energy in order to last for longer period of time .
On the other hand , building the vehicle with light weight material , such as aluminium can conserve energy .
Furthermore , having an aerodynamically styled shape , the vehicle can move faster and has a powerful pickup .
The electric generated vehicle should be fully tested and examined .
It is an important process to make sure that the product is safe to be used .
Test drive for the successful electric generated vehicle can open to public and ask for feedback from them and make improvements for it .
After that the electric generated vehicle can be introduced to the market throughout the world .
In conclusion , the creation of electric generated vehicle can reduce air pollution problem that is becoming more and more serious nowadays .
It has to be created to fulfil the world's need nowadays so that our future generation has a healthier earth to live in .
Engineers can make world different by their expertise and knowledge .
Picture a scenario in mind: a man sitting in front of a computer is busy using email , eBay , online banking , and teleconferencing .
This is ecommerce , which consists of the buying and selling of products or services over electronic systems such as the Internet and other computer networks .
CITATION wik09 \l 2052  Thanks to this burgeoning technology , people can almost fulfil all their needs without moving a step .
With the initial to achieve a more convenient human life , ecommerce is considered to be socially determined rather than technologically determined .
To specify , the formation and development of this technology is mainly contributed by three factors: public's needs , economic consideration , and government regulation .
Basically , the origin of ecommerce is due to public's desire to facilitate their life and work .
Tracing back to the late 1970s , Electronic Data Interchange and Electronic Funds Transfer first emerged in the US to satisfy people's needs for simple business communication .
CITATION Ken08 \l 2052  These were the very first types of ecommerce .
Later on , as the rapid spread of internet , the utility of this technology quickly varied and extended to global scope .
The most popular usage is online shopping .
Because of the increasingly heavy workload , people are sick of stepping out of home and shopping .
This concern soon results in the appearance of online store .
In 1995 , both eBay and Amazon launched and quickly grew to become the biggest online retailers .
CITATION Jul08 \l 2052  Till now , people can nearly do whatever they want simply by clicking the web browser .
During the speedy development of ecommerce , corporations realize the potential to gain huge interest and participate to shape the direction of ecommerce's growth .
Comparing with the traditional selling styles , ecommerce manages to broaden the market as well as obtain a cheaper but more efficient publicity .
For example , originally the retail stores most probably sell products only within the city since they can hardly afford to publicize in a larger area .
Thanks to the technology of ecommerce , these shops can now do publicity to a much larger target group .
By the same time , the online banking system also facilitates the procedure to make deals .
Besides these two factors , government regulation also contributes to shaping this technology .
In the 1990s , as a result of the rising development of ecommerce , the usage of this technology gradually became out of control .
The public's privacy and security was seriously threatened .
In order to solve these problems , Federal Trade Commission  established FTC Act in the US .
Similarly , the related governmental agency in other countries also established such rules to maintain the situation .
Directed by public's requirement , enterprises' intention , and government regulation , ecommerce is now still developing .
Undoubtedly , this is not the end of its growth .
If continuing the efforts of these three aspects , we have confidence this technology will sooner or later develop to a certain stage which satisfies the whole society .
Engineering design , also known as innovations , are created by people to make the world a better place to live in .
However , innovations do not come easy .
It has to go through a five step process before coming out with the final product .
The steps named in order are identifying the problem , gathering of information pertaining to the problem , generating of solutions , analyzing and testing the solutions and implementing of the solution .
In Singapore , there are some problems which hamper certain stages of the design process .
First , the attitude of Singaporeans makes them reluctant to change .
Singaporeans live in the comfort of their own homes believing that all the things that can be invented are already made .
Everyone is just waiting for someone to discover new things .
With attitudes like that , it is not possible for Singaporeans to innovate .
Moreover , Singaporeans accept things too easily .
They lack the motivation to create new things .
Such frame of mind hinders the progression of innovation .
Singaporeans are afraid to try out new things and they are also afraid of failure .
Innovation requires perseverance , the ability to accept failure and motivation .
These are a few traits that are hardly seen in the Singaporeans .
On top of this , the education system in Singapore does not emphasise on creativity .
Students are always 'spoon-fed' by the teachers .
As a consequence , they are instilled with a 'sit back and wait' state of mind from young .
Clearly , the lack of creativity and the passive attitude of Singaporeans have hindered the first stage of the engineering design process .
Second , the social systems in Singapore are also affecting the generation of solutions in the design process .
As Singapore is a country based on meritocracy , companies are more concerned about their profits , and hence are reluctant to risk on innovation .
In addition , the society is unable to accept new things which are out of the norm; consequently , inventions which are different will not be accepted by the public .
Besides , there are so many areas to consider during the design process .
For example , a new product not only has to be aesthetically pleasing to the public , it also has to be safe for usage and most importantly being able to make profits for the company .
Thus , issues will arise at the stage of generating solutions .
Doing one thing may improve on an aspect but at the same time , it may also compromise the quality of another area .
As a result , it is very difficult to attain a balance among all the areas .
Unless a balance among the areas could be achieved , the design process will not be able to continue , as possible solutions could not be created .
Indeed , the social systems in Singapore have significantly affected the third stage of the design process .
In conclusion , the design process is demanding and tedious .
There are certain stages of the process to complete before being able to come up with a feasible solution .
However , there are problems faced during the process .
The two major problems in Singapore are the attitude and the social systems .
The passive attitude results in people being unable to identify existing problems , which is the very first phase of the design process .
Furthermore , the social systems set strict standards for new products .
This significantly affects the third stage of design process which is the generation of solutions .
Therefore , only by overcoming the two major problems , Singaporeans will then be able to create and innovate .
The year is 1969 .
Man has finally conquered the Moon .
Television screens all over the world showed replays after replays of this history making moment .
No longer was planned space exploration an unreachable frontier; possible only in the restricted realms of science fiction .
Fast-forward forty years after Neil Armstrong has become the first man to land on the Moon , the question remains: Can a nation like Singapore pursue a grand dream such as space exploration ?
There lie two major hurdles , the small population size and the lack of natural resources , to engineering design process in Singapore .
Singapore is a minute city-state situated in the tropics of South East Asia .
The republic today is a thriving metropolis where slightly less than five million people call home .
This estimate , taken from Singapore's government population survey reports in 2008 , placed the republic modestly as the one hundred and fifteenth most populous nation globally .
Besides small population size , Singapore also does not have any natural resources to boast about .
The republic's physical landmass of approximated seven hundred and five kilometres squared is ranked one hundred and eighty- seventh internationally .
Unsurprisingly , the scarce land does not yield precious metals nor is it a treasure trove containing prized fossil fuel .
The above-mentioned problems will have severe ramifications on the engineering design process .
Singapore's small population size affects the initial two stages as well as the final testing stage of the engineering design process .
Firstly , a small population would mean that most problems encountered by small groups in Singapore would often be overlooked .
For a similar situation overseas , the problems are likely to draw more attention .
This is due to the fact that for a seemingly insignificant proportion of people who require specifically designed solutions , it is quite a sizeable amount in absolute terms in countries with larger human concentration .
This situation would be problematic during the definition of problem stage of engineering design process .
In addition , even if there were potential solutions , it would be a tough task to carry out experimentation or trials , either as a mean to gather data or to implement a solution , simply because a local test group might not exists .
This was illustrated in the report "A chair that's music to deaf ears" where a research team was unable to find a test group for a chair for the deaf they designed and had to look overseas .
The non-existence of natural resources is another concern .
Specifically , resources can be divided into raw materials , land , wealth and labour of which the first two , a nation like Singapore clearly lacks .
This deficient in raw materials and useable land as well as to a lesser extent , wealth and labour , limits the magnitude on the engineering solutions to be pursued .
The space race cost the United States an estimated twenty-five billion dollars in ninety-sixties terms .
Such an enormous amount would be several annum of Singapore's gross domestic product in the current economic climate .
The scarce land space further adds to the problem .
In conclusion , Singapore's unique size and state of available resource are obstacles in the engineering design process .
The ability to work with such constraints will greatly influence the outcome of future engineering endeavours .
Title : Two Problems that Significantly Hamper Engineering Design Processes For Innovations and Their Effects .
Who are the designers of all the inventions in this world ?
Well , obviously they are engineers .
"Scientists dream about doing great things .
Engineers do them ."
This is a famous quote by James A . Michener .
Engineers are people who investigate problems and try to solve them .
Gadgets and machines were invented to solve our daily problems .
However , some obstacles may obstruct the innovative engineering design processes .
Identifying these obstacles and their effects may help to prevent rejection of inventions in the future .
The educational system in Malaysia is exam orientated .
The educational system is based more towards theory and not practical .
Students spend most of their time in the classroom learning theory .
The amount of time spent in lab for practical is minimal .
The system is giving emphasis on memory skills , not analytical skills .
Furthermore , school teachers merely teach students to pass their exams , but not for the students to learn .
Primary and secondary school students are spoon fed with information rather than letting them learning independently .
Students are taught and train to score in public examinations such as Penilaian Menengah Rendah  and Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia  .
Eventually , students with good memory will be able to pass with flying colours as they are able to memorise all the facts and spit them all out during the exams .
These excellent students will face problems as they further their studies to be engineers .
They lack of analytical skills , creativity and innovation .
These are the two factors that will cease engineers from being able to solve real life problems .
It is human's nature to response to incentives .
Incentives could be in the form of money or moral support .
Society does not show an encouraging attitude towards innovation .
Society is afraid to accept new invention .
This causes engineers to be demotivated .
In conjunction to this , companies are not willing to take risks to fund the research and development of engineers .
For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi , a brilliant engineer who envisioned and invented the laptop .
He idea was rejected by Toshiba fearing that it will not be successful  .
This scenario is common and it is preventing engineers from doing research and development for a given problem .
Research and development is almost impossible without funding .
Thus , engineers are not capable to come up with solution to problems although they have brilliant ideas .
In conclusion , our current educational system is too rigid .
It should focus more on practical applications rather than theory .
Students must be exposed to new problems related to current issues and be able to propose solutions to the problem .
In addition , the solutions must be practical and appropriate to be accepted by society .
Nevertheless , society should be open to fresh ideas .
Positive feedback from society will stimulate passion and desire for engineers to contribute with what they do best , inventing .
Rogers , E .M .  .
The birth of the laptop computer at Toshiba .
In Diffusion of innovations  .
New York: Free Press .
Since the birth of car at the end of last century , its development has gone through ups and downs over the last one hundred years .
The first car invented by Carl .
Zaochu Benz at that time only had a speed of 18Km per hour , but now , a sport car can accelerate from zero speed to 100Km per hour within 3 seconds .
We can see that the speed of development of cars is very amazing .
But what actually made the car industry develop so fast ?
The car industry' development cannot be separated from the adoption of car by the people .
Only the customers' demand can stimulate the enhancement of the car industry .
So again , what is the factors influence the adoption of car ?
Actually , after Henry Ford's Model T automobile was invented , cars just gradually become a vehicle that can be adopted by people .
The {Model T} was introduced on October 1 , 1908 .
The car was very simple to drive , and easy and cheap to repair .
Economically , because the Model T was so cheap that by the 1920s a majority of American drivers learned to drive on the Model T . Apart from this , in order to make the Model T more universal , Henry Ford also created a massive publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product .
He also created a network of local dealers , which provided a good marketing channel to his company .
These are all the things that the Ford Company did in order to sell more Model Ts .
If we analysis from a bigger view , then we can see that there were also other economical factors influence the cars' adoption .
One of the most important factors was that declining cost of oil at that time .
Several years before Ford produced the Model T , in 1901 , the discovery of Spindletop really means a new age of oil mass production .
The daily output of this site was more than 1 million barrels o oil , which was even more than the sum of output of other sites in the United States .
This made the price of oil in United States decrease very fast at that time .
So the lower price of oil provided a good background for the adoption of Ford's Model T .
In conclusion , the adoption of car and this technological innovation was not only technological determined , but also shaped by economic factors , military demands , and government policies and priorities .
Two problems hamper engineering design processes for innovations in China and their effects .
An engineering design process , which includes mainly five stages-defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and testing and implementing the solution , plays a very important role in improving the quality of people's life .
In our daily life , we can easily identify automobiles , laptops , handphones and microwaves as engineering innovations around us .
Take China for instance , the culture for innovation in engineering design is severely lacked .
One factor would be China's rigid education system that produces only a small number of innovative engineers .
It does not help either that the Chinese government is giving very little incentives for innovations in engineering .
As a result , engineers have little motivation to innovate .
Even they have the motivation , their ideas are unlike to come true due to lack of funding from the government .
One of the problems that hampers innovations in engineering may be China's rigid education system which discourages students from being creative .
In China , most teachers spoon-feed their students , and students are instructed to follow standard answers given by the teachers .
When a student finds out an alternative method of solving a problem , there is usually no reward for him and he still has to answer the question in the standard way to avoid losing marks in examinations .
Thus innovation among students is discouraged .
Moreover , students have very little hands-on practice of what they have learnt in class .
Instead , most of their time is spent on solving sample examination problems .
As a result , China's education system produces engineers that are generally weak in doing research and development , which will adversely affect the stage of generating multiple solutions in the engineering design process .
In conclusion , rigid education system and government's very little incentives to innovations limit the number of innovative engineers and hinder the realization of innovative ideas if any .
They are hence the two prominent obstacles that hamper the engineering design processes for innovations in China .

In many companies , brilliant and capable engineers were often denied the opportunity to express their ideas through innovation .
Engineers in the past were innovative and a vast amount of creative ideas were generated to improve the technology .
However , many of these ideas were rejected by the corporate leaders of various companies .
The leaders were not risk-takers and reflected the ideas to be non-profitable to the company .
Passionate engineers ventured 'in the dark' and started a skunk works project as they were unable to gain their superiors supports .
There are many defining features of a conventionally generated technology with those of a comparable innovation that was created in a skunk works environment .
Skunk works projects do not have access to the full resources of the company , have their own rules and have to maintain confidential about their projects .
Skunk works projects have their limitations in terms of resources .
The project is helmed by the project managers and all problems , including technical and administrative , will be handled by them .
The research funds and human resources were not made available to them .
Therefore the project managers will have to find their own financial support to fund their projects .
The construction of the team will not be easy as the choices are limited .
The more capable engineers were already involved with other projects and there can be no way to transfer out without the knowledge of the superiors .
On the other hand , conventional projects have a huge backing from the corporate level .
All administrative issues will be settled in a much shorter time to allow the project to begin earlier .
Also , capable engineers will be assigned to the new project , depending on its priority .
Skunk works projects aim is to develop the innovation .
Hence the rules of the company need not to be enforced in their secret working environment .
Project managers will set the rules for those personnel involved .
There had been extreme examples of rules set by project managers where both emerged successful in their innovations .
In contrast , conventional project personnel have to follow the strict rules of the company .
An image has to be maintained .
Smart dress codes are to be adhered to at all times and working hours should be fully utilized in the company's interest .
The engineers often follow a monotonous lifestyle .
Skunk works projects are secret projects not to be revealed to anyone .
Personnel will have to maintain double life for this project .
No discussions on the project are to be made .
Personnel often have to stay back late after office hours to work on their secret projects and no claim of overtime are allowed .
Since they are involved in a secret project , no rewards will be guaranteed .
On the contrary , conventional projects engineers take pride in their work .
Special privileges were often granted to those involved in high-profiled projects .
There will also be media coverage and time to time update on their projects .
Engineers working for conventional projects are more at ease with their jobs .
However they faced equal stress on their projects .
They will have to follow their company rules while their leaders support them financially .
Skunk work projects do not have the backing of their leaders , resulting in secrecy and extra work .
Engineers must be highly motivated and passionate to achieve results .
Therefore conventional projects and skunk works projects are different in nature .
However an engineer can be successful as long as he is highly motivated , passionate and diligent .
Two problems that may hamper engineering design processes for innovations in my home country .
In the real world , there are countless problems waiting and engineers are often the ones to take up this challenge as they strive towards finding the best solution through innovating new products .
An engineer tackles problems by first detecting the problem before carrying out the necessary research .
After which , engineers would then start developing their products and subsequently proceed to commercialize it .
It is necessary to recognize that the entire process is fraught with numerous difficulties which could impede an engineer's creativity .
These problems should be identified and rectified in order to prevent the emergence of additional problems .
As mentioned , the development of an intended product is part of the engineering design processes .
For these two processes , an engineer needs to be able to think out of the box .
One possible factor that might hamper such creativity is our educational system .
Singapore's education system has been structured in such a way that it is rigid and text based and does not teach students to apply what is taught .
There is so much to learn in the syllabus and yet so little time .
Hence , we see chunks of lessons squeezed into packed timetables .
The time needed to fully understand the concepts are usually not enough .
Therefore , many students eventually end up merely memorizing and going through the motion instead of thinking of different ways to apply the knowledge learnt to the real world .
Furthermore , the choice of subjects is very limited and the subjects are mostly of the same nature .
For creativity to be induced , it is important to be exposed to knowledge from various different aspects .
Another portion of the design processes involve commercialization .
For a new product or technology to be successful , it is required to be accepted by the public .
Therefore , the society is a big deciding factor for the success or failure of the product launched .
Sadly , society as a whole are generally not that receptive of new ideas and innovative products .
This is a potential problem which would hamper engineering design processes .
Humans in general , like to stay within their comfort zone and is often unwilling to accept new ideas or changes in their lifestyle .
The new product needs to be widely accepted so that it will be profitable .
Hence , an unreceptive society is not going to generate enough profits to enable the product to be sustainable .
Without profits , engineers will not be able or motivated to continue research and development necessary to improve the products as it is simply not worth it to do so anymore .
An example would be the case of the refrigerator .
Refrigerators currently common in the market are electric refrigerators , which generally produce a "humming" sound .
A soundless refrigerator was in fact produced in 1930 .
However , during that time , large investments went channeled into the research and development of electric refrigerators .
Furthermore , electric refrigerators were more aggressively advertised for .
All these factors led to the downfall of the soundless refrigerator .
In sum , a society which is less receptive of new ideas and innovative products could lead to the hampering of engineering processes for innovation .
In conclusion , there are several factors that play a part in the success of innovative engineering processes .
It is necessary for engineers to exhibit a high level of creativeness .
Moreover , for a new product to succeed in the market , it has to be accepted by the society as they are the ones purchasing the products and making them profitable .
Two problems are identified which might hamper creativeness in engineers .
Although measures that tackle these problems might have already been introduced , we have yet to witness the effectiveness of these measures .

In Diffusion of innovations  .

Despite of the poor environment , tough stress , and high risk , skunkworks indeed value more than conventional technology .
To some extent , conventionally generated technology usually improves our life , but innovation in skunkworks often changes our life .
Skunkworks , defined to pioneer the development of a technological innovation , normally has a tougher working conditions .
Usually skunkworks cannot get enough support to create a satisfied working environment .
Due to the uncertainty , R&D group in skunkworks often cannot find enough people to conduct the innovation .
Without initial capital and sufficient crew , the developing process has no way to start .
In addition , it is a fairly stressful job because of the limitation of time and the finance .
Just like the team of design Macintosh , they were working day and night under the aggressive leadership of Steven Jobs .
By contrast , conventional technologies have well organized systems that can ensure the progress of work .
Seldom do they have a stressful workload .
The starting points of innovation in skunkworks and conventional technology are different .
Innovation in skunkworks is made for solving the potential problems or needs of life .
However , Conventional is made for solving the existed problems or needs .
When NOKIA upgraded its N series hand phone annually , iPhone of the Apple company surprise the world , because it give a different definition of touching the phone .
The success of innovation is generally much more considerable than conventional technology .
To sum up , skunkworks usually has a tough environment and a stressful workload .
Furthermore , it is often at a high risk for investing in skunkworks .
However , for the desire of changing the way of how people live , and also for the considerable benefits for companies and human life , innovation in skunkworks plays a more vital role than the conventionally generated technology .
Compressed Natural Gas  vehicle is an alternative fuel vehicle .
Instead of using fossil fuels such as gasoline or diesel , it uses compressed natural gas which consists of mainly methane  as the fuel of a vehicle .
By 2008 , there are roughly 7 millions of CNG vehicles on the roads worldwide .
The development of CNG vehicle can be viewed as a socially determined technology , because of the influences of environmental , economic factors and government regulations on its development .
Firstly , the development of CNG vehicle is determined by the environmental factor .
Unlike the normal gasoline vehicle which emits greenhouse and harmful gases , the power of CNG vehicle can emit 70% lesser CO2 and little harmful gas .
Therefore CNG vehicle is more environmental friendly than gasoline vehicle .
In the context of global warming becoming more and more serious , the development of such environmental friendly vehicles becomes a must .
Many automobile manufacturers  conducted a lot of research , development and innovations for a number of years using CNG as a fuel source for vehicles .
CNG equipment manufacturers have invested in research and development to improve this technology and make it convenient and available for consumers globally  .
Apart from reducing the air pollution , Natural gas vehicle also produces lower noise levels than gasoline vehicle .
This is another positive feature of CNG vehicle .
The greater use of CNG vehicles for public transportation will result in a quieter urban environment , which will be a plus for our living environment .
Thus , it is the environmental factor that spurred the development of CNG vehicle .
In recent years , with its growing prosper and affluence , China is investing more on science and technology development .
However , the lack of research funding and an inflexible education system , in my opinion , has significantly hampered engineering design process in China .
First of all , lack of research funding has significantly hindered the development of many engineering design projects in China .
In China , innovation in science and technology is mostly driven by the state , rather than by the grass roots .
In contrast with some developed countries , the spending in R&D in China is obviously not as abundant .
Statistics shows that R&D spending takes up 3 .2 percent of GDP in US and 2 .9 percent in Singapore .
However , it is only 1 .4 percent in China .
Also , a large proportion of the R&D funding goes to the state-owned military and defense technology cooperation , leaving even less for the rest of the R&D programmes .
The lack of funding gives rise to dissatisfactory research conditions and also implies that many of the engineering design projects may meet either construction or operating budget crunches long before any productive work can be done .
Thus insufficient funding is a prominent factor that hampers engineering design process in China .
On top of that , an inflexible education system in China has also hampered its engineering design process .
In order to come out with a new product , the engineers must be able to think out of the box and possess practical skills .
However , the education system in China does not train the student to think creatively and provide few chances for the students to put what they learn into practice .
The education in China is very much exam-oriented .
The students study hard in order to excel in exams .
The only aim of the students seems to be doing well in the university entrance examination and being enrolled into renowned universities .
In the so-called cramming method of teaching , teachers paid particular attention to memorization , even at the cost of comprehension .
During the examination , the students were not evaluated by how much they memorize , but not on how they think .
Such a rigid education system has significantly hindered students' creativity and poorly equipped them to apply knowledge in the real world .
In conclusion , the lack of research funding and exam-oriented education system is the two most significant factors which have hampered engineering design process in China .
However , in its eleventh Five-Year Plan , the Chinese government has promised to increase the R&D spending to 2 .5 percent of GDP by the end of 2010 .
Also , the education system in well developed cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is under restructure to better prepare the younger generation to compete in the globalized world .
Thus , the condition of engineering design in China may have a more positive outlook in the future .
Nowadays , we have entered an age of technology .
It seems that technology is everywhere around us , and it has a great impact on our lives .
Therefore , it is beneficial for us to learn more about innovation and technology .
In general , technology can be divided into two types .
One kind of technology is conducted via research .
For example , in 1970s , a new tomato variety was launched by a research team in California .
This tomato variety could be harvested by machine , which was a big success .
The other one is discovered by serenity , and an example of it is the discovery of Warfarin , the effective rat killer .
These two examples both have their own features , since they belong to either type of technology respectively .
In my opinion , the innovation of mechanized tomato and Warfarin technology differ in their start , process and key to success .
The hard tomato program and the discovery of Warfarin started differently .
The program of hard tomato varieties began with an idea .
A California agriculture professor foresaw a future labor shortage in California and came up with a rough idea of tomatoes that could be picked by machine .
Then , he proposed this idea to his institution and got the research started .
However , the discovery of Warfarin happened during another research .
Prof Link , the discoverer of Warfarin , was involved in a research of sweet clove disease at that time .
After about ten years' research , he discovered Warfarin one day in an unrelated experiment , which turned out to be the most impressive progress in the whole research .
The big profit made by the patent was used to support other research projects of Madison professors , provide financial aid to doctoral students and cover other research expenses .
Moreover , the progresses of the two technologies are not alike .
The hard tomato program followed a whole procedure of research works .
A group of scientists were gathered together in an institution .
They were supposed to use the scientific approach to solve various unexpected problems occurring in the research .
In the process , development was extremely important .
Not only should the scientists figure out how to breed the variety , but also they needed to do other non-research works in order to successfully put the variety into practice .
They also cared about the commercialization part .
All of these included building a prototype of the machine used to pick the tomatoes , contacting producers who were willing to sell their products , making their research results known to the local farmers and collecting their feedbacks to improve .
Finally , they came up with their research results after many years' research , in due time according to their plan .
In contrast , in the case of Warfarin , the process was a reversed one .
The product came out first accidentally , followed up with some research to get a better understanding of the discovery .
Warfarin was put into practice directly after it , because its use was totally known when discovering it .
The whole process was highly effective and by chance .
No one expected it before head .
Besides , although both these two technology were successful , the keys to their success are different .
As the hard tomato program was a research project conducted by a group of people , I think the success was mainly due to teamwork and cooperation of the whole group .
On the contrary , the key to success in Warfarin lies on Prof Link , who discovered the chemical .
In conclusion , the mechanized tomato program has different start , process and key to success from the discovery of Warfarin .
Technology is progressing every day , and different products are created following these new technologies .
Our life become more convenient with these technological products and companies can benefit from producing these products .
However , not all the technological products can bring profit to their companies .
Before manufacturing a product , companies have to evaluate its profitability and denied those products with an uncertain future .
Engineers who are enthusiastic with these "no future" products form a group to work out the products , and this kind of groups are called "Skunk works" .
Conventionally generated technologies and technologies in "Skunk works" are of great difference while they still have features in common .
Technology in "Skunk works" is like a double-side sword , which not only can become a great success but also can be a super failure in future .
Working in a "Skunk works" environment is much tougher than in a conventional way , engineers working in "Skunk works" would not be rewarded unless their work turn out to be a success .
Nevertheless , both of "Skunk works" technology and conventional technology make contribution to technology development .
Comparing to conventional generated technology , "Skunk works" has a great possibility to become a big failure , while it also has a potential to be successful .
It is comfortable for engineers to make technology work and to optimize a design under given condition .
Whereas , a well optimized design is worthless if it cannot meet the desires , or at least needs , of the customers .
Therefore , on one hand , without sufficient market research , "Skunk works" is faced with a high potential to be a failure .
On the other hand , a talent "Skunk works" can also be a success in market .
Like E .M . Rogers mentioned in his article -"the Birth of the Laptop Computer at Toshiba" , laptop is a good example of successful "Skunk works" .
On the contrary , conventional generated technology is much safer than "Skunk works" , it can bring steady profit to its company , but , to most companies , playing safe is not enough to compete with their competitors .
"Skunk works" and conventional projects are different , but both of them are making contribution to the development of technology .
Conventional generated technologies are closely connected to our life .
By doing sufficient market research , technologies are controlled to provide things that can fulfill our desires , and these technologies make our life become more and more convenient .
"Skunk works" care more about technology itself , and its aim is to produce the most advanced and optimized designs .
Therefore , "Skunk works" can promote the innovation of technology , and it also provides a big platform for creative engineers .
With the largest population and adequate natural resources , China has developed quite well .
However , nowadays new technology is playing a more and more important role in the whole society and replacing the importance of resources .
However , there are two significant problems in China restricting the development of the technology .
One of them is that the intellectual property rights in China are not protected well; there are many illegal copy phenomena in China .
The other problem is that the normal employees in many companies are not valued much by the employers .
Normal employees are not inspirited also limits the innovation in technology .
There is no doubt that China has developed fast and well since the foundation of the country .
However , when we change our focus on the enterprises in China , we will find that most of the huge enterprises are public and relied on resources and monopoly .
Huge enterprises which relied on high technology are very few .
One of the reasons is that normal employees are not inspirited to take part in the innovation .
In many companies , only some certain research staffs take part in the innovation of technology while normal employees just do their routine work .
Compared to professional research staffs , normal employees have more experience about certain productions .
As the employers do not show much respect to normal employees , few employees will try their best to provide their experience to research staffs .
Without practical experience , research and innovation are difficult to achieve .
We probably know that IBM employers value every employee in the company .
Many employees have a chance to put up a suggestion to the company .
With the large amounts of outcomes of experience and observation , research staffs can achieve new production relatively more easily .
Therefore , that normal employees are not inspirited restricts the innovation of technology in China .
As the pace of society quickens , people around the world are faced with an increasing number of problems .
These problems could be man-made or naturally occurring .
Regardless of the cause , people have realized there is a need to find a way to solve these problems and improve their way of life .
This is where engineering design process plays an important role .
This process involves the identifying of the problem , gathering relevant information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting the most appropriate and feasible solution and finally , testing and implementing the solution in the real world .
However , not everything is smooth sailing , and there are problems that may hamper the engineering design process .
In Singapore , one of the problems that engineers might face during the engineering design process is that Singapore's education system is rigid .
Due to the inflexibility of the education system , Singaporeans have grown up getting used to rote learning .
This means they memorise formulae and information from the texts without really understanding , questioning and analyzing what they are studying .
This leads them to not being able to think out of the box and thinking of creative or alternative solutions other than those provided by the teaching system in Singapore .
Firstly , they would have trouble identifying problems in the real world .
The education system in Singapore works in such a way that the boundaries of problems are defined clearly .
There is usually a fixed method as to how a question is answered .
However , in reality , problems are not clearly seen and observation skills are needed to identify causes and sources of problems .
Engineers might also find it difficult to think of various approaches to tackle the problem , and also to use analytical skills to decide on the best method to solve the problem .
Secondly , as the information needed to solve questions and problems in school is already provided in textbooks and notes , engineers have not honed their skills of doing research for relevant information .
Thus , they might encounter trouble in gathering relevant information needed to solve the problem they may face .
Another major problem that engineers might face in Singapore is that people are less receptive to innovations and ideas as compared to the Western countries .
The older generation is especially resistant to change , and would rather use products that they are used to .
Thus , despite the presence of new innovations that would greatly improve their way of life , they might not be so accepting of these new products .
This would affect the testing and implementation of the solution during the process .
When surveying the feasibility of the solution , results would not be accurate as the target group of an older age would generally be less supportive towards the new idea .
If the customer base for the new innovation is too small , investors will be less willing to provide funds to fund research and development of new innovations and products , therefore affecting the whole design process .
In conclusion , it is inevitable that there will be problems that might affect the various stages of the design process .
However , measures have definitely been taken to tackle these problems .
For example , the education system now has definitely improved in terms of its rigidity .
Since 2005 , Ministry of Education  has introduced Project Work  to junior colleges in order to improve communicative skills of students , as well as to encourage building of teamwork among students .
Hopefully in the near future , more effort will be put in to encourage society to be more accepting of new innovations that would greatly change their way of life for the better , and also to implement in not just aspiring engineers but students in general , skills that they are able to use and apply in handling problems in the real world .

Engineering design process - Education transfer plan , Thesis 
Rapid industrialization is one of the main economic boosters that characterize today's society .
Singapore is a good example of such a society .
Since the 1960s , there was a paradigm shift from the low end industrialization to a high end industrialization thus resulting in a rapid depletion of the already scarce resources .
Land scarcity is one of the pressing human needs that may require immediate attention .
Engineering design processes are therefore created to meet the above mentioned human need .
One of the final processes is to analyse and select a solution .
According to Khandani , Ergonomics is crucial in the designing process because production of final products must not result in disaster .
For example , the construction of Nicole Highway initially resulted in injuries but after detailed analysis made by relevant experts , the final product is on its way to completion without casualty .
Construction of sky scrapers is relatively safe despite its height due to deep analytical insights in the construction of these buildings .
As a result , the final products serve its purpose without imposing damage to the surroundings .
In conclusion , engineering design processes are generic as they can cater to all possible problems and help to benefit mankind greatly .
Land scarcity is a good example of the applications of all these processes .
The naissance of all the greatest technologies and discoveries always have two different scenarios .
One is via research and the other is the result from some serendipitous discovery .
But history shows us sometimes the fates of the two kinds of technologies birthed in different ways are also not the same .
The "designs" are thought highly by people at the beginning , though the importance of the "accidents" is realized much later .
Actually the major cases of engineering inventions coincide with the "design" way .
Many great technologies can be successfully designed should owning to people persistent effect , countless experiment plenty of precise analysis and a mass of sources .
Though it's may just a matter of few second's time for the final success of a new technology development , the process from its infancy to maturity can be very long and tough .
With the coming out of a technology people will , of course , show their high concern on it , because it already cost a lot .
Take the atomic weapon test as an example , decades years ago the military of USA intent to make use of the power of atomic , they employed a lot human and non-human sources to complete numerous experiment and test , plenty of money was spent to invite talented scientists and engineers to come to help them make the most powerful weapon all through the human's history .
According to the information from Wikipedia "The Manhattan Project cost 2 billion dollar , this includes the cost of the two bombs used as well as the test bomb .
This would be about 23 billion US dollars today .
The development and production of the delivery device  cost more than the Manhattan Project ."
Then US treated this new technology as their most precious weapon , of course it was deserved .
Compared to the development of atomic bomb , the discovery of gunpowder is just an accident or something unexpectable that no one plans to make it realize before it really happen .
In my opinion , this must be very crucial to explain why nobody attaches importance to this new technology at first .
That's to say , though , technologies like that may somehow change the world , it is not in people's contemplation , time is needed for people to realize the existence of them and learn more about them .
In 2005 , one of the most dreadful news revealed that {Kuwait}'s {Al Burqan Oil Field} , which is the second largest oil field in the world will be depleted before the middle of this century  .
Meanwhile , the up-going oil price also indicates an undoubting truth that we are facing a tough challenge , energy crisis .
According to oxford English dictionary  , engineering is defined as the "science , discipline , art and profession of acquiring and applying technical , scientific and mathematical knowledge to design and implement materials , structures , machines , devices , systems , and {processes} that safely realize a desired objective or inventions ."
Overwhelmed by the demand of energy , to increase the energy efficiency should be viewed as the priority of the desired objective or inventions of engineering design .
Toshiba's laptop and Microsoft's operating systems are two technologies that are created under different conditions and environment .
Toshiba's laptop is often known as a skunk work innovation whereas Microsoft's , as a conventionally created product .
The key difference in these two products is the support they received during the creation process .
However , both are known to be successful creations .
The first difference is the lack of support for the creation of Toshiba's laptop as compared to Microsoft's operating system .
According to Rogers , due to the fact that Toshiba's laptop creator Tetsuya Mizoguchi failed to convince his superiors in Toshiba to support his laptop project , he was not able to receive any research and development funds .
The funds would have been useful to help him cover the cost of production .
Furthermore , his superiors refused to assign experienced engineers to aid him . 
* {en .wikipedia .org/wiki/United_States_Microsoft_antitrust_case}
In comparison , although Bill Gates himself is the boss of Microsoft , he received much external support .
In January 1975 , the president of Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems  agreed to let Gates and his partner to develop a program for MITS new microcomputer .
It would be useless if there is no hardware for Gates' program to work on .
With this , he went on to create new programs with the support of his entire team at Microsoft . 
The vision of these two innovators also differs .
Bill Gates' way of running the business is largely monopolistic .
According the article  , Gates actually wrote to computer hobbyist demanding that they pay for the usage of his program so as to allow him to continue to write quality programs .
In May 1998 , Microsoft is accused of abusing its monopoly power to keep rivals out of the market .
Its operating system is believed to favour Microsoft's web browser and not other competing browsers like the Netscape Navigator and Opera . 
On the other hand , Mizoguchi idea was to create a laptop that is compatible with IBM's platform despite the fact that they were competing for the same market share .
He recognised that IBM is dominant at the time and it would be fair to the consumers to allow them to use IBM compatible peripheral Toshiba's laptop .
If Mizoguchi had done otherwise , we would probably have to buy only Toshiba's laptop for its convenience .
Despite the difference in both technologies , there is actually one similarity between them .
That is , both are largely successful .
Mizoguchi , with his perseverance and determination , finally sold the highly demanded laptops in Europe .
By 1988 , Toshiba commanded almost half the market share in Japan , despite the fact that there were many competitors . 
Similarly for Microsoft , Gates rode on the success of IBM's personal computer by becoming the full owner for a program that was written especially for IBM's personal computer .
The program was then sold to IBM , without the copyright .
This had allowed them to be a monopoly in the industry .
In conclusion , despite the fact that both skunk work and conventionally created technologies differ in environment where they are being produced , they will still be successful if their creators have the determination and are full of ideas .
* The Birth of the Laptop Computer at Toshiba by E .M . Rogers
* {en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Bill_Gates}
The birth of new technologies and inventions came about in different forms and through different processes .
Although the innovations maybe comparably similar , the conditions where they were created maybe totally different .
An example would be in the case of conventionally invented electric cars by General Motors and the first laptop that was invented in a skunk works environment by an engineer from Toshiba .
There are certain differences and similarities between these two .
Differences like , risks involved , working environments , marketing strategies while similarities like the visions and goals of both innovations .
The first difference between the two types of innovations is risks involvement and work stress .
For conventionally generated technology , companies would select a team or department and assign tasks to them .
Then , they would set out to complete their tasks , without having to calculate the risks involved because these are what they are supposed to do .
For skunk works environment's created technology , the person who suggested the innovation has to take very big risks because it is a project of his own , he was not supported by companies , only his own team .
As said in Rogers' article on the 'Birth of laptops' , Tetstiya Mizoguchi , a Japanese technologist , disobeyed orders and risked his career for the sake of innovation-development which in the end , he succeed .
Therefore , risk taking is unavoidable in skunk works .
Secondly , the processes in which the new technology are designed and carried out between the two types of innovations are totally different .
The electric car was researched and built by the R&D department from General Motors .
The team had full funding from the company to support their costs in researching and designing electric motor cars .
On the other hand , Tetstiya Mizoguchi who led the invention of the first laptop , had no team initially and was not funded by his company because his proposal of creating a laptop , was rejected by his company .
Therefore , people who are working under skunk works environment have to gather their own team and a substantial amount of money before they can actually start on their project .
As such , because of limited funds the team or individual have in skunk works , they possessed larger stress because they could not afford to fail .
Because of disapprovals from companies , the working space for skunk works innovation is usually smaller and limited as compared to those who worked under companies to create new technology .
As said in Rogers' article  , Tetstiya Mizoguchi and his team went 'underground' and work at a factory which was far away from the headquarters of Toshiba .
Therefore , for skunk works innovations , people have to find their own team , funding , and workspace to carry out their project .
The third difference is the limitations of marketing .
For conventional innovations headed by big companies , they have their own marketing department to advertise and test their products .
They have the ability to make their products appealing to the public and attract them to test their prototypes .
In the case of the creation of electric motor cars by General Motors written by Rogers , General Motors had gone to the extent of putting advertisements on the newspaper and came out with marketing campaigns to publicise their new product .
On the contrary , products or technology created from skunk works environment do have the capabilities to roll out massive campaigns to advertise due to the lack of funds .
They had to depend on their own network to publicise their product and introduce their prototypes to the public .
Comparing the two articles written by Rogers , the target group for skunk works prototypes testing usually started small , and then eventually became bigger as more people accept the product; whereas in the case of conventionally created products , the target group is very large in the beginning due to large scale marketing campaigns .
The similarity between the innovations created under different environments is that both had wanted to come out with solutions to solve problems that were present .
In the case of Toshiba first laptop invention , Tetstiya Mizoguchi wanted to solve the problem which most Japanese companies faced , the crowded offices which prevented the usage of more desktops due to the lack of space; while , electric motor cars were created to lessen pollution .
In conclusion , for innovations by conventions or skunk works environment , there are various differences and similarities between them , but at the end of the day , both produced products that helped to solve problems and bring benefits to the people in the world .
In 1943 , Abraham Maslow published a theory on what he believes is the hierarchy of needs of people .
In his study , he defined five stages of needs; they are , in descending order of importance , physiological , safety , love and belonging , esteem and finally self-actualization .1 In view of the world today , we engineers should tackle the most important human need that needs the most urgent attention .
This is of course one of our basic physiological needs , water , which is imperative in sustaining lives , especially in harsh environments .
The five stage engineering design process , as proposed by Khandani , will guide us in making solutions that solve this problem .

Potable water , the source of life , has become the largest demand in third world countries .
Drinking water that has not been treated clean can lead to life threatening diseases .
According to the World Health Organization report in the year 2000 , Africa , home to a population of 784 million people , faces dire shortages of clean and disease free , drinking water .
3 Furthermore , it is the continent with the least supply of potable water .
Nearly 48% of its human population has no immediate access to water supplies .
This is clearly a problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible .

5BBC News , "New straw to kill disease as you drink" , May 2006 , {news .bbc .co .uk/2/hi/africa/4967452 .stm}
According to Khandani , the first step is to define the problem of the water shortage in Africa .
It is important that engineer realize the true need of the problem , so as to waste resources on a solution that does not work .
For instance , one may think of solving the water shortage by building desalination plants throughout the coast of Africa , but only to realize that he or she did not address the problem it at all .
Because the water shortage may not lie in the quantity of water , but rather , lies in the ease of access to potable water in Africa .
Hence , the first stage of the engineering design process has to be thought out carefully .
The second step is to research on the shortage of potable water .
Engineers have to understand why current technology has failed to solve the water shortage , and the oversights engineers of the previous technology .
For example , a company has produced "LifeStraw" , a portable device that processes safe drinkable water to by removing microscopic bacteria through its filters .
4 Something like this may seem like a godsend to the people of Africa , but quickly follows its downfall is its cost and the problem of transportation of filtered water .
5 Therefore , a thorough understanding of the limitations of technology can guide engineers to invent a product that fulfills all criteria of the need .
Lastly , the fifth step is to make and test the developed technology .
This allows engineers to troubleshoot problems in the device and make changes prior to production .
This ensures the product meets expectations of the problem .
In a nutshell , we can see how the five stages of engineering design introduced by Khandani can help engineers plan and develop solutions to solving the water shortage in Africa , thereby saving countless lives in dire need of safe drinking water .

Facebook , History; en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Facebook
As mentioned , skunkworks are always lack of resources , which funding ranked first out of others .
As a start-up , Facebook didn't have the funding which its competitor  , Myspace has .
As the history suggests , Myspace has everything in control when they first launched , including funding .
The site was designed by the experienced eUniverse engineers .
Unlike Facebook , Myspace used its resources to push its program to the masses .
Thus , they get instant popularity in the beginning .
However , Facebook trounced Myspace recently , setting its user number to a record high .
Clearly can be seen , skunkworks are no loser to conventional technology despite funding problems .
While conventionally generated technology are opened to public , skunkworks undertake secret project .
Before Facebook was created , Mark hacked into Harvard School system to get the information of all the students while others are sleeping soundly .
He posted the information up on a site called Facemash which paired photos of undergraduates with the visitors .
Soon Harvard yanked Mark's connection .
Nevertheless , Mark didn't stop right there .
Instead , he scarified his sleeping time to program another program to replace Facemash , which is Facebook we all are using today .
He started off the program alone without opening it to public before it was launced .
While Myspace took a different approach to show the public what they were doing .
The reason lies beneath could be the confidence Myspace had over their program because of the size of their resources which Facebook didn't have .
Although there are many differences between skunkworks and conventional technology , both of them drive innovation in the same way as the other .
Despite the fact that the approaches they take are obviously different , they share the same goal , which is to innovate the future products .
Either Facebook or Myspace , we can use them to share information without borders .
They are competing between each other by introducing new features .
Thereby , the healthy competition between both parties should improve one another .
In conclusion , innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment is comparable to conventionally generated technology .

One of the few positive impacts arose by Iraq war is that governments as well as individuals came into awareness of how our dependence on oil , gas and other petrol products can trap us into serious situation once the supply of petrol is limited .
Moreover , the importance of finding new , sustainable and eco-friendly energy sources is now aware by people .
For solving this problem , no one else is more suitable than engineers .
Indeed , the utmost purpose for the existence of engineers is to improve the living standard and satisfy the higher requirements of human beings by creating or improving the products used in daily life .
In daily life , energy supply is so important because almost all the human activities , like cooking , working , heating and even water supply cannot work normally without electricity , and the emerging energy shortage is impossible to solve without the development of new energy source .
Thus , government should give priority to the research of economy , environmental-friendly and sustainable energy .
The basic steps for engineers to find new energy is shown as below .
The energy crisis appears to be increasingly serious as human beings' consumption keep increasing while the increase in energy supply is slow .
Since engineers are the most important in discovering new energy sources and the aim of their work is to meet people's needs , they should give priority to the development of new energy .
Since 2000 , our government has been driving Singapore towards a Knowledge-based Economy .
On one hand , much effort and fund has been put into our education system to prepare our people for the Knowledge-based Economy .
On the other hand , Singapore has always been encouraging companies , regardless of their size , to do more in Research and Development  .
The reason for doing these is our government has realised the importance of R&D in our progress as a nation .
Although much effort and fund has been spent on R&D , some problems still exist to significantly hinder engineering design processes for innovations .
In conclusion , some problems may significantly hinder engineering design processes for innovations , but Singapore is trying its best to solve these problems .
In addition , in this imperfect world , engineers are always solving the arising problems to make a better world .
A problem will not last infinitely , it will be solved eventually .
Over the last couples of years , with the developing of China , all industries , especially manufacturing industry , are developing into a large scale .
However , it is strange that not so much big companies like Lenovo and Haier exist with such a large-scale industry and such a large home market .
Instead , millions of small companies are operating their small business everywhere , and large transnational corporations are enjoying their profit in Chinese market .
How come ?
I think it is because of lacking innovations in engineering designs .
Many companies , especially the small ones , are following others' steps to design and manufacture their products , expecting some profits in the market are still there , left for them .
Then , another question rise: what hamper innovations in engineering design ?
I think there are two primary reasons , high costs in engineering design with relatively low rewards and unsatisfying engineering education system .
Firstly , many companies lack money to support innovations in their product design .
As I mentioned , many manufacturing companies in China are running their business in a small-scale .
What they manage to do is making their designs slight different from other similar ones , which make their products quite elastic in the market .
These companies have to take the price from the market , which indicates a meagre profit .
And that is why they do not have enough money .
For most case , the circle continues until they shut down .
Moreover , even if companies have enough money to support innovative design , they may not do so .
In Chinese emerging market , not all invests in innovation are rewarding .
Instead , just following others is proved to be more profitable sometimes .
Another group of companies are manufacturing products for large transnational corporations , which do not care about design .
Secondly , the engineering education is not focusing so much on innovation but memorizing .
This limits engineers' ideas when they are designing products .
Thus , engineers are more likely to use the similar module that they learn in school or university instead of bothering to consider another , perhaps a better , way .
According to Dr . Seyyed Khandani , five steps for solving engineering problems are:
* Define the problem
3 .
Generate multiple solutions
4 .
Analyze and select a solution
5 .
Test and implement the solution
However , many engineers educated in universities usually focus more on how to get a solution using formulas and laws .
Other steps are neglected unfortunately .
Behind prosperity of the products "made in China" during the last few years , it is lack of innovations in products of Chinese local manufacture companies .
And the main reasons why we lack innovation are high costs and low rewards of innovation in China and unsatisfying engineering education system .
I hope things are starting to change now .
The common challenges faced by every developed and developing countries are the daily demands for improvement in various areas , be it economy , infrastructure or even society .
Nation building is never easy; hence governments worldwide engage specialists , engineers in particular , for assistance .
Engineers plying their trades in Singapore , however , will face two major problems amidst the common obstacles , in which they are potentially critical in the future development of the city-state .
Singapore , besides being famous for its airport and topping many surveys for the best , most recently named as the best place for business by the World Bank , it is also famous because of its size despite being termed as a "developed country" .
Hence , local engineers encounter their first major test in their quest: limited land spaces .
With just 647 square kilometres of land area , it has always been an essential as well as historical issue for the country's development .
Land limitation greatly reduces the range of technological advances local engineers can create in our country .
For example , lack of wide drainage areas force us to adapt building waste water reclamation plants instead , which admittedly drew ridicule from our neighbouring countries .
Despite plans ongoing to build a third plant , we are still rather reliant on Malaysia for the sale of water .
Reclamation of land from the ocean was also limited due to sensitivity border issues , thus hindering any designs that require huge spaces .
Burning of waste materials hence provide our major source of energy instead of bulky power plants .
Past engineering miracles in housing now require an upgrade in innovation and design due to the cultural shift in our society , as the younger generation now demands quality unlike the past , when the more crucial task is providing a roof for every citizen .
There is another common global issue , especially worst in Japan , and that is the ageing population crisis in Singapore .
The entry into the 21st century provides the world with a whole new set of problems: pandemic flu , terrorism and the emergence of a group of senior citizens .
Singapore has no chance of avoiding it as it also experienced a post war 'baby boom' period during the 1960s .
A new research report revealed that Singapore is set to be the world's third- fastest ageing nation , as the proportion of those aged 65 and above will double to 20 per cent in 2020 .
Adding on to this problem Singapore , being a small country , has always faced a talent crisis .
Low birth rates coupled with the outflow of local talents force the government to resort to adopting a foreign talent scheme in order to increase the talent pool in the city .
An ageing population creates a new dilemma to engineers working on their designs , because they have to rebuild or edit all their past creations so as to be 'elderly-friendly' , a phenomenon unheard of during the early days of nation building .
This will be a somewhat testing task as they cannot rely on any past references in Singapore , so any designs will be a risk taken by them .
Nowadays we are living in a fast developing world which provides not only abundant goods but also convenient and functional productions .
People's increasing desire for higher living qualities push our engineers to work on designing new things .
While , things does not get on as it seems to be .
Many negative factors exert on the processes for innovations that significantly hamper the design .
Now focus on the things in my home country , China , there are two main factors: the overflow of copying and lack of money .
Since USSR's Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant was established on June 27th 1954 , nuclear power has becoming one of the most important energy resources in the world .
By 2007 , an estimated of 14% of the global electricity come from nuclear reactions according to the International Atomic Energy Agency .
And due to the ever increasing consumption of oil and its limited reserves , it is predicted that there would be a further surge for nuclear energy .
Nuclear power was first discovered scientist in 19th century .
They realized that heavy nuclei , which were unstable , would undergo fission if collided with highly energetic particles to gain stability .
In this process , a certain amount of energy would be released because of the decrease in the total mass of the products and reactants .
Since the equation governing this change is E=mc^2 , an enormous amount of energy could be released even if there is an only a tiny amount of change in the mass .
In addition , no byproducts will be produced .
As a result , it is perceived as an alternative of liable energy resources .
However , the development of nuclear power is greatly affected by non-technical issues , namely military , political and economical factors .
Recently , Iran and North Korea are facing sanctions from various countries and continent because of their nuclear development .
Both countries are accused of possessing nuclear weapons which would present a great threat to the world .
In this case , it clearly presented how political factors structured the advancement of important technology like nuclear power .
In North Korea's case , they started the development of nuclear technology because of the raise of tension with South Korea .
Hence , they regarded nuclear development as a way to sort out the disputes over policies .
At the same time , Iran makes use of nuclear power to resist American policies and its influence in the region as well .
For nations like Iran and North Korea , the development of nuclear power is mainly determined by the political forces .
It is employed as a means to achieve certain political goals whereas the technical aspects are inferior .
Despite the political impact on the nuclear technologies in the less developed world , military forces are likely to exert a similar impact on development of nuclear power in those more developed countries .
For instance , the US military force considers nuclear power as viable source to provide energy for the military uses .
Due to logistic reason combined with the unstoppable depletion rate , scientists in the United State is diverting most of their funding into research of how to make nuclear power as a readily mobile and less dangerous energy source for military uses .
In conclusion , the recent innovation and development have showed the impact of political , military and other social factors .
Moreover , they are likely to exert a greater influence in the future .
As the development of technology , the abilities of innovation have becoming more and more important all over the world .
In order to survive and develop in the competitive world , it is crucial for not only many countries but also the individuals to fully develop the process for innovations .
According to Rogers  , there are six main stages of this process , namely the needs and problems , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and the stage of consequences .
However , in some countries there are still many problems which restrict the development of these stages .
Take China as example; there are two main problems in hampering the development of innovation .
First of all , the education system has great effects on the process of recognizing the problems or needs which is the fundamental stage of innovation-development process .
It is true that the Chinese special education system has excellent achievements in laying the solid foundations of knowledge and skills which are also very important in doing the deeper researches and studies , but the lack of flexibility and creativeness of Chinese education-system is still a big problem .
As a result , many students get used to accepting the information in the references without thinking and investigating by themselves .
Consequently , it becomes quite difficult for them to discover the potential problems even when they try to to do it .
However , Innovation requires students to develop the ability of discovering problems instead of easily satisfying with the current situations or just following the rules .
In fact , most of the famous inventions or significant scientific discoveries are based on the ability of questioning .
If Watt did not realize the shortcomings of the traditional streamer , the age of stream may be cannot come so fast .
If Galileo did not challenge and simply accepted the statements presented by Aristotle thousands years ago , people may still not realize the nature of free fall motion for a long time .
Without the awareness of recognizing or discovering the problems , the innovation process cannot proceed smoothly .
In addition to the education problems , the economic development is also one of the important limitations for China .
General speaking , the success of innovation needs a lot of premises .
Not only the human resources , but also the financial resources have impacts on the development of innovation .
The implementation of many big projects or innovations requires large amounts of economic foundation .
Indeed , the economy of China is accelerating at high speed recently .
However , it is really hard to meet all the needs of the rapid innovation-development in the past .
Comparing with some developed countries , China still cannot provide large amounts of financial aids in encouraging and supporting scientists and engineers in doing the process of research and putting these innovations into practice .
In a nutshell , for the importance of developing the processes for innovation , it is quite necessary to solve these existing problems nowadays .
Only if China try to minimize these potential limitations , will the innovation-development processes success and flourish .
Penicillin is a type of antibiotic that is used against bacterial infections .
It is a serendipitous discovery made by Alexander Fleming from a petri-dish with bacteria left behind from his experiments when he went for a holiday .
In-vitro fertilization is the process of making fertilization of eggs with sperms outside the womb of the mother and the technique is invented through researches .
Many may think that serendipitous discoveries are just by luck , but through the comparison of penicillin and in-vitro fertilization , we will realize that serendipitous discoveries are just as complex and impactful as technologies created through research .
There is a distinctive difference in the aims and the expected results achieved for the experiments that resulted in penicillin and in-vitro fertilization due to the element of luck .
Rogers  suggested that researches with the objective of providing solutions for one problem might result in solutions that are useful for another problem .
Indeed , for the case of penicillin , Fleming did not anticipate the discovery of penicillin , a type of antibiotics , when he was making researches on the characteristics of bacteria .
On the other hand , In-vitro fertilization is researched upon and invented with the primarily objective of conceiving babies outside the wombs of mothers .
Therefore , there is a difference in the objectives of the two experiments in the setup - one set and achieved its goals and the other , set goals but achieved other results .
However , despite the difference in the expected results of the experiments leading to the discovery of penicillin and in-vitro fertilization , the environments in which both technologies were developed and the processes taken are similar .
Fleming did his experiments in his laboratory as he was a professor in a hospital .
Likewise , Carl Wood  and various other scientists did their experiments on the in-vitro fertilization techniques on egg cells in laboratories too .
After the discovery of anti-bacteria substance , Fleming did his researches to improve on the results just like what the researchers for In-vitro fertilization did .
Both the technologies have to go through laboratory testing and many other processes before the final formula is derived .
Hence , both the technologies are developed in a laboratory environment with sufficient equipments for their testing and both requires extra steps even after discovering the correct method of making the technology .
In addition , both the technologies are developed not only by the person who founded the technology .
Penicillin was actually extracted successfully from the fungus by Ernst Chain .
Also , in-vitro fertilization would not be successful if not for other researchers such as John Rock , Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards besides Carl Wood . 
In conclusion , even though penicillin's discovery was accidental , we can see from the comparison of the two technologies that the invention is actually comparable to those developed by researches .
The developments of both technologies are similar in terms of the complexity of the processes and the impacts of the technologies are equivalent .
Everyone will grow old one day; it is just another phase in life .
With every phase in life , comes its own set of problems .
Throughout the process of aging , people will face certain problems relating to health , finance , and social and so on; and many of these problems are usually interrelated .
Just like every set of lock comes with a set of keys , every set of problems comes with their own set of solutions .
Now , with the help of technological advancements and the reforms of government policies , the aging process has certainly been made easier to a large extent .
Extensive research and development has been done in the medical field to make our lives easier .
Through research and development , new technologies are being created .
With the help of these technologies , many possibilities are formed .
Diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past are now curable .
Many diseases can be detected earlier and thus prevented .
Also , many age-related problems can be cured , either fully or to a large extent , using these new technologies .
All these have helped to make the process of aging easier; whereby the aged can lead better lives with fewer health problems .
Also through research and development , many lifestyle guides that help create healthy lifestyle , becomes available .
It is known that by having a healthy lifestyle , one will have fewer health problems; and thus , spending less on healthcare .
By saving more on healthcare , the financial stress on the aged will be relieved .
Therefore , through the help of research and development , the aged live better lives , and have fewer health problems .
However , as healthcare technologies improve , the costs of healthcare also increase .
As these new technologies involve the usage of newer , and more advanced equipments , the costs of using such technologies tend to be higher than the past .
There is a small percentage of the elderly who are not financially secure .
For them , using such new technologies is either impossible , or it will create further financial problems .
Also , another side effect of improved healthcare technologies is that people tend to have a longer lifespan .
With prolonged life , the aged might face certain issues .
There are diseases which are incurable , but the life of the victim can be prolonged using these new technologies .
However , these technologies are expensive .
By prolonging the life of the victim , it can be financially draining on the family , and cause financial and social tension within the family .
This becomes the case where solving one problem creates another .
However , with the help of government policies , this problem can be solved .
Financial aids can be made available to these families; and help relieve the financial stress .
Recently , government policies have also undergone several reforms to better cater to the aged in the society .
These reforms in policies are aimed to help the aged cope better with aging .
These policies encourage the elderly to retire later .
Also , they lower barriers to elder employment .
With these , the aged can have longer working life , and thus accumulating more wealth to support themselves through their old age .
Also , the government helps relieved financial stress by subsidizing healthcare costs , and providing financial aids to the elderly needy .
These healthcare costs include hospital and caretaker fees .
Healthcare system is also restructured to cater to the aged .
An example is by building more community hospitals , nursing homes , and home care .
These will provide competent and appropriate care for the elderly patients .
Through the reforms of the government policies , the aged has been well taken care of .
In conclusion , current research and development , and policies have certainly helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
New technologies have been created to help eliminate many of the age-related health problems .
Government policies and the restructuring of the healthcare system have helped the aged cope better with life .
However , not every elderly in the society can get to enjoy these perks , especially those who are bounded by financial problems .
Therefore through current research and development and policies , the aging process has been made easier , but it is only to a large extent .
Until recently , the problems of aging population have become a major concern among all the nations throughout the world .
Governments of many countries have come up with policies and solutions to decrease elder dependency and slowing down the process of a fast aging population .
Aging statistics taken from the United States of America administration of aging shows people above the age of 65 represented 12 .4% of the population in the year 2000 but are expected to grow to be 20% of the population by 2030 .
The statistics have shown that in time to come , the problems of a fast aging population will be too overwhelming for the society to handle , therefore we have to slow down the aging process .
A fast aging population will have serious detrimental effects in developed countries .
Caring for health of the aging population will pose a problem for the government .
The country's economy will also suffer as a small amount of young working population will have to support a bigger umbrella of elder generation .
This will tax and stress heavily on the small working population .
A lot of resources will also have to be spend on the elderly people .
However , policies have helped to reduce the effects of an aging population .
I have to agree that current developments and policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Singapore has encouraged people to retire at an older age and companies to keep their employees for a longer time .
Legislative changes were made in Singapore in 1993 to put the retirement age at 60 , and then to move it up again from 60 to 62 years in 1999 .
This will help the working people to save more money and be more financially independent when they are old and have no income .
In this way , the working population will not be stressed on too much by the elderly population .
The government also has encouraged and provided incentives for companies to employ elderly workers .
This will help the elderly to be more in touch with the society and keep their physical health in good shape which will in turn reduce diseases .
Singapore has also help working adults to save money when they are working so that when they retire , they will still have money for living expenses .
Singapore introduced the Central Provident Fund  in 1995 as a compulsory saving scheme to help workers to benefit in their retirement .
Employees will contribute twenty percent of their salary while employers will contribute thirteen percent towards this saving scheme for workers .
The purpose of this saving scheme is to emphasize on self reliance .
To meet healthcare needs , Medisave was introduced to allow CPF members to use their CPF savings for hospitalization .
In this way , most problems of the aging population is taken care of .
Singapore has also emphasize and instill filial piety to the children of the aging population and to support their parents through meeting their financial needs and emotional needs .
The children of the future should provide for their parents as much they can even though their financial status looks bleak so that the aging population will not have to rely too much on government help .
Children also should arrange for their parents to live under the same roof so as not to only provide for them financially but also to show care and concern to their aging parents .
For example , children of the aging parents are able to bring their parents to consult a doctor if any minor medical conditions arise , thus preventing serious illnesses from developing .
Singapore has encouraged people to buy a HDB flat near their parent by subsidizing a substantial amount of money .
By living together , the children can also provide a listening ear to their parents and even warn them against making wrong decisions .
This will definitely reduced the fiscal cost of elder dependency .
However , some critics might disagree with this strategy .
No matter how much we encourage young people to care for their parents , it's still their personal choice , the society or the government cannot force them to do their part .
However , if the government does a good job in educating the young people and introducing policies to encourage young people to be more caring towards their aging parents , this would be a very effective strategy .
This is because what the aging population needs are their children providence and their care and concern .
In conclusion , I think that many developments and policies have helped to reduce the aging process and also solving the problem of a fast aging population .
Although this problem cannot be solved in a short period of time , theses policies and development will help to curb the problems of an aging population .
Nowadays , against a changing technology background , many of the social problems that have troubled people for centuries are being eased .
Among them is the aging problem , which leads to a restructuring of the social composition .
Many pessimistic predicts were made by people about this problem .
However , with the assist of Information and Communication technology  , the situation could be fundamentally shifted through mainly three ways .
Firstly , the development of ICT can reduce the aged people's difficulties by changing the workspace .
Instead of being forced to travel from and to the office every day , now they can simply stay at home and finish their work through the internet .
This change effectively eliminates their disadvantages in lack of mobility compared to the young people .
Coming along with the workspace shift , the job itself will also change .
Nowadays , fewer and fewer jobs are requiring certain level of performance .
Those repetitive and tedious jobs are now performed by machine and jobs become more of management people and resources , especially with Information Technology as the medium .
This change of job nature makes a huge difference to the aged people's captivity for their body conditions are no longer their employer's top concern .
Besides by changing the workspace , ICT also brings good news to the aged by changing employment relationships .
It is well known that for the aged people , jobs are really hard to find .
9 out of 10 employers would be reluctant to hire an old people because they are in fear that they can not work as efficiently  .
However , with the introduction of ICT , many more new jobs are created , large percentage of which are self-employed jobs .
So for the elderly , a new choice is offered to them: after their retirement , instead of heading into the job market and compete with people probably half their age for a post , they can start up their own business .
There are plenty of opportunities out there on the internet .
What matters is their smell , not their age .
The opponent may probably argue that ICT is a privilege that only benefits the young people .
However , the truth cannot be farther than that .
Although young people have an advantage for they are exposed to the technology from early ages , the aged people still stand a high chance to succeed , as long as they can adapt to new features quickly .
After all , the internet is a common property which every one can enjoy a share .
Current research and development in the field of ICT has largely shapes the society .
It makes aged people remain productive by changing the workspace , reforming the employment relationship and offering easy access to re- education .
Technologies like this promise to offer us even more new dimensions to deal with existing social problems in the years to come .
Aging is becoming a hotter problem when the percentage of the elderly in the society is continuously increasing .
Certainly , when the number of aged people raises , public spending on this group will have to be raised as well to take care of this group .
However , I think there should be a limit on how much shall be spent for the elderly , because government needs to emphasize the money more on country development .
First of all , spending money on development is the most effective way to address the aging population issue .
Actually , the problem of more population getting aged does not lie in the demographic change , but in the fact that the productivity of the nation will get declined .
When the government try to spend more and more for the aged , it will leads to a lack in money for development , then a slower economic growth , which finally leave the government with less choice to spend for the elderly people .
In contrast , when focusing on country development , particularly economic growth , the country can earn more money .
With this extra money , the government can have more to spend for the whole society , and the money for the aged will be increased as well .
In fact , "if real economic growth averages about 2 percent per year between now and 2050" , Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer claim , "government expenditures as a proportion of the economy in 2050 might not be substantially larger than what it is today"  .
Secondly , imposing a limit on public spending for the aged can make people spending money more responsibly .
For most people , bearing in mind that they will have to take care more for themselves when they are old will force them to save money for the future .
They therefore will have to think more when spending money , and reducing wasting extra money on unimportant things .
Moreover , nowadays , with better living condition for the whole life of a person , attributing old people with bad health seems to be not so true for many cases .
Hence , extra care such as extra health diagnostic may not be necessary for many elderly people .
With less money received , social organizations which host these activities will have to choose people to serve more carefully and this can also save much money .
From the opposing view , many people argue that the aged are the most vulnerable group in the society and thus needing more and more attention .
However , to help these people become less vulnerable , it is not so good to do so when they are already aged .
"Prevention is better than cure" .
Thus , focusing on social development as a whole , and improving living condition throughout the life of people is actually better way to help people gain a better health and become less vulnerable when they are aged .
Moreover , when more money is spent for people when they are younger , it could raise a better workforce for the nation .
The productivity of the country will therefore be increased , and again , with more wealth earned , public spending in general , and on the aged , in particulars , will be increased as a certain result .
In conclusion , although the population of the earth in general is getting aged , which could lead to certain consequence , the government should not be panic to address that problem in a short term way by increase public spending for the aged as high as possible .
Rather , the government should focusing on develop the nation as a whole , especially maintaining the economic growth , because this is the long term and most effective way to solve aging problem .
Have present studies , development and policies helped to relieve the aging process ?
This is the question many people grapple with and the core of the debate lies in the impact they bring on the aging process .
In my opinion , I agree to a large extent that current research , development and policies have helped eased the aging process .
In the course of my essay , I will first show how economics , medicine , architectural , technological inventions and social policies have helped eased the aging process while financial constraint can limit the effectiveness of easing the aging process .
Firstly , economics have helped eased the aging process .
Due to the growth in the awareness of the different financial needs over an individual's life cycle , financial institutions have designed and introduced a wide range of products to meet these needs .
For example , a person will need health insurance to protect oneself from the high cost of medical treatment .
Also , with the insurance coverage , an individual can seek adequate medical treatment to recover from any sickness .
The various products available helped to minimize the impact of unforeseen events so that an individual can save resources to meet aging needs .
In addition , as education opportunities increase , economies around the world has transformed from labour intensive to knowledge-based .
This has extended the working life of the labour force .
With longer working life , people will be able to accumulate more wealth which they can use to support themselves in their old age .
Therefore , people will have saved enough money by the time when they are old to maintain a certain standard of living .
Secondly , architecture has also helped eased the aging process .
With the growing advocate for obstruction free building design , the mobility of the senior population is significantly increased .
For example , buildings are fitted with lifts , ramps and more railings to allow people who are physically challenged to access .
With mobility , the elder generation can have the same mobility options as they were young and continue to live their lives on their own .
The reduced dependency on others will ease the pain of aging .
Thirdly , the modern state of technology has significantly eased the process of aging .
Many tasks in life are made easy with technology .
For example , robotic vacuum cleaners have made housekeeping very much effortless .
The safety features in household appliances has enabled the elderly to take care of their own needs safely .
Overall , technology allowed the elderly to reduce their dependency on others , and improves the quality of their lives .
Fourthly , advancements in medicine have significantly increased the life expectancy of mankind .
Many diseases that have plagued mankind in the past are now curable or can be vaccinated .
Long term illness such as diabetes is more effectively controlled , and the treatment process has become less painful .
As one ages , they need not suffer the torment of illness as the previous generations did , and are able to spend more time on other meaningful activities .
Fifthly , various social policies have been introduced to ease the aging process .
For example , filial obligation is stressed through informal and formal channels to increase the willingness of the next generation to support their own elderly parents .
With their children supporting them , the elderly will no doubt be happier and enjoy their golden age .
Furthermore , in some countries such as Britain and Singapore , people are required to provide for their own old age dependency .
They are compelled by law to save and invest more of their income earned while they are active in the work force .
In this way , the elderly will have a sum of money available to support themselves in their golden age when they retired .
However , many of these advances discussed require financial resources to achieve .
For example , the wide range of financial and technological products comes at a cost .
For those who are not able to afford them , they will not be able to enjoy the benefits .
Social policies also require funding in order to put the plan into action .
Therefore , the ability of recent advancements to ease the aging process can be greatly limited by financial constraints .
In conclusion , economics , medicine , architecture , technological inventions and social policies have helped to ease the aging process but they required financial resources to achieve .
Therefore , the elderly and their children supporting them must have sufficient financial resources in order to take advantage of the benefits of modern day advancements to ease the aging process .
In recent years , there is an increasing number of countries faced with an ageing population .
The problems of an ageing population have led to these countries coming up with measures to counter effect the problems .
One of which is to increase public spending so as to ensure that the aged are taken care .
Yet , at the same time , this money could be spent on other areas of the country's development .
Therefore , some may argue that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , I do not support this argument as increasing public spending on the aged is a necessary step for the government to take in order to prepare the country to face an ageing population .
Firstly , improving on current facilities to better suit the aged is compulsory .
We have to prepare more healthcare teams to specialize in treating illness related to the old as it is commonly known that the old are more prone to illness .
Thus , by increasing the amount of healthcare workers focusing on treating elderly illness prevent the situation of the lack of healthcare workers for the elderly in the near future .
Also , we have to create an environment which is elderly-friendly so that the elders are able to take care of themselves without the help of others .
Being able to take care of themselves is very important as this greatly decreases their dependence on others and hence reduces their burden on their children and the elderly will not feel that they are useless by not being independent .
Therefore , this public spending on improving facilities should not be comprised for the welfare of the elderly .
Similarly , the government has to provide elderly benefits as most of the elderly are no longer in the workforce and thus have no regular income .
The elderly depend on their savings or their children to support themselves through the old age .
Even though so , some of the elderly may not have saved enough to last them till death or their children are not willing to take care of them .
They are faced with the problems of living a proper life .
A proper life refers to having home , three meals and adequate healthcare .
Therefore , it is important for the government to step in to provide help for these poor elderly so that they could have a proper life .
If not , these elderly may die because of hunger or the lack of proper healthcare due to poverty .
However , an argument against this is that most people feel that old age is not the responsibility of the government and the government is not obliged to take care of the elderly .
The elderly ought to be independent .
Nevertheless , if the government leaves elderly who are fighting old age alone without care , it would be too cruel of the government .
In other words , the government should not leave those elderly in lurch to struggle on their own for survival .
In addition , the elderly may encounter biasness against them .
This is a social problem where the government has to step in to solve it .
Ageism may be present in the working or social life of an elderly .
These unfair treatments that the elderly faced may be pose a psychological problem to them .
For example , the old aged face discrimination when finding jobs as compared to the young and also , the old age may receive less all-rounded treatment in healthcare sector based on the stereotype that they are in the natural process of aging and that they are less likely to recover .
The government then has to interfere to educate the public to be less prejudiced against the old aged .
This will take up part of the public spending which should not be limited .
On the other hand , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as the economic sector .
If the economic improves , people would earn more money and thus the burden on the children taking care of their old-aged parents would be relatively less as they could better afford the costs of taking care of elderly .
On the contrary , this is only applicable to filial children who are willing to take care of their parents .
Those elderly who are unfortunate or those without kids may face problems as they would have no one to take care of them and would be worse off without any help from the government .
As a result , public spending on the aged should not be limited as it is needed to help these elderly .
To sum up , the government has to assume responsibilities in taking care of the elderly and to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to accept an ageing population , public spending on the aged should not be limited and money should not be diverted into other areas of the country's development .
Statistics from the World Health Organization  stated that:
From 2000 until 2050 , the world's population aged 60 and over will more than triple from 600 million to 2 billion .
Most of this increase is occurring in developing countries - where the number of older people will rise from 400 million in 2000 to 1 .7 billion by 2050 .
The baby-boom generation has created a need to improve and provide care and services to the aging population .
I agree to a large extend that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Technology plays a significant role in providing aid and improving the lives of the elderly .
Current technologies have provided aids and support to the elderly in the fields of personal health technologies by reducing the cost and time of medical appointments and increasing the effectiveness of health record tracking .
It is also important that ageing related problems are highlighted into the national development and policies for example introduction of the pension system and encouragement of late retirement to reduce elder dependency .
World Health Organsation . . What are the public health implications of global ageing ?
September 15 , 2009 , from w .who .int/features/qa/42/en/index .html
Firstly , with a higher budget to be spent in other areas such as education and defense , a country may develop even more rapidly .
With little economic growth , society may be faced with fewer options on how to take care of people who are least able to take care of themselves .
However , with sufficient economic growth , this would not be the case as there will be more options and lesser persons in need of the help .
With more educated youth , the size of the economy and tax base will be higher and the cost burden of an aging population may be spread over a larger and more productive future generation .
Such as the case in Scandinavian countries where generous public funding for prenatal incentives and investments in children for example in education as helped curb the problem a population's aging and declining .
Furthermore , with a more educated society , more people are acquired with the knowledge to better take care of themselves and hence help lessen the amount of healthcare spending .
Secondly , by setting boundaries on public spending , people will be less reliant on the government to take care of their every need such as in healthcare .
Elderly dependency can be reduced when it is enforced or encourage upon them to plan and provide in advance for their own old-age dependency .
When enforced by law or encouraged to save and invest more of their income while still in the work force , people will then of sufficient amount of money to take care of their health issues when necessary rather than depend on the government spending to support their health spending .
Dependence on the government can also be reduced by encouraging later retirement dates , longer working lives and lower requirements to elder employment which can be achieved alone with an increase on the eligibility of age for pensions and government incentives for the elderly .
Also , when people work longer , they will be able to accumulate more money to be used to support themselves in their old age .
In Singapore , the government has tried using schemes such as CPF  , Medisave , Medishield and even scrapped away the pension scheme in order to encourage more Singaporeans to take better control of their own health issues .
Lastly , with limited public spending on healthcare , it will encourage more working adults to take better care of their elderly parents .
With elderly to look after for , there will be more stresses on filial obligation and also increases the willingness of adults in the future to take care of their elderly parents by all methods .
In an increasingly paper-chase society , working adults often have no time , attention , care and even financial aid to take care of their elderly parents and eventually abandon them in homes .
However , with the support and care from the proper channel from the family , it may be a better and cheaper alternative to take care of the elderly by yourself then depend on the nursing home's nurse to take care of your parents .
However , detractors may disagree that money public spending should be limited on healthcare and diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Limiting public spending on healthcare may not solve the social issues that have surfaced due to the problem of population aging .
It merely leaves the individual and his/her family more responsible for their healthcare issues .
Some of these costs may eventually end up going back into the public sector through other means .
The society may face with a wide range of social issues on education , housing and many more which may not be solved by setting limits on healthcare expenditure on the government's part but instead create even more problems .
Yet , in the first place , spending on healthcare may not be a good way to solve societal issues such as the lack of filial piety amongst youth and over dependence on the government to solve every problem one might face with .
In a nut shell , government spending on the aged in the healthcare should be capped at a certain limit to take care of people who may really be in need while the rest of the budget are to be shifted to other areas of the country's growth .
With a limit on healthcare expenditure in the government's budget , there maybe a better investment in the area where the government's budget goes to , people would be more self reliant and lastly it will instill a stronger sense of filial obligation in youth .
"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
Clearly , this suggestion considers the interest of the country but not the aged .
Although the country's development is essential , it cannot neglect the frailer aging group of the population .
Regardless of the problems an aging population may bring along , it cannot diminish the fact that the elderly is still part of a country's assets .
If the government decides to cut its expenditure on aging population , the elderly will be struggling for their survival as many welfare benefits will be limited .
Instead , the government should continue to promote welfare programs that aid the elderly in terms of housing and healthcare .
Indeed , there are many problems associated with an aging population .
For example , the elderly people are in need of social and healthcare attention because of their feeble physical condition .
This increase burdens on the younger workforce as they have to bear the cost of healthcare services required by the elderly .
Other than that , an aging population will hinder the economic growth due to its lower productivity .
However , it is a fact that citizens are part of a country's assets regardless of their age .
We cannot abandon them just because they bring along several problems .
It is the responsibility of the younger population and the government to support the aged .
This is because the older generation has contributed to the workforce during their younger days .
It is their hard labour that had paved the road for us today .
As a result , the younger people and the government should return favour by helping the elderly .
Even if the elderly is able to support their own , the government should continue in assisting through other policies .
However , priority should be given to the needy elderly; especially for older people with less education background and savings .
One of the welfare packages that the government can provide is "housing" .
A handful of old people are left stranded on the streets without shelters .
Some are abandoned by their families while others cannot afford a house because of their financial difficulties .
These people definitely require attention from the government .
Therefore , the government should not limit public spending on aging population .
Instead , they should invest on introducing new policies that can help these homeless elderly .
Another welfare package the government can offer is "healthcare" .
Health is the most common problem faced by the elderly .
As they aged , their body constitution becomes weaker .
As a result , they are more vulnerable to sickness and disease .
They have to make occasional visit to the doctor for diagnostics and remedy .
The cost is heavy , especially nowadays when new technologies and treatments are expensive .
This is where the government can provide financial aid for the healthcare services required by the aged .
The government can subsidize part of the healthcare expenses borne by the elderly .
This will lighten the burden of the aging population as well as the younger workforce .
Therefore , public spending for the aged should not be reduced for the country's development .
Instead , the government should increase their spending on the aged so that they can reach out to more needy senior citizens .
Certainly , if the government diverts its spending to other areas of the country's development , they would enjoy a growing economic growth .
Because of that , they will be able to collect more taxes , which can be used to aid the aging population .
On the other hand , with little economic growth , the government has no choice but to cut down on benefit programs for the aged .
However , it takes time to realize a noticeable increase in economic growth .
It may be many decades from now .
By that time , an unfortunate group of the aged will have been deprived of welfare programs previously planned for them .
These people will suffer as the country works toward other areas of its development .
This is because the country has to limit its spending on the aged while expanding other areas of development .
This is where the government has to make a tough choice between the aged and the country's advancement .
Clearly , the consequences of cutting expenditure on the aged outweigh the other in many aspects .
A sizeable segment of the aged will be suffering through the process of achieving an economic growth .
Consequently , they will be struggling for survival with the limited welfare policies available to them .
In other words , if welfare programs for the aged are reduced due to limited spending , many problems will arise .
Subsequently , the government have to spend more resources to solve the arising problems .
Therefore , it is better to give equal if not more spending to the aged , keeping existing welfare benefits in place .
"Today , slightly less than 1 in 10 of our residents are 65 years of age or older .
This proportion of the elderly in our population is expected to rise significantly , doubling to 1 in 5 by 2030"  .
As Singapore's population ages , there are many issues arising on how to help the elderly cope with the aging process .
Therefore , with the government's emphasis on tackling the uprising problems of an ageing population , current research and development have helped to ease the aging process through introducing policies , upgrading of facilities and providing quality healthcare services .
These improvements can be seen in various context and we will be looking at the benefits it has provided to the elderly .
822 words
Secondly , as we grow older , we tend to experience more health problems such as walking difficulties and deteriorating physical strength .
Therefore , with the development of an elderly-friendly environment , it has helped to ease the aging process .
An elderly is not afraid to walk around the housing estates or travel in public transports as these facilities have become more accessible to them .
One of the architectural developments that we can see is the building of lifts to serve all levels of new and existing HDB flats .
This eliminates the need for an elderly to climb the stairs in order to get to the level that the lift has no access to .
Another development is the building of more slopes instead of steps .
The elderly will have an easier time walking up and down to get to their destination .
These are some of the benefits that can be seen around our housing estates .
Public transportations such as the MRT and buses have similar concept implemented to their facilities .
MRT stations have built lifts to allow the elderly to travel up to the platform and down with ease .
Public buses have steps-free entrance and exit for easier mobility of the elderly .
However , some people are concern if the spending on all these upgrades to increase accessibility for the elderly is necessary .
They feel that the money spent should be used on strengthening the economy instead .
But if we do not maintain a good infrastructure that caters to the elderly , no matter how good the economy is , the elderly will not be able to enjoy accessible and user-friendly facilities that ease their life .
Lastly , better healthcare services that are readily available to the elderly ensure that they are well taken care of .
One may be afraid of growing old as more health problems will arise and it may be difficult getting the necessary healthcare .
However , now we will be able to get the proper care and rehabilitation from improvements to healthcare facilities such as public hospitals , nursing homes and polyclinics .
We have a team of well-trained doctors and nurses who are committed to take care of the elderly who needs special attention .
We also have groups of medical specialist who are always finding ways to improve the healthcare of the elderly through better medication and rehabilitation .
As a result , more day rehabilitation centres and nursing homes are built to handle the demands for increasing healthcare .
In my opinion , the elderly does not need to worry about getting good healthcare services as it is easily found anywhere in Singapore .
In conclusion , we can see that research and development has brought about improvements that have played a part in easing the aging process .
The government policies are involved to ensure that proper saving for the future is in place , the upgrading of public facilities have helped create an elderly-friendly environment and the better healthcare services readily available .
I concur with the writer's view on reducing elder dependency by encouraging later retirement , longer working lives , and lower barriers to elder employment .
Firstly , encouraging later retirement for elderly can drastically change their attitude towards work .
This in turn will provide a positive mentality to better prepare them in their older age .
For example , when the government announced measures to encourage later retirements , the citizens will be prepared for what is to come and will be more readily to accept it and thus reducing elder dependency in the long term .
Secondly , by extending working lives , it will often results in the accumulation of more wealth which can be used to support themselves in the old age .
In addition , it acts as a safety net to dramatically reduce the need for elder dependency .
For example , an elderly who worked for 50 years compared to one that worked for 40 years has considerably more savings .
Lastly , lowering barriers to elder employment can also reduce the need for elder dependency .
With the ability to work and also a sustainable income , elderly will find themselves less dependent on others .
Moreover , their experience gained can prove valuable to the economy .
For example , with increased measures from government for putting elderly into the workforce , the elderly will be able to depend on themselves .
All in all , the strategy on reducing elder dependency through the 3 methods can prove to be valuable for an aging society .
"Old age is like a plane flying through a storm .
Once you are abroad , there is nothing you can do" , said Golda Meir .
Indeed , perhaps everyone is afraid of aging because it not only marks deterioration in physical health and significant psychological changes , but also places more financial burdens on the government and the society , because obviously , the elderly need fiscal support , better health care and facilities specialized for their elder problems .
Therefore , it is suggested that "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development" .
From my point of view , this recommendation is completely reasonable and convincing for several reasons .
First of all , investment should be focused more on education as it takes a higher priority than other fields of development because education plays a very important role in the society , determining the wealth and success of the entire nation .
More specifically , a good education system will produce a more talented and creative generation who can replace the current old generation and continue to devote their best to develop the country' economy in the future .
One example of necessary financial support is the investment on developing and upgrading the current facilities used in education , including information technology equipment , laboratory and library system .
This is particularly important to developing and less-developed nations' education , like Vietnam , China , Philippine and Malaysia , where teaching and learning are still following the traditional method with less support by IT and using old textbooks , as well as laboratories with obsolete devices .
Hence , students will be able to approach updated knowledge more easily , experiment and apply what they have learned in reality .
Another way to carry out this strategy is that the budget can be used to promote and export the country's education .
This is exactly what the Singapore government is doing to attract excellent students from other nations .
By providing tuition grants  and financial aid for living costs for foreign students along with a career bond , Singapore will have a greater workforce serving them for at least 3 years after graduation .
Besides the concerns about environmental protection and education , public spending on the aged should be partly transferred to public infrastructure development projects such as public transportation , schools , hospitals because such developments are directly related to the improvement in living standards of senior citizens .
Firstly , a modern infrastructure will bring about higher capabilities , effectiveness and efficiency .
One example of this could be the extension of access to most public places and even on public transport vehicles for people with physical disabilities , such as designing paths or elevators specialized for wheel chairs , or placing special directions for the elderly with sight or hearing problems .
Secondly , due to higher efficiency , such system will help reduce the operating expense and subsequently decrease the living expenditure for citizens .
For instance , a well organized public transportation system will help minimize the use of private vehicles which is costly , and reduce traffic congestion and accidents .
And therefore , to some extents , the elderly will indirectly benefit from this policy .
In conclusion , people may be upset with this idea because they may think that the aged increasingly lack of care from the society .
However , if considering the positive impacts it brings about the entire society , obviously the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages .
Hence , this idea should be carried out soon for the sake of everybody and the government needs to promote and analyze the pros of this policy in order to avoid misunderstandings  .
"Old age is still young , its potential is not fully realised , and institutions , norms and resources advantageous for old age still need to be developed ."
-Baltes and Mayer , 1999
Population ageing is an international phenomenon .
In Singapore , it's no different .
According to SingStats , 8 .5% of Singapore's population is above the age of 65 .
This figure was 7 .2% in the year 2000 .
As the population continue to age , government spending on the aged would increase as more and more people would rely on the government for their needs .
Many arguments have been raised on whether the government should limit this spending as the money could be used for other areas of the country's development .
I do not agree with them .
The government should not limit the spending on the aged .
In fact , they should make sure the needs of the aged are attended to .
In the past , literacy rate of the people is low .
Many elders of the current generation have little to no education thus in the economical active years , they weren't able to save a lot .
Moreover , most of the money they earned was spent on their children to make sure that they receive proper education .
This action of placing the younger generation's interest before theirs and making sure that they get proper education increases the literacy rate of the country and contributed to the country's development .
In other words , the old have contributed a lot into shaping our country to what she is today .
Therefore now that the country has prospered , the government should look after the people who helped made it possible .
On the other hand , some may argue that since the elder spent their money on their children , it's now the responsibility of the children to look after their needs , and not the government's .
If that were to happen , it would impact the society as social cost would increase and the younger generation may find it harder to start a family .
Throughout the years , Singapore has concentrated on the country's development .
According to Singapore Ministry of Finance , in FY2009 , 41 .5% of government expenditure would be placed on the economical and social development of the country .
Looking at the numbers , we could tell that sufficient funds have already been placed for the country's development thus no additional funds are required .
Even if there is a need for additional funds for economical and social development , instead of limiting or cutting cost on the aged , the government should look at other areas to cut .
For example , expenditure on security and defence is 34 .3% of government expenditure in FY2009 .
This is certainly too much an amount to be spent on security and defence .
A reason for the stand that government should limit spending on the aged is that the aged is not of much use to the society thus the government should not concentrate so much on them .
However , Singapore's policy of re- employing the old has proven that to be not true .
Most of the aged proved that they can continue to work and contribute to the society in one way or another thus their welfare should be looked at as well .
In conclusion , spending on the aged should not be limited or diverted as for a developed country like Singapore , many successes are brought about by them and they helped shaped the country to what it is today .
If there was ever a need for more funds to be injected to the development of the country , other areas and not the spending on the aged should be looked at .
I agree that the implemented polices eases the aging process .
After Singapore gained independence in 1965 , Singapore saw a boom in the population .
To control the population , they introduce the 'stop at two' policy that was so successful , which resulted in a decline of the overall population even till today .
The drop of population give rises to the aging population .
To tackle the issue on aging population , The Government has implemented some measures that help the elderly to age comfortably .
Some of the measures are Medisave , Lift Improvement and Facilities Enhancement for the elderly  and Eldershield scheme .
Firstly , Medisave was introduced in 1984 to help Singaporeans to set aside an amount of money from their incomes for future medical expenses .
The Medisave covers a range of health expenses which includes Surgical Operations , Psychiatric treatment and many more .
Such measures of saving for the raining days will help Singaporeans to cover part of their medical expenses as they retire into old age .
Although this scheme does not provide 100% coverage on their medical bills , patients will have a lesser burden when majority of the medical bills are heavily subsided by The Government and supported by Medisave .
Thirdly , the Eldershield scheme is introduced since 2007 .
The scheme automatically covers Singaporean that are aged 40 and above with an insurance plan .
The payout is $400 per month and up to a period of 6 years if one is to become severely disabled .
According to Census of Population 2000 , about 3% of elderly was non-ambulant .
The scheme will reduce their financial burden that arises from medical bills .
However , one will have to pay a minimum of $176 .96 annual premium in order enjoy the benefits of the scheme .
To make the plan affordable , the government provides premium subsidy and constantly review the plan .
In conclusion , the elderly are now more protected and ages more comfortable with the implementation of the policies .
There are two sides to a coin , although the measures do not solve the problem entirely and may cause inconvenience in some case , the benefits will eventually outweigh the cons .
The Government will have to constantly review and improve the measures to be prepared for the aging population .
There have been many controversial debates on whether the government should limit public spending on the elderly group so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
While this is important and inevitable , our government is being challenged to cope with the need to increase allocation of public funds for this area with a graying population .
Rising living expenses and healthcare costs is also another factor which highlights the importance of limiting public spending on the elderly .
If a limit is not in place , the government might soon face difficulties with funding other key sectors of the country's development such as education and defense .
Smaller side effects include , the over reliance on the government to support the aged .
This will turn the regime of supporting the elderly a nightmare and burden to the society .
Firstly , with a graying population , the government is expected to spend more public funds each year on areas like healthcare for the elderly , elderly friendly public facilities such as slopes in housing estates .
This section of public expenditure soaks up a large portion in the government's annual allocated budget each year .
In Singapore 2009's budget allocation , a total of $66 million  was allocated from the pool of $18 .1 billion allocated for social development .
This spending allocation only covers enhancements for the elderly in the society and excludes healthcare benefits coverage .
This expenditure is expected to rise further with the increase of life expectancy and the increase in the proportion of elderly  .
Quoting a statistic from Singapore's 2008 budget day report , in 2007 , 21% of the Government Healthcare Expenditure  , or 0 .2% of the country's GDP was dedicated to elderly care .
This proportion of spending is expected to double in the next three decades .
Secondly , the rise of living expenses and healthcare costs continuously is another reason why should government limit public spending for this sector .
With this , more public funds will have to be allocated to fund this sector .
This scenario would only be ideal should our economy achieve constant growth in economy in the upcoming years and the spending on other sectors remain unchanged .
However , it is increasingly difficult to forecast such growth with the current volatile and gloomy economy worldwide .
With this situation , other key sectors such as education and defense might be implicated when the targeted Gross Domestic Product  to sustain the increased expense on the aged is not met , should a spending limit on the aged not be imposed .
This might in turn lead to a series of negative chain effects such as making education less affordable .
Thirdly , the constant aid from the government might lead to unsightly social problem .
Unfilial children might abuse the system by pushing their responsibilities of supporting their parents to the government .
Also , young adults might not also see the importance of savings during their financially active years since the government will do their part in providing subsidy for the needy .
Mnay people might however , disagree that government should limit the public spending on aged .
This view is valid as well .
If the government is to limit public spending on this sector and instead channel it to other sectors , this might deprive the needy elderly from obtaining assistance and might lead to adverse effects .
Some of the adverse effects includes , elderly people especially those who are childless , spouseless and elderly people who does not have huge amount of savings to face difficulties to fund their own healthcare or living expenses .
This might in turn result in a social problem where an elderly might be utilized by crime syndicates to commit crimes to fund those expenses .
To deal with these challenges , the government has limited options , and one of which is to limit the spending on this sector to reduce the burden on the society .
One such way is to look into a tiered system when providing healthcare subsidies for the elderly .
Alternatively , government can also look at ways to further enhance the current Central Provident Fund  , MediSave and MediSheild schemes to enforce compulsory savings during one's financial active years to prepare them for old age .
Filial piety should also be enforced .
There should be a limit to how much the government should spent on the elderly group .
The issue if not dealt with properly , might place government into a challenging position , lack of funds on important sectors such as education and defence and also causing the citizens to be over reliant on the society .
These will all turn the regime into a nightmare .
I strongly agree that public spending on the aged should be limited .
Economic growth of a country relies on many areas such as education , welfare of the public , defense system , transportation , and many more .
All these aspects work together to contribute great impact to the country and make the country grow .
Therefore , the government should not direct their money specifically into certain areas and while neglecting the rest .
Education is one of the very important areas .
Government should invest enough amount of afford to this area .
School is a place where every single young receive education .
Government should also focus on developing this area to make the learning process more interactive and exciting .
Education and knowledge are important tools that help them to survive at outside working world .
Lacking of education leads to lack of knowledge .
If a country does develop well on the education area , the economics of the country definitely will not grow well .
Besides that , even though the world is advancing rapidly and there are a lot of jobs out there , there are a lot of fresh graduates who are still unemployed .
This is because most graduate do not meet the industrial requirement .
Thus , government should also focus and put in more afford to help these people .
Government should create more job opportunity for them .
For example , government can run some job training programs to help the graduates exploit their talent and make them industrial compatible .
Investing into the young is more worthy than to the aged because they are well-educated and have potential to bring more contributing to the country .
Over the time , the population of old people is gradually growing .
If expenditure on the aged is never controlled , it means that government is putting more and more money on something which never really has impact on country economic growth .
Government can limit the expenditure because the burden of health cost can be borne by their family members through scheme like MediSave .
However , today , the cost of living is high .
Working adults have to pay for high living expenses and support their children on tuition and enrichment classes .
To those with low income , it has already been a burden for them .
Most elderly have a lot of health problems and they also need medical care , which majority of them involves high cost .
Therefore , cutting down on the welfare program will put the working adult in financial crisis .
They will have to compensate more to work extra hard to earn a living .
For example , they might compensate their time and health to take up 2 or more jobs working day and night .
As a result , it will cause the adult to have poor health condition and reduce productivity in work .
In conclusion , limiting the public spending on the aged does not mean the cease the expenditure for them .
This is to achieve the balance between each area , where government can set a limit and provide adequate amount spending on them while focusing on other more important aspect like education and so on .
Public spending refers to money expended by a government to pay for areas such as defense , development projects , education , health , infrastructure , law & order maintenance and such spending is supported by taxation .
With an increasing number of elderly in the society , it is rather strenuous for the non-elderly to contribute to the tax base .
And it is in no doubt that the aged requires additional spending on public pensions and health care .
However , this does not mean that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Certain children who are capable of providing for their elderly parents refuse to do so because they do not want to waste money and assume that it is the government's responsibility to provide for the elderly .
However , it should be made clear to them that public spending on the aged should not be misused .
In order to prevent public spending from being misused , government should provide aid to the aged after assessing their living condition and how much their children can provide for them .
For example , an elderly who lives all alone by himself , without any children , will receive more help from the government if he is unable to provide for himself .
Whereas , an elderly who have children whose income is relatively stable , will receive lesser help .
After all , it is the children's responsibility to provide for their parents before the government steps in to help .
In this way , public spending will not be misused , children are forced to be filial and therefore , do not have to set a limitation on public spending since the amount spent on the aged will be lesser .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited because they deserve to receive help from the government when they need it as they once helped to contribute to the country's development .
In order for those elderly from the past generations to live reasonably well , but not to the extent of "luxury well" , government should assess the living condition of these elderly and provide them with the necessary aid instead of limiting public spending on the aged .
In recent years , public spending on the aged has gradually increased , sparking countless discussions about whether public spending on the aged should bre limited , so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Personally , I agree with such a view .
In countries where the population is not aging , public spending on the aged should be lowered and the funds should be channelled into other more important policies and schemes .
This would benefit the country , both economically and socially .
Also , in every society where such schemes exist , there will be a group of people who tend to "abuse" the system .
In reality , there are a number of those who try leech off as much government funding as they can , despite their ability to support themselves .
After the aged retire , there are a large group of them who actually are still fit to work , they are able to do minor jobs to support themselves .
However , this is rarely seen due to the fact that most of them do not wish to continue working into old age , they believe that they deserve to rest .
Although I believe that people who retire definitely deserve their old age freedom , I completely disagree that most of them are doing it at the expense of the government .
If your children are unable to support you through your old age for whatever reason , you should be trying to find minor jobs to support yourself , especially if you are still physically fit .
Therefore the spending on the aged should be lowered , and the smaller amount of funds that are dedicated to it should be given out more wisely and strictly .
Some people disagree that the public spending on aged should be cut down , and they may say that the cost of supporting an old person may be too much of a burden for the young adult of our world .
The children of these aged folk do not earn enough to support their parents .
However , I feel that if there are increased funds in the other sectors of country's development , the burden would actually be lesser than it already is .
If , the public spending on the aged is lowered and the funds are diverted to other channels to boost the economic growth , the country would enjoy a richer society .
There will be a rise in wealth and the working population would actually have more monetary assets to support the aged .
Also , the funds can be diverted into other sources which will result in an increase of cleanliness in a country .
This can be through the form of increased technology , or investment into machinery that clean up the polluted air .
The cost of supporting and old person is by no doubt majorly due to the increased medical costs that come with old age .
However if the country is able to find a way to improve cleanliness in the country , this will no doubt lead to a healthier population , which in turn means lower medical costs .
Therefore it is the wiser choice to lower the public spending on elderly , because the net benefit from such an action would be much greater than if we were to leave the spending untouched .
However , such a policy would only be beneficial in countries that do not face an ageing population .
Countries that face the problem of an ageing population are unable to carry out such a plan .
This is due to the fact that it is almost impossible for the younger generation to support the aged , considering the number of aged in society greatly outweigh the generation that are supporting them .
Therefore it would be wiser for the governments of such countries to find other policies that would suit their own needs .
In conclusion , in countries where the population is not aging , public spending on the aged should be diverted to other more important sectors , such as research and development sectors .
This would in turn benefit the country more than if they were to leave the policies untouched .
This essay agrees to a large extent that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process because of the innovative solutions that Singapore's government and other organizations have come up with to further delay the aging process .
These solutions are mostly focused in the area of medicine , technology and society in which they are essential in slowing the process and eradicating this issue in the future .
First , many people commonly associate health issues with the elderly .
For instance , in United Kingdom , a research done by Deloitte and summarized by Dr Michael Harris  , reflected that more than a quarter of fifty to sixty year old elderly people are diagnosed with medical conditions and the numbers are expected to increase in the future .
One of the many medical solutions that helps to slow down aging and is available in the market is called the "Human Growth Hormone" drug  .
This prescription provides alternatives to improve old age health issues such as memory loss and weaker bones .
However , not many individuals are willing to adopt this medical option as they would want to age naturally and are afraid that this treatment will cause side effects as it is not commonly used .
It is possible for people to have this judgement because this medicine is not widely used in the market as further research is still ongoing to further improve its effectiveness .
Second , technology is advancing rapidly and users are expected to constantly upgrade themselves to keep up with the pace .
But the elderly may face problems in the process of keeping up .
Most of them will have trouble adjusting to new technology when they are already comfortable with the level of technological background that they are equipped in .
Moreover , the health conditions such as deteriorating eye sight or poorer hearing can be a problem as well .
However , Microsoft has come up with technological advancement that helps the elderly deal with these situations due to their health concerns .
To illustrate , a Magnifier  is made available in Windows so that the user can magnify part of their computer's screen in order to view it clearer .
Despite this solution , the elderly are still struggling to cope with the latest technology .
On the contrary , they should be willing to adapt to technological changes as they are there to help humans cope with their daily activities and there are alternatives provided to these changes so that society would not to neglect the elderly .
Finally , society plays a major role in coping with the problem of an aging population with the country's government as a support .
In Singapore , the government has provided many measures to protect the elderly .
In fact , one of the measures includes the "Maintenance of Parents Act"  in which parents can claim their rights from their children who had neglected them .
This way , it helps to prevent grown children from running away from their responsibilities towards their parents .
Other than that , companies are encouraged to employ older workers even after these workers have past their retirement age  .
To further attract the interest of companies to do so , recognition such as the "AARP International Innovative Employer Awards" is given out to companies who showed innovation on how to include elderly in their companies  .
Yet , despite such incentives being given out , many companies still chose to retrench those who fall under the older age group during the retrenchment period claiming that the elderly are less productive and effective .
While this may be true , it is possible to keep the elderly away from retrenching them as the elderly can take up upgrading course to improve their skills .
In conclusion , although these researches and policies have yet to fully solve the problem of an aging population , they still provide alternatives for the aged and society to cope with the problem .
Thus , it is up to the individuals themselves to determine whether they would want to oblige to the policies implemented and try out those new alternatives .
Aging population is becoming more and more serious problem , consuming a great amount of money from public programs .
There are several solutions proposed to ease this problem .
One solution is limiting the money spending on programs for the aged and diverting that money to other areas of country developments .
Some critics say implementing this solution might be implied that the government does not want to support the elderly; however it is a practical solution for the current aging population problem .
In fact , several countries have already implemented means testing systems that reflects the above idea .
In Australia there is a means testing for age pensions , which is based on the income test and assets test to assess compensation payments  .
Starting from 1 January 2009 , Singapore has run a mean testing system in its public hospital: a certain group of citizen with certain range of income will have different subsidy scheme .
For example , citizens who have average income lower than 3200$ per month will have their hospital fee subsidized by 80% while those who earn more than 5200$ monthly will only have their hospital fee subsidized by 50%  .
Most importantly , limiting public money spending on the aged will save a great amount of money for the Government .
This money can be diverted to other needier and more important programs , such as education , environment programs and other economic development related programs .
These programs are essential to ensure the development of a country in the near future  and in the long run  .
Friedland and Laura Summer  state that the key word in fighting against aging population is economic growth .
As the economic develops , the country will generate more money and thus be able to spend a greater amount of money on programs such as health care support for elderly .
In conclusion , country which faces the aging population problem should consider limiting public money spend on the aged and instead using that money on country developments .
That cut-off money can be considered as an investment on the country economic .
Besides , a country could also run supporting programs to make the policy run more effectively , such as promoting children's willingness to support the elderly parents and implementing means testing programs .
IT is user friendly .
It over comes the two main problems that the elderly have when using IT .
Firstly , the elderly may have a difficult time figuring out the user interface .
Also , old people tend to forget .
Because of the above , the elderly may find using IT a challenge .
However , IT can actually be made simple to use .
One way is to provide a simple user interface .
With this , the elderly will never go wrong as there are only a few buttons to choose from .
Another way is to provide a functionality to the interface to "remember" inputs .
This way  , the elderly would not have to worry about having forgotten what they have done before to the interface .
IT is indispensible for learning .
Some people may think that many people nowadays do not have much patience with the elderly .
Teaching the elderly would therefore be a chore for them .
IT , on the other hand , will never grow impatient on the old .
It acts as an alternative and gives older people chances to learn or try to do something .
Some people may argue that although IT would not grow impatient on the old , the old may , in contrast , grow impatient on IT .
However , I believe that IT is user friendly , and therefore easy to pick up .
The elderly , it given a chance at IT , will never tire of it .
IT makes it easier to grow old nowadays with more available help .
IT  could improve the operative ability of the elderly and may even enhance their wellbeing .
The aged could even prevent being sent to an old folk's home , be able to live alone at home , and have increased individual management of their personal issues .
One big hurdle is to get the elderly to accept the new products and to learn how to use them .
However , with the considerable degree of benefit that they will have , I think this hurdle would not be a problem .
The elderly would just have to see and understand the advantages IT would bring to their lives .
From the above , we can see that to a large extent , current research and development in IT have helped to ease the aging process .
IT not only brings great convenience to the livelihood of the aged , but is also user friendly .
This makes it easy for the elderly , who would be slow at learning , to pick up IT and get familiarized with it , at their own time .
It is also clear that with all the above reasons , the elderly would most definitely find it rather undemanding for them to embrace it in their lives .
First of all , public spending on the aged can be diverted to help those people who have lower income but have the potential of pursuing a higher education to get a higher qualification .
The government could offer scholarships or offer subsidize school fees based on their income level in order to help to generate more higher educated people so that the effects of having little education and not being able to save during one's economically active years could be minimized .
Although there are benefits , it will result in a large number of people having high qualification and it will end up becoming something that is common among everybody .
Therefore , diverting money to education would not help to minimized the effect of having little education and not being able to save during one's economically active years .
So , this suggests that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
In conclusion , public spending should not be diverted to other areas such as , education and generating a more productive workforce .
Instead , the government should support the aged by providing work that are suitable for the elderly as well as providing support for their medical and social spending in order to help elderly to cope with the rising issue of social and healthcare cost .
In addition , by providing work for the elderly , they can earn enough money for themselves to spend even though they were unable to save during their economically active years .
Moreover , when the government provide support for medical and social spending , it will allow elderly to have enough money to spend for their other leisure activities .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to allow elderly to aged with dignity .
Yes , I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be used for other developments .
There are several reasons on why public spending should be limited .
One reason is that the government can still provide benefits to elderly by developing areas that will benefit all age groups .
By limiting public spending on the aged , the government can focus on other developments such as economy .
Government could use public funds to invest in job markets to increase the economical growth of the country .
This does bring some benefits to elderly .
With an increase economy growth , the number of working population will rise as more people will be able to find jobs .
In addition , working adults would be able to earn more income in a stable economy .
Therefore , the working population will have more capability to support their elderly parents .
This will encourage working adults to take responsibility to look after their elderly parents and thus , promoting filial obligation .
On top of that , with a better economy , the elderly will be able earn more income if they decide to continue to work till retirement age .
There are other reasons on why public spending on the aged should be limited .
One reason is the rising cost of caring for aged .
This is because the numbers of people aged 60 and above are expected to be triple by year 2050 .
Also , with the rising cost of living , amount of funds needed to care for the elderly will rise tremendously .
This will mean a higher tax is required .
Therefore , if the government does not limit the spending , more taxpayer's money will be needed to be spend to care for the elderly .
When this trend continues , the country's financial reserves will be depleted .
As a result , there is a need to balance the public spending .
In conclusion , public spending should be limited so that funds could be used in other developments .
The government must be able to balance the funds so that it will benefit all age groups without compromising anyone .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
I disagree to this statement .
The idea of reducing public spending for the aged would eventually generate more problems in the country and thus slowing down the country's development instead .
The scope of this essay will be focused on the area of public spending in healthcare of the elderly .
The country could consider adjusting the budget into improving the economy .
Indeed it may seem to be a wise move as the country will be richer in their next budget planning .
However , as the economy grows , wages increases and cost of life increases , it would be inevitable that prices of products , medication , and services , hospitalization bills , would also be on the rise .
As the subsidy is reduced , the family will have to pay more .
Therefore , the effect of the positive increased wages could be well offset or even insufficient to keep up with the cost of living for the middle and lower income groups .
Thus , would lead to the rich getting richer , and the poor getting poorer .
Do you consider a country with high GDP , tall and flashy buildings , together with an increasing number of its citizen living condition regressing into living in slum condition a country with good economy ?
The answer is no .
The money could also be invested into many other areas of the country's development for further growths or better benefits to the country , rather than wasting on healthcare benefits for the elderly .
On the other hand , it is these aged population that had brought the country to what it is right now with their sweat and blood .
Their ailments and conditions could be resulted from their work , be it directly or indirectly caused , while contributing to the nation progress , thus it should not be ignored .
Because of that , therefore it is only reasonable that the country should look after these past contributors and not to overlook their achievements just because they are no longer as capable of contributing to the nation .
As this move will reflect badly on how the country regards its citizen , it may even discourage its citizen from performing their best , or even migrate and work in other country , as they are aware that state will not take care of them in their later life .
To sum up , without a doubt diverting public spending from supporting the aged population to the other development in the country may at first seem to be the best option , but eventually , it could in turn result in more harm than good , be it by upsetting the balance of wealth in the country , educating of wrong moral value and conveying the wrong message to its citizen workforce .
With the development of society , governments and policy makers pay more attention to the phenomenon of aging populations , especially in developed countries .
According to incomplete figures , in the European countries , spending on pensions , health , and related issues is 15% of GDP  currently .
However , although the spending on the aged is high , it should not be limited .
Some consider that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
For instance , government should cut down the spending on aged , and use more money to attract talented immigrants .
This can not only stimulate economic growth , but also buffer the rate of aging population .
To a large extent , it seems quite reasonable .
However , the result what we will do that is that many immigrants who have different cultural backgrounds will pour into the country .
One country with the great influx of immigrants will become unstable , since cultures are different and cultural fusion need a long period of time .
Hence , it is not necessary to limit the public spending on the aged for attracting talented immigrants .
On the other hand , it should promote a sense of humanity and come up with more ways to help the vulnerable group and it is the duty of government that pays more attention to the vulnerable group in the society .
The aged belongs to the vulnerable group , as the productivity of the elderly is relatively low , but their medical expenses and social costs are higher than other age groups .
Thus , public support on the finance for the aged is extremely important .
In contrast , some may say that it is obligation for children to show filial obedience to the older generation , so young family members need to take care of the older generation and government can bear less responsibility for older people .
Due to this , the public spending on the aged should be limited .
However , the aim of government is to enable people in its country to live better and happier .
If we just cut down the public spending on the aged and divert the money to other areas of the country's development , this is contrary to the purpose of the government .
In other words , why do we divert the money to other areas of the country's development ?
Because we want to make our country stronger and the lives of citizens better .
In consequence of the same aims , diverting the money to other areas of the country's development is an extra and needless job .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , it does not mean that the aged can totally dependent on government's support .
The aged are advised to solve their problems as possible as they can and put the public support as their second choice .
I agree with the statement that "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
Although we are moving towards a a fast aging population , public spending should be limited and diverted to area like monetary reward to encourage parents to have more babies .
The country's development should not be hindered just because there is a need for public spending on the aged .
Besides , if we were to slow down the country's development , this might hinder our economic growth which in turn , will affect the public spending on the aged indirectly .
As we are now facing the problem of a fast aging population , healthcare expenses incurred by the elderly needs funding .
To fund these expenses , a large sum of money is needed .
Therefore , if public spending on the aged were to be limited , less budgets would be set aside for the elderly , which would affect them as healthcare is very important to them as they will face many health issues .
With the limitation of public spending on the aged , the elderly might not receive essential healthcare due to insufficient funding , which may leads to undesired outcome .
If public spending on the aged were to be limited and diverted to funds to encourage couples to have more babies , many people will plan to have more babies since their worries of not having enough money to bring up or to support so many babies have been partially subsidies by the fund .
As the increase in the fund for baby bonus leads to more people planning to have more babies , this would eventually reduce the problem of having too many elderly which make us move towards an aging society .
Besides , when these babies grow up , they will be able to work and earn money to support their parents .
In this way , it indirectly reduces the problem of having to set aside a big amount of money to aid healthcare services for the elders .
Another reason to limit public spending on the aged is that the children of the elderly should pay for their parent's healthcare expenses .
If the funding for the aged are limited , this will result in children bearing the responsibilities to look after their own parents .
As people can no longer depend on the society to look after their parents , they will have to take up the responsibilities of looking after their own parents .
In this way , people will be setting a good example to their children by looking after their own parents which would in turn indicate to their children that they should look after their parents in the future .
Although funding of healthcare services for the elderly is essential , it should be limited and diverted to other areas , especially baby bonus .
With more babies born , it would mean more people to look after their parents in the future , which would in turn cut down funds needed for the elderly .
In addition , having more babies will reduce our median age and also solve our problem of moving towards an aging population .
Firstly , the elderly can provide for the society by imparting values to the younger generation .
The elderly has spent many years of their youth on this earth .
Thus they have the most life experiences .
They have gone through many good and difficult times .
Therefore they are in the best position to impart values to their children as they are the wisest person each family .
In this way , the younger generation will be able to gain more wisdom from them .
Hence , crime rates will be greatly reduced as the younger generation will be wise enough to do only the right things .
This will help to make Singapore the safest country in the world .
Therefore the public should continue to provide for them .
Furthermore , even if someone is old , they can still provide for the society in terms of decision making .
With the amount of life experiences , they will know the consequences of implementing different kinds of solution .
A very good example is our former prime minister , Mr Lee Kuan Yew .
Despite of his old age , he still contributes to the society by making major decisions for the country .
This shows that an elderly is never a useless person in the society .
On the other hand , they are the ones who can make the wisest decisions .
These decision making skills can also be imparted to the younger generation .
Hence , the public should continue to provide for the aged .
In addition to the above mentioned factors , the elderly has already contributed many years of their youth to the society .
Now that they are old , they have problems working for their own allowance .
It is the social responsibility of the public to provide for them in order to express their gratitude for the years that they have contributed to the society .
If not for them , Singapore will never become a developed country .
Hence , there is no way that the other areas can be developed .
Therefore , the public should continue to provide for the aged .
However , the amount spent should not exceed a certain limit .
As children , it is their responsibility to take care of their parents and elders in the family .
By allowing the public to provide for the aged , the children tend to push their responsibility to the public .
They will have a mindset that the elderly can go to the different societies in the community to ask for financial aid .
Thus there should be a limit to the public spending for the aged .
In conclusion , I do not agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be divided to other areas of the country's development .
The elderly can contribute to the society by using their life experiences to make important decision for the country .
They will also be able to impart life values and skills to the younger generation .
This may seem impossible but it can be made possible if each elderly begins imparting these values to their own children .
In due time , Singapore will become the safest county that can make the best decision .
Until recently , there is always much concern about the consequences of over spending on the welfare of the aging population .
It is said that , if a huge portion of the public's money goes to the aging population , it will cause undesirable effects to the country in many ways .
The median age in Singapore is anticipated to be doubled by 2050 .
Which means that the amount spent on the welfare of the senior citizens is also expected to be doubled .
Elder people tend to be the primary beneficiaries from the public spending .
Although , the welfare of the senior citizen may be important but it should not be in an extent where the other areas of the country's development are being hindered .
What is therefore needed is to take a close look at the current situation and evenly distribute the public spending into different areas to ensure that the country is being able to prosper .
Public spending must be limited so that it can be diverted into other major areas where it forms the pillars of the economy , like Education , Defense , Technology , and Research & Development .
If the government does not invest enough on these areas , the country will lose its competitiveness , productive capacity in the economy and decrease in public services which will greatly harm the economy .
The importance of a quality educational system is not less than the importance of the aging population .
Education is a need to educate the future workforce of the economy , and also to create a workforce which is truly competitive and productive .
Japan is a country with little natural resources and yet with a very highly educated population , which resulted them in being one of the most foremost and advanced country in the world .
A population with poor education background will find it hard to compete with other foreign talents with quality education background , thus losing out when it comes to employment and resulting in a huge percentage of the population being unemployed .
Furthermore , foreign investors will not set up factories in countries that are equipped with poorly educated workforce .
Thus the importance of education is equally important .
The amount spent on the defense should not be neglected as well .
Singapore is a country who is constantly being the target of the terrorist .
There were several terror attempts on Singapore , but it was foiled mainly due to the contribution from an effective and strong defense system .
A weak defense system can cripple a country's economy .
For example , New York City was once a major financial center in the world , but after since the September 11th incident , majority of the investors left New York seeking safer alternatives .
This particular incident costs New York billions of dollars and also millions of job lost overnight .
In addition , defense is also used to safeguard the economic interest of Singapore .
Singapore being a small country and yet having one of the strongest economies in Asia has always been the target its neighboring countries .
Without a strong and effective defense , Singapore would have been an easy target .
Therefore , defense is one of the most important areas which safeguards interest of a country and the allocation of budget on this area should never be overlooked .
Critics often said that the senior citizens were the country's pioneer and they had been through the process of nation building and it is our responsibility to ensure that the welfare of the aged should never be overlooked .
However , the allocation of the public spending on the aged should be based on wants and the needs of the elderly .
For the financially strapped elderly , they will receive the necessary subsidies for medical cost , transportation cost from the government .
Therefore , for those who are financially capable will have to rely only on their retirement savings .
Otherwise , it would be a huge drain on the tax payer's money which will not be utilized to its maximum potential .
Clearly , public spending on the aged is required , but other areas which will affect the development of the country are also equally important , if not to say more important .
With this ever changing and competitive society , Singapore needs to make the necessary investments on other areas to ensure that it remains its foothold in the global economy .
Therefore there is a need to analyze the importance of each area and cleverly distribute the spending .
If we do not limit the spending on the aged , Singapore may risk the possibility of losing its current global recognition status that it has always had .
Firstly , contributions to society made by the elderly cannot be ignored .
In the past , Singapore was an under developed country with swamps and kampongs around the island .
The living conditions were poor too .
If not for the elderly members of Singapore who contributed in helping to mould Singapore into a highly developed country , today many will not be enjoying the fruits of the labor .
They have laid a sturdy foundation only for most of us to benefit from it; the infrastructure , the technology , and the standard of living have made us what we are today .
As such , with all the hardships that the aged people have gotten through in helping to develop our country , it will be ruthless for us to leave them unattended or even setting limitations .
Secondly , with the attractive monetary incentive packages which the Singapore Government hands out to its citizens , it is not a foolproof method that works the solution .
The amount of money probably can tie most people over a few months but there are many unforeseen circumstances that might occur .
We know that elderly are prone to medical hiccups .
I would say that it can be from top to bottom .
They are not just common flu or illness that will wade off easily but long term illnesses .
If limitations are set , they will not be able to afford huge sum of money that they have to pay .
Furthermore , we still have to consider those who have been deserted by their own children or those who have no next of kin to depend on .
Thus , they will be alone and unable to take care of themselves .
Ultimately , they will be living in the old folks home and eventually use up their savings .
Without any family support , the only support they get will only come from the public's generous donations .
Having state the above , the main emphasis is that each and every elderly has their own respective needs and problems , thus there is no absolute solution to solve the problems of the aged people much less speaking of limiting the amount of money spent on them .
If we do not address this issue and even set curfew to it , there might be more worrying problems arising which eventually leading to bigger problems and more difficult to solve .
Thirdly , it is our responsibility to take care of our parents whom grew us up since young .
Without their care and concern , we will not be who we are now .
Morally , I feel that there is no way to set limits .
In fact , it is our obligation to take care of them right until their twilight years .
On the other hand , I mentioned in paragraph two that Singapore is a highly developed country now .
Despite so , we cannot take things for granted as we are still mainly dependent on external economies of other countries especially the Europe and United States of America .
Unlike other countries , Singapore has limited land and has no natural resources .
Thus the solution is to pump in money to further educate younger Singaporeans , invest in other countries and constantly carrying out Research and Development .
All this will be possible only when Singapore continues to invest more money in that respective area .
As the amount of money needed to invest in the respective area is huge , the government may need to consider using money from other aspects such as setting a limit to the amount of money spent on the aged if there is a situation whereby Singapore is financially strapped .
To conclude , these are the probable factors that may arise if public spending on the aged is implemented .
Not only that , if the government is scrapped financially , the government may consider setting the limit and help Singapore in its development .
Ageing is viewed as an inevitable phase of life that we are compelled to live .
Despite the challenges surrounding the ageing society , it is still depicted as the best part of our lives - 'the golden years' .
This description of old age is true as most countries have now increased efforts to address the challenges surrounding the graying population .
Therefore , I agree that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the ageing process .
One of the major problems faced by the aged is financial security .
Most elderly are worried about retirement costs .
One policy mentioned to deal with the financial challenges of an ageing population is to enforce a compulsory saving scheme for citizen old age .
Alike with many countries around the world , the Singapore government has implemented the Central Provident Fund  whereby a fixed percentage of its citizens' salaries is set aside to the fund .
Recently , there have also been top-ups provided to their CPF accounts to further help them meet their retirement needs .
However , some may argue that no matter how large the nest-egg one has carefully managed to put by , the sum is not sufficient to cover the rising cost of everyday life and healthcare services .
As a solution , government also invests a considerable amount of resources in health promotion and disease prevention .
Not only are the healthcare services subsidized , a community health screening programme is also inaugurated for seniors .
These enable the aged to lead a better quality life without being anxious over financial difficulties .
It is regrettable that when we think of old age , what automatically come to mind are visions of loneliness and neglect .
Over the years , efforts have been made to develop elder-friendly public infrastructure and housing as well as community based support services .
In Singapore , HDB flats are now designed with the ageing population in mind .
One example is the Studio Apartment Scheme .
These studios are built in such a way that it allows for elderly to be independent .
Some facilities include the construction of lifts at every floor instead of alternate floors and the installment of elder-friendly features such as non-slip tiles and grab bars .
Railing , ramps and passage way access to building are also made available .
With this , elder who have difficulty walking can get help by holding on to railing and at the same time exercise their leg muscles .
Ramps are also built for those wheelchair bound so that they can go in and out of the building without any help .
In addition , located within the perimeters are senior citizens' corners which allow them to mingle with one another .
However , one setback is the breakdown of family ties .
Children may not find the need to visit as they assume that the elderly have already had proper care .
Although some people claim that old people enjoy each other's company more than that of the young people , I find it hard to imagine an old person feeling very happy with only rare visits from his or her family .
Friendships may be important , but surely kinship is equally , if not , more important .
The government promotes close family bonding through education and celebrations such as 'Grandparents' Day .'
This way , the elderly can age happily in the comfort of their homes , surrounded by family and friends .
In conclusion , I agree that to a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the ageing process .
The elderly would feel more at east knowing that there are helps provided for them in their twilight years .
I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
It is well-known that our society is aging and there are strategies currently in place to aid the aged that would lessen their financial burden or other needs .
Singapore may suffer from long term economic loss while possible government support for the elderly could cost a portion of its Gross Domestic Product  to decline .
To deal with the limitation of public spending for the aged , a budget amount should be set aside to allow enough funds to be used for building and developing infrastructures , creating employment opportunities and improving standard of living to benefit the nation , as well as to increase its economy and its GDP .
Firstly , by having more funds , Singapore can build and develop new infrastructures .
Public transportation systems including light rail system , mass rapid transit system , as well as the current new railway network , Circle line , are well advanced to make the public accessible to any locations in Singapore .
Constructing of overhead bridges and expressways has made the citizens benefit too .
Developing housing facilities in new towns or designated places enable people to have water and power supply , modern sanitation and communication systems .
Currently , the government has set aside an amount to build integrated resorts , the casino , and tourism attractions to attract tourists to come to Singapore .
This would enable foreign money to come in and improve the economy .
Next , having more funds can create employment opportunities for the people .
Having hotels , shopping centers , transportations or other amenities would generate improve economy .
Tourists got to spend their money on accommodation in hotels , shopping and entertainment , food and beverages in restaurants , cultural shows and souvenirs and transportation would generate foreign money .
Employment opportunities would then be created to the local people such as hotel attendants , tour guides are needed .
Thus , these people need to be hired and they can contribute to the society and sustain the economy .
However , the rising standard of living can cause some factors that will contribute to the aging population such as high-quality health care , which helps people live longer .
Even though with the help from the government and fund raising campaigns set up by charity organizations , there will be still a sizeable segment of the population the government has to consider to continue to aid the aged .
With the rising cost of basic necessities and medical costs due to inflation in the future , those with no or low income aged group will suffer as these factors will cause the elderly not having enough savings or income to overcome the current economic climate .
Furthermore , social problems like quarrelling over money issues , or even stealing of money would happen in future .
Another point is that the elderly in their younger age may have contributed for the society and the economy .
Therefore , the government has to play a part to help the aged if they have any difficulties financially or in any other ways .
In conclusion , an aging population may decline Singapore's economy .
However , since the elderly in their younger age may have contributed for the society and the economy , we should spend a certain amount of money for their needs if they have problems dealing with money issues .
But , the amount must be balanced and have to take into consideration for other needs such as improving and developing infrastructures , creating employment opportunities and the rising standard of living of the nation .
The extent to which limitations of public spending on the aged has always been a complicated issue in many developed countries .
Over spending may result in a shortage of resources in the development of the nation while under spending may imply a negligence of government towards the aged .
We will discuss on the differences on whether to limit the public spending of the aged .
Firstly , with appropriate limitations , more money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Upon having better technology and infrastructure developments , the country will be able to attract more Multinational Corporations  to invest , and thus increasing job opportunities .
For example , Singapore had attracted MNCs such as Las Vegas Sands Corp . and Genting International & Star Cruises to invest in the tourism sector .
Integrated Resorts  that are built will generate an approximate of 50 ,000 to 60 ,000 additional jobs .
It is also estimated that there will be a boost in the tourism receipts by 2015 and this will improve the economy of Singapore .
Hence , it can be clearly seen that with limitations to public spending on the aged , the money diverse to other areas can help in boosting the economy condition of the country .

Finally , without limitations on public spending on the aged , it will lead to an increase in dependency on the public spending by the aged .
Apparently , some aged will try to abuse the public spending policy .
They will have this mindset that since government will be taking care of their lives , why would they need to work .
Hence , they will rely heavily on the government subsidies .
However , they may be a small minority of aged who are physically unfit to work .
They will need subsidies from government in order to maintain their lives .
Hence limitations on public spending should be implemented so that only this needy group of the aged will be the only recipients .
In conclusion , with proper limitations on public spending on the aged , the excess money can be made to the development of country thus improving its economy conditions .
More trust can be gained from the public with transparency .
Aged population will also be encouraged to take care of themselves instead of over-relying on public spending .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited .

In the modern societies , the aging population is increasing as a truth which cannot be denied .
The reason is that the more the living standard is developed , the more the life is lengthened .
Therefore , the government should consider carefully about the way to treat this special kind of citizens .
However , there are some people who state that the public spending on the aged should be limited , so that the money can be spent on other areas .
From where I stand , I totally agree with this idea .
This essay will give some reasons that support that idea .
Secondly , I hold the view that if all the other areas of the country are developed adequately , the living standard of the aging population will increase then .
It is easily to be seen that if all the other parts of the public facilities are improved strongly , the living standard will increase for all the people in the country , including the elderly .
As far as I concerned , when the living standard is developed , the incomes of the young people will go up so that they can pay more money to help their parents , who are the aged also .
Another argument against X is when the government pays so much on the other areas , there will not any money to help the elderly .
This counter argument is good but it may be not correct because the government pays for the other areas; they are also the public facilities , so that the elderly can receive those facilities also .
In my mind , the youth has a duty to care for their old parents as well as their parents took care of them when they were young .
All in all , there are many reasons which support the idea that the spending fee on the aged should be limited .
There are also many benefits that may bring the advantages back to the aged citizens .
All things considered , I totally agree with this idea .
Aging , a biological process which every single normal human in this world must experience every day , has become a quite serious problem for some countries in the recent decades .
Japan for instance , with its average age of population at 42 in the year 2009 , is having a quite serious problem with aging population .
What is actually the problem that the aging population brings ?
Basically , with the number of the working population dwindling down and the number of the so called "old aged" rising up , the expense for taking care of the "old" is increasing and the economy is facing a huge threat of collapsing .
This over , however , has been taken too seriously by some countries .
Although this problem is quite serious , over-emphasizing and spending too much in this problem is not a good idea .
I agree that spending for the old age should be limited for the "old" is not the only important part of a country .
There exist many other aspects of a country that needs more funding and , in some cases , spending more in these other aspects can actually help a country's aging population problem .
The aspect of education in a country is one of those that can indirectly help in easing the aging population problem .
How can the education sector help ?
Firstly we have to take a look at the cause of the decrease in the number of working population .
The decrease itself can be caused by 2 different things: low birth rate which means the problem arises because the shortage of youth and low education which means that the problem arises because the shortage of well-educated youths for the workforce .
In the latter case , reallocating the funds for taking care of the "old" to the education sector can help in both easing the aging population and developing the country .
One example of this case is Singapore .
With the education sector well funded , not only that Singapore can increase the number of workforce by increasing the number of educated youths , Singapore also manage to attract a lot of immigrants from the neighboring countries such as Malaysia , China , India , Vietnam , and Indonesia .
These immigrants and well-educated youth , in the long run , can ease the aging problem by becoming the workforce , increasing the size and moving the wheels of the economy and decreasing the elder dependency to the government .
Another aspect that can help in easing the problem is the industrial development aspect in a country .
On contrast with the earlier education sector which helps in easing the problem by eliminating the cause , an increase in spending in this sector helps by reducing the effects of the old aging population: the collapse of the economy .
The aging population problem can practically stop the turning wheels of economy as the ones who turn the wheel are the industrial and commercial sector of a country which needed youths as workforce .
By spending more in this sector , one can hope that the economy will not collapse and immigrants are more attracted to come .
Japan , in this case , is one good example .
Japan , as one of the developed countries , has put great emphasize in its industries .
Their industries , starting from the modern gaming industries such as koei and konami to the more luxurious and "heavy" industries of sport cars such as Mitsubishi are well-known have a wide range of customers around the world .
With the industrial sector well-developed , Japan can still maintain its economy from falling despite of its average population age of 42 and proved that funding the industrial development sector can really help in easing the aging problem by reducing the impact .
Although one can already see from the examples above that spending for the old age should be limited and the fund should be reallocated to other sectors , one might still think that we are in debt to the old age population because of their previous effort and work in the past and that we have to show our gratitude to them by allocating some fund for them , spending too much is still not wise idea .
Taking care of the old age population and spending some for them is indeed the government's obligation and responsibility but one can already see that there are some alternative and better ways to solve and to take care of this population problem just as shown above .
Spending too much on the old age population will not benefit the country at all as spending too much will only waste the funds and will not bring any development or solution for the problem .
On the contrary , spending in other areas might bring benefits as well as solutions for the problem .
The examples stated above have already shown the facts that reallocating the funds will greatly benefit a country .
Spending in education will help in developing the country and eliminating one of the causes of the aging population problem while spending in industrial development will help in attracting immigrants and keeping the economy running .
These examples with the fact that spending for the old age population will not bring any benefit have proven that it is better to limit and reallocate the spending for old age .
Just as the aging population is a serious problem , spending for the old age population is also a problem if it is not done properly .
Spending on the old age must be limited and not too many as there are other aspects as shown above that also need to be funded .
On the other hand , spending on the old age should not be too little either as spending too little will cause the population to be upset and therefore decreases the government stability .
It is a challenge for the government to find the right portion of the spending that has to be allocated for the old age population in the country as it is one of the obligations and responsibilities a government has .
The better , however , is spending more on the other aspects rather than spending on the old population .
If one can solve the aging problem and develop the country at the same time by spending more on other sectors in the country just as mentioned above , why would one choose not to and spend more on the old age population ?
The aging problem is gradually growing into a larger concern for many developed and developing countries in recent years .
Furthermore , this problem is likely to become more serious in the near future as the lifespan of mankind keeps increasing .
This is when technology comes into play .
Technology acts as an essential role in helping ease the aging process for the elders in mainly three ways .
First of all , technology makes it possible to slow aging speed to some extent .
Newest advanced technology offers new therapies , anti-aging products , and etc .
For instance , the Laser ablation of Lipofuscin , a new anti-aging project , aims to tune the use of laser pulses in order to remove lipofuscin from aged cells , to hopefully cure or reduce aging .
The accumulation of Lipofuscin is implicated in a variety of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease .
If this research concludes in a major success , it may completely redefine the meaning of being old .
Other anti-aging products such as a skin-care cream can contribute in making a part of the consumer's body stay young .
Now that human can age at a slower speed with the help of technology , people no longer wake up to the horror that the reflection in the mirror looks so old that it does not correspond with the memory .
Last but certainly not least , technology promises a brighter future for all men , including the elders .
In fact , the future is not far away from the present .
Take a look at organs , for instance .
"Several different technologies for harnessing regeneration are now in clinical trials around the world .
One machine , being tested in Germany , sprays a burn patient's own cells onto a burn , signaling the skin to re-grow" .
Similarly , the quality of artificial organs is improving at an amazing speed , while the need of organ replacement is growing at an even faster rate .
It can be seen that future technology may lead to longer lifespan and better healthcare , as well as possible ways to make an elder's body literately young and energetic once again .
Technology has been playing a major part in helping ease the aging process .
It slows human's aging speed , makes up human's deficiencies when they grow old , and promises a brighter future that human can look forward to .
It is most likely that technology will continue to play an essential role in almost all men's lives .
Firstly , the most common psychological change that elderly will experience is deteriorating memory .
This change can leads to a lot of complications such as forgetting to take medicine for other illnesses , wandering around the streets because they forget how to get home and unable to remember things they had just did .
Personal digital assistant  can be used to help the elderly remember things .
With this device , one can set time-based reminder to remind them to perform periodic chores for instance to take their medicine .
In the medical field , there are many ongoing researches to find medical cure to slow down or stop the process of deteriorating memory .
There are various non-profitable organizations all over the world seeking cure for common illness among elderly an example will be for Parkinson Disease there is the Parkinson's Institute and Clinical Center in America . 
Secondly , biological change is another change that aging brings about .
There are the obvious changes such as physical appearance and the not so obvious change in term muscular build and structure .
As one advances in age , their movement and reflex become tardier .
Radio Frequency Identification  technology is a new technology which is in use to help the elderly .
For example in Singapore , the Land Transport Authority  is looking into using RFID to help the elderly .
The traffic light will be modified to be able to extend the time for slow-walking elderly to cross the road when it detects an elder is going to cross the road .
Muscular related problems are common among the elderly .
Various types of pain-killer are introduced to help ease the pain of the elderly .
Lastly , the sociological change that elderly experienced is the desire to be closer to their family members .
Familial relationship is more important to them and they are more dependent on their children to look after them .
Work commitment makes it impossible for their children to be with them twenty-four seven .
Web-camera is a technology that can help bring members of the family closer .
They might not be able to meet physical daily but at least it is an alternative for the elderly to have their empty heart filled and know that they are care for .
Working children can also use web camera to keep a lookout for their elderly parents at home and should any mishaps happen they can go to their aid immediately .
In conclusion , technology helps an elder to adapt to changes in aging process easier .
It can help fulfill their psychological , biological and sociological needs .
Based on the aging statistic conducted by the Administration of Aging , "the older population who aged 65 years old and above in America is numbered to be 37 .3 million in 2006" and it is expected to be rising where there will be "more than twice the number by 2030 ."
As the population aged , there will be a higher probability for elderly to suffer from certain illnesses and disorders that will affect both their physical and mental health .
Some of the illnesses and disorders include Alzheimer's disease , chronic disease such as hypertension and diabetes and cataract .
However , as the technology become more and more advanced , countries will be able to tap into the newer technologies and develop more elderly friendly inventions that eventually ease and slower the aging process .
Firstly , Alzheimer's disease is "the loss of intellectual and social abilities that is severe enough to interfere with daily functioning ."
Based on research , the number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease rise "from around 2 .8 million people to 5 .1 million today" and the probability of people "developing Alzheimer's disease doubles every five years after the age of 65" .
Thus to aid those elderly who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease , many researchers have used the current or newer technology to come out with different innovative solutions .
One of the examples will be a "reminder robot which is developed by the University of Tokyo" .
This reminder robot which is named as "Mamoru monitor every move its owner makes and verbally alert them when they are trying to do the same activity twice a day" .
This help to prevent the elderly from forgetting and doing the same thing/action repetitively in a day .
In addition , the University of Tokyo has also developed another reminder robot where "it monitors a room with camera and senor to keep track of where pre-registered objects have been placed in the room ."
This helps elderly to locate their items and ensure that they will not misplace their valuable items .
Secondly , chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes are very common illness among the aging population .
These illnesses required constant and regular medication and treatment from the doctor to keep it under control .
From research , "death rate from high blood pressureincreased25 .2 percent ,and the actual number of deaths rose56 .4 percent ."
To ensure that the elderly go for their treatment and take their medication constantly , researchers have come out with practical solutions that eventually alert/ remind the elderly to take their medications on time .
The first example will be the automatic pill dispenser called the Medtime XL .
"Medtime XL is a device for dispensing medicine where it reminds the user when the medicine shall be taken and making the correct dose available .
"Besides that , "alarm will also sound and pills rotate into position" based on the individual medication time and the "alarm will only go away after the users have turned the device upside down" to retrieve their pills .
The second example will be the "Ageing Lab's Robot Pet called the Pill Pets" .
Pill Pets is created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  where "it reminds owner to take their pill or go to the doctor for regular treatment or checkup ."
If the elderly fails to perform the task required by the pill pets , the "pill pet will try a more visceral reminder which include simulating sickness or death ."
By having those inventions , children of elderly suffering from chronic disease will not have to manually remind their parent on their medication dosage and time through phone and thus train the elderly to be more independent .
Thirdly , as we aged , the chance of getting a vision disorder such as cataract will be higher .
Based on research , "by age 80 , more than half of all Americans are suffering from cataracts ."
"A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision ."
To help those elderly who are suffering from cataract , researchers have come out with various creative solutions that are closely related to their daily lifestyle .
The first example will be the Tek Partner TV remote .
"Tek Partner TV remote is a special TV remote that consists of large , illuminated buttons" .
The second example will be the "Accenda Voice-Adicted TV remote where "elderly is able to change the TV channel and play video through voice command" .
By having these elderly friendly inventions , it increases convenience and elderly would be able to better operate their television with their blur vision and there will not be too much strain on their eyes when they look and use the remote control .
However , the critics of this argument feel that the current technology does not help to ease the aging process , but instead , it infringes the privacy of the elderly .
It is true that technological invention tend to infringe the privacy of the elderly , but it still help to ease the aging process as the monitoring of elderly through various electronic ways are done at a good cause .
Due to the increasing aging population , there will be an increasing number of elderly that are likely to suffer from disease such as dementia .
By monitoring the elderly actions through web camera and reminder robot , children of the elderly can be better informed of the well-being of their parents and thus able to work at ease .
Other than that , monitoring can also give the elderly more sense of security as everything will be recorded down and they can easily refer to the recorded video without straining their brain cells to recall and find those items that they have misplaced it .
In conclusion , increasing aging population has posed huge challenges to the whole world .
With advanced technology , elderly friendly inventions can be easily developed to train the elderly to be more independent and thus help in easing the aging population .
Besides that , through advanced technology , it can further help to lighten the workload and burden of the government .
Do you know that by 2030 , Singapore's aging population would increase from 8 .4% in 2005 to 18 .7% in 2030 thereby making it as one of the fastest aging population in Asia .
This can be translated into an increase of about 296 ,000 in June 2005 to 873 ,300 in 2030 .
As elderly aged , they are bound to suffer from illnesses such as visual and mobility impairment and stroke .
Although no treatment has been discovered to cure such illnesses , the only way is to improve and come up with new innovative technology to help ease the current aging process .
Although critics argue that technological inventions have helped to ease the aging process , this however , may not be the case .
In overall , technological inventions may be a great help to the elderly .
However once the elderly becomes over dependent on technology , they will be at a loss once the device is unable to respond to its correct state .
This will result in the elderly being unable to continue with their daily lives .
For example , there is no absolute assurance that device that will never breakdown .
What if an elderly who is operating an electric wheelchair suddenly breaks down in the middle of the road and the elderly got stranded in the middle of the road; this will definitely cause disastrous effects to the elderly and to the traffic .
Therefore this is the main reason why technological inventions may have not ease the aging process in Singapore .

However with the increase of elderly in Singapore , the number of elderly suffering from all kinds of illness also increases .
Without the use of technology , there will not be enough care givers in Singapore to provide support and help to the sick elderly .
Therefore , the need for technologies will be the only solution to help ease the aging process .
With technologies getting more and more advanced each day , elderly who suffers from illnesses requires technology to reduce their burden and ease their daily lives .
With "age-related macular degeneration being the major cause of visual impairment in elderly ," "it has been proven that patients who suffer from visual impairment have difficulty recognizing faces or identifying objects ."
Not only will elderly have difficulty recognizing different faces , they will also lose their ability to perform simple task such as pouring a cup of water .
However as technology advances , new and improve innovations are created to help elderly solve such awkward problems .
For example a new technology called "Braun Bell Mug" is designed to assist elderly who suffers from visual impairment .
This technology allows elderly to pour water into the mug without fearing that water will overflow .
As this cup is installed with water surface sensors in the mug with 3 indication levels  on the handle along with a bell integrated in the cup , elderly would just need to select the level of the water they desire .
After selecting the level , elderly would then pour the water until it reaches the desired level and a bell will immediately sound off to alert the elderly to stop pouring .
This ensures that elderly would not get scalded when handling with hot water .
Therefore , with this innovative technology , it would definitely ease the elderly aging process .
Another illness that brings forth attention is mobility impairment .
As elderly aged , they will gradually lose neuro-muscular coordination which in terms means losing of muscle power or balance .
This will result in elderly suffering from falls and which in turn risks osteoporosis-related fractures .
Technology is also able to relieve the elderly in this situation , for example the "HipSaver Hip Protector" is designed to help prevent elderly from sustaining fractures and minimize the forces of impact if they really fall .
This invention is an all-soft one piece brief with thin tapered elastic foam pads encased in a waterproof and airtight pouch .
It effectively protects the elderly by absorbing the impact from a severe fall .
According to this source , a controlled study is conducted on elderly over the age of 79 , and the percentage of elderly who uses the HipSaver Hip Protector had 199 falls over 26 months with no hip fractures while the group of elderly who did not use suffers 369 falls over 26 months with 16 sustained hip fractures .
At the same time , an air pad will inflate like a miniature air bag diverting the force away the hipbone .
Elderly can wear this comfortable Hip Protector for the whole day in comfort .
Lastly with this device , it provides confidence and independent living for the elderly .
"In Singapore , the 3rd leading cause of death is stroke ."
"Stroke is a disease that affects arteries supplying blood to the brain and causes sudden non-convulsive malfunction to the brain .
Unless the blood supply restores , part of the brain cells will die and this will cause irreversible permanent brain damage ."
There is an increasing number of elderly who suffers from stroke and many of which became disabled .
Thus , as technology advances day by day , there are many various innovative solutions that help the elderly to solve the problems faced in their daily lives .
For example , a new invention called "My Spoon" has been invented to help disabled elderly .
"My Spoon" is a robotic arm which operates by controlling the joystick where elderly can be able to move it in 4 directions  to maneuver the arm which can wield a spoon or a fork to bring the food to their mouth .
Elderly would use the joystick to select their desired food on the food tray .
One of the users , Takashi Fuzawa who had tried out this device , commented that this device has helped him to eat by himself without much help .
This technology benefits the elderly by obtaining minimal help from the care givers to feed them and allowing them to gain confidence in living an independent life .
According to a report concerning the aging population in Singapore , "there is an increase of elderly living alone from 10 ,400 in 1990 to 25 ,700 in 2000 ."
With more elderly living alone , the need for more care givers also increases .
Moreover , as elderly are prone to illnesses and accidents , they might suffer from severe falls and strokes .
However with technology improving drastically , many new innovative technologies have surfaced to assist the elderly .
With these elderly care devices and gadgets , elderly can lead a safe and independent life with minimal help from care givers .
In conclusion , the importance of technology has created an impact in elderly daily lives and has helped to ease the aging process .

Based on a recent survey conducted on the impact of technology on the elderly , majority of the elderly surveyed believe that advancement in technology "will produce better quality of life for themselves" .
Indeed , advancement in technology has helped to ease the aging process in terms of health , lifestyle and safety .
Firstly , technological inventions in the field of science have made health care more efficient .
Majority of the elderly suffer from memory loss .
In fact , up to "5 percent" of the elderly in a population suffer from it  .
This can cause health deterioration , as these elderly may not be able to remember to take their medications .
However , recent technology such as the "Med-eMonitor from InforMedix" can help to ease this burden  .
The Med- eMonitor is a pill organizer that has different compartments to separate medications , a built-in reminder system , an on-screen instruction panel and a communication line  .
When it is time to take the medication , a musical chime will be played to alert the elderly .
If the elderly does not respond to this chime , "the machine can place a phone call to a family member or care provider"  .
Another example would be online health services .
Today , health care has gone digital .
There are many websites available , which provide online health checkups .
One example would be Hear-it .org .
It provides an online hearing test that determines whether an elderly would "benefit from wearing hearing devices"  .
This makes it much easier for the elderly , especially for those who have trouble walking , as they do not have to visit a test centre in order to get their hearing tested .
Such technologies make health care much simpler , which in turn , makes it much more efficient .
Secondly , technological inventions can help improve the lifestyle of the elderly by making them more independent and bringing them closer to their relatives .
Take Japan for example .
Nearly "22 percent" of its population consists of the elderly  .
Thus , Japan resorted to technological inventions "to care for  rapidly graying population"  .
An example would be "Secom Co .'s My Spoon feeding robot" that helps the elderly eat with a "spoon and fork-fitted swiveling arm"  .
Another example would be the "rubber and nylon muscle suit developed by the Tokyo University of Science"  .
This suit "helps to keep the elderly active by providing upper body support" and allows them to "lift heavy objects" with ease  .
With inventions like these , the elderly will no longer need to rely on relatives and care providers for support .
Today , there has been an increase in the number of breakdown in family ties .
One of the reasons for this may be that many elderly suffer from hearing loss .
Conversation between family members and relatives becomes frustrating , as they have to constantly repeat themselves .
This causes tension between relatives and family members .
Thus , many elderly tend to seclude themselves from the society  .
With hearing aids , this problem will no longer be present .
"More than 30 percent  experience improvements in six months"  .
With these improvements , elderly will no longer have to worry about troubled family relationship , thus bringing them closer to their family .
Lastly , technological inventions can help keep the elderly safe in their homes .
Today , many companies provide home monitoring systems .
An example would be QuietCare .
QuietCare uses an "average of five to seven" sensors to monitor movement within the elderly home  .
It can detect , using infrared sensors , if there is "a lack of movement" within the home and notify the relative or a care person  .
Another example would be the intercom doorbell , which can help the elderly "respond to visitors without having to rush"  .
This , in turn , can help prevent injury caused by falls .
The most common invention would be the webcam .
An example would be Willing Webcam that has a built-in "motion capture detection sensor"  .
This sensor can activate actions such as "sending emails" , "SMS text message" or "sounding an alarm"  .
It can detect "the slightest movement in the home" and notify the user if there is an intruder  .
With such technologies at hand , elderly will be confident to live alone knowing that their safety is well taken care of .
With such advancement in technology , aging would be a worry of the past .
As we head towards the future , more technological inventions would rise , easing the aging process even further .
Who knows , in the future we might even have a fully automated house with a built-in conveyer belt to guide the elderly from one point to another .
Governments often put their focus on the country's development such as economic growth and do not see the importance of taking care of the aged .
As the problem of an aging population arises , governments turn their attention to this group of people and provide some assistance for them .
However , the main priority is still on the country's development and the spending on the aged is not sufficient to curb the aging population's needs .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be limited just to contribute more towards the country's development .
The aging population problem should be viewed at the same importance as the country's development .
If governments were to provide little or no help to the aged , the citizens would be worried about their future in the country and result in a threat to social stability .
On the other hand , if public spending on the aged is not limited , this would cause an adverse effect on the younger workforce .
For example , more tax would be imposed on them in order to have more funds for the aged .
However , Australia's pension scheme has proven to be effective in higher taxes to provide pension for the aged .
The factors leading to an aging population are low birth rate and advanced health care .
Governments are constantly trying to produce effective solutions to deal with the factors which are part of the development plan .
However , governments should not limit the spending on the aged as those solutions will not solve the current situation of the aging population that countries are facing .
For example , if money is diverted to the child benefits scheme , this will improve the situation of low birth rates but does not relieve the need for elderly assistance .
This will result in old age dependency on the younger generation and could affect the productivity of the workforce .
Although some countries implement a retirement savings policy which is compelled by law , this is only a preventive measure to reduce the old age dependency .
Therefore , there is still a need to set aside some funds for the elderly .
Governments should prioritise on problems which require more attention .
They can cut down spending on other areas rather than the funds for the aged .
For example , military spending should be reduced if the country is already enjoying peace and defense stability .
However , military is deemed so essential that it is the "prerequisite" to all areas of development in the country .
Although the country's defense cannot allow for any complacency , the benefits of investing in a military can only be projected as a contributing factor to the economic growth .
Nevertheless , the aging population problem must not be overlooked by focusing on only the important factors contributing to the country's development .
The aging population can be viewed as part of the country's development and should not be taken lightly .
If governments do not provide enough aid and thus lead to an increase of the severity of the situation , it can indirectly affect the country's development .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be compromised for the country's development .
In the contemporary society , the elder are well taken care of in many countries .
Some governments even do it "too" well that a large amount of money , which should be spent on other social issues , is wasted .
There should be changes in the policies about this problem .
First of all , there should be a careful consideration about what are the things that governments should pay for .
As for healthcare service , it is not reasonable that the elder can have free or low-priced treatment for all kinds of sickness .
Instead , it should be limited that everyone mustn't have any priorities when they get treatment for any kinds of illness that are resulted from unhealthy lifestyles .
For instance , the obese patients must pay full-price for their treatment since obesity is the consequence of the lack of exercising in their everyday-lives .
Moreover , governments should only pay for each individual a certain amount of money based on his or her financial position .
That everyone gets the same amount of money is neither fair nor efficacious .
There should be a prudent consideration so that it's worth every penny .
In conclusion , governments should cut off the inefficient amount of money spending on the aged and use it to invest in other aspects of society so that the result is better off not just for the aging problem .
Many developed countries such as Singapore are faced with severe ageing population .
As the number of elderly increases , countries are forced to allocate a larger amount of public spending to take care of their ageing population .
However , this spending should be restricted so that it would not become a restraining factor for the growth of nation .
Thus , I agree that public spending on the age should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development such as economic growth , education and general health of the public .
By limiting public spending on the aged , more money can be devoted to the progress of the economy .
Larger scales of technological investment can take place thus gaining better profit .
This economic growth is important because it allows the country to have the power to improve its citizen's quality of life .
Safe drinking water and proper shelters can be better provided for the population as a result of this additional growth .
Citizens enjoying this better quality of life are less prone to diseases promoting a healthier life .
To add on , the nation will also be able to build more hospitals and enhanced medical services to provide the population including the elderly with better health care .
The elderly of the nation will also be benefiting from this economic growth indirectly  .Caregivers , consisting largely of working adults , will be earning more income in parallel to the nation prosperity .
Furthermore , non-profit organizations dedicated to take care of the elderly are able to obtain donations easier as the members of the public are more able to contribute .
Clearly , economic growth not only affects the population positively but the elderly are also benefiting from it .
With larger financial support given , the education sector can be improved further .
More teachers can be trained to facilitate the learning environment of students .
Additional Universities and specialized schools can be built to enroll more students therefore allowing more citizens to get an education .
Through education , working adults are able to deal with highly complicated equipments that enable them to bring revenue back to the country .
Educating the population not only improve the economy by allowing them to become more efficient , but also allow them to plan for their retirement .
This would reduce their dependency on the government when they are old thus cutting public spending on the age .
Elderly who wished to continue working are able to do so by attend upgrading courses to facilitate them in finding jobs .
Another major area that helps with the country's development is health care .
Taking care of the population health is important as they contribute directly to the country's economic growth .
Workers who are sick would not be able to work .
Increased spending on research and development on the issue of health will allow the country to better take care of its citizens .
Moreover , the country would also be more prepared in case of a pandemic such as the H1N1 virus .
Elderly who are more prone to sickness will benefit from this increase in knowledge of health treatment .
Being advance in health issues , will also contribute to economic growth .
Patients from other countries will come here for these special treatments to cure their illnesses .
The country's expertise can also be sold to other countries too .
However , the mentioned advantages to the elderly are only applicable to the aged who have caregivers and are able to afford health services and education .
Single and poor elderly would not be able to reap the benefits but suffered because of limited public spending by the government on them .
Effective measures to identify these needy elderly are needed to separate them from the wealthier cohort .
Following which , appropriate amount of help is given equally to them so as to fully utilize the limited resources .
In conclusion , the country's development is more important than the aging population as it helps the entire population including the elderly .
The public spending on the aged should be limited as the other domains that would assist the country's developments are beneficial both to the population and the elderly .
The statement puts forward the proposition that the issue of ageing population is not as important compared to other sectors such as social , economical and political progress in a country .
Based on this idea , the government of a country should focus on improving these areas with the limited funds and not on its aged citizens .
In other words , sufficient funding of its aged citizens is not necessary .
This is a dangerous proposition .
I disagree with the notion of cutting public spending on aged to fuel other aspects of a country's development .
Such an act equates to deserting the aged , leaving them to support themselves .
In most cases , they are unable to .
Limiting spending on the aged population could bring about social instability , affecting society infrastructure which greatly affects a country's image in the international community .
We cannot abandon them as ultimately they are still an integral part of our society .
Government should spend much effort to take care of them by providing financial support .
It would be the most direct means of showing concern for them .
Not doing so would lead to many social problems such as climbing crime rates , street begging and so on .
In October 2003 , a ninety-one year old US citizen J .L Hunter Rountree was convicted of bank robbery in Texas , USA .
In his declaration statement he complained that he had no job , no children to support him and a petty monthly sum from the government simply could not support him .
He had no choice but to resort to bank robbery for survival .
He further confessed that even if he gets jailed , at least then he would not have to worry about meals .
He is just one of the extreme cases driven to desperation from government's inability to take care of the aged , many more suffer the same fate .
Do we really want such case to happen in our country ?
These social problems greatly affects a country's image .
When a country cannot even handle its own problem , there is no way it could be given chance to hold world class events such as Olympics which boosts its international reputation and many other areas .
The rippling effect that arises from the small social issue greatly affects a country's developments on many fronts .
Secondly , cutting funding with particular reference to the aged is undoubtedly seen as out casting the society group .
It portrays a government as practicing discrimination , which is a violation of human rights .
In modern world democracy , infringing on human rights is a grave matter .
Any government would be unwise to openly advocate for policies which discriminates against a particular society group .
Denying responsibility to take care of its less privileged elderly would draw criticisms from both international bodies and its citizens .
It would be deemed political suicide .
Ousting of the political party in ruling is only a matter of time .
What more of other areas of development can the political party talk about when its not the ruling party ?
Lastly , shrinking responsibility to take care of aged citizens will lead to drastic loss of talents in the country .
Citizens would consider migration and foreign talents would be less attracted to migrate into the country .
Knowing the government would not take proper care of them after they retire .
Perhaps on the short term pumping financial resources to areas such as technology and economy may produce expected results .
On the long term , the country will suffer from irreversible losses as progress is made by its people and remaining talents are insufficient to substantiate the growth .
While a country has to focus on many sectors of development and most likely funding for the aged is not a prime concern , its funding should never be limited .
In the coming years , as people live longer with each passing generation , our ageing population will climb steadily .
Eventually becoming a group that's too significant in numbers to ignore .
If a country fails to take care of this significant portion of society , its people would lose confidence in government's ability to handle other topics as well .
Then , all other developments are futile as no amount of progress can replace a government's credibility in its people's heart .
Singapore has severe population aging .
This issue will increase the health care spending and national budgets .
To deal with this problem , there are several policies or development implemented by Singapore's government to help to ease the aging process .
The second measure is the Maintenance of Parent Act .
This is an act to handle the cases relating to children abandoning their parents in nursing homes .
According to the article from Sunday Times , it is said that more than 400 elderly people have been beneficial from the Maintenance of Parent Act .
Of the 424 applicants , 328 or almost four in five were successfully compelling their children to take care of them .
This statistics show that the elderly people can be protected by the law .
However , some children might think that living with their parents is very nuisance because they need a lot of care and attention .
The health care spending is also another burden .
If you think in another way round , the parent's contribution to children may not be lesser than children's contribution to parent .
In addition , one must admit that the hardship of bringing out a child .
The parents need to teach them how to walk , pay for their medical and education fee , and etc .
Anyway , this is about the issue of filial piety .
Therefore , to protect the elderly people , the filial obligation must be stressed .
The last policy is the age-friendly policies which increase the employment of the older worker .
This policy aims to help the older worker to stay employed longer .
According to Xinhua News , Singapore's employment rate for workers aged to 55 to 64 is 57 percent today .
It is believed that it will increase until 65 percent in the next three years .
To deal with such challenge , Singapore's government has implemented many schemes to help the people work longer .
One of the examples is "ADVANTAGE !
Scheme" which has made more than 1 ,200 companies to employ 8 ,800 mature workers , to keep 19 ,300 existing older workers , and recruit more than 5 ,300 older workers .
However , some people might think that elderly people should stop working and enjoy themselves in their old age .
If they do not have sufficient retirement savings , it is very hard to enjoy themselves in their old age .
So , if people can work longer , they will be able to accumulate more savings that they could use to support themselves in their old age .
In addition , they could lessen the burden of their children .
In conclusion , there are three policies or schemes implemented by Singapore's government which are very useful to the elderly people .
They are MediSave , Parent Maintenance Act , and Age-friendly policy .
Overall , to a large extent , current policies or schemes adopted by Singapore's government has eased the aging process in the area of society , medicine , and workforce .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to divert this money to other areas of the country's development .
The reduction of the funds allocated for the elderly might lead to many social issues .
Apart from that , it is morally wrong for the nation not to support their citizens when they are aged .
Last of all , some families may not be able to support their elderly parents due to their low income .
Thus , public funds are essential for the aged to uphold their standard of living .
Certain social issues such as poor quality of life and insufficient funds for basic healthcare may arise from limited funding .
In general , most of the aged in Singapore are economically inactive and have a lot of free time on their hands .
In order to prevent them from turning to vices such as gambling and drinking , organizing more activities at various community centres are required for them to lead healthy social lives .
As these activities require government funding , limiting spending on the aged will make organizing these activities impossible .
Aside from social life , having basic healthcare is vital for the aged .
When people get older , it is only natural that they are more prone to illness be it mentally or physically .
At present , healthcare is dreadfully expensive and the aged may not be able to afford proper treatment should they fall ill .
Thus , if the government limits spending and does not subsidize the costs of these treatments , the financial burden on the elderly will be even greater .
Some may argue that it will be more beneficial to the country's economic growth , if the funds are diverted be used on economic development such as better infrastructure .
Nevertheless , limitation of public spending on the elderly might lead to many unhappy voices from the citizens as they might think that the government is not taking care of the aged population's welfare when they are unable to contribute to the economy .
It might then adversely affect the economy of the country as the citizens may not be willing to work for the country for fear of being abandoned by the nation once they are economically inactive .
So even if the funds are allocated to other areas of economic development , with the low morale and faith of the citizens , the fund may not be well utilized .
As we belong to a country influenced by strong Asian culture and beliefs , the country should uphold the moral value of filial piety .
The elderly have been working hard as nation builders for the country throughout their lives and it is only right for us to repay them for their effort .
Although it might seem like they are reaping the rewards of the current workforce , the workforce should never forget who brought them so far .
It is true that some of the families are able to afford to support their elderly parents and it should be their responsibility to bear the expenses of their aged family members instead of the government .
Nevertheless , there are some low income families who face high costs of living and cannot support both their children and elderly parents .
Hence , there should be distribution of public funds to the elderly parents of these families .
On top of that , there are elderly who have no children , so if their financial conditions are unstable , they should able to given the necessary funds to make ends meet .
In retrospect , in order to maintain a healthy social life for the elderly and lessen the burden of their families , sufficient funding should be allocated .
Therefore , considering all the various negative impacts in terms of social , economic and cultural factors on the society , I feel that public spending on the aged should not be limited and diverted to use in other areas of the country's development .

I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
This is because excessive public spending on the aged can hamper the country's development in other areas such as education , research and investments .
If the aged have children , the children should also be responsible for their parents' well-being in the first place .
Firstly , as a country usually allocates its budget to various areas , any increase in spending on a particular area will mean lesser spending on other areas .
For example , if a country decides to increase spending on the aged , lesser budget may be allocated for education , research and investment purposes .
Reduced spending on education can mean lesser educators and lowered standards of teaching , reduced spending on research can mean lesser incentives for researchers and for their research works and reduced spending on investments may mean lesser cooperation with international bodies .
Thus , a country's budget cannot be adjusted without much consideration and thought or else it can cause instabilities to the supporting pillars of a country .
Thirdly , if the aged have children , the children should also be responsible for their parents' well-being .
Having the children support their own parents will mean lesser dependency on the government .
Some children choose not to support their parents even though they can afford to do so , usually claiming that they need the money on other necessities and luxuries .
The government can start policies to make it compulsory for children to provide for their parents with the basic necessities such as housing and allowance .
Although such policies can reduce the people's dependency on the government , it may not be practical for some .
This is because some children may already have problems supporting themselves or even a new family which they started , so they may want to support their parents but are practically unable to do so .
Nevertheless , the government can be flexible with the policy such that if the children have financial difficulties they can then seek aid from them .
Clearly , as a country's aging population grows larger , the need for more spending on the aged will also grow .
But the increasing spending should be limited such that it does not hamper the country's development and stability .
Policies can be put in place to help the people themselves save up for their later years .
The dependency on the government can also be reduced by requiring the children to support their own parents when possible .
In recent years , many developed countries have been facing problems related to aging population , especially pressures on social support systems .
In view of the fact of dramatic increase in national budget spent on the aged , some people suppose that government should limit its expenditure on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , from my perspective , I unhesitantly take issue with the above idea and believe that elderly people deserve public support policies , instead of boundaries on healthcare and welfare schemes .
One of the primary reasons why government should not set limits on public spending on older people is the aim to create a higher quality of live for almost everyone .
A society is developed or well being only if its citizens satisfy the minimum requirements of health , happiness , safety , prosperity , and fortunes .
And obviously , those of old age should also be provided services such as healthcare , insurance , housing . . .Thus , there is no reason for government to eliminate its expenditure on this area while many people's lives can be improved thanks to the support .
Another factor that policy makers should consider before deciding to set boundaries on public spending on the aged is issues related to moral standards that recent years have witnessed their decline in many countries .
From this angle , public support policies for elderly people will make young generations change their attitude toward older people .
Improved healthcare services , subsidies . . . not only aid the aged in poor financial situations or make their health better but also are the ways people express their respects to the older , which has positive impact on enhancing younger people's treatment .
Last but not least , most elderly people after all have contributed to the development of country during their young ages through productive services as well as taxes .
Therefore , limiting public spending on them is irrational .
They deserve more support policies .
Government should not consider the rising expenditure related to programs to support a growing elderly population without mentioning their contribution in the past .
When taking account of all the above factors , I can safely conclude that public spending on the aged should not limited even though the amount of money can be used to invest on some areas like education , infrastructure , development projects .
Policy makers should find another solution to reduce the rising cost of healthcare or welfare schemes to maximize the benefits of both citizens and the nation .
Have current research and development helped to ease the aging process ?
As a man ages , his efficiency in both physical and mental capabilities decreases , causing many difficulties he would not have faced during his younger years .
Through current research and development , some of those problems had been eased significantly , providing a better aging experience .
In this essay , we will discuss how current research and development helped to ease some of the issues raised by immobility , health conditions and resource management that the aged faces .
Falls are one of the biggest issues caused by lowered mobility in the aged .
While individual efforts can be done to prevent falls , many of the aged are not aware of such prevention measures or they are unable to seek help if they fell despite of such efforts  .An article published by the American Academy of Family Physicians in April 2000 reported that falls caused 70 percent of accidental deaths in people aged 75 years and above .
Falls had also caused more than 90 percent of hip fractures in people aged 70 and above .
In order to address this issue , research in the wireless technology had developed a reporting solution to facilitate fall management .
A motion sensor and pager is installed in a watch and data will be sent to the database periodically .
Information which is collected includes location and motion level of the users .
Alerts can then be sent to family members who are not at home if the user is not within a designated area or had experience a falling motion .
Heart diseases are frequently accompanied with old age .
Acute Coronary Syndromes  or the commonly known "heart attacks" become frequent with advancing age .
A journal published by American Heart Association in year 2003 had cited 85 percent mortality rate by ACS is of patients aged 65 years old and above .
Heart attacks can be prevented if ACS is recognised but it is not the case unless the patient and the physician are both aware of the syndromes that surfaced .
In most situations a heart attack strikes at least expected times and in most occurrences , immediate medical attention is critical to the survivability of the patient .
Arrhythmia , which is the alterations in the heartbeat , has an increase chance to surface in an aged patient who survived a heart attack .
Medical advancements such as cardiac catheterization  , pacemaker  helps to ease some of the health conditions that are associated with old age .
A growing number of families had faced a common problem in elderly care and that is resource management .
Resource management may comprise of physical monitoring and medical records management .
Due to time constraints , some of the families employ services from nursing home or private nurses as they are unable to take care of their sick elderly .
However , not all services provided are trustworthy and satisfactory .
A news article by Telegram & Gazette  in 2007 had featured a lady who had not been properly taken care of , after the engagement of nursing services .
Research and development in Information Technology had allowed resource management to be simplified .
A good example is the conversion of current medical records to technological solutions .
The majority of the solutions are designed to send reminders , the medical conditions or medical schedules to its users .
These solutions greatly reduce the need for physical presences of family members because the manual tasks are now automated .
Research and development has created many convenient and simpler methodologies to help ease the aging process .
If research and development were ceased to exist , it would be much tougher to take care of the elderly as the world's aging population is expected to increase from now till 2050 .
Most developed countries are now confronted with more rapid aging in its population than the past .
As such , many countries that have started research , new development and policies to help to ease the aging process .
I agree to a great extent that these research , new development and policies will help to ease the aging process and also prepare the country with their aging population .
Countries are able to use new policy of encouraging elder employment , increasing the awareness of filial obligation or creating new development of infrastructures caters to the elderly in their country .
Firstly , countries can help to ease the aging process by implementing new policy of encouraging elder employment .
The government can help to achieve this by increasing the retirement age , creating more benefits and lowering barriers to elder employment .
This measure will help to ease the burden of the younger generation , allow the healthy elders to still contribute to the society and at the same time help to generate more wealth for the elder which they can use for themselves .
Japan is one good example that uses this measure successfully .
Although the retirement age is legislated at 60 , the government of Japan encourages the elder to continue to work up the age of 65 .
To help support the employers , the government provides grants and subsidies to the employers who employ the older workers .
Although some are prejudiced towards older worker due to their work efficiency and high salary cost , there are more benefits of employing them .
The older workers are more trustworthy , conscientious and dependable .
Other attributes include punctuality , lower absenteeism and less concern about monetary returns .
Therefore , implementing new policy of encouraging elder employment will help both economically and socially for countries with aging population .
Secondly , countries can increase the awareness of the filial obligation of its people .
It is the duty of the younger generations to display more filial piety towards their aged parents as they are the one who took care of us during our growing up days .
They provided us with unconditional love and even paid for all our living expenses .
A society that the children will take care of their parents will help to ease the government spending on the aging and divert the spending on other areas of the country .
In the Asian's culture and belief , it is the responsibility of the children to take care of their parents when they are financially stable .
Asia countries such as Japan and South Korea , most of the elderly still live with their adult children and can even help to cook , do house work and take care of the grandchildren .
However , contrary to the beliefs in Asian society , it is view as "not cool" in the western society to be living with your elderly parents when they grow up .
Living with their elder parents will not just limit they social life , but also causes their freedom to be taken away .
Personally , I feel that this is a very selfish act .
The adult children should take this as a responsibility of their life and do it with pride .
After all , it is their parents who took care of them when they were young .
So , increasing the awareness of filial obligation will result in more children taking care of their elder parents and help to ease the country aging process .
Lastly , countries can ease the aging process by building new development of infrastructure in the country .
To prepare the growing demands of an aging population , countries can build special infrastructure , such as hospitals or apartments , cater to the elderly .
This way , specialize and better care can be provided for the elderly .
An example will be Singapore , the government is building new infrastructure to prepare the growing demands of an aging population .
Singapore is building new community hospitals as well as linking up acute hospitals with community hospitals .
This way , patients can receive treatment at the acute hospital and then recuperate at the community ones .
Also , special apartments called studio apartments are being built for the elderly .
On the other hand , some may argue that the public spending on the aged should be diverted into other areas of the country's development .
Diverting the public spending into other areas of the country's development will cause the aging population problems to increase and hence also increases the burden of the younger generation .
As such , the public spending on building new infrastructure for the aging population should be encouraged so as to prepare countries for their aging population and ease their aging process .
In conclusion , current research , development and policy have help to ease the aging process and prepare a country in facing the demand of an aging population .
By creating policy of encouraging elder employment , the elders in the society will be more independent and able to support themselves .
Increasing the awareness of filial obligation will result in more adult children living and taking care of their elder parents .
Finally , building new development of infrastructure caters to the elders will help a country prepare for the aging population .
In many countries , the proportion of older people is steadily increasing .
It has been shown that the world is facing the aging problem .
The growing number of older people has caused the attention of many people and countries , and it has caused many problems to the society .
So far there are many countries have come up with many strategies to deal with the problem .
Although we cannot solve the problem in the short run , we can ease the problem in many ways .
To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
However , we should still go on to ease the problem .
The growing aged people has bring with many problems including greater pension pressure , increasing medical expenses , and the heavy burden of nursing care for the elderly and so on .
It can slow down the productivity of the society .
It also gives more burdens on young people .
It also discourages the young people to work hard because they think they can depend on the society when they are old .
It also has great impact on health-care .
For governments , there are generally two ways to deal with the problem .
One is to reduce the future old-age dependency burden by increasing available resources , which means to increase the size and productivity of tomorrow's working-age population .
One is to rethink the private attitudes and public policies that now equate old age with a loss of health which somehow entitles the elderly to government spending .
We should do the both ways to make deal with aging problem by making aging both more secure for older generations and less burdensome for younger generations .
The policy makers have find out many ways to ease the problem .
For example , government encourage old people continue to work , and government encourage people to save for their old-age , and encourage young people to product more and so on .
These policies have indeed eased the aging problem .
Without these policies , the government may increase spending on the old people or the young people will be more burdened .
For the young people themselves , they should work hard for their old-age and save to prepare for the old-age .
In this way , it can reduce the burden of the next generation and reduce the spending of government .
Also , it can encourage people to work hard and help to increase productivity .
For example , Singapore encourages people to save for their old-age .
In the past , the old people just depend on their next generations .
This can make the old people not secure if they have no children or their children are poor .
Thus , the people can secure themselves when they are old in this way .
For society , it can support the old people by building charity .
There are many charity funds in the society to help old people .
It can ease the aging problem without giving burden on the government and poor people .
What's more , it can help to distribute the property and decrease the gap between the rich and the poor .
However , some developed countries have high healthcare costs and thus aging may still impose an economic burden .
It is important to set appropriate limits on healthcare .
To do this , we should know what "health" means for an aging population .
Thus government should decide on what is essential and should therefore be supported by the public sector , and what should be left to individuals .
Besides , different countries have different policies for their own .
Every country has own features .
Thus one should not copy the so called paradigm of developed countries .
The developing countries may not have enough capacity to deal with the problem because they have not enough money .
The developed countries can also help developing countries to ease aging problem as it is a global problem .
Some countries deal with the aging problem by encouraging young people to have more babies .
It is a good way to ease the problem for the countries having small population .
However , it does not always work in other countries having big population like China .
To a large extent , governments , society , and young people should do something for the aging problem .
We can ease the aging problem from different angles .
So far current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
However , we should keep calm and continue to deal with the problem .
It is a well known fact that the proportion of the elderly in every developed nation's population is on a rapid rise , thanks to increased usage of birth controls and past government policies .
Along with this phenomenon comes a wide range of problems such as social problems and ethical issues .
Inevitably , governments must intervene in order to curb this ageing population problem .
However , governments' intervention often meant huge spending on medical resources and infrastructure for the elderly , which created many other economic problems such as hindrance of the nation's economic progress .
Hence I agree that public spending on the aged should be reduced so that the government can use the available funds on other sectors of the society .
Reducing funding on the elderly meant that the government have more capital to spend on improving their economy .
The funds could go to many different types of industries for research and development purposes .
The money could also go into building cost-saving infrastructures , hence attracting more businesses to the country .
When the economy improves , almost everyone , from the individual consumer to large multi-national companies , in the society will be able to benefit , as opposed to spending on just the elderly where only one group of people will really benefit from the funding .
For example , Singapore government spent a lot of resources to build Jurong Industrial Park so as to enhance its competitiveness in the global market , resulting in rapid increase in economic growth .
Hence governments should focus more of their resources into improving their economy , rather than spending so much of their funds on the aged .
On the other hand , critics of this notion have argued that with reduced government spending , less educated old folks and those who did not saved enough would be at a severe disadvantage as compared to the rest of the population .
The government funds would not reach them at all .
These less competitive elderly people would be cut off from any benefits of economic growth .
However , this situation might not be necessarily true because if governments focus more of their funds onto the economic sector , the increase in capital as a result of rapid economic growth allows governments to create social programs for these more disadvantaged elderly people .
In the end , the main idea is that with more funds from the economic growth , governments can do so much more to help these elderly folks .
Governments can also use their funds on the education sector .
Since large amount of money is needed to support an ageing population , governments have to increase their own existing pool of resources to order to generate such amount of capital .
One such method is increased focus on education .
The governments could spend more on education , resulting in much better education institutions offering higher-quality education to the people .
The aged workers would benefit as well because governments could introduce educational campaigns that help subsidise skills upgrading for the elderly workers .
The population on the whole would become more skilled and hence increase their competitiveness in the global market .
The country would be able to compete more effectively on a global scale .
In contrast , aged workers , due to less governments' funding , might become even more dependent on their children .
In the end , it is still very taxing on the working population , whom now not only have to support themselves and their children , but also their parents as well .
However , it can be argued that after all it is the children's responsibility to take care of their parents .
This belief is especially true in Asian countries .
Hence , governments should encourage their normal working population to take responsibility for taking care of their elder parents , through social awareness campaigns .
In this way , economic growth will not be hindered and at the same time , the issue of ageing population is handled in an appropriate and ethical manner .
In conclusion , government spending is important for all sectors of the country's development .
However , there are limits on how much they can spend on each area .
Furthermore , new challenges and problems will arise in the future; hence because of these two reasons , I feel that government should not be too focused on the ageing population issue as there might be other more urgent issues that require their immediate attention in the future .
Personally , I do agree that spending on the aged should be limited so that more money can be channelled to other areas of the country's development .
Instead of priming the spending on the aged as one of the key focus on our annual budgeting regularly , I strongly feel that the Singapore government should remedy its focus and divert its focus to other key areas such as military , urban development and education spending .
Firstly , military spending is of paramount importance to all sovereign countries like Singapore .
The adequate spending on the military aspect not only conveys a strong deterrence message to our potential aggressors , it will also instill confidence into our business partners .
The confidence that Singapore is well protected militarily ensures their continual long term presence and active involvements in shaping the country's financial establishments .
In addition , plenty more foreign investors may be attracted to this safe haven with the aim of expanding their dynamic business empire .
Evidently , we can see how well it is to diversify our spending , rather than just allocating a lion share to cope with the aging problem solely .
In conclusion , we can see vividly how important it is to diversify our spending into military , urban development and education purposes , instead of just placing our top most priority on spending on the aged at the centre of the radar .
As long as their health and well beings are taken care of , our priorities should be channelled to spendings on other more relevant and crucial areas like military , urban development and education purposes .
Resultantly , these does not only aid in the nation's continual progress , it will also enable us to create a competitive edge over our neighbouring countries and also build a strong presence in the financial sector in this region !
Every country has its own strategies in development depending on its current situation .
Nowadays , as the world population is gradually aging , the governments start to adopt a new policy on the public spending .
Some people believe that "Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
To some extent , I agree that we agree spend more money on education and environment since investing for country's development is also a way to invest for the elderly .
First of all , education should take a higher priority than life of the elderly as investing on education is the inevitable preparation for the next generation .
For example , many European countries such as Denmark , Sweden and Cyprus allocate nearly 7% of their GDP into public investment in education .
That money goes to modernization of schools and universities , and helps to train students better , to make them talented scientists or skillful workers .
As a result , this public investment enhances the country's intellectual standards of its people , and that leads to an increase in economics as people works more efficiently with knowledge .
Consequently , the government will have more money to provide better services of the elderly care .
After all , not only the young but the old people will also benefit from the investment on education .
Second , government should also divert the money into the environment .
Recently there have been so many symposiums talking about the earth , the climate change , etc .
Just those conferences can show us how important the environment is .
As a matter of fact , spending money for environmental improvement really brings global benefits .
For example , this could help us to preserve many beautiful natural scenes , which attract many people and thus impulse the country's tourism .
Moreover , living in a clean and fresh environment is better for everyone's health , including the elderly .
According to a recent study done by the U .S National Institutes of Health  , environmental factors , as well as the genetic , contribute to the longevity and ability of avoiding severe diseases that come along with aging , such as cancer , stroke or high - pressure .
Therefore , green funds can actually offer good returns for everybody .
However , although investing for development will bring good things for the country , we should not spend 100% of the money for it .
In other words , this means we need a policy so that money can be dispersed appropriately .
Firstly , investment for the old is an issue of morality .
People spend their whole life working and contributing to the future of their country , so after retirement , it is time for them to rest , and elderly care is somehow the requital for what they have done for the society .
Furthermore , as the young see that the government pays good attention to the elderly , which they will become , they will know that their future is well-secured .
Correspondingly , people will work harder , and there is no doubt that the country will thrive by leaps .
In conclusion , caring about the country's future development is good , but we should never forget about the past , the people who are now not capable of supporting their own lives .
It is much better to have a suitable and balancing money distribution of public investment between elderly care and other aspects .
Population aging generally refers to the increase in the percentage of elderly people in a country .
According to the latest statistics reports , the current number of elderly people is increasing constantly at 8 million per year globally .
Due to this situation , many countries have spent huge amount of public spending on the aged in order to ease the various problems that came along with it .
However , I believe that instead of focusing so much on the aging issue , it is sometimes wiser for the government to divert the money to other areas of country's development which includes education and military .
Another reason why people support the idea of public spending on elderly people is the fact that it's a natural process for everyone to age .
Therefore , taking good care of the elderly people also means securing a better future for ourselves .
However , all of them have glossed over the fact that this can only be done when we have ensured security and safety of the whole nation in the first place .
Imaging living in a country like Sri Lanka where people live in fear everyday with its never ending wars between the local army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam .
How is it possible to look after the aged when the whole nation's security is at risk ?
It is apparent that we should not compromise on the part of military spending so as to obtain a harmonious and stable society within the country .
This is also the reason why more and more countries are increasing their military spending .
In 2008 , the global military expenditure rose by 4 percent to a record of $1 .4 trillion .
Therefore , it is clear that the military development should be ranked with a higher priority as compared to the spending on the aged .
However , this does not mean that we should forgo any spending on the elderly people in the country .
Being the ones who have served the community for so many years , there is definitively a moral obligation for us to provide to our seniors .
Many countries like US have set aside a large sum of money to ensure the welfare of elderly people annually .
Different healthcare policies are also implemented in different countries to allow the old people to enjoy free medical services .
All of these are done as a recognition of what they have contributed to the society for so many years .
In conclusion , although it is indeed necessary for the government to take care of the elderly people in the country with its public spending , there are many other areas of development that should be looked into in the first place such as education and military .
Without making these developments , there's no way we can ensure that the welfare of the graying generations is met .
One reason that public spending on the aged should be limited is that some of it can be diverted to develop military .
Nowadays , internal or external crimes such as bombing or terrorism can be happened at anytime and anywhere .
According to the World Fact Book 2008 , published by the Central Intelligence Agency , military expenditure from all over the world has increased .
Singapore , for instance , is one of the 25th greatest expenditure on military .
Being a small country with a small population compared to other big countries , Singapore has less manpower .
This is the reason Singapore has great expenditure in military; Singapore wants to improve its military defense .
That's why some of the public spending should be diverted to military .
Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited and diverted to military development .
To sum up , even though the aging issue is quite difficult to handle , but still , public spending for the elderly should have a certain limitation .
Therefore , the elderly will be more encouraged to be independent and self sufficient .
Other than that , some of the public spending should be allocated for education as a purpose to prepare the younger generations and for military to improve the military defense .
The global aging issue has aroused public attention around the world .
Research shows that "The number of persons above 60 years or over is likely to triple , increasing from 673 million in 2005 to 2 billion by 2050" .
Everybody will get old eventually and when we grow older , most likely we will suffer from some organ decline or mental decline .
Some illnesses , such as vision loss , hearing loss and senile dementia , often make the elderly feel frustrated , isolated and lonely .
However , as technology advances day by day , it has helped us slow down these aging processes by applying technologies in more creative ways .
Technology can provide a mean for the elderly to have a more enjoyable life .
Their free time can be better spent in a quality and meaningful way .
Firstly , technology introduces a wider variety of entertainment for the elderly to choose from .
Due to the booming of the media and gaming industry , many sophisticated technological inventions are penetrating the market and becoming more affordable and ubiquitous .
This is unlike the 1970s when old people normally led a monotonous life like listening to the radio or reading newspaper to kill their free time .
Today , with many technology inventions such as television , gaming consoles , and karaoke becoming widely available , the elderly have a wider range of option for entertainment .
Moreover , they are more willing to spend money on these technology inventions because it is one way to attract their grandson and relatives to visit them and enjoy the fun and entertainment offered by the technology .
In fact , this makes the home livelier and merrier .
Secondly , the elderly can now expand their social networks beyond the neighborhood by means of internet , which is a fruit of technology itself .
They are no more confined to the same area around their house but can actually look out the the outside world .
In America , Statistics has indicated 45% of the senior citizens age 70-75 are now online , meaning that internet has become a channel for the elderly to connect to the outside world .
In addition , they enjoy mixing with other people especially youngster via virtual communities such as facebook , flikr , and Del .icio .us .
Therefore , their life will not be boring for them because they can learn and know friends on the internet .
Clearly , aging process can be eased by current research and development .
Aging effect that has been the nightmare to everyone can be diminished by a large margin and quality of the twilight years can be greatly improved in parallel to the level of science and technology .
It is possible that in the future , aging effects can be diminished to so low a level that the elderly enjoy healthy and fulfilling lives into their twilight years , without putting a heavy burden on their children and grandchildren .
Many countries nowadays are facing with the problem of fast aging population .
As a result public spending on the aged will increase and eat into the spending on other areas of country's development .
However this does not solve the aging issue in the long run , in fact it will hinder the progress of a country .
Therefore either a developed or developing country , public spending on the aged should be limited , and divert to other areas of development that could sustain even in the long run .
Another important area would be environment .
Earth's average temperature has increase dramatically over the past few years and resulting to an increase in the awareness of global warning around the world .
Building a greener environment became the objective of many countries , so as to protect our mother planet .
In the long run , it will not only benefit the current population but also the future generation .
For the example of Iceland , they have replace its energy sources from coal and oil to geothermal and hydropower for decades .
This has helps to eliminate the amount of greenhouse gases emission and hence reduce air pollution to the environment .
As a result , now their citizens are able to enjoy fresher air which means that they will be healthier at an old age .
Last area that this essay is going to cover is the military development in a country .
With increasing terrorism activities around the globe , the ability to keep the country safe and stable become an important issue .
Without security there can be no economic development .
Conversely , stability & security are in serious jeopardy without economic development .
By achieving security and economic stability , then a country will be able to exist .
For the example of Singapore , we have always believed that National Service is important in keeping our country stability .
As it not only protects our country from external threats , it also brings foreign investment into our country .
Only then will Singapore be the safest place for everyone to live in .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged will only benefits a minor group of people and slows down the country's progression .
Therefore in order to benefits everyone in the country which also includes the aged , there is a need to diverge the money into other areas of the country's development .
The healthcare systems are now also improving to meet the need of the elderly .
Statistic from The Center for Disease Control  shows that: "88% of those over 65 years of age have at least one chronic health condition; nearly 40% of deaths in America can be attributed to smoking , physical inactivity , poor diet , or alcohol misuse; and almost 20% of older Americans suffer from a mental disorder that is NOT part of normal aging ."
Long-term healthcare has become a vital need for old people .
Many counties are paying more and more attention to the healthcare system as the proportion of the old population increasing .
For example , the United States is considered spending more money on heath care than any other nation in the world , approximately 15 .3% of GDP and expected to reach 19 .5% of GDP by 2017  .
More research show that about 97% of older American are benefiting from healthcare system through health insurance like Medicare .
Being covered by healthcare insurance has become critical for old people especially those with disabilities and chronic illness associated with aging .
There was a quote , "Age is a prison from which we cannot escape" , by Morrow Bourne .
Indeed , aging is a natural process that everyone will experience it .
Due to ageing , some of the people may suffer from physical and mental depreciation .
As people are a country's most precious resource , the governments should help its people when they are suffering from ageing problems .
In recent decades , many countries have invested a certain amount of money in areas such as science and technology in order to develop new products such as an intelligent system , iShoe and big button TV remote controller that would help the elderly .
I certainly agree that these developments have greatly helped to ease the aging process .
To conclude , science and technology have help in developing products in order to ease the aging process .
For instance , the intelligent system is invented to help the elderly to remember their daily tasks .
This is because as people get older , they will forget things more frequently .
Therefore , they need a system to remind them to perform certain activities .
iShoe , is another product that is developed using science and technology to prevent elderly from falling .
It helps to monitor human movements and provides a warning if balancing problem is found .
As a result , elderly can improve their balance by approaching the balancing specialist earlier .
Lastly , a big button TV remote controller is created to help seniors that are unable to see certain image clearly .
With the help from the controller , they are able to operate the television , VCD and DVD player independently .
In conclusion , elderly are able to lead a better life with the help form all these products .

It is also an added significant to create a barrier-free environment for the increasing ageing population in Singapore .
With steps and stairs at pathway , elderly who are walking with clutches have difficulties climbing up and down; therefore , it is even impossible for wheelchair bounded elderly to move out from their house .
To ease aging convenience , obstruction-free walkways are built to connect individual district within the neighborhood .
Accessibility to all facilities in neighborhoods is well taken care with distribution of ramps throughout the vicinity for elderly and wheelchair disabled to move around comfortably as the gradient of ramp is design in such a way that even without the help of second party elderly will also be able to move up and down freely  .
At community level , drop off porches are built to seamlessly connect driveways to other surrounding buildings effortlessly , which benefits elderly in wheelchairs to move about remotely .
At block level , as mention earlier , lifts are improvised to stop at every storey if feasible and additional features such as widening the lift door for wheelchairs and lowering handrail bars for elderly to grip for support are included for elders' beneficial .
These architecture advancements are frameworks of the 5-years Barrier-Free Accessibility  Upgrading Program which BCA invested $40 million Accessibility Fund into this program in year 2007 .
It aimed to transform Singapore into an elderly friendly and barrier-free environment for the olds to live in safety now and in the near future .
With our current developments , obstructions to elderly accessibility are thus reduced tremendously .
"Old age isn't so bad when you consider the alternative" , said Maurice Chevalier .
Indeed , even though ageing population is critical in Singapore , we are actively implementing various architecture developments and policies in provision to meet the special needs of the aged .
To raise awareness of the importance in "shaping a safe , sustainable and friendly environment" for people of all ages , a BCA Universal Design Award was introduced in year 2007 to promote barrier-free accessibility in our environments .
With these improvements , we are one step closer in building a totally barrier-free healthy environment where the elderly can travel around freely and safely in absolute comforts .
According to U .S . Census Bureau report , the average rate of people turning age 65 in 2000 was 795 ,000 each month1 .
In 2008 , the figure increased to an average of 870 ,000 monthly2 .
This rate has increased by 9% in just a short period of 8 years and is expected to rise at a higher rate as the first group of baby boomers who were born between 1946 to 19663 move into the category of elderly in two years' time .
As humans age , their five senses deteriorates gradually .
Among the five senses , the most common deteriorations of senses are vision problems and hearing loss .
Hence , recent technological inventions such as assistive technologies for sight or hearing can in fact ease the elderly in the aging process , making their aging symptoms more manageable .

There are also times when technologies cause more troubles for the elderly .
As we move into the technological age , where computers and other devices flourish in every home and office , the elderly would have problems trying to use such devices .
For example , in the National Library , books to be borrowed were to be scanned at the checkout counter .
However , self-service kiosks are set up at every floor to facilitate borrowing of books and to the elderly who were born during times without such devices , it would be very difficult for them to learn how to use the devices without help from others .
In addition , working elderlies are also more susceptible to being dismissed , if they are still working , due to the reason that with the invention of many different types of machines that can do menial jobs like cleaning automatically , they are no longer required in the workforce .
One such example is the Eurolab Auto Vacuum Intelligent Cleaner which has wall sensors and can be remote-controlled from a distance13 .
Employers may be tempted to replace the elderly floor cleaner who may have become slower in cleaning due to a weakened aging body .
How would the employer not be tempted to dismiss the elderly floor cleaner when the price of owning the machine for one year is much cheaper than the annual wages of the elderly cleaner ?
Therefore , with the advancing technologies , it does not mean that every product that was invented would help the elderly to ease into the aging process .
In all , with the help of advancing technologies , the elderly can counter their shortfalls in sight and hearing loss and thus still live independently without much intervention from family members or others , especially when there is nobody at home .
This would thus make the elderly feel less depressed and frustrated due to the effects of aging like being unable to see or hear clearly .

Nearer to home , Information Technology has revolutionized how the aged communicate with other people .
With computer and the Internet readily available anywhere , the elderly can communicate with their families at anytime and anywhere at the comforts of their homes .
The aged who have their family members worked overseas can communicate to them visually using web camera .
There is also the Internet chatting system like Windows Live Messenger that allows them to communicate with their families and friends at anytime .
There is also "video chats" , "forums" and "weblogs" to allow them to talk to make friends with other aging people and also able to express and voice their opinions anywhere anytime .
The Internet also allows the aged to surf the Internet , obtain and learn the information available at their preferred pace .
Thus , with Information Technology the aged no longer be lonely even when they are homebound .
In conclusion , recent developments in Information Technology have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent through interactive computer programs and the Internet .

Certain objections must , of course , be considered .
One may argue that older people are forgetful and are not able to learn new things .
Also , with the advances of technology , it is impossible for the older people to learn the complex nature of new technology such as using the text messaging function of a mobile phone .
However , this argument is flawed .
Aging does not affect our ability to learn .
Although it might take an older person a longer time to learn , the cognitive function does not decline with age .
While an older person might have "experience some difficulty with short-term  memory" as cited by James Pirkly , Trangenerational Design Matters  , "long-term memory generally remains sound ."
Also , although technology itself is complex in nature , there are technological inventions tailored for the older people and we will take a look at two of these technology .
Firstly , the current technology of mobile phone and personal device assistance  has in a lot of aspect contribute in addressing issues arising from health and decrease performance in terms of mobility .
These devices  have various functions and applications that assist the user to complete daily essential tasks that are made difficult due to aging .
The quick dial function allows the elderly to seek emergency or medical help promptly with just a press of a button .
This ensures that the elderly are attended to when they are alone at home and suffers a fall or have any other injuries that need attention .
The global positioning system  function that are found in certain devices allow loved ones to keep track of the elder's movement and if the elderly gets lost , the loved ones are just a call away .
Applications such as the Baycreast's Memory-Link Program that can be installed on a PDA have functions to set time-based alerts and snapped photos to aid the elderly in remembering important details .
These applications and functions amongst many are easily available on the market and are there to ultimately help the elderly age in the comfort of their own home .
Secondly , the technological invention of Med-eMonitor , a device that helps the old to differentiate the various prescription drugs and when exactly to take it .
Managing the different drugs that often look similar in appearance is a challenge for the elderly .
With their ever-worsening eyesight and memory loss , this device seeks to help ease that burden .
This device has different compartments to store different medication and each compartment has its own unique time reminder system with instructions .
When it is time for the elderly to take a particular medicine , a musical chime will be played .
When an elder opens that compartment , text instructions are displayed clearly on an LCD screen .
If the musical chime is not attended to , the device can place a phone call to family members or care givers .
Current research and development particularly in the field of technology has in a huge way helped the elderly cope with the demands of aging .
The 2 technology that are mentioned in this essay are amongst many that facilitate the old in handling age-related decline in health , performance and productivity .
As technology continues to advance , more tasks can be done and aging will soon be considered a transition rather than a problem .
Cutting down spending on the elderly will only increase the seriousness of the aging issues .
Over the years , journalists and scholars have been publishing articles regarding how public spending on the elderly are rising and will be increasing in the future and the consequences of it .
They think that this will become a financial burden for the young generation and working adults , whom will be contributing to the public spending .
It is normal that tax-payers are very concern on how policy makers make decision on how spend their hard-earn money , whether the policy maker are making full use of it or not .
Hence , more and more people are suggesting diverting the money to other areas of development , which they think is beneficial to them as compare to spending on the aged .
But , this is definitely not a good suggestion because I believe that government should always put their people as the first priority when making decision .
If they were to ignore the needs of the elderly and focus on the development , it will obviously bring more social problem to the society .
Furthermore , this aging population is very much dependent on the public spending to cover their daily needs , more importantly their medical expenses .
They are usually had low income level or below poverty level .
Daily expenses and medical needs might become a burden for them .
I believe this is one of the reason why most elderly refused to see a doctor and accept medical treatment when they are ill because they think that it is a waste of money .
Without the help from public spending , they might face financial problem in order to maintain their living and health condition .
Illness and various diseases are always seems to attack the aging people as this group of people are weaker compares to other age group .
It will be more worrying if they need special or long term medical treatment that might be too costly for them to handle .
From the all the reasons mention above , it is very clear that cutting down public spending for the old age is not a good choice in order to divert the money for the areas of development .
The group of elderly people is getting bigger which tells us that the current policy is not applicable anymore in the future as there will be more demand from the elderly .
In order to have more money for other areas of development , one of the ways is to reduce other sectors of public spending , education , for example .
So , the suggestion to cut down spending for the old age people is not a good solution to use the money for other areas development .
The Government raising more productive children so that the spread of burden over a larger scope of youngster .
For instance , The Singapore government encourages the university educated or professionally qualified mother to have at least 3 or more children by giving tax rebates of $20 ,000 or more .
On the other hand , the government has begun to provide subsidy of $100 for employed mother when their 3th preschool children placed in approved full day child care centers .
There are also unrecorded leave for mothers to take care of the sick children .
The "three , if you can afford it" policy above have increase the total population of Singapore citizen and let the population of the country become younger .
Different types of policies had been introduced to improve the welfare of the elderly so that they are able to benefit from it .
One of the policies that had been introduced is the housing policy such as lift upgrading , elderly fitness corner and studio apartments .
However , critics of this position argue that the government should not spend time and resources to ease the aging process .
Instead they should implement more policies on the younger generation to boost the economy growth so as to move towards a knowledge based economy and also to introduce more schemes to increase the birth rate so that the government is able to meet their goals .
Moreover , it is the children's responsibility to take care of the parents instead of the government .
If the elderly well- being is not well taken care of , the younger generation may not want to reconsider giving birth since the society is unprepared for the aging population in the future and this will cause more elderly living in this society .
If the society is well-prepared , the younger generation does not have to worry about their own welfare when they turned old .
Besides that , not all children have the ability to support their parents as they might be facing financial problems and hence unable to take good care of them .
In addition , some elderly do not have any children .
Therefore the elderly need the government helps to meet their physical needs .
In my opinion , public spending on the elders should be limited and the money can be diverted to other sectors of the progress of the country .
Indeed , the aged ones were once the main human resource that have done great contribution to the development of the country and , thus , deserve the welfare of getting public spending , as a token of gratitude .
Yet that token of gratitude should not be too much till it may drag down the development of the country .
Instead , reformed policies should be implemented to limit the public spending for the aged , and meanwhile , to make sure that their welfare is still taken care of .
To begin with , public spending on the aged population has become a burden to the tax payers .
It is known that the money proposed for the eldercare nowadays has comprised a large portion of the government spending .
For example , according to the Singapore budget report 2009 , the payout for the Senior Citizen Bonus is at least SD$73400000 .00 for that year .
This figure has not yet included the other programme that is proposed for the senior citizens .
As the source of money for the government is mainly the tax payers , this figure infers a burden to these contributing citizens .
Furthermore , in these few years , the amount of money that is allocated for the eldercare has been increasing .
If this trend does not change for the next few years , the average citizens would have to pay more , in order to enable the government to use the money for the aged ones .
In other words , the incomes that they earned would be constantly reduced , more or less .
This may grow the feeling of indignation in the tax-payers towards the ruling government - which is not an advantageous condition for the further growth of the country .
In fact , the public funding for the welfare of the aged ones is still needed in some way , but not so crucial until it should comprise such a huge section of the government spending .
As an alternative , some of the policies should be reformed to shift a part of the government duty to the family of the elders , and even the elders themselves .
For example , people should be compelled by law to take care of their own parents .
The family should carry out the responsibility to look after the elders .
Besides that , most of the elders do have their own savings or investment that they accumulate since they were young .
Anyway , in the case of the three "-less" - homeless , childless and jobless , indeed they should savour the benefit from the eldercare programme by the government .
Or else , they may have to end up suffering without assistance or even notice of the others .
Thus , in conclusion , the public funding for the aged population should be limited , for the good of the tax payers , the overall development of the country and the familial happiness of the elders .
Then , the money that is cut off from that sector can be diverted to the other areas of the country .
The problem of aging population has become worse and worse in many countries .
For instance , Singapore is said to be the third-fastest ageing nation with a doubled proportion of people aged above 65 in 2020 .
Aging often becomes terrible as the elderly are drained from high medical and healthcare fee .
Thus governments' pension , subsidy and medical insurance perform a main role to help such old people .
However , to solve the aging problem is not merely spending more money on the aged .
Certain fields' pension could be limited , such as the ones' who are financially independent after retirement .
On the other hand , there are other crucial areas where governments need to give strong financial supports , such as education and economy .
Furthermore , investment in these areas will help to solve the aging problem as well .
Pension , subsidy and medical insurance is the main way through which the government can directly help the aged , however , this does not imply that more financial support would definitely lead to better situation .
Now fiscal policy to help the aged does not satisfy everybody's needs .
Firstly , in terms of pension , the government's regulations always determine the amount of pension given to a person by how much he or she has contributed to the society .
Mostly , these productive people are able to accumulate enough wealth to fight for their aged problems .
At the same time , research reveals that these people can often be productive and healthy even after retirement .
In contrast , those who are less successful in their life will get comparably less pension to support them .
Their low-skilled and physical jobs limit their possibility to continue working after certain age .
These men have to cope with their miserable sunset years with limited pension , and this is where the pension system's imbalance lies .
Secondly , in terms of subsidy and medical insurance , the government often fails to differtiate the levels of need among different groups of people .
For example , people who have chronic disease should receive more subsidy and better medical insurance .
For those who work in high polluted industry , they should also be specially considered .
Therefore , the government's financial support should depend on people's financial state and healthy state .
What is more urgent and practical comparing to purely spending more money on the aged is to restructure the pension , subsidy and medical insurance systems to ensure the limited government's money can effectively help the aged .
Furthermore , the money we save could be diverted to develop education .
Education is the root of a country .
It is widely believed that the most important treasure of a country in 21st century is talents .
The main way to produce competent people is to develop education .
Many countries have made different new policies to boost education development .
One of China's well-known policies is popularizing compulsory education in urban and rural places .
The vision of this policy is to raise the civilization level of the country and give its citizens abilities to keep pace with the fast developing technologies .
Thus education deserves huge financial support from the government .
On the other hand , focusing on ethical educational topics either in school or social propaganda could teach children as well as adults to be willing to take the caregiving duties .
Hopefully , such broad education could evoke love in everyone's heart , and let all people take initiative to care about the old people in our society .
This would probably have a better effect on solving the aging problem than just focusing on financial areas .
Besides education , spending money on economy development is also very important .
A country can step on its way to prosperity if it has good economic policy .
A good example is the reform and opening-up of China .
It is a time when Chinese government paid huge sum of money to create good investing environment and financially support local entrepreneurs .
Without this , China could not possible to achieve what it has today .
In addition , it could be concluded that spending money on economy would make people wealthy , which could greatly help to ease the aging problem .
The reason is that if people could afford the healthcare fee themselves , they already overcome the radical part of the aging problem .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited; the reasons are given in terms of pension , subsidy and medical insurance .
Furthermore , the money saved should be diverted into important areas relative to the country's destiny , such as education and economy .
In return , developing these crucial areas would benefit the as well .
Recently , the aging population has caused lots of social and economic problems , which draws the attention of more and more governments .
However , what most governments do is just to increase public spending on aged people , which is not enough to tackle the issue and even decreases the country's development .
In fact , it will be more efficient to limit spending on the old and use more money on economic development .
First of all , it cannot be ignored that there will be more choices to care for those who are in need with sufficient economic growth .
For instance , Cambodia possessed a very slow development for a long time .
With a large population living in poverty , its government spent quite large amounts of money on the needy .
The situation is similar for the problem of aging population .
If more efforts and money are spent on the development of economy , there will be much more benefits gained from it in turn .
Therefore , we are provided with more choices to care for the elder people .
Secondly , it is not necessary for governments to spend too much money on the elder to resolve the problem of aging population .
Alternatively , by requiring people to provide in advance for their own old-age dependency , governments can also solve this problem without slowing down economic growth .
In some countries , like Singapore and Britain , people are encouraged or compelled by law to save and invest a certain portion of their income when they are active in the work force .
And this method proves to be very effective .
With enough money saved or invested during the years of work , elder people become less dependent on financial aids from governments .
Moreover , there will be more money diverted to other areas to promote the economic development .
Instead of increasing spending on the old , the problem can also be tackled by encouraging elder people to lead longer working lives .
That is an effective way to solve some economic and social problems caused by aging population .
A good example is that the UK's government managed to solve pension drain by using this method .
Furthermore , longer working lives can definitely help lessen the pressure of younger generations , which protects them from being overwhelmed by overloaded work .
What is the most important is that longer working lives give elder people opportunities to accumulate wealth for later lives , making them less vulnerable to the changes of outer aids .
This will truly benefit the elder people who are completely dependent on pensions from governments .
Some people may have doubts about the productivity of elder people and argue that it is elder people's right to lead later lives of ease .
However , that is not true .
On the one hand , life today is different from the past , in part because of demographic and economic changes .
The population aged 65 to 75 is healthier and better educated than those in this age group in past generations .
Most people retired from work today are still energetic and in quite good health .
So there is no doubt that elder people are able to lead longer working lives .
On the other hand , since elder people are mostly more experienced and patient , there truly exist some certain jobs more suitable for them .
In that case , elder people are even more productive than younger workers .
It is shown that we are able to efficiently solve the problems caused by aging population with limited spending .
Through the methods of requiring people to provide in advance and encouraging longer working lives , more money can be diverted to other areas to promote the economic development .
And with sufficient economic development , there will be more choices for governments to care for the old .
It is well-known that the world is facing a growing aging population and this trend is unlikely to be reserved in the short term .
In order to let the aged enjoy a relatively good life , the governments grant pension and other benefits for the old .
In 2006 , the Chinese Government granted over 500 billion RMB of pension to 460 billion pensioners nationwide , and the medical expenses of these people were more than 3 times that of the young population .
Without a doubt , this will leave a heavy burden on the growth of the economics with the rapidly growing aging population .
Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Firstly , it is not worth spending a lot of money on the aged at the cost of the whole society's development .
Money should be transferred to some more important areas .
In fact , if the economics of the whole society can ensure a steady growth , then it will be much easier for the country to undertake the pension .
Although the aging problem is worsening , it is not a wise choice to focus too much attention on the issue .
When the limited money is made the most of , the aged can benefit from the various prospering departments all over the country , even maintain a self-sufficient life without the financial aid from the government .
Secondly , governments can encourage every citizen to save for their old-age dependency .
If everyone starts to save when they begin to work , then most of them can be independent in finance after retirement .
Nowadays investment companies or insurance companies provide a variety of investment plans which can satisfy the needs for most people .
For example , in Singapore , people begin to save a certain percent of his salary into his bank account , in order to pay the housing loan , car loan or for advanced age .
Many developed countries such as Britain , Australian also carry out this policy .
If people are not willing to save in advance , then the government can compel people to save by law .
Spending a lot of money is not the most effective way to solve the aging problem .
We can also achieve the goal of easing the aging process by encouraging advance savings and providing suitable jobs for the old .
Since the money should be reduced by promoting these two policies , more money can be transferred to other more urgent areas .
In a nutshell , money spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .

Law Compelled Saving
In order to cultivate the sense of self reliant , the Government should make a compulsory law for the working adults to save into a special account with their monthly pay .
One of such example is the Central Provident Fund  scheme used in Singapore over 5 decades .
This policy helps to prepare the citizens for their retirement while they still have the ability to earn an income .
This would ensure that each citizen would have some amount of money to fall back on when they retire and would in turn lessen the needs for subsidise or help from the government .
Education should also pay a part in allowing the future citizens to know the importance of early retirement preparation and planning .
Increase Workforce
One of the major problems of an ageing population is the lack of workforce to drive the economy .
Since the human's life expectancy has generally increased over the decades , it is essential that elderly could work and earn more income for their retirement while it is possible .
Therefore the retirement age should be pushed back and elderly should be encouraged to upgrade their skills and continue working as they are a country's invaluable resources with many experience .
By tapping on the large number of elderly , the country's workforce will be increased and more people will be available to drive the country's economy to encourage growth .
With sufficient economic growth , there will be lesser needy people as well .
Healthcare Service
Vulnerable Group of Elderly
The human's life expectancy has increased over the years with the advanced technology and different living environment; more adults are better educated and well off than before , this have changed our perception towards what is healthy and what is ageing .
Despite all these improvement , it does not mean that every single one of the elderly in the country would be covered and well taken care of .
There will still be a group of vulnerable elderly like the older single elderly as mentioned by Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer  .
This means that lower educated people will be more likely to be needy of the public spending funds .
But all in all , the advantage of limiting of the public spending overall outweighs the disadvantage as the needy group of people would be minimised .
In conclusion , I agreed that public spending should be limited as citizens should not be over reliant on their Government and the focus to solve such problems should be to increase workforce and also make use of more money on lowering healthcare costs or in other areas of the country's development .
Nations in Asia are suffering from the problem of an aging population , with the increasing problem , the government has no choice but to spend a large sum of money to help and allow the process of aging in the society to be easy and convenient .
With policies , resources and money set aside for elders , elders are prepared to retire and enjoy retirement in a more fulfilling manner .
Reasons for the government to increase their spending on the elders include , the importance of an elder in a family setting is important and we should all respect them in all aspect .
Elders in countries have given most of their life in their homeland and as a result become a significant part of development of their nation .
In return , the government should take care of our elders as a means of gratification .
Lastly , the potential contributions of an elder would be valuable for the current generation .
Aging is the accumulation of changes in an organism or object over time .
Aging process happens naturally and does not result from disease or accident .
The effects of this process differ from each person but most likely they will suffer from declining organ function .
Vision and hearing loss , smell problems , and memory loss are some examples of illnesses that often attack the elderly .
These illnesses will affect their daily lives in some ways such as cause inconvenience in social life and inhibit their activities .
Nevertheless , current development in technology has produced a variety of devices that help simplify the aging process .
Research shows that "Of people aged 70 years , 8 .6% report problems with both hearing and seeing" .
This vision impairments and hearing loss can be a serious problem to the elderly as they may lead to misunderstanding in communication .
Elderly who suffer from vision and hearing loss will find difficulties in making a phone call , listening to voice mail , and using text messages with cell phone .
However , the development in technology has eventually overcome such problems .
In 2006 , an electronics brand , Samsung , launched its Jitterbug J , an excellent cell phone for the elderly .
This gadget provides the elderly a simple way in making phone calls and using text messages .
Jitterbug cell phone suits the elderly as it has loud and clear sound as well as large and brief on-screen text .
A satisfied customer , MakenzieB , purchased a Jitterbug for her 62-year-old mother .
Her mother absolutely loves it and could easily understand how to use it .
She can easily call her family and check voicemail by herself .
Technology development has also helped the elderly with smell problems .
A statistic from National Institutes of Health shows that "More than 2 million adults have disorders of smell" .
These problems are more common in elderly because the sense of smell changes as people age .
When sense of smell changes , elder people will lose the ability to detect smoke , leaking gas , or airborne pollutants and toxins .
Thus , they will need warning devices to detect smoke and carbon dioxide .
A device called The Shake-Up Alarm is a solution to this problem .
The Shake-Up Alarm contains of two parts: smoke detector and signaller .
When smoke is being detected , the smoke detector will transmit signals to two receivers which are a bed vibrator and a strobe light .
The bed vibrator can be placed under a pillow or mattress .
Thus , the vibrator will alert the owner even when he falls asleep .
The second receiver , which is a strobe light , will flashes 60 times per minute .
The other illness that usually attacks elderly is memory loss .
According to a mid-March story from HealthDay , "5 .4 million Americans over 70 have memory loss that affects their daily lives" .
One problem that occurs as an effect of memory loss is a difficulty to manage a strict schedule of numerous prescription drugs .
Many pills look similar and there are different instructions for taking each of them .
Thus , it will be a big problem for the elderly with memory loss to remember the instructions of each pill .
However , there is a device called Med-eMonitor which can help ease such burden .
Med-eMonitor is a pill organizer which functions as medication separator and system reminder .
This device also shows on-screen instructions which will help elderly take the drug with proper dosage and schedule .
Another device that can help elderly with memory loss is Mnemonic .
Mnemonic is a wrist-wrapped device that reminds the owner about important events or meetings .
It has a special feature which is built-in accelerometer which will keep the display on top no matter which direction it is rotated .
In conclusion , every people will face the aging process and as a result , various diseases such as vision and hearing loss , smell problems , and memory loss are likely to attack as they age .
After all , nowadays research and development in technology has eventually provided a variety of gadgets that suit the elderly and help them handle the aging process .
Thus , elderly will feel convenient to do their daily activities and live independently .
"Man is different from most other species of animals in that an abundance of resources tends to reduce rather than increase fertility ."
As the productivity of the world has increased greatly compared to decades ago , an ageing society has come to being .
Problems led by decrease in manpower come along; however , research was made and strategies were proposed meanwhile .
This essay is going to elaborate the effects that science discoveries , technological inventions and social policies have on easing the aging process .
Thirdly , social policies like CPF  have helped alleviate the financial support of the eldly .
CPF is a policy to make people save a portion of their salaries while they are economically active .
With CPF , the eldly have money for life after retirement without extra financial help from the government , thus the implementation of CPF alleviate the government's financial problem , and it is also favored by the rest of the society since they do not have to pay for the expenditures of the eldly after retirement .
Critics of science , technologies and social policies' alleviation on aging population argue that the eldly could live a satisfatory life in terms of material; however , it is hard for them to be happy since the society does not favor old people who do not fit its fast pace .
This is not necessarily true .
It is because there are communities which welcome the retirees who are healthy , independent and rich in time , and they are becoming more popular and "recruited" by the communities since traditionally , women have provided much of the voluntary work but now more of them have joined the work force .
Retirees in this way have much more chances to communicate and probably they would not feel lonely .
In conclusion , science discovries ease the aging process by educating the eldly what is healthy; technological inventions do this in ways to heal the sick , injured and even disabled; finally , social policies help the eldly in finance to secure their peaceful eldly life .

Heart disease makes up more than 30% of the death of American adults aged 65 and above caused by chronic disease , making it the disease which kills most elderly .
The most fatal symptom of heart disease is heart attack .
When heart attack occurs , blood supply to part of the heart is interrupted , causing some heart muscle cells to die .
This often causes severe heart failure because the heart muscle cells cannot regenerate themselves due to the absence of myoblasts , which are the cells forming muscle cells .
In the past , these dead cells caused by heart attack could not be replaced .
But today , thanks to a new heart attack treatment called "Heart Myoblast Cell Injection" , heart attack victims can get their healthy heart muscle cells back .
In this new treatment method , myoblast cells are extracted from the heart attack patient's own thigh muscles .
After that , the cells are cultured in the lab then injected to the heart of the patient .
Research showed that new tissue formation and improvement in the heart function of the patients were found after this treatment .
The lead researcher of this treatment at the Arizona Heart Institute , Nabil Dib , says , "Through this heart attack treatment we can regenerate a scar tissue caused by a heart attack , which is the opposite of what we learnt in medical school ."
Recent inventions offer medical solutions to the elderly suffering from chronic medical conditions such as arthritis , heart disease , and lung cancer .
These inventions help the elderly to live healthier life .
By living a healthier life , the elderly people can live their days more normally and hence help them to ease the aging process .

A survey done by Strait-times shows that old people spend nearly 90% of the rest of their life at home , 53% of them hire maids to assist their living and that they develop some diseases due to inappropriate home design .
An old woman in this survey said it is not very convenient for her to use the wheelchair at home and her eyes feel tired very often .
If old people have the layout of furniture in a more organized way they can live by themselves more comfortably .
Meanwhile the adjusted daylight can also benefit their health .
Thus , it is essential to redesign homes for old people to ease their aging process .
First of all , layout of the home is extremely important for old people to manage their living at home .
Firstly , by making sure that the house has single level living , no steps in main entries , no obstruction in the hall way and bedrooms open to the sitting room can reduce the accidents at home for the elderly .
This can be further illustrated by a research conducted by Hunter Centre for Health Advancement in Whales .
It finds that 71 home accidents are reported by 607 elder people in four weeks and 70% of the accidents are falls .
Secondly , more flexibility can be gained if the door is constrained to 36'' and the cabinets do not exceed 67'' high and counters provide a space for your knees when sitting in .
So people with wheelchairs do not need to have someone to assist living , and in such a way they would have a positive attitude toward aging .
And psychologist from university of taxes indicates that being positive delays aging .
Equally important , lighting is another concern about the elder's health , especially the eyes .
Firstly , light should be used carefully for eye health .
Such as room lighting with controlling senses is also necessary to increase the illumination for eye protection , and glare should be avoided by choosing the material of the wall , ceiling and mirror to fight against cataracts .
On the other hand , getting enough exposure to daylight can fight against osteoporosis and insomnia .
The best solution is to gain daylight through the ceiling .
With the daylight sustained , skin would produce vitamin D more easily , which is critical for strong bones and teeth .
And a study by Gloth  suggests that half of the elder people are under the vitamin D levels .
Furthermore , since old people stay at home for the most of the time , adequate sunlight would help them to form the cycle of day and night and thus prevent them from sleep disorders .
Although some people still insist that it is better to let someone take care of the old or provide asylums for them , and therefore there is no need to redesign their homes , they fail to consider the fees for the care and the feeling of the old .
Firstly , since most of the old do save their pension for the health care and do not want give their children too much burden .
Secondly , since old people have already developed a strong sentiment for their house , they do not want to move .
Furthermore , home care can also be done by providing welfare and consultation by government agencies at a lower cost to alleviate the solitude and physical burden of the dependent elderly , which is suggested by Claude  in "Home based care" .
As information and technology has been developing dramatically , the elderly nowadays are being helped with many modern facilities , helping them to ease the aging process .
The aging process usually comes with several phenomena such as bad vision , bad hearing , backache , hair loss , etc .
Many progresses have been made in science , especially medicine , to provide the elderly with convenient tools for their lives .
For example , dealing with bad vision , which is very popular among people above 60 , we now have special lens and eye drops , together with traditional magnifiers which are being improved more and more to help the elderly with their eyesight , or special hearing-aid can do a very good work in reinforcing the hearing ability .
In terms of medicine , we also have skin cream to prevent wrinkles , anti hair loss drugs , special medicine for osteoporosis , heart disease , etc .
to provide different ways to ease the aging process .
* "Older Americans Big On Internet , Elderly Not There , Yet" {seniorjournal .com/NEWS/SeniorStats/5-01-19SeniorsInternet .htm}
In addition , technology has also brought to the elderly many convenient tools to help them to be independent in their lives .
Nowadays many houses are equipped with intercom doorbell to help "respond to visitors without having to rush or feel panicky"  , thus preventing them from falling .
Electric appliances are accompanied with remote controls which are easily to use and remember so that the elderly can flick through television channels or turn on and off lights and fans themselves .
What's more , wheelchairs now do not need physical strength to move , but thanks to the controls with some different-color buttons , the elderly can use an electric wheelchair and skillfully direct them to wherever they want within the house and around the neighbourhood .
For children working at offices who cannot keep their eyes out of their old parents , they can install the webcam system around the house to watch over the parents while still doing their job .
Perhaps the most modern tool for the elderly that has been invented is robots , which have been brought from factories to home to do house chores .
They can do various things with multi-tasks and thus help the elderly a lot in the house .
For example , the robot named Domo is programmed to not only hold cans and tins but also identify other food with different shapes and quickly find an desired object to accompany the elderly whenever they need .
Or in Japan , where nearly a quarter of the population is at age 65 and above , robots are being used very effectively to help lift the elderly or support them in moving .
Some of them can also respond to oral commands such as "forward" , "back" , "right" , "left" , very convenient for the elderly because they often struggle to remember the buttons and the functions to run a machine .
Who say computers are just for teenagers and the youth ?
With significant advances in information and technology , today the elderly can also use the Internet to join some virtual communities especially designed for them to meet their peers and talk about many things with one another instead of staying alone all day in the house waiting for their children to come home after work .
Singapore recently has launched an Internet portal "I Not Old"  especially for the elderly , "to provide them with social platforms , games andinformation" .
In America , a survey has been conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation to find that one third of seniors above 60 and two-thirds of people between 50 and 64 get access to the Internet .
What do they looking for ?
They search healthcare , such as how to consult a doctor online without having to leave home , or drug information , etc . 
In conclusion , the elderly nowadays are being helped a lot with different advances in technology , become more and more independent to live on their own .
We now can feel safe to leave home on our business and leave them at home , knowing that they are supported and equipped all the things they need .
And with the rapid development in technology , we know that in the near future , many more things will be invented for our parents .

Firstly , for a graying population that occurs over the world , lots of policies have been applied to control the birth and death rate or to balance the age structure .
One of the most possibly effective ways is "two child" population policy in Shanghai , a big city in China .
The Shanghai Daily says about 22% of the population is over 60 years old .
Additional , for a long time , Chinese main population-controlling has been "one child" policy .
As a result , a bulge in graying population is developing .
Alternatively , "two child" policy can relax this problem and boost a higher birth rate , with a government campaign that encourages couples having a second child .
However , because of lacking of financial incentives , there is still no official announcement that allows this .
Secondly , to cope with the aging process , an increase in healthcare demand can be organized for 4 main headings: improve system performance , redesign service delivery , support informal caregivers , and shift demographic parameters .
Obviously , the older people use more healthcare than young people .
Nevertheless , health costs are independent of the age structure , which defines the distribution of predetermined expenditures .
Particularly , in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  , aging population does not have any connections to health expenditure as a part of GDP .
For example , the over-65-year-old Swedish made up 17 .3% in 2000 , but Sweden just spent 8 .6% GDP on health .
The former in Australia was 12 .7% , and the latter was 9 .3% , figured in 2001 and 2002 .
Thirdly , as a way mentioned in "A graying world" of Peter Peterson , later retirement not only solves the employment problem , but also lightens the financial burden on the younger .
In countries with limited labour force , taking advantage of experienced , stable employers is very important , which also contributes a part in family income and saving a huge amount of training cost .
Moreover , providing work to the older people help getting rid of being bored , alone , and maybe health depression .
Therefore , the younger people who are the breadwinners of the family are more relaxed and under less pressure , so their work will be more efficient but less stressful .
In conclusion , due to a development in various areas , world has to face a problem of aging population .
Awaring of this , lots of countries have applied a plenty of effective policies to adapt to a new changing world .
Although there are many developments and improvements for it , it seems that some governments still have not seriously concerned on it .
There is a robot project called Twendy-one under research at WASEDA University .
This project aims to develop a daily life support robot for the aged .
Currently , this 147cm tall human-symbiotic- robot can perform conversation with people; provide motion support and perform sophisticated tasks such as fetching seasonings from the refrigerator and picking up a piece of bread from the toaster and put it to a plate using a food tong without spoiling it .
With these functions , this robot may bring great convenience to the life of the elderly and ease the aging problem if it can be industrialized .
In fact , there are a number of researches like Twendy-one , which focuses on technological innovations helpful to the aged people , is being done currently .
Judging from the outcomes of these researches , the aging process has been eased to a large extent mainly in three fields: visual assistance , health monitoring and mobility support .
First , technological inventions provide solution to the vision problem that comes with aging , presbyopia .
The aged may choose to wear optical lenses for presbyopia , and current research has raised this lens technology to a new height .
For example Bifocal Contact Lens has been invented recently .
Each piece of this kind of lens is divided into two parts with different focus .
This enable the presbyopia patients , usually the aged , to see both far objects and near objects clearly without changing lens .
Moreover , this kind of contact lens rides on the eyeball but does not roll together with the eyeball .
This means , when the patient look down , he or she can use the lower part of the lens to read and use the upper part of the lens with a different focus to look at distant objects .
Besides , the aged may also choose to carry a portable digital magnifier which takes picture behind the device , magnifies it to desired clearness and show it on the screen such as PocketViewer .
With these technological inventions , the aged may be able to read and write like young people .
Hence , the pressure of aging process is reduced .
In conclusion , current research in technological inventions mainly have accomplishments in three areas: vision assistance , health condition monitoring and mobility support .
In each areas , inventions are solving practical problems that may happen on aged people .
By solving these problems , the life standard of the aged in enhanced while the stress of the aging process is reduced .
Therefore , current research in technological inventions have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
Technology now a days have been improving our daily life a lot .
It impact on our work , leisure and home .
Compare with the past , now a days , everything can be done easily with the aid of technology .
As the speed of the technology grow , people in the society aged as well .
Recently , aging population have been a concern by the government and society .
By 2050 , many people in the first world countries will reach 51 .
In order to ease the global aging process , people have begin using technology in hope to help the aging population .
Internet and automated gadgets are a few technology that have began using a few years ago to help the elderly .
Now a days , internet have been so common in the society that it is now been use to help the aging population .
People have started to create a link from the elderly to the their family members .
For example , in the United State some family members actually give their elderly a GPS device which can helps to keep track of their location at anywhere and any time .
As people gets old , the chances of them getting lost are much more higher and with the help of GPS device , their love ones can easier find out their current location when they get lost .
Another way of helping the aging population was automated gadgets .
With the automated gadgets , it can help to take care or monitor the elderly especially when they are alone .
An example would be the Med-eMonitor , invented by InforMedix , which seek as a medicine reminder for the elderly .
This gadget actually is just about the size of a VCR tape and operates on a rechargeable battery which can last for two weeks .
Inside this gadget , it have a lot of compartments that can help to separate the medication and also allowing user to set a date and time .
It also comes with a reminder system , on-screen instruction and a line of communication .
When the time has come for medication , the gadget will play a musical chime that will alert the elderly .
When the user press on the button a LCD screen will display the instruction for taking the drugs , for example , some drugs are to be taken before meal or with a empty stomach .
If the musical chime is not responded by the elderly and the medication is not taken , the gadget will place a phone call to the family members to inform them . 
Beside using internet and automated gadget individually , people have also combine them as one device .
In the United State there are device that can also help to connect the elderly to the doctor without having them to go to the hospital everyday .
For example , elderly with Cardiovascular disease can be attach a intelligent small device which is called a Chronicle system in their body to monitor their "heart rate , physical activity , body temperature and right ventricular  pressure in them ."
After that , those result gather by the device are transmitted to the doctors through a remote monitoring so that their health can be monitor even if they are at home or in the hospital .
Using internet and automated gadgets have help to ease the aging process a lot .
Both the elderly and their family members can receive many benefits from technology .
As time pass , our aging population grows and so do our technology .
But as technology grow , it can provide us with more invention that can help to ease the aging population process .

"We have an ageing population and the demand for elective surgery continues to increase , which provides us with a real challenge" .
That famous quote of Australian politician Michael Wright not only illustrates one of the problems the government has to deal with aging population but also points out the pressure the aging population put on the medical system .
It appears that aging population has become the biggest and common concern of the countries all over the world , especially those in Europe and Japan .
Many researchers have recently stated:" To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process" .
From my point of view , supported by many reliable online articles , I agree with the claim above .
On the other hand , the scientists keep giving out newly technological inventions to help the elder people feel more comfortable and content with their ordinary life .
They present wireless and mini deaf-aid to enhance the listening ability of elder people as well asartificial limbs for them or walking sticks to aid them standing and walking around .More specifically , designed elevators used for elder people in wheelchairs are everywhere , which plays an important role in helping them going to higher levels in tall buildings .
The older they get , the worse their body organs function , which leads to the situation that they really need some helps from inventors to retain their original life .
Without these gadgets and assisting tools , now they would suffer numerous and tremendous difficulties in communicating with other people or going around as well .
The next question needs to be debated is: "How much money should the government spend on the medical care for elder people ?" .
In my opinions , the government should use much more money on taking care of elder people because the following reason: Firstly , the aged are citizens who contributed a lot of money to National Treasury through compulsory taxes like land-tax , income tax . . . Because in this way or another , that was their money , they are deserved to receive more care from the authority .
Secondly , as long as you take care of the elder people well , the average longevity of the citizens will rise significantly .
As far as we concern , many economists evaluate the wealth and development of a country not only on the money it keeps , but also on how the average longevity of its citizens is .
In conclusions , it's unassailable that: To some extent , current research have helped ease the aging process .
This mission not only lies on the scientists' hands but also require some supports from the society in general , and the government in particular .
If the government reserve more money on the medical care for the elder people , absolutely they'll be more satisfied with their life .
That's the best solution in comparison with other inventions from the scientists .
Disability affects some people .
Aging affects all people .
As we know , people are living longer today than they used to , and this is resulting in a much larger elderly population than formerly .
Also , as we grow in to adulthood , many things start to change in our life .
Aging is an unavoidable process , beginning at conception and ending with death .
The process does not proceed at a uniform rate all over the body .
As we age , the organ systems of individuals age at different rates .
Our body gradually slows down in early adult life .
So , current research and development or policies in particular field of science and medicine have helped to ease the aging process .
Technology can help the elderly with their hearing problem and hearing impairment is one of the five most chronic conditions of aging .
According to research , it is estimated that one out of three people over age 64 has some hearing impairment; this increases to almost one out of two persons over age 84 .
But , nowadays , there are many assistive devices available for persons with hearing impairment .
That is what technology is !
For example , vibrating alarms allow older people with hearing impairment to wake from vibration than by auditory alarm .
Also , door knock alert allows older people with hearing impairment to see a blinking light rather than hearing an auditory "knock" sound .
As we know , the ability to have chronically ill patients need to check in with a health-care provider every day and answer questions about their current symptoms allows for immediate intervention .
So , numerous telehomecare devices have been developed to allow health-care providers the ability to manage follow-up care of the chronically ill .
This technology allows patients to sit in the comfort of their own homes while health-care providers conduct routine and comprehensive medical monitoring procedures in their offices .
One example of this type of technology is Aerotel's Medical Parameters Monitoring  devices , which allow data to be stored for immediate consultation and treatment , as well as for future reference .
Other than those technologies used in developing devices to aid old people's hearing and illness , home , as we know is a very "important" to the older people .
They need a comfortable home for their retire life .
So  , there is a new technology in our modern world now  , Well@home Telemanagement System from Patient care Technologies ,Inc .
This Well@home devices has an interactive function similar to a bank ATM .
This technology reminds patients to take their medication; instructs patients through text , illustrations , and the spoken word on what , when  , and how to make their medication; ask patients if they would like to learn more about their medication; provide administration , purpose , side effect , and storage information to the patient and etc . , .
This will helps the older people a lot so that they will not been "throw" into the old folks home because of their disability in home .
As the world goes on , Technology has been applied to public transportation in the development of Intelligent Transportation System  that enhance older mobility by providing better information before and during a journey .
Many of the age-related declines in function that contribute to driving cessation can impede mobility independence when using public transportation systems , The application of technology within an ITS can support deficits in vision  , hearing  , cognition , and sensorinotor function .
Technology on itself is not only the panacea to solve the aging global population .
So , there should be improve in every field of study and research to ease the aging population and to enhance the quality of life for a global population that will double in size by 2050 .

Since the birth of human beings , our ancestors have gone through the 4 stages of life , namely birth , old , ill and death .
It is a process that had started when we are first born .
It is inevitable that we will eventually become old and vulnerable to problems and diseases that associate with old age .
Therefore , there is a need to improve the life of the elderly in order to ease the aging process .
It is not unknown that scientist have been researching while government are constantly improving development and policies for elderly .
The current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Firstly , modern medical research are able treat and cure deadly diseases and we are incapable previously .
With the currently advance medical technology , we are able to remedy and prevent diseases more effective .
Previous generation have no knowledge of illness like diabetes , hypertension and high cholesterol which leads to more sever problems like heart attack and stroke .
With modern research , medicine are produced to assist in treating the problems .
The findings were used for prevention to these illness , thus elderly who are more prone to these diseases are able to take more precaution to their health .
We can cure and treat everything easily and conveniently but it is always costly .
In fact not many people can afford long term medical treatment especially for elderly who have either retired or have savings that are not enough to cover the expenses .
But on the other hand , policies are made to engage the potential financial problems .
For example , Medisave are made compulsory for Singaporean to contribute part of their income into saving for medical usage .
A minimum balance of $15 000 are required in Medicsave for preventing premature depletion which will needed for future medical needs , more precisely during old age .
Also benefits such as national medical subsidy scheme are introduced to subsidies the medical cost for the elderly .
Elder are given a subsidy of $360 annually for chronic diseases like diabetes , hypertension and high cholesterol .
These policies made medical treatment more affordable and less taxing to the elderly .
To summarize , with the current medical research , development and polices made by the scientists and government , it have definitely slowed and eased the aging process that everyone will experience .
Although our lifespan have significantly lengthened from 60 to 65 year to 75 to 85 years in developed countries .
However ageing will remains the same for today and will not change at least in our time .
Regardless of country , race , language or generation , staying young , healthy and active is the dream of every person in this world .
From the birth of mankind , we have been searching and trying all means and ways to ease or stop aging .
This process or searching and examine was never ending , ever after decades .
This was even much more obvious shown in this century , where the standard of living of the generation X's improved compare to the past .
They have begun to realize that their life expectancy is now much longer than that of previous generations .
Therefore , the demand for anti aging products and treatments to restore health and beauty has grown significantly .
Men and woman past the age of 40 feel more empowered than ever to take control of their bodies and redefine the aging process .
To ease or slow down aging process is to have the ability to lengthen the lifespan of our youthful healthy days .
As such , life extension is the main concept that most company is engaging to target aging issues .
These anti-aging promoters from various nutrition companies are promoting their own brand of nutrition , in the form of diets or supplements , to extend lifespan .
These products use different raw materials and food processing methods , which they claim it is safe and effective to be consumption , after rounds of testing .
However , mostly they work and agree on the same common theory , which is the importance of keeping a stable blood sugar levels , achieved in part by managing the glycemic indices of food choices .
An example of the 2 diets with different approaches and with some support from scientific research is the Palaeolithic diet and Caloric restriction .
An alternative to the use of nutrition products to ease aging process is the research and development of Cosmetic interventions such as skin treatments and plastic surgery .
They are widely used to mask the effects of aging , although they do not actually affect lifespan .
Some of these surgeries include skin resurfacing , eyelid surgery and Botox treatments , cosmetic dental procedures and many more .
In addition , Anti-aging creams such as "Olay" and "Loreal" is also getting more popular and commonly use in both woman and man .
These are mostly moisturiser based cosmeceutical skin care products marketed with the promise of making the consumer look younger by reducing visible wrinkles , expression lines , blemishes , pigmentation changes , discolouration and other environmentally  related conditions of the skin .
Despite great demand , many such products and treatments have not been proven to give lasting or major positive effects .
However , it is on the rise at many age levels and has been embraced by many age groups including teenagers .
Another issues connected with aging process is the terror of memory loss .
According to one of the research conducted by the Natural Marketing Institute   , memory loss and losing brain capacity is the biggest fear of the aging baby boomer population .
Their research had shown that 52 percent of females and 36 percent of the males in United States has memory loss and losing brain capacity as their biggest fear .
Hence , research on means to prevent memory loss and increase brain capacity is essential and important in helping to ease the aging setbacks .
Currently in the market , they is brain supplement such as "Prevagen" and "Essential Youth" ; product which claims to have remarkable formula , which can help old people look younger , feel better , think faster , remember more clearly , thus enjoy their life again is out in display in all corners of the shopping and healthcare centre .
These products were advertised with the support from TV artist and prove documentation testing from scientist .
When comes to matters related to healthcare , research is never ending .
Scientist has also carry other studies and proposed other strategies of life extension .
Some examples will be the studies of Cloning and body part replacement technology .
They suggest that therapeutic cloning and stem cell research could one day provide a way to generate cells , body parts , or even entire bodies  that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient .
Others suggest Cryonics  , which is the low-temperature preservation of humans and animals that can no longer be sustained by contemporary medicine until resuscitation may be possible in the future .
However , these 2 researches involve debatable points in ethics and religion which need to be resolve .
Ethical and theological opinions of cloning and cryonics tend to pivot on the issue of whether this method is regarded as interment or medicine .
Aging is a process which cannot be stop and it is going to be a much more critical emergency issue to the mankind in the next decades , while the ratio of working adult and to the old is further reduce to one-one .
It is a problem that every country is facing , and if it is not properly deal with , it will held back the country's development and be an economy hindrance .
As such , in conclusion , the researches in medicines and other field such as technology and social policy is one of the up most importance issues currently .
With education , detail and proper planning now will help to ease numerous problems that the country and family will face as the population agers .
I think that with the development of the technology , the aging process will become even slow .
The technology really help the old a lot at easing the aging process .
Hopefully , we will benefit more from the fast developing of the technology .
Technology has vastly improved since the past century and made life easier for the elderly around the world .
For the case of developments in terms of Architecture , it has been true thus far .
In our current society , one which faces a graying population , Architecture has played an active role in creating a safe and greatly accessible environment for the elderly .
With better knowledge in Architecture , homes and places outside home are made user-friendly for the elderly
Moving around in a speed and mobility which they had decades ago was not possible , but Architecture has changed our homes in a manner which assured that the elderly can at least move around without facing much difficulties .
Homes that are user-friendly to the elderly have features that allow the elderly to move around easily .
One such feature is having a home to be built with leveled ground .
Another of such feature will be homes with wider corridors .
Both of the mentioned features allow greater mobility for wheel-chair bound elderly or elderly who move around with the help of a walking stick .
Elderly has always been stereotyped as people who are prone to slipping and injuring themselves .
To ease such worries of the younger generation , developments in Architecture has its means to solve such problems .
In areas where the floors tend to be wet , such as the toilet , anti-slip tiles can be installed to induce greater friction even when the floors are wet .
Furthermore , grab bars can be mounted to the walls of the toilet to aid the elderly in sitting down or standing up .
In parts of homes where a staircase must inevitably be built , handrails or barristers can be built for support if the elderly wishes to climb the stairs .
As the number of elderly that live alone rise , the government saw the need to provide special housing for them .
In terms of Singapore , the government has decided to develop blocks of rental 1-room flats which have lifts that stop on every floor , an alert alarm to call for help in the event of emergency and support hand bars in the toilets and along common corridors to facilitate mobility of the elderly .
For the elderly who are able to better support themselves , they can choose to stay in rental flats or studio flats .
Besides homes , Architecture has made the community more user-friendly for the elderly .
New shopping centres such as Orchard Centre and Ion Orchard have elderly-friendly facilities such as rams or leveled ground at the entrance , toilets for the disabled which is also user-friendly for the elderly .
At City Link , there are machines installed to maneuver wheelchairs up and down the stairs .
Architecture has raised the standards of living up to a stage where even elderly that have low mobility are able to move around as they wish .
Certainly , developments in the field of Architecture have helped to ease aging process .
Victor Hugo , poet and novelist , once said that "Forty is the old age of youth; fifty the youth of old age" .
Old age is therefore not the end of our life but a start .
There are many physical and mental ailments that often arise from aging , such as brain degeneration , discriminations from the public , social isolation and no sense of direction in life .
To reduce the negative impact of aging process , it is therefore important to create a role model for the elderly , eliminate ageism in the society , and improve detection of depression and encouraging lifelong learning .

Fighting ageism is essential to ease the aging process of our society .
One way of fighting ageism is educating the people of the adverse effects of old aged stereotyping is important .
In a study done by Levy and her colleague , older individuals with more positive self-perception of aging lived 7 .5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging .
Another common problem of aging is depression among the elderly .
As a person ages , the signs of depression are much more varied than at younger ages .
This is turn makes it harder to detect .
Therefore a possible solution is to increase the number of doctoral-level trained geropsychologists  and make age-related information more available to researchers , practitioners and students to help improve in detection and treatment .
A Graduate Psychology Education  Program was setup in 2002 to provide grants to accredited doctoral , internship and postdoctoral programs .
In a survey done in 2008 , the GPE Program has doubled the number of students who are trained to provide mental and behavioral health services and lead to many who would otherwise have not received these services .

The world's population took a rapid growth in the 1950s and 60s .
This was the period of the post-war 'baby boom' as there was peace and stability .
Today , these 'baby boomers' form the majority of our population .
It is expected , by 2030 , about nineteen percent of the world's population will be over the age of sixty-five .
Indeed , this illustrates a concern for an ageing population .
However taking a look around us today , current research , development and various policies have evolved to an extent large enough to dismiss our concerns with a greying population .
These measures and policies developed have greatly aided the elders with their ageing process .
This is especially so in the area of social policies , namely government grants and healthcare benefits .
Other social policies established to help ease the ageing process include the Central Provident Fund .
This comes across as forced savings where members can withdraw their savings on reaching the age of fifty-five years , leaving a minimum sum in their retirement account .
From the age of sixty-two , members receive a monthly sum from their retirement account , ensuring they still have money left to fund their old age .
This social policy has helped many to self sustain their elderly years .
Also , this has achieved the reduction of elder dependency by encouraging later retirement and longer working lives .
Such is an example of raising the eligibility age for public pensions and government incentives .
At the same time , when people work longer , they will be able to accumulate more wealth which they could use to support themselves in their old age .
In the area of healthcare policies , there are a handful of available measures which have essentially helped eased the ageing process .
Firstly , one such example is the Medisave fund , whereby a portion from a member's central provident fund is channelled into their medisave account where the money can be used to pay for hospital bills and certain medical treatments which are expensive .
This measure curbs the elder's worry of escalating healthcare costs , which they find themselves more liable to in their older years .
Secondly , direct subsidies are given to government hospitals , polyclinics and some nursing homes for the elderly to ensure that basic healthcare services are made available for all Singaporean elders .
Ageing process is made easier as worry for health issues and expenses are greatly reduced .
As illustrated , there exist many current social policies which have become widely available .
These policies caters to the varying needs of the ageing population be it in financial terms or healthcare .
Today , the concerns involved with the ageing process have been curbed in a wide array and a majority of our concerns with a greying population are dismissed .
The elders are greatly aided with their ageing process through government grants , healthcare benefits and many other social policies made available to them and each can be easily utilised .
People today are able to ease aging process because of the current research and development .
One area of focus is on psychology .
In psychology studies , scientists analysed human mental functions and behaviours and came out with solutions to help elderly ease their process of aging . 
Through research , psychologists found out that elderly gets depress easily .
This is mainly due to ageism .
For instance , in the work society , some young adults develop prejudice and discrimination against the older people because they feel that elderly are less efficient and no longer productive .
Therefore , aging process can be eased by helping the elderly develop a positive attitude towards life .
Elderly tends to think that they are incompetent and useless as they no long contributes to the society .
Firstly , live long learning is emphasized to help them .
They can upgrade their skills by taking up enriching courses like computer classes .
At the end of the course , a certificate will be awarded to them if they have successfully attained the skill .
This can boost their confidence in securing their job .
On the other hand , critics feel that these solutions can only help the elderly to a certain extent .
It only eases aging temporarily .
However , it is not true .
Easing aging process is just about making them feel better .
As long as the elderly are engaged in their busy lives , they will actually feel not much different from the young ones .
For retired elderly , they may even feel better as there's no stress from work .
The saying goes: "You're only as old as you feel" .
Since the solutions from current research and development can help elderly to feel young and create a positive attitude towards life , hence aging is eased to a large extent .
Recently , a controversial topic has been put forward .
It is about whether public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
As far as I am concerned , we should not limit the public spending on the aged .
The reasons are as follows: Firstly , put first thing first .
Secondly , cutting down public spending may arouse the complaints of the public .
Thirdly , limiting the public spending on the aged will surely increase the load over the youth .
Aging population is a global phenomenon which affects economic growth , sustainability within families and public spending .
It is caused by declining fertility and rising life expectancy .
It declines economic growth as the size of the workforce reduces as more elderly leave the workforce and less people are recruited into the workforce affecting productivity .
Another impact is the sustainability of families , because there is far less children supporting far more elderly .
This results in severe financial stresses for the working population .
Public spending which is government expenditure is also stressed to provide pensions , building infrastructure , healthcare catered for the elderly .
I agree that public spending for the aged should be limited because it is impractical for public spending on the aged not to be limited , and that the limit should be set on healthcare without neglecting the healthcare and social needs of the elderly .
It is impractical for public spending on the aged not to be limited .
If it is not limited , then it will increase indefinitely .
Either other areas of public spending have to receive less funding or taxes have to be raised to allow for more funds to be spent on the aged .
These two solutions are both impractical .
Firstly , public funding on other sectors is also limited and cannot be reduced , as they are equally important .
Housing and healthcare are basic needs of people .
Military is a need for defense of the nation .
Public spending on technology cannot be reduced as it is a substitute for the decline in productivity with a shrinking workforce .
This is because , technology provides the automation and machines to increase productivity solving the problem of a shrinking workforce .
Secondly , the main income for public spending is from taxes , especially income taxes from the working population or services tax forming the largest proportion .
If taxes are raised substantially it would even worsen the severe financial stresses for the working population and adversely impact the consumer market .
Therefore , public spending on the aged definitely has to be limited , ensuring enough funding goes to other sectors such as education , military , technology , transport , housing , healthcare , sports , etc which are equally important and also not to increase taxes for the working population .
The government should limit on public spending on healthcare for the aged , and the limit should satisfy the healthcare needs of all the elderly .
Healthcare has become more of a want rather than a basic need .
The government has to distinguish between needs and wants .
Needs are consultation and medication upon falling ill .
Wants are usually specialist services that perform detailed checkups to determine the underlying cause of the illness , analysis of patients' symptoms to predict illnesses they might contract and certain pharmaceutical medicine which acts as supplements .
The wanted healthcare costs are significantly higher as specialist services and pharmaceuticals use high technology equipment and expertise .
Therefore , individuals should pay for what is wanted and only needs are being subsidized the government to reduce public spending on healthcare for the aged .
The government should also support healthcare costs for those elderly in families with financial problems as poverty would come into place if basic healthcare is not provided to everyone .
The elderly are extremely susceptible to certain illnesses due to age .
These illnesses or diseases could be non-communicable or chronic which include cardiovascular disease , dementia and Alzheimer's disease , cancer , arthritis , and diabetes .
Hence , self reliance such as retirement savings has to be in place first to allow the elderly to be able to pay for illnesses which they might contract later .
Otherwise , it would be a huge drain on government resources to pay for all their medical expenses .
In conclusion , the world should shift towards fostering an elder friendly society that values their contribution and allow them to part of the community .
It should also inculcate a strong sense of self reliance among the workforce to prepare them for their elderly life .
This would reduce their dependence on children or government to support them , and not hinder the growth of other areas of country development when these other areas receive fewer funds due to the increasing amount of funds being diverted into helping the growing aged population .
According to the definition from the Internet , "psychology is an {academic} and {applied} discipline involving the systematic , and often {scientific} , study of human/animal {mental functions} and {behavior} ."
.
As psychology develops , it has benefitted human a lot , helping people know more about themselves .
Furthermore , current psychological research and development have indeed helped to ease the aging process by dealing with elderly depression , promoting life-long learning and eliminating ageism .
In conclusion , elderly depression problems are becoming less severe with the help of psychological consultation and treatment , life-long learning has been promoted by psychological development to equip the elderly better for employment , and ageism is somewhat eliminated by correct psychological perspective .
Current psychological research and development have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
With the population of aged getting larger in the society , a big sum of money is involved in helping the aged .
If this huge amount of spending is reduced , but in turn , spend on the other areas for the country's development , the wealth of the country can reach a balance point .
To many people , it can be perceived as being cruel to the elderly by limiting the amount of money to be spent on them .
However , we need to be realistic and pragmatic .
A country's development is the key element to bring wealth to the country , so as to improve the living quality of the future generation .
With sufficient fund , the country can spend on manpower , education , investment , construction and other aspects to aid in its development .
A well-developed country can bring wealth and boost economy of the country .
With that , the citizens can get to improve their living qualities and conditions .
For that reason , spending on areas that serve the purpose of helping a country's growth is essential to the country .
If the government continues to splurge a lot in funding the aged , the country's capital would ultimately become unbalanced and would be insufficient to spend on the other areas , for instance , education .
Let us imagine a country that has slower development in education .
In the near future , children in the country would have lower chance to be educated .
With little knowledge and skills , the country would be poor and would not grow .
In a nutshell , a country's funding for both aged and young should be balanced out .
People need to be more practical and far-sighted to consider about the next generation in the country .
This can be done by building up fund for the country's development , but not overdoing in funding the aged .
The main focus should be on the country's development .
Therefore , public spending on the elderly should be restricted .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited because this is part of the country's development and social well being .
It is equally important as the other aspects of the country's development .
Some countries experience aging population , for example Japan , which is facing rapid change in aging population , having a 5 .1%1 increase over the last 30 years .
This figure is expected to increase as more elderly age reaching 65 years old .
Countries such as Singapore also face rapid aging population with decreasing fertility rate of 0 .31%1 over the past 7 years .
If this trend continues , Singapore will be second after Japan demographic age .
This aging population thus affects the country's economy because of the high retirement rate and the increased need in providing healthcare for the elderly .
Hence I disagree to a large extend that public spending should be limited because it is still part of the country's responsibility to take care of the aged population .
Secondly , as the country's aging population increases , health problem becomes one of the concerns for the elderly .
For most developed and developing countries , healthcare would become an issue .
As the cost of living increases , the cost on healthcare also increases concurrently .
For instance , healthcare is an issue in the United States such as coverage of healthcare expenses issues .
Any healthcare cost will become a burden to themselves as well as to their family members .
On other hand , countries such as Singapore have policies which help the elderly in covering their medical expenses .
ElderShield plan , an insurance scheme , covers medical treatment expenses for severe disabilities especially for the elderly .
This will not be possible if limitation of public spending on the aged had been imposed .
However , a significant amount of the country's funds should be spent on improving the country's economy , which in turn creates more job opportunities .
For instance , during the current economic downturn , public funding should be diverted to developing more facilities , which will in turn improve the economic .
One example is the recent government project on the integrated resort , which create job opportunities and attract people to spend when it is completed .
If the economy of the country is not growing , it may affect the businesses within the country , which in turn affects the employment rate .
Therefore , we should not limit the public spending on the aged as they are still part of the country's development and social well being .
It is still part of the country's social responsibility to take care of the aged population .
As a Chinese idiom goes , the aged population is actually a treasure to the country .
However a significant amount of funding should also be diverted to other developments to stimulate the economy and help the country and its people to survive the economic downturn .

In conclusion , I found many technologies that have helped to ease the aging process by a large extent .
Aging would become much less difficult and uncomfortable without these technologies .
One of the most challenging issues in the world now is on the ability to meet up with the increase in energy demand .
Current resources like the fossil fuel , which is used to generate electricity , will eventually be depleted in a few centuries' time  .
One of the solutions to this problem is the Generation IV nuclear reactors .
Among all the proposed reactors , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor  is the most suitable option in terms of its design  .
Although there are public opponents who do not wish for the nuclear reactors to be built due to potential threats , past incidences and cost , Generation IV VHTR aims to overcome these negative aspects with funding for the research and development work .
The public , being nuclear-adverse , is also the result of the past incidences at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl in Pennsylvania and Ukraine respectively .
The former was caused by operators not being able to respond to a sudden shutdown of the reactor .
Also , the cooling system of the reactor was not properly set up; hence , overheating caused the reactors' core to melt and severely damaged  .
The VHTR can reduce the occurrence of this incident by incorporating simple cooling system which does not need skilled operators  .
Thus , with careful , well trained operators and better cooling systems , the probability of incident happening will be reduced .
Although the cost of hydrogen replacing gasoline is huge , there will surely be more benefits to mankind due to its high efficiency .
According to Butler  , approximately 400 nuclear power plants , each requires about US$1 billion , need to be built in order to fully be dependent on hydrogen instead of gasoline .
In addition , research and testing works are required to look for materials which are able to resist the high temperature of the VHTR and the rapid impact of high energy neutrons in the reaction  .
Opponents may comment that the initial capital cost is very high , but the VHTR is able to produce 50% more energy than the typical reactor using the same quantity of fuel  .
This could help to meet up with the rising energy demand .
Although there might be future technologies which are better than the VHTR , it is not definite as yet .
Therefore rather than waiting for a new technology to fully emerge , we should continue to carry out research work on enhancing the feasible technology present now , which is the nuclear reactor .
Talking about the most serious accident ever in the nuclear power history , the 1986 Chernobyl Accident will come to everyone's mind  .
According to an authoritative report  , there are 56 deaths confirmed to be directly related to the Chernobyl Accident by 2004 .It is officially suggested that the Chernobyl Accident was the result of inadequately trained operators , a flawed design , as well as the lack of proper regard for safety  .
As researchers pay more and more attention to applied psychology in the recent decades , people are wondering whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented some major engineering accident like the Chernobyl Accident .
The psychology discussed in this essay is defined as  "the science of mind and behavior in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity " .
Evidence shows the use of psychology during the design process would largely reduce the chance of the Chernobyl Accident by raising the awareness of safety culture among the crew .
In this essay , two aspects where psychology could have been applied to prevent the accident will be talked about , they are: calling people's attention to the importance of safety and making people consider the safety of the complex high hazard system from a macro view .
Above all , applying psychology during design process could make people pay more attention to the importance of safety .
It is identified by International Atomic Energy Agency  in the post-accident report that deficient knowledge and awareness of safety through out the design , operating , and regulatory crew was one of the main causes that lead to the Chernobyl Accident  .
Here are some examples that reflects the deficient knowledge safety of the crews .
For the design team , a few fatal design errors of the nuclear system and their possible consequences had been known long before the Chernobyl Accident , but no action was taken to correct these errors in the design process .
For the operating team , insufficient training of the operating staff caused a serious problem about the man-machine interaction .
And for the regulatory team , they underestimated the potential danger in the nuclear test and therefore did not provide necessary supervision for the test .
All these had contributed to the painful consequence of the Chernobyl Accident , and could be prevented if psychology had been applied to make the crew more responsible and pay more attention to the nuclear safety .
On the other hand , not everyone agree with that applying psychology during engineering design process would have prevented the Chernobyl Accident .
There are mainly two rebuttals against applying psychology .
First due to the wrong social perception of psychology and the social sciences , many people think psychology is only under the field of human arts and social science , which is totally unrelated to engineering , therefore they think there is no way applying psychology during the designing process will help to prevent those engineering accidents like this Chernobyl Accident .
Nevertheless , these people do not realize that those who designs , constructs , maintains , and runs the systems are all humans  .
Therefore a large part of the safety of the engineering systems lies on human activities .
Applying psychology in engineering can help to make people more mature , responsible , and careful while dealing with complex high hazard systems like the nuclear reactors , which will definitely reduce the chance of accident .
In conclusion , there is adequate evidence shows that the use of psychology during the design process would have largely reduced the chance for the Chernobyl Accident , considering psychology could help to make people pay more attention to the importance of safety and consider the safety of the whole nuclear in the design process .
Nevertheless , solely applying psychology during design process would not have totally prevented the Chernobyl Accident , because there are other factors that lead to the accident , for example , cultural factor .
It is confirmed by UN  that the Cold War isolation is one of the direct cause of the Chernobyl Accident .
These factors cannot be helped by solely applying psychology during the design process .
Now the scarcity of energy has increasingly become a severe problem .
Compared with other kinds of power generation , nuclear energy is rather cost competitive and eco-friendly .
Thus , more and more countries have put the construction of nuclear plants on their agendas .
With the development of nuclear industry , the proliferation of the generation reactors will become a certainty .
Personally , among all the generation reactors , I believe the supercritical water reactor should be the most applicable for most countries , especially those developing countries without advanced technology and tremendous capital .
Thirdly , the Supercritical water reactor is more eco-friendly and safe .
Different from Light Water Reactors used around world today , the Super Critical Water Reactor can be more likely to slow down and catch 'fast neutrons' , which means it would burn less nuclear fuels in a more thorough way .
Therefore , less radioactive waste will be generated and need to be land-filled .
So the time for breakdown nuclear wastes will be decades instead of millenniums after SCWR will be applied .
Further , compared with VHTR , the primary and secondary coolant of SCWR is just the same supercritical water which can be relatively easy to get and recycled .
And because the super enthalpy of supercritical water , more energy will be transplanted but less unexpected by-products will be produced , which will certainly decrease the risk of contamination to the environment and enhance the integral efficiency of transplanting , which will effectually reduce the carbon emissions by burning less fossil fuels .
To conclude , although some technical issues of Super Critical Water reactor are still under researching , personally I reckon that the SCWR would be the most promising reactor against other generation ones , in terms of performance , cost , feasibility , and impacts to the environment .
With the development of science and technology , the SWCR will not only be able to efficiently produce clean energy but also significantly settle the severe global warming challenge today .
To further explore the potential of nuclear energy , the United States , Argentina , Brazil , Canada , France , Japan , South Korea , South Africa , Switzerland and the United Kingdom , have come together to form the Generation IV International Forum .
GIF's criteria of including a nuclear reactor design for consideration include: sustainable energy , competitive energy , safe and reliable systems and proliferation resistance .
Very-high-temperature reactor  is one of the six generation IV reactor concepts proposed by the GIF .
VHTR requires an operating temperature of 1000oC ,at high pressure where helium is the coolant being used .
Critiques have argued that the current nuclear plants in operation are susceptible to terrorist attacks and whether the plant is worth the high cost of funding .
Lastly , they are concerned with the safety level of the plant .
All these critiques are against the funding and development of nuclear power plants .
I however , strongly support further research and development funding of nuclear reactor plants .
This is because nuclear reactor plants have many advantages such as being able to produce both hydrogen fuel and a large amount of electricity from small amount of fuel , at the same time . 
Ever since the 9/11 incident , protection of nuclear plants has been a heightened national priority .Yet , some anti-terror experts commented that the current criteria does not require the plant to be protected by a threat equally posed by the 9/11 hijackers .
A report released by the Government Accountability Office even mentioned that it is critical of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  , finding that it has not increased standards enough to ensure plants are genuinely secure , but only as much as industry officials believed was necessary .
This has instilled a lot of fear in the citizens and they have no confidence in the security of the plants .
As such , they oppose the funding of nuclear plants .
On the contrary , the security problems of nuclear plants have already been tackled .
One solution would be the "Design Basis Threat"  which specifies the severity of the attacks that has to be prepared for .
NRC requires each nuclear plant to periodically conduct security exercises to test its ability to fight against the DBT .
Last but not least , the nuclear industry has spent more than $1 .25 billion in the upgrading of its security operations and the increasing of its armed guard force from 5 ,000 to more than 8 ,000 .
In conclusion , the security of the plant is now sufficient to repel off terrorists and therefore the funding of nuclear power plants should be supported .
After the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island nuclear accident , which took away many innocent lives due to the explosion as well as exposure to excessive radiation , people are now very concerned on the safety of the nuclear plant .
In Texas , the citizens have again succeeded in opposing against the development of two proposed nuclear reactors at the South Texas Project .
The opposition came about as the citizens are fearful that the environmental effects of radioactive compounds may lead to health problems when contamination or leakage was to occur .
However , there is evidence to support that the safety aspect of nuclear plants are up to mark .
According to the World Association of Nuclear Operators ,the performance indicators showed that the U .S . nuclear plants managed to sustain a high levels of achievement in safety performance , industrial safety , unplanned automatic reactor shutdowns and programs to protect workers from radioactive exposure .
Since the nuclear plants are now of higher safety standards and with agencies to regularly check on the status of the plants , the further funding of nuclear plants should be supported so that this safe and reliable source of energy can be made available to everyone .
In conclusion , I support the notion of the research and development of nuclear power plants .
Even though there may be problems and public opposition along the way , but by bearing in mind three main factors namely: the benefits of nuclear energy , the importance of a strong defence and most importantly , the importance of having a set of safety protocols , we are able to push the development of nuclear power to greater heights .
Opponents of nuclear reactors claim that building a new reactor can cost a country between $6 billion and $9 billion each  .
Although proponents of nuclear reactors agree with the fact that the reactors are expensive to construct , they argue that it is comparatively inexpensive to operate because nuclear fuel accounts for only 27% of the variable cost of a kilowatt-hour as compared to other alternatives like natural gas which accounts for 85% .
In fact , any new design of reactors today will be pre-approved for lower construction costs , which include the cost for decommissioning and waste management  .
Furthermore , developing countries that have insufficient funds to build nuclear reactors can seek assistance from Alternate Energy Holdings  that has offered to provide skills and funding in constructing nuclear reactors  .
Alternatively , the Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Mohamed ElBaradei , proposed that these countries could construct hundreds of small-scale plants for a single town; each one built using a fraction of the cost used for a large-scale plant and without using expensive power grid  .
Opponents also maintain that developing countries should adopt other renewable energies such as solar and wind energies rather than building nuclear reactors  .
Despite the fact that studies show the use of solar and wind energy are more economical than nuclear energy , it completely ignores the limitations of these energies in producing electricity for the decades ahead  .
Moreover , solar power is limited to daylight hours and that there is no continuous supply of wind .
The International Energy Agency  forecasts that , even with continued subsidy and research , and a landscape full of solar panels and windmills , these renewable energies can generate only about 6% of the world electricity by 2030  .
Thus , the key difference is that nuclear energy can supply electricity on a global scale .
The final argument advanced by opponents of nuclear reactors is that jobs created by nuclear power plants require highly skilled workers that developing countries , like China and India , are lacking .
As a result , opponents maintained that building nuclear reactors would not address the problem of unemployment  .
However , the research is inconclusive .
In fact , by 2010 , Asians residing in Asia will dominate 90% of all Ph .D . physical scientists and engineers in the world .
And among the Asian Ph .D . engineers and scientists , most will originate from China  .
In addition , to better meet the demand for skilled workers , nuclear industries in the developing countries could set up on-site training centres that recruit and train the locals to work in the nuclear industry  as each plant creates about 400 to 700 permanent jobs and 1400 to 2400 jobs during peak construction period  .
In summary , developing countries should develop the nuclear reactors for several reasons .
First , nuclear reactors operate using cheaper nuclear fuel that accounts for only 27% of the variable costs of a kilowatt-hour .
In addition , new design of reactor will only be approved if it presents a relatively lower construction costs .
Moreover , if developing countries have insufficient funds , they can approach AEHI for financial and labour support but an alternative way would be building smaller-scale plants without the need to use costly power grid and thus , incurring lower costs .
Nuclear power is also capable of supplying electricity for the whole world as compared to wind and solar energy .
Besides that , developing countries like China and India have sufficient high-skilled workers to contribute to the nuclear industry and the unemployment rate can also be reduced as approximately 2400 jobs are made available in each new plant .
Therefore , in my opinion , developing countries should first provide huge funding to build generation IV reactors in order to combat unemployment and poverty in the rural areas .
Group issue: Should there be R&D funding for the development of SuperCritical Water cooled Reactors ?
According to Butler , 2009; butler states in his article that researchers have been pondering on the decision to use the nuclear funding for the development of generation  reactors , which are projected to be better than the current generation  and  reactors , or retain the nuclear funding for existing generation  and  reactors .
Moreover , for the generation  reactors , there is a debate to channel the funds for the research of SuperCritical water reactors   , which is claimed by scientists that it would benefit mankind more in most aspects considered like cost and efficiency than the other five generation  reactors .
Although there are reasons that seem to support the funding of the SCWR , the development of the SCWR should not be funded as there are other factors like economic and social feasibility to consider before we can conclude that the funding for the development of SCWR should be approved .
Another reason proponents give is SCWR uses water which is cheap and easily obtainable as a coolant  .
In addition , supporters of SCWR also state that SCWR take up less space than current Generation  and  Reactors  .
I have to acquiesce to the two points raised by the followers of SCWR .
However , these two arguments brought up by the opposition did not consider that both water and space are vital to mankind .
Although , water is easily obtained and affordable , opponents failed to recognize that only 1% out of the 97% water available is usable  .
Thus , it is astute not to use water as a coolant because the world population is constantly rising , so there might be a possibility of water shortage .
This implies that funding should not be channeled for the development of SCWR .
Instead , funds could be directed to the development of Very High Temperature Reactor  which utilizes helium which is not important for human survival as helium is not found in human body  .
Second , although the land required to build the SCWR is less than the existing reactors , the area needed to build new SCWR would be better utilized as area for agriculture especially in the future .
In the year 2050 , it is projected that there could be 9 .2 billion people in the world  .
This signifies that there will be a high possibility of a food shortage which is a more pressing problem than energy shortage .
Therefore , there should not be funding for the development of SCWR as SCWR utilizes two key ingredients for human survival .
The last reason that advocates for funding of the development of SCWR provide is the building of SCWR that could generate excellent jobs for the society  .
According to Nuclear Energy Institute , it is stated that operation of a nuclear plant generates 400 to 700 permanent jobs and these jobs offer a salary that is 36 percent higher than average jobs .
Although the statement made by the opponents is valid and beneficial to society , they once again ignore the fact that after the completion of the construction of a nuclear plant , there would be job losses involved .
During the construction of a new nuclear plant around 1400 to as high as 2400 jobs is created .
However , after the completion , only 400 to 700 jobs will be available .
This indicates that a job loss of around 1500 is incurred .
Furthermore , the 400 to 700 jobs require personals that are highly skilled which developing countries are unlikely to supply .
Therefore , the validity of generating excellent jobs requires to be redefined .
In a few more years ahead , the world's population will be expanding exponentially from around 6 billion people to approximately 10 billion people worldwide .
We speculate that the demand for energy in future will be greatly increasing for future development .
In order to support and supply the growing population , ten nations , namely Argentina , Brazil , Canada , France , Japan , the Republic of Korea , the Republic of South Africa , Switzerland , the United Kingdom and the United States , had formed the Generation IV International Forum  .
There are six nuclear reactors that are in research stage , and one of them is the Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor  , which is the most ideal nuclear reactor in concept .
.
Nuclear power is the most prominent and reliable energy source today .
It is the energy of the future generation , and I support the use of nuclear power for alternative energy of the future .
First of all , nuclear energy is an environmentally friendly energy .
It is stable , reliable , and clean in which does not emit any carbon compounds and toxic pollutants to the environment .
Many people claim that the nuclear energy is unsafe to the environment and health .
It is true that the nuclear reactors generate radioactive waste , with high doses of these substances can kill and cause cancer to human .
Besides , these radioactive substances will pollute the earth and poison the living organisms on the earth .
However , nuclear power plants do not require any fossil fuel for combustion; therefore , there will be no emissions of carbon waste to the environment .
.
Using SCWR as an example , the generator is using water as the main coolant .
This definitely will not pollute the environment .
Secondly , most people are concerned about the safety of running a nuclear power plant .
The public resists to nuclear energy due to the aftermath of the incidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 .
It is a psychological effect on human , whereby the aftermath will result in opposition to nuclear energy by the public .
Nevertheless , we cannot deny the truth that scientists and engineers have actually thought about the safety precautions of nuclear energy system .
This is to make sure the risk of operating nuclear power plants can be minimized tremendously .
Nuclear power plants are to be designed , built and monitored carefully in order to prevent any accident to happen .
The Environmental Protection Agency  and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  work together to govern of radiation emissions periodically .
.
There is also a safe storage for the waste to be stored up , namely the Yucca Mountain , Nevada .
Therefore , nuclear energy is safe to be used as an alternate energy .
Thirdly , for most people's impression , nuclear energy is way too expensive for the unworthy efficiency .
The capital cost of nuclear power plants construction is extremely high and it is increasing as years go by .
There are people who claim that nuclear energy is a mature technology , where it is definitely will not become cheaper in future usage .
Besides that , the management of the radioactive waste is expensive .
For example , Sweden has spent about $14 billion to manage its radioactive waste .
.
But in realistic , this idea is very unlikely .
There are studies shows that the production costs of the nuclear power plants have already dropped and the efficiency is high in long run .
It is the efficiency that saves time and cost .
With good maintenance practices , time and cost will be save and unplanned shut downs can be reduced .
For example , SCWR is a high efficient nuclear generator that will save a lot of cost when the maintenance is well-practiced .
The Chernobyl Accident , the most notorious disaster of nuclear history , took place on 26th April 1986 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine , and released a considerable amount of radio-nuclides over a large neighboring area .
Subsequently , various groups of experts from the nuclear and chemical industry investigated into this case , and some of them came into a conclusion that the most essential way to prevent such catastrophe from happening again lied in the enhancement of psychological education to people; whereas the others opposed that the main problem was actually the design failures of the plant , and the prevention could hardly be simply regarded as a psychological issue .
Those experts , who were against of the psychological point of view , further claimed that even though the human factors were all amended through psychological approaches , possible accident still stands a chance of happening .
They concluded that the actual primary causes of the 1986 accident were nothing but the engineering factors , and permanent avoidance of such accidents could only be achieved through more advanced technology development .
According to the author of 'Psychology and design process'  , he regards the human minds' deficiencies as the basic reason of an accident .
He thought that disastrous consequences could be avoided or at least minimized with the help of psychological education , and if psychological aids were provided through out the whole engineering progress , during item processing , structure designing , team managing , and even decision making , the Chernobyl disaster could be essentially avoided .
In my point of view , I am supportive to the idea that human factors' impacts overwhelm any other factors in this accident .
Based on my reasoning of Chernobyl Accident , it is evident that the disaster was totally the result of a series of human factors instead of purely hardware fault .
In recognizing the three main problems as the operators' unawareness , designers' misses of considerations and politicians' arbitrariness , the aid of psychology should be highly appreciated as an efficient way to minimize the human errors , and thus to prevent such accident from happening again .
With the increasing demand of energy and the rapid depletion of currently available energy resources , nations are now trying to look for new , alternative ways of energy generation .
One of such alternative methods currently under consideration is the generation of nuclear energy .
Presently , thirteen countries have come together to set goals on nuclear energy generation research on six reactor designs; namely gas-cooled fast reactor , lead-cooled fast reactor , sodium-cooled reactor , molten salt reactor , supercritical-water-cooled reactor and very-high-temperature reactor .
Of these six reactors , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor  and the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor  are the more promising reactor designs .
The conceptual design of the VHTR will be the first to be defined and optimized by the year 2015  , while LFR is , judging from the existing schemes , more feasible because of its low costs and good security features .
In comparison with the VHTR , I feel LFR has more advantages and a better reactor design and thus deserves greater research .
Lastly , the LFR's operation methods seem safer and more secure than the VHTR .
A VHTR will be operating at estimated temperatures of 900 to 1000 degrees Celsius .
At such high temperatures , there is higher possibility of a dangerous melt-down of the reactor .
Furthermore , as its fuel cycle is not closed  , radioactive materials may be able to escape from the system and endanger the lives of workers near the reactor .
Also , the amount of nuclear waste that will be generated is greater than that generated by the LFR  .
For LFR , the chance of a melt-down of reactor will be far lower as the operating temperature is only around 550 degrees Celsius  .
Also , as its fuel cycle is closed , there is no need for offsite emergency response - the system will shut down without spreading radioactive materials .
Therefore , LFR seems a safer reactor as compared to VHTR .
Until today , the designs of the reactors have not been fully conceptualized yet .
Hence , there are still uncertainties in the features of the reactors; it is not certain that LFR will still have these advantages over VHTR after the completion of designs of the plants .
However , from the theoretical point of view , after looking at the advantages LFR has over VHTR in theory , I believe that LFR will be a better reactor than VHTR with its predicted flexibility in its scale of operation , low cost and better security .
Hence , more funds should be allocated towards the research of LFR .
Within the past half century , two major accidents at the Chernobyl and the Three Mile Island nuclear power plants had caused the public to have a negative view on the operation of nuclear reactors and also , the future of nuclear energy generation .
Presently , the most common energy source , which is the coal-fired power generation , has been causing detrimental effects on the environment by releasing tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases; and subsequently , causing rise to global warming .
Furthermore , with increasing concerns regarding the future of our environment , there is also an increasing need to search for alternative sources of energy which would not cause as much harm to the atmosphere .
As a result , leaders of environmental organisations , such as Patrick Moore who is a cofounder of Greenpeace , are beginning to realise that nuclear power generation is one of the most secure , economical and environmentally- friendly energy sources available  .
In 2001 , the Generation IV International Forum has introduced six different generation IV nuclear reactor concepts which have been designed in such a way that when accidents occur , the damage will be contained  .
Out of the six reactor concepts , the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor  looks to be the most promising one .
With the past accidents in mind and considering the advantages that nuclear power has to offer , if sufficient research efforts are to be channelled to the development of the LFR , we humans can certainly benefit from it in the long run .
Critics also claim that nuclear power plants and nuclear waste can be potential terrorist targets as a great extent of damage can be done when the plants are being attacked or exploited .
Therefore , a strict set of security procedures have to be put in place and the use of advanced technology should be incorporated into the security system .
Another factor to be considered is the sustainability of LFR .
Critics of nuclear energy claim that nuclear energy generation produces a large amount of radioactive waste products; and eventually , storage spaces will run out , making nuclear energy unsustainable .
However , a characteristic of LFRs is that they are fast breeder reactors that carry out nuclear reprocessing of nuclear waste .
With this reprocessing feature in LFRs , uranium and plutonium , which makes up 96% of the nuclear waste , can be extricated and reused in the reactor  .
As a result , the final amount of waste product would be reduced to a very large extent .
In addition , nuclear reprocessing also increases the efficiency of the usage of uranium and hence , makes nuclear power a sustainable source of energy .
Moreover , lead is abundant  , and uranium resources can last us for the next 250 years or so ; making LFR an excellent reactor in terms of sustainability .
In conclusion , LFR has much to offer to mankind especially in terms of safety , security , sustainability as well as environmental effects .
LFR is a nuclear energy reactor that is environmentally friendly with zero greenhouse gas emission .
Furthermore , the resources required in an LFR are in abundance , making it a sustainable source of energy .
Most importantly , humans can benefit from the LFR in the future if thorough research and more developments are to be made on it so as to make it safer and more secure from accidents or terrorist attacks .
The public has been concerned about the danger of radiation leaks from nuclear plants , especially after the Chernobyl incident in 1986 where the massive radiation exposure caused approximately 50 deaths directly  .
The incident raised security concerns about nuclear plants becoming a terrorist target , where an induced meltdown in terms of present-day operating scale will have catastrophic consequences .
The US administration though , recognizes the potential of nuclear energy and has committed US$40 million to support Research & Development  for Next Generation Nuclear Plants   .
The very-high-temperature-reactor  , with its operating experience and the extensive R&D conducted on it , has been selected over other reactor concepts such as the supercritical-water-cooled-reactor  as the reactor choice for the US next generation nuclear power plants  .
Federal funding should be channeled for the VHTR concept as it promises enhanced safety and inherent security designs , in addition to a highly efficient production process .
An estimated 4000 cases of thyroid cancer cases in children were attributed to the radiation leak from the Chernobyl incident , with the long term effect of the radiation exposure expected to continue over the years  .
The slow but fatal effects of radiation have made radiation leak from nuclear reactors a major safety concern among the public .
The VHTR addresses this concern by using helium gas as the choice of coolant for the reactor .
The inert nature of helium means it will not react with the radioactive materials of the VHTR and become radioactive , eliminating a source of radiation in the event of a coolant leak  .
Another safety feature of VHTR is the use of uranium fuel pellets multi-coated with graphite .
These reinforced pellets are extremely heat resistant and do not crack easily , so even in a case of a meltdown , the uranium pellets will be able to retain the radiation and fission products within its core with minimal release to the surroundings  .
Questions have been raised by opponents of nuclear power technology regarding the security of the fuel pellets , which are rich sources of uranium .
When extracted and processed , enriched uranium can become a key material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .
However , the multi-coated uranium fuel pellets used in the VHTR require a temperature of more than 1600oC before the fission products within its core can be removed and this arduous extraction condition deters potential weapon proliferation using its radioactive core  .
In addition , unlike traditional reactors , the VHTR is designed to minimize fissionable material in its spent fuel by running the fuel pellets through the reactors for consecutive cycles till its fissionable material is exhausted .
The spent fuel pellets will then be safe for disposal and not pose a security risk should there be any intention from terrorists to extract fissionable products from it  .
Detractors of nuclear power technology also have doubts on whether nuclear power plants can match the cost effectiveness of existing coal and gas power plants .
However , NGNPs are not only capable of generating electricity like coal and gas power plants; they can also simultaneously produce hydrogen  .
This co-generation of electricity and hydrogen is made possible by the high operating temperature of up to 1000oC for the VHTR which allows for the efficient production of hydrogen by thermo-chemical processes .
Hydrogen fuel cells have been identified as the energy source of the future , thus the capability to produce hydrogen gives NGNPs an edge over existing coal and gas plants .
By future proofing its technology , NGNPs can ensure their relevance to the power industry in the future .
Moreover , the high operating temperature of VHTR also results in higher fuel burn-up ratio of the fissionable materials in the uranium pellets  .
With its highly efficient fuel burn-up , NGNPs will have a lower carbon footprint than coal and gas technology and at the same time , lesser radioactive material remaining in the spent pellets reduces the amount of radioactive waste to be treated , improving the overall process economy .
R&D work done on nuclear power technology to date has shown promising prospects to justify the US$40 million financial support from the US administration .
However , additional funding for VHTR will only be available if both the US government and public can be convinced about the viability of NGNPs replacing coal and gas power plants as the main supplier of US electricity .
To achieve this , the VHTR has to stay on track through sustained R&D work in the coming years so that it can meet its expected delivery deadline on 2020  .
The world encounters an unprecedented challenge which requires urgent global action to prevent the risks of climate change  .
To do so , the global green house gas has to be reduced by half relative to 1990 by 2050 , which means to reduce to less than 10 Gigatonnes of emissions  .
Many countries rely on fossil fuels as their source of energy and fossil fuel is known to be the major contributor to the green house gases .
In the United States alone , greenhouse gas emissions are mainly contributed by the burning of fossil fuels for energy use .
Energy- related carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of petroleum , coal , and natural gas had contributed to eighty-two percent of total U .S . anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2006  .
By using the very high temperature reactor  , hydrogen can be used as the fuel of the future replacing the fossil fuels .
In addition , more electricity is being produced with the help of the VHTR .
Therefore , for a better environment to live in , countries should support further research and provide large funding for the development even though the public is concerned with the cost and security of the VHTR .
VHTR plants are able to produce hydrogen for fuel using high-temperature steam electrolysis , which breaks apart the bonds of water molecules; this process is 50 percent more energy-efficient as compared to the existing hydrogen production methods  .
Thus , hydrogen can replace fossil fuels as a source of fuel .
Till now , there is still no material that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures , and even if such materials are found , they might incur millions of dollars to the still- unknown cost of constructing a VHTR power plant  .
The public is then concerned about the huge funding needed for development of the VHTR and thus feel that developing countries should first handle poverty and unemployment .
However , the developing countries will account for around eight billion out of a world population of nine billion by 2050  .
They will be the greater part of global emissions and so they need to be involved in achieving global emission reductions .
In addition , poor people around the world also need abundant , affordable and modern energy .
1 .6 billion people in the developing countries do not have excess to electricity and they have to end their day earlier than those in richer countries due to lack of proper lighting  .
With VHTR , developing countries will be able to meet their energy demand and will thus lift millions of people out of poverty .
Therefore , similar to those rich countries , developing countries should also provide funding to the development of VHTR .
Building of VHTR means that countries will no longer need to depend on fossil fuels for source of energy and the emission of greenhouse gases will also be greatly reduced .
In addition , the controversial reprocessing of nuclear waste will be solved .
Generating sufficient hydrogen to totally substitute gasoline for the United States transport purposes would mean to build more than four hundred nuclear power plants , each producing a gigawatt  .
However , there are only 441 nuclear plants in the world today  .
It is evident that the countries should go ahead with the research and development of VHTR .
Developing countries should also invest in the development of VHTR as satisfying their energy demand is essential for their economic growth .
Nuclear power has been a source of energy since the 1960s .
Nevertheless , the public , referring to the entire world population , has always been concerned about the safety and security issues of these nuclear reactors .
Thus , researchers came out with generation four reactors concepts hoping to ease the public's worries .
I personally support the molten salt reactor concept for further research and development based on the following factors , safe operation of the plant , global security and the cost efficiency .
The safety issue of nuclear reactors is directly linked to the risk of radioactive emissions .
Radioactive emission can be from nuclear explosion or nuclear waste .
An explosion of the nuclear reactor not only affects the people in them but also millions of others kilometres away .
A good example will be the Chernobyl disaster .
Explosion of the nuclear reactor during operation is due to either high temperature or high pressure .
According to Ghetta , Gorse , Mazi re and Pontikis  , the molten salt reactor functions under very low vapour pressure but very high temperature .
Nevertheless , Forsberg  stated that the MSR has a strong negative temperature coefficient .
Thus when there is an increase in temperatures , the fuel-salt density will reduce and push fuel out of the reactor core into critically safe , passively cooled tanks .
This will prevent overheating which leads to explosion .
As for the waste of molten salt reactors , due to reprocessing , the nuclear wastes are minimal .
According to Forsberg  , the final nuclear waste from the molten salt reactor can be solidified to a stable form thus ensuring that it does not emit radioactivity .
He also added that MSRs operate at steady-state condition , with minimum excess nuclear reactivity .
This greatly reduces the radioactive emissions around the reactor .
In conclusion , I have to agree that the molten salt reactor is not perfect , however the benefits of the molten salt reactors outweighed the cons and supporters are optimistic in finding solutions to the problems , showing its potential .
This is proven from its low excess reactivity to decreasing maintenance costs .
Thus I support the molten salt reactor to undergo further research and development .
A point to argue would be regarding the wheel design .
The train company , InterCity Expss  , had received complaints regarding the original train wheels causing serious resonance and tremor whilst travelling at high velocity .
Engineers resolved this problem by inserting a rubber damping ring between the wheel and the tire .
However , this design had never been used on high-speed trains before and thus failed to adhere to safety standards .
It is evident that had the engineers waited for the approval of the new wheels before its implementation , this accident might not have happened .
A psychologist roped in to help the engineers may have been able to foresee this impending structural failure of the wheel and intervened before it was too late .

Another point lies with the company and the conductor .
Company policy stated that thorough examinations had to be done before taking necessary action .
This led to the conductor refusing to brake the train even after a passenger raised concern regarding a damaged coach .
Even after the conductor had verified the problem , he still outright refused to stop the train and insisted to adhere to company regulations .
It is shocking to realize that this unique policy that ICE complies to differs from the traditional 'stop and examine' one .
This accident could perhaps be averted if the conductor had used his personal judgment and halted the train when an unexpected problem was discovered .
It must have been pressure from the organizational management that made the conductor follow ICE orders and refuse to do what is right i .e .
stall the train .
On part , it can be said that the cause of the accident is ICE for forming this rule and the conductor's erroneous judgment .
After conducting a root cause analysis on the accident , a psychologist could perhaps aid the company by vetting the flawed regulations to grant train conductors the power to make an assessment to stop the train should he receive any complaints from passengers .
Yet another point is due to a simple fault found in the train's wheel .
This brought forth attention to the frequency of maintenance checks carried out by the train company .
ICE had claimed that they had conducted checks on the train on a regular basis using conventional flash lights .
This proved that checks were only on the external structure of the train and not on the internal hardware and sustainability of the wheels to support the train's weight .
It is evident that ICE was too complacent and did not use more advanced technology to maintain their trains .
The aid from a psychologist in this aspect is limited as it deals with technical equipment and the views of psychology design cannot be implemented in this field .
After various considerations , this writer concludes that only one factor cannot be blamed as the sole cause of the accident .
Instead , it should be various factors working together to create a chain reaction which led to the dire consequences .
From this train accident , factors begin from the preliminary wheel design that design engineers came up with , to the insufficient maintenance of trains and the operation mode ICE uses .
The aid from a psychologist is inadequate in avoiding the accident as the majority of the causes for this accident deals with technical related aspects that psychologists do not have experience in .
However , the psychologist can contribute to the intangible aspects of the company's routine like spotting the mistakes engineers sometimes overlook .
With the help of psychology design , the rates of accidents may reduce drastically .

Secondly , unlike traditional LWRs , refueling of the MSR can be done while the system is still in operation .
Fission products are removed and new fuel is added to portions of the fuel at a time , drastically reducing the cost of operation of the MSR .
The Obama campaign initially opposed to the idea of the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository .
The amount of money needed to build a nuclear repository isolated away from civilization , cost up to $25billion .
There are better methods of using this sum of money collected from taxes from its people to solve waste disposal problem .
The government should exploit the funds available to develop MSRs .
These reactors are capable of consuming existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity , and prevent nuclear waste from accumulating .
Accelerated development of MSRs will result in the US to successfully tackle nuclear waste problem and revolutionize an entire new level of carbon-free energy that can last longer than just centuries .
Furthermore , MSRs are up to 300 times more fuel-efficient compared to the LWRs .
It actually provides a bit more than what most scientists expect from fusion as an MSR can be built in small 1 .2MW electric units .
A 7 .4 MW thermal reactor was built in the 1960s and operated for years , proving the concept .
MSRs is also much more efficient than a helium-cooled Very High Temperature Reactor  operating at similar conditions , in terms of electricity conversion .
Apart from that , MSRs are capable of operating for several centuries with only uranium that is already present .
Thus , the claim of nuclear fuel mining using up fossil fuels and adding to the greenhouse effect is unjustified .
However , the high temperature and corrosive operating conditions of the MSR require materials that exceed the limitations of current nuclear reactors .
Materials used for these reactors require high dimensional stability and most importantly corrosion-resistant , due to the molten salt of MSRs being corrosive itself .
Some materials that fit the bill include nickel-base super alloys , silicon carbide , specific grades of graphite and refractory alloys , are expensive in nature .
Hence , the cost of operation will not be price-friendly as claimed .
Nevertheless , introduction of MSRs still deserve strong support as they prove to be the best solution for improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energies .
Prompt development of MSRs is especially required for rising countries such as China and India .
These countries are unable to satisfy their energy needs with solely just based on the available avenues for energy sources currently .
In conclusion , fourth generation nuclear energy is the best substitution for coal and natural gas .
Current emissions of carbon dioxide from automobiles and industries are furiously contributing to global warming .
We have already crossed the thresh hold of acceptable greenhouse gases emission levels .
Thus , preventing accelerated climate change beyond human control is of greatest priority .
Secondly , are the security issues or known as proliferation .
Nuclear power leads to potential security risk , plutonium have to be separated out during reprocessing cycle of nuclear .
Plutonium is a key ingredient of advance nuclear weapons .
Although U .S .A was decided to dump all the plutonium waste to the Yucca Mountain , they never mention the level of safety that can be achieved .
Consequently , public claims that nuclear power wastes create a high degree of proliferation risks and until today there is no solution on it .
Among the six technologies in the IV generation of nuclear power only SCWR and VTHR no required waste recycling .
In the super-critical water-cooled reactor  system the waste recycling was optional , which means that SCWR can operate without having to depend on the contentious reprocessing of plutonium waste  .
In conclusion , this technology was independent with the proliferation risks .
Last but not least is the performance of the super-critical water-cooled reactor  .
SCWR consider one of the most promising future nuclear reactors because of the high thermal efficiency .
The use of multi-pass flows system in the SCWR allows the production of process heat on demand and improves the thermal efficiency .
The thermal efficiency of SCWR is about 45% , which is much higher than the generation III light water reactor of 33% of thermal efficiency ) .
Moreover , the distributed fuel channels in the SCWR allow the system optimized fuel bundles into each channel .
Thus , an appropriate fuel cycle , flow , cladding temperature and power distributes independently can be achieved , this ensures the stability and predictable performance of the reactors .
Nuclear power is an energy produced from controlled nuclear chemical reactions .
Commercial plants in use today use nuclear fission reactions , which is a result of a large molecule breaking into its smaller fragments .
Nuclear fusion reactions are believed to be much safer than fission and appear potentially viable , though technically it is difficult to take place .
Fusion power has been under intense theoretical and experimental investigation for many years .
The atomic bombs dropped on the island of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during the Second World War and Chernobyl Nuclear plant that caused two explosions in 1986 have raised eyebrows about the devastating effects of nuclear energy .
The Chernobyl disaster , especially , exposed millions of people to radioactive chemicals and has been linked to many forms of cancer in Eastern Europe and Russia , as well as destroying animals and plants .
These two incidents have highlighted the power of nuclear energy , which has caused so much controversy as to whether it has become a liability or a source of energy to the world .
Electric utility reactors heat water to produce steam , which is then used to generate electric energy .
In 2007 , 14% of the world's electricity came from nuclear power , despite concerns about safety and radioactive waste management .
More than 150 of such plants were built .
In this way , nuclear power has become an independent source of energy to meet the rising demand of a country and an increasingly growing global population .
These reactors can also be used to split hydrogen from water thermochemically .
Many countries around the world that largely depend on oil and fossil fuels for their energy needs are betting on hydrogen as the fuel of the future , using fuel cells to convert the gas into electricity for cars and homes .
Research has been done by many countries to improve on generations of reactors , some of which are in operation now .
The latest theoretical nuclear reactor design has been drafted up by a consortium of ten nations that are planning the nuclear reactors of tomorrow .
The Generation IV reactors are expected to be available by 2030 .
These new plants would operate at high temperatures to improve their efficiency and they would include simplified safety features that rely on non sophisticated back up systems to eradicate any problems .
One such reactor that we could see in the near future is the Very-High-Temperature-Reactor  , which allows for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity , up to more than half of what could be produced previously .
The problem of high operating temperatures is eliminated by using coolants that use inert helium .
Another important point to consider is that nuclear energy is not a source of carbon dioxide emission , unlike the burning of fossil fuels .
With the "greenhouse" effect and the environmental issue of global warming , nuclear energy has come at the right time to slow down the melting of the ice caps and stop the rise of sea levels .
As much as there are many positive reasons to use nuclear power , many people still have their doubts about this source of energy , mainly due to the fact that they remembered the infamous Chernobyl incident and the atomic bombs of World War Two .
Any accidents could lead to widespread damage and nobody can afford another radioactive leakage which could signal the end of nuclear energy .
Despite a generally high security standard , accidents will , nonetheless , happen .
Technically , it is almost impossible to build a plant which is totally safe .
There is always a chance of the plant failing .
The consequences of an accident would be absolutely devastating for both humans and nature , as in the past .
In addition , the power plants , together with the nuclear waste , could be targets for terrorist attacks .
No atomic energy plant in the world could withstand an attack similar to the infamous 9/11 .
Such a terrorist act would have catastrophic effects for the entire world .
Researchers have not solved the problem of radioactive waste produced by plants .
This waste from nuclear energy is extremely dangerous and can be used for the production of nuclear weapons .
To sum up , this emergency response information system is a good system to protect public after incident happens .
However , it has to be improved and developed more in-depth to ensure its safeness and enhance its feasibility .
The countries that are developing this nuclear power  must make good use of the nuclear power as the energy source for people's daily use .
People will definitely not give up this nuclear power as it has a lot of potential as an energy source .
Therefore , design to enhance the safety of nuclear power plants becomes a long-term project of the world .
Consequently , the nuclear power source will be used by public extensively .
To summarize , nuclear power has various alerting security issues that could affect the well-being of our environment and health that could not be neglected despite of it numerous benefits .
In addition , there are better alternatives such as the renewable energy that will be able to support as in a long-run .
Hence , the funds pumped into development of nuclear power should be used in development of renewable resources that are more cost- effective .
In conclusion , although accidents are unexpected , it is possible to prevent and minimize accident from occurring in certain aspect by psychology approach on design processes .
This has also proved that it is feasible in accident prevention as the MOM has made an obligatory requirement that all work sites must employ a Work Site Safety and Health Officer before the commencement of a project  .
30 years after the Three Mile Island accident , and 23 years after the Chernobyl disaster , the horrors and fears of a nuclear reactor meltdown might have died down considerably .
But the general public is still cautious about accepting nuclear power as a viable energy source .
Although we should never forget the painful lessons of Chernobyl and Three Mile Island , we should also be open-minded about the possibilities that generation IV nuclear reactors brings .
Of the 6 generation IV reactors earmarked for further development , the gas cooled fast reactor design is both innovative and dedicated to becoming an efficient and sustainable nuclear energy option .
According to a recent US poll , a significant 44 .7% of the respondents think that nuclear is somewhat dangerous or very dangerous .
And they are not wrong in thinking that , given that the radioactive uranium used as fuel is inherently dangerous , being extremely lethal to human health and polluting to the environment .
To address the safety concerns of the public , this design envisioned many safeguard systems .
A NEA report stated that a 'three barrier principle' will be implemented , and there will be 'cladding at fuel levels; vessels and primary circuit' .
This means that the radioactive nuclear fuels will be well contained by three separate layers of shielding material , greatly reducing the chances of leakage .
Furthermore the report emphasized the employment of 2 separate and redundant heat removal systems .
One is a passive system that uses natural convection while the other is an active system that uses circulators to pass the gas through the reactor core .
The coolant will be helium , an inert gas that is much safer than the sodium liquid used in sodium-cooled fast reactors .
A major constraint of nuclear power is the tricky issue of waste disposal .
Nuclear wastes need to be stored in deep geological repositories for thousands of years .
Hence the treatment of nuclear waste will be a major public concern .
A key feature of the gas cooled fast reactor is that it is a fast neutron reactor that fully recycles actinides .
According to 'Nuclear power's new dawn' published on Nature , '96% of spent fuels consist of uranium and plutonium' in other words more fuels can be generated if the wastes are to be reprocessed .
In the gas cooled fast reactor , radioactive byproducts are recycled and the waste eventually produced will only be a fraction of that produced by reactors with once through uranium fuel cycles .
In addition , as the design is a fast neutron reactor , it produces excess neutrons which can be used to transmute the nuclear waste to isotopes of shorter half-lives , reducing the toxicity of the waste .
This design also addresses a security concern of nuclear waste reprocessing .
Currently , in the logistics of reprocessing , nuclear wastes are transported to reprocessing facilities which recovers the uranium and plutonium before sending them to another mixed oxide fuel  reactors to be burnt as fuels .
This involves frequent transportation of highly dangerous radioactive materials over long distances .
This exposes a security risk as an accident can cause spillage of radioactive materials or a hijack can send these materials into the hands of terrorists .
However a report by Hussein Khalil from the Argonne National Laboratories in USA envisioned 'an integrated , onsite spent fuel treatment and refabrication plant' .
This essentially obliterates the security risks involved in transporting radioactive wastes and allows security efforts to be focused on plant itself .
Lastly , this design is committed to becoming a sustainable form of nuclear power .
Contrary to popular beliefs that nuclear energy is renewable , uranium is actually a rare element that can be depleted .
In this aspect , the gas cooled fast reactor is attractive as it boasts higher efficiency in converting heat energy into electricity than conventional nuclear reactors .
This is achievable by running the reactor at 850 C , a temperature that is kept in check by the helium heat removal system .
The higher efficiency if this reactor design together with the recycling of wastes , meant that the same amount of fuel will produce electricity many times more than the conventional reactor .
In conclusion , many advantages of the gas cooled fast reactor looked extremely promising .
It addresses the public's concern about safety with a very comprehensive safeguard system .
Although nuclear waste remains as problematic , it is reduced to a minimum .
Above all , it shows the potential to be sustainable , an advantage that can allow it to be built on a large enough scale to shoulder a significant portion of the world's energy needs .
Therefore its research and development should supported and properly funded so that one day it can reach its full potential and alleviate some of the world's energy problems .
Global warming has become a concern to people due to its high emission of greenhouse gases from the energy usage .
To reduce the carbon dioxide emission , a new energy source , which can provide sufficient energy with least emission of greenhouse gases , should be considered since the energy needs is rising in every country .
Nowadays , the engineers and industrial people are very interested about nuclear energy which can provide up to 80% of the electricity in France  in cost-effective way with mass production .
However , there is always a great concern to the public with the safe operation of nuclear reactors and radioactive waste management .
According to a research , the accidents caused by nuclear plants are much less than those of other accidents like traffic , suicides and fire .
.
Another concern on nuclear energy source is how to dispose the nuclear wastes which are long-lived , radioactive and toxic .
As VHTR operates at very high temperature , there are fewer wastes to reprocess than those of other systems .
The reprocessing will cut off 96% of the nuclear waste produced which consists of plutonium and uranium and only about 1% of long- lived element is left as residue .
There are also additional steps of process to convert those long-lived wastes into element with shorter half- lives , i .e .
they may take just centuries to decay instead of more than 300 ,000 years  .
Hence , nuclear waste disposal will not be a great concern in future .
Nuclear terrorism has always been a threat to the world since the sudden attack in Hiroshima in 1945 .
The VHTR is designed carefully to discourage weapon proliferation and to increase assurance that they are very unattractive and the least desirable route for diversion or theft of weapons usable materials , and providing increased physical protection against terrorism .
Moreover , the plutonium , which is the main ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons , produced from the nuclear waste cannot be picked up safely with a pair of gloves like pure plutonium as it is spiked with radioactive and heat-producing elements to make it easier to handle .
Hence , it would be harder to steal or use the material by terrorists .
Since VHTR is still in the way of research , the earliest delivery will be in 2020  .
Further security features can be added before the delivery time .
With the qualified security system developed , the nuclear terrorism can be prevented .
In conclusion , in view of the increasing need for more energy globally , nuclear energy will become essential in the future once its negative aspects such as safety issues , waste management and potential exploitation of plutonium proliferation by terrorists can be controlled .
This , in fact , has become possible after the development of VHTR which incorporates the new features to minimize the risks of accidents and enable safer disposal of nuclear waste .
Therefore , research for VHTR technology should be funded for further development to reach its optimal .
In our modern technological society of today , people make substantial use of electricity for their daily needs .
In the United States alone , people have used close to 4 million million kwh of electricity .
However , as society grows , the demand for such energy grows as well .
The usage of fossil fuel as a fuel at power plants is projected to increase by 44 percent from 2006 to 2003 .
In this new dawn , nuclear power is a new technology set to replace fossil fuel .
With promises of lower cost , lesser waste and a safer alternative , it may seem that Nuclear power with introduction of generation IV reactors such as the super-critical-water- cooled reactors is the next generation of power plants .
But these promises are empty promises if one would look deeper into the issue of Nuclear Power .
Therefore , support of further research and development funding for Nuclear power should not be continued .
With regards to safety , it was reported that there is more cases of fatality for coal powered plants than their Nuclear counterparts .
In the last 40 years , 6400 died due to coal power plant related accidents while only 31 died in Nuclear powered ones .
Therefore , it is claimed that Nuclear is a much safer choice .
However , we cannot ignore that Murphy's Law will still hold .
There will be a point in time where there will be an error which could result in an accident in the Nuclear power plants one day .
This single incident will have castastrophical effects and the fatality will be a substantial amount .
In the Chernobyl disaster alone which happen on 28 April 1986 , 47 people died on the spot with 4000 more dying from cancer .
The effects of the incident are still felt greatly today with the radio activeness of the area still a recorded high despite three decades of clearing up .
Hence , we only need one nuclear accident to cause damage of what a coal plant might have caused in more than 50 years .
On top of what have been pointed out , Nuclear Power will also invoke security issues in the region .
While used as a form of deterrence , it is also seen as a threat by neighbouring countries .
This will led to an arms race which might inevitably cause some conflicts in the region .
An example is the Nuclear programs of Iran .
Iran developed its nuclear programs as form of deterrence and to build up national pride .
However , many neighbouring countries saw it as an excuse for the building of Nuclear weapons as they felt threatened .
Hence , many conflicts resulted .
From this , we can see that Nuclear Power not only brings issues to the country itself who are developing it but other neighbouring countries in the region as well .
To conclude , with so many flaws in the claims of benefits from supporters of nuclear energy , it will be a wiser choice to delay if not stop further research and development funding for it .
The price for a small mistake in the pursue of nuclear energy is too much for mankind to pay .
Alternative sources of energy should be considered instead .
One reason that impedes the continuation of research of the molten salt reactor is the general caution on the issue of nuclear waste proliferation .
A key step in current nuclear power generation , which is seperation of the by-products in the nuclear reactor wastes , would yield materials usable in the creation of highly destructive weapons .
However , the design of molten salt reactors allow for on-site reprocessing of the reactor waste , followed by a direct feed of the recovered and reusable fuel back into the energy generating cycle  .
This will ensure that the majority of the fuel is burnt in the process , leaving very low level of enriched fuel remaining that can be extracted for use for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .
While the use of nuclear energy rises some concern in terms of security and cost , the continuous research of molten salt reactors can solve them through the recycling of fuel and the use of a different variant of fuel .
However , while the research cost of a reactor is very high , this can be solved through the cooperation of more contries , especially the larger start-up countries like China .
In the long run , one of the benefits of using molten salt reactors can also be observed from the fact that it can meet the energy demands while maintaining a clean environment .
In the recent two decades , adopting nuclear energy as a sustainable source of energy has become one of the heated arguments in the world .
The scientists stated that coal and fossil fuels on earth are depleting at an alarming rate and would be running out in the next century .
Nuclear energy has thus emerged as one of the most possible solutions .
However , due to the strong oppositions from the public about the safety factors , many countries are caught in a dilemma that whether they should build a nuclear plant or not .
It is indeed true that a country must not ignore the safety factors of building a nuclear plant .
However , in the current situation where there are no better alternatives , nuclear energy seems to be the most suitable energy for the future and therefore one of the generation IV reactors , lead-coaled fast reactor , should be adopted as the most suitable one .
Firstly , the argument brought by most opponents is the safety issue .
They declare that the nuclear reaction which may be termed as nuclear fission and nuclear fusion is extremely dangerous and even fatal to human beings .
The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was a reminder of the importance of the safety .
30 people were killed  during the accident and many more injured or adversely affected .
It was indeed a disastrous accident which subsequently made nuclear plant like a scientific devil .
However , the reactor used in fact lacked some basic engineering provisions for safety , probably due to technological constrains at that time .
With the advancement in science and technology nowadays , the level of danger of the nuclear reactors would be minimised to the lowest degree .
The generation IV reactor , lead-coaled fast reactor , is the safest one among the four being proposed .
It is operated under low pressure which means that the nuclear reactions are less vigorous .
In addition , the operating temperature allows a range from 550 to 800 degrees .
This medium range of temperature increases the function capacity of the reactor as compared to those which only operate at a fixed temperature .
On top of that , lead which is used as the main source is less reactive metal compared to sodium for sodium-coaled fast reactors .
Therefore , safety is ensured to the greatest possible level .
Moreover , another opposing view is that the cost for building a nuclear plant is rather high .
They insist that fuel is still a cheaper source of energy than nuclear power reactors .
The fact is , however , the other way round .
Gas-fired power plants are very cheap and quick to build , but relatively very expensive to operate due to the cost of their fuel .
In contrast , nuclear power reactors are expensive to build but relatively cheap to operate .
It might take millions of dollars to build the lead-coaled fast reactor , but once it is constructed , it will be operating at a reasonably high capacity over many years .
Furthermore , the cost for mining out and transporting the coal and fuel is also very expensive due to their scarcity whereas the sources for nuclear power plant are much cheaper since plenty of uranium can be extracted from the earth's crust .
The abundance of uranium on earth also means that it is a more powerful way of generating electricity .
Most importantly , the waste generated by this reactor can also be recycled and thus there is virtually no pollution to the environment .
Hence , in the long run , it is more economical to adopt lead-coaled fast reactor which is also an environmental source of energy .
The final argument advanced by opponents is that there are other alternative sources of safer energy such as solar energy and wind turbine , why do we need to adopt the nuclear power reactors which are still untested ?
Recent research indeed shows that the sun is a variable source of energy .
In addition , thermal energy can be stored in a system so that solar energy will still be available even at night .
However , can we really solely rely on it ?
What will happen during the rainy seasons and will there be enough solar energy to sustain our daily usage ?
The answer is most probably not .
We still have to rely on other sources when solar energy is running low at times .
On the other hand , unlike solar energy , the provision of nuclear power by lead-coaled fast reactors does not depend on weather or location .
As long as the nuclear sources are provided such as lead and uranium , energy will be generated .
Therefore , lead-coaled fast reactor is a more efficient and reliable energy source .
All in all , with the depleting source of coal and fuel , lead-coaled fast reactors will be the most likely alternative in the future .
With the technological advancement and engineering design , the safety of nuclear reactors will be ensured as much as possible .
It is also a relatively economical and yet efficient source of energy .
Therefore , such type of nuclear power reactors should be adopted in the future as a promising source of energy .
The world depends largely on external energy to function all activities in the society .
The world's main energy resource , which is the fossil fuels are slowly depleting .
As a result , there is a need to depend on other alternative energy resources to satisfy our high energy demands .
Nuclear power proves to be an effective energy source as it can generate electricity efficiently to satisfy the world's energy needs .
However , there are many controversies over the use of nuclear power , in which many critics criticize on the use of it .
Some of the topmost concerns that are widely mentioned are safety , costs and the performance .
Regarding to the safety concerns , opponents of nuclear power might argue that nuclear reactors are potentially dangerous as the effects from any nuclear accidents would be disastrous to both the environment and the people .
However , Generation IV reactor such as VHTR has advanced safety mechanism which will minimize the probability of accidents occurring .
VHTR is capable of dissipating decay heat even under severe accident conditions and its graphite structure is able to withstand high temperature to prevent itself from self-sustained combustion .
According to the "Four levels of safety" VHTR is the only reactor that meets the level 1 safety criterion , which means that it is immune to major structural failure and operator error .
Therefore , VHTR will be a safe nuclear reactor , liable with minimal accidents .
Regarding costs issue , Critics might debate that the high financial costs in building nuclear plants worldwide will create a negative impact on the economy .
Although the cost of building nuclear plants is high , future benefits from nuclear power will be able to boost the economy greatly .
For example , hydrogen produced in the nuclear reactor would be used to power the next generation hydrogen fuelled cars .
In comparison to other alternative hydrogen producing methods , VHTR produces hydrogen at a lower costs .
Statistics shown that "VHTR produces hydrogen at $1 .40/kg , steam reformation of hydrogen costs at $6 .30/MBtu while MHR produced hydrogen costs at $1 .52/kg ."
In addition , using VHTR to produce energy would reduce the economic costs spent in controlling carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels .
Regarding the performance issues , critics might strongly argue that the frequent unplanned nuclear shutdown  will make nuclear power the most inefficient energy among other energy sources .
However , no external energy source in this world is perfect .
For example , solar power cannot be generated at night and wind energy cannot be harnessed without wind .
Sun , wind , tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power or peak-load power when it is needed .
Therefore , nuclear power will still be a preference to other alternatives as it does not depend on the inconsistency of nature .
In addition , VHTR's gas turbine system can generate electricity at an efficiency of 50 % whereby existing nuclear power plant generates at only 33% . , making it one of the best performance nuclear reactor .
In conclusion , nuclear power is most preferred as an energy source in terms of its performance and efficiency .
In comparison to older generation reactor , Generation IV reactor will have better safety and costs effective features .
VHTR is one of the best generation IV reactors , making it one of the most reliable energy providers in the future .
So , further research and funding for the VHTR will definitely benefit the future generations .
It is the 21st century and the world energy consumption is on the rise .
With this prominent trend , there is a pressing need for the world to increase the amount of energy production .
Currently , the world energy consumption is supported largely by natural fuel .
According to Marshall & Robert  , the rising costs and rapid depletion of natural fuel lead to the search for a more sustainable energy source .
Thus , countries focused on the development of nuclear reactors , the most viable energy source that seemingly appears to be endless .
The most promising concept of the latest generation IV nuclear reactors would be the Very High Temperature Reactor  .
Another popular concept would be the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor  .
However , in terms safety concerns , costs and overall performance , the VHTR would be the best nuclear reactor to be implemented . 
According to Austrian Institute of Ecology  ,the performance for SFR was rated highly by for its closed fuel system which recycles 99 .9% of the actinides in its process .
There is close to no nuclear waste after the once through system .
However , the net plant efficiency of the SFR is only around 40% .
The energy output is much lesser than the VHTR models which will exceed 50% .
Furthermore , VHTR produces hydrogen in addition to electricity .
This additional fuel production would mean a larger net output by VHTR in comparison to SFR . .
In conclusion , the Very High Temperature Reactor would be the best nuclear reactor concepts to be implemented .
Whether it is about safety issues , costs factors or performance level , the VHTR is a notch above its peers , the SFR for example .
The VHTR's potential as the best nuclear reactor is recognized by many countries like France , Japan and United States of America .
It is given the most funding and research attention by these countries .
Future world energy consumption is well taken care of .
Globalization has caused the demand of oil to surge up to the extent by which the supply of crude oil could not match the demand for it , hence leading to a shortage for oil .
Thus , an alternative energy source is needed .
Nuclear energy is considered by some as the most promising energy source that could replace the depleting crude oil .
The Generation IV International Forum  , an organization formed to further develop on nuclear energy had come out with six generation IV reactor concepts .
.
Since there are a lot of benefits in using nuclear energy , especially the very high-temperature reactor  , thus further research and development on the nuclear energy sources should be encouraged .
Secondly , nuclear energy , especially the VHTR , produces less waste as compared to its corresponding energy source .
It is known that large percentage of the greenhouse gases present today is due to the use of petroleum and also due to the combustion of fossil fuels .
The burning of fossil fuels also produced other waste products that are harmful to the environment .
Even though VHTR produces nuclear waste which will emit harmful radioactivity , the industry has come up with effective ways to dispose the nuclear waste .
One such method is to bury the nuclear waste to the ground .
Research had shown that the radioactivity that is produced by the nuclear waste under the ground is equivalent to the radioactivity emitted by the cosmic rays .
Thus , human are safe from the radioactivity produced by the nuclear waste .
Ergo , nuclear power , especially for the VHTR , is a much cleaner source of energy to the environment , further research and development should be done on it .
In essence , nuclear power , especially the VHTR , is more cost effective in the long run as compared to other energy source .
In addition , it is less harmful to the environment and it also ensures human safety .
Moreover , it is shown that VHTR is 40% more effective in producing energy as compared to the other sources of fuels .
Thus , in my opinion , more funding should be provided for the research and development to further improve the nuclear power , the research should focus more on the VHTR .
The usage of nuclear plants to generate electricity has been a controversial issue decades ago , due to the disastrous incidents like the Three Miles island and Chernobyl , which has resulted in major health issue caused by radiation exposure .
The public opposition has been rejecting the construction of nuclear plants due to safety concern .
However , as technology evolved with time , the Generation IV power plants are better in terms of security , cost and performance .
Hence , more people are accepting the usage of nuclear energy .
In 2008 , a survey showed that the number of Americans that supports nuclear energy has increased from 10% in 2001 , to around 50% in 2008  .
Half the public is still opposing the usage of nuclear energy .
One of the main reasons stated by the opposition is nuclear plants consumed uranium and produced nuclear waste , which could be used to manufacture nuclear weapon .
Furthermore , the nuclear waste emits radiation that is harmful to humans and the environment .
However , these situations can be prevented with Generation IV molten salt reactors .
The molten salt reactors are capable of recycling the nuclear waste to produce more electrical energy , and the waste created from recycling process will not be able to use to create nuclear weapon .
This process also helps to avoid the existing practice of spending large amount of money on operation cost to store the nuclear waste .
In addition , the International Atomic Energy Agency  has set up necessary guidelines for the governments to ensure the highest level of security for the nuclear facilities .
The Generation IV plants are built to shutdown automatically in the events of a meltdown or terrorist attack  .
To prevent the radiation resulted in the Chernobyl incident , the new plants are built with shielding that can prevent radiation from escaping into the surroundings for fear of a meltdown .
Opponents have also argued that renewable energy is a better source of energy as it produced cleaner energy when compared to nuclear reactor , which produces radiation and nuclear waste .
In addition , renewable sources are also unlimited , whereas uranium will last another two century at most  .
Thus , they believed that governments should spend the money on research for renewable energy instead of nuclear energy .
On the other hand , with the technology of Generation IV reactors , the radiation and nuclear waste can be eliminated .
Furthermore , the electricity produced from renewable sources like solar energy is in Mega watt per hour , while the electricity produced from nuclear plant is in Giga watt per hour , one thousand times more energy is produced .
In comparison , the biggest solar power generator located in California is able to support half a million users , less than two percent of the city population ; while a single nuclear plant is able to provide electricity to a few cities .
The vast difference in energy produced supports the funding for research in nuclear energy .
Another issue is Uranium is finite like fossil fuels .
By allocating more funds into the research of nuclear energy , scientists can look for possible alternative elements to fuel the nuclear plants .
In conclusion , governments should support further research and development on nuclear energy as the security concern on nuclear waste can be eliminated; moreover nuclear plant is the most efficient energy source and the cost of nuclear energy is the cheapest in long term aspect .
With further funding on the research , humans will be able to produce energy source in the long run without damaging the environment .
The robotic surgical technology is a prototype and a new breakthrough in the field of engineering and medicine .
It enhances surgical procedures through improvements in dexterity and precision .
The robotic system uses fine , precise robotic arms and its three dimensional high resolution computed image guides the surgeon during operation .
This advanced dexterity and precision of operation will eliminate the need for large incisions on patients .
According to a report  , Asia medical forum) the rate of survival in every fifty patients of mean age 68 years old undergoing Robotic Radical Cystectomy is 98% .
Whereas according to  for the traditional Radical Cystectomy surgery , the survival rates were 62% for males and 39 .4% for females , with mean patient age of 62 .8 years old .
Thus it has been proven that the robotic surgical system has a prominent clinical result as compared to the conventional surgery .
Although the initial clinical outcomes are positive , safety is a major factor why the robotic surgical system still remains fearful to the public .
Safety can be due to technical credibility , surgical liability and operation performance .
Even though there is no absolute in the robotic surgical system to ensure safety of patient , the design of the robotic system can be improved to enhance safety .
Currently , the robotic surgical technology has not been widely accepted by the public mainly due to its uncertainty in safety .
During operation , condition of patient could remain unforeseeable; there were additional tasks and decisions needed to be made between the surgeon , the nurses and the robotic system .
For example , during tools changing , the robotic system needed to be paused in order to replace another surgical tool .
During this process , the surgeon has no direct access to the situation; it relies largely on verbal exchanges between the nurses and the surgeon to coordinate the surgical procedures .
The differences in prospective in terms of communication with respect to the patient condition and the robotic system create safety issues , mainly due to the potential of miscommunication .
In order to enhance safety , a common ground is needed to be built , through ensuring similar speech patterns .
Therefore , communication between surgeon and nurses will be improved by the sharing of a common set of statements and ideology .
Although the robotic system has improved greatly in its dexterity , it has yet been able to develop its full potential in terms of instrumental design and sensory sensitivity .
This imposes uncertain danger during operation .
According to  Health News , 2009) , no credible system is currently available to assess the capability of a surgeon while operating the robotic surgical system .
Dr Kevin Zorn recalled an incident where a patient died from complications after long hours of operation using the robotic surgical system .
In order to account for the safety , the future of the robotic system can be expanded using ultrasound and infrared .
More ideal mechanical surgical tools are to be developed .
In addition , the surgical equipment occupies large spaces which may restrict the movement of nurses and cause delay during operation .
By miniaturizing the equipment will help address the problem , and also save cost in making rooms for the accommodation of this expensive equipment .
During the past few years , there were discussions on whether nuclear power plants are supposed to be built or not .
For the past few centuries , most of our electricity was generated from coal , fuel or oil plants .
As the population increases , it leads to higher demand for electricity , thus more raw resources such as fossil fuel have to be used .
Recently , it has come to our attention that the depletion of fossil fuel is getting faster and it leads to higher electricity cost .
As a result , more people are turning to nuclear power plant as a solution to high electricity cost .
However , before we change to nuclear power plant solution , there are some factors we need to consider .
The factors which would be discussed are such as cost , security and performance .
Some of the reasons why people are opposing to the idea are due to the high construction cost and level of danger of nuclear power plant .
However , for the supporting views , it is because of the lower electricity cost and the ability to meet the world's demand in the future .
Despite the opposing views , the idea to have further research and development funding for the Very-High-Temperature-Reactor  is encouraged .
Thirdly , for the performance factor , according to Bulter  , it claimed that the VHTR could squeeze 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with conventional plants .
People have agreed that in order to reach such efficiency , higher temperature would be needed to be generated , thus , causing higher chance of accident .
Once again , this could be resolved by the "Meltdown" Proof mentioned earlier .
In conclusion , we could see that even though there are some disadvantages about the nuclear power plant , it is still beneficial to the public if we are going to operate it in the long run .
The advantages of the nuclear power plant are more than the disadvantages .
Secondly , next factor is the cost of building the nuclear reactors plant .
The nuclear-averse public opposed the development of generation IV reactors because they are too costly to build .
It is true that a country needs to fund billions of dollars in research and development of nuclear reactors plant .
However , it is beneficial for the country in the long run .
With the increasing number of people's population , the demand on the energy source will increase .
One alternate energy source which has been suggested by many of the scientist is nuclear energy .
This is because with the same amount of raw materials , nuclear reactors plant can produce up to ten times more of the energy than the fossil energy plant .
Lastly , the third factor is the effect of nuclear reactors to the environment .
The nuclear-averse public oppose the development of generation IV reactors because they are worried of its waste will pollute the environment .
The waste of the nuclear reactors will last for a few years on earth before it started to deplete .
It will pollute water and air .
However , if it is handled with a proper method , we can recycle it .
GIF is researching a proper method for recycling the waste from nuclear reactors .
When GIF have found out the proper method of recycling , the public can live with ease nearby the nuclear reactor plant .
To conclude , the nuclear-averse public oppose the development of generation IV reactors because they do not understand fully the concept of generation IV reactors .
Once GIF is able to produce the generation IV reactors , the nuclear-averse public should be able to understand and support their development .
Hence , very high temperature reactor needs to be developed for further research .
In the 21th century , energy issue becomes a serious problem that human beings are facing .
It is predicted by experts that the fossil fuels will run out in 250-300 years with oil disappearing in less than 100 years . .
It becomes really urgent to find a substitutable energy source to meet the increasing demand of human beings .
As a result , many scientists have turned to the nuclear energy and are doing research on future Generation IV reactors which are safer and have higher productivity .
Although some people are against these nuclear reactors , but one particular generation IV reactor called molten salt reactor is really worth to be researched on .
Some opponents argued that the safety of the nuclear reactor cannot be guaranteed , and such dangerous power plants should never be built .
They thought that the waste was radioactive and may cause health problem to the people around .
But the real situation is not as worse as they thought .
Besides , the molten salt reactor can solve these problems perfectly .
It is written in Generation VI Reactors  that the molten salt reactor uses liquid sodium fluoride as coolant which dissolves the uranium and circulates through graphite core .
In this way , fission products can be removed continuously and actinides as well as plutonium can be fully recycled .
It means that there is no radioactive waste in the whole process .
Therefore , their concern about radioactive waste is not necessary .
Some opponents argued that even though there is no radioactive waste of the plant , the reactor itself is a big safety problem; the reactors may explode like the three miles in the United States and cause disasters .
However , According to Power Uprate Safety & Containment Overpressure , the major safety problem for the reactor is that the balance of energy generating and energy removing may be broken due to some reason .
This will cause the temperature and the pressure of the coolant to increase .
As a result , the reactor may explode because of overpressure and will release large amounts of radioactivity .
But for the molten salt reactor , according to Dr . Paul Pickard  , there is lower pressure in it as the boiling point for molten salt is 1400  .
Besides the term which may cause accident is low due to the continuous removal of mobile fission product .
In addition , the molten salt can absorb lots of heat with little change in temperature .
All these guarantee that the balance cannot be broken easily .
As a result , the molten salt reactor is quite safe .
Furthermore , it is mentioned in Power Uprate Safety & Containment Overpressure that an entire system which is designed to match the energy produced by reactor and the energy removed can effectively prevent accident from happening is now used in each reactor in America .
In molten salt reactor , a better or at least the same system will be used to ensure the safety of the reactor .
The opponents always argue that the cost of the nuclear reactor is so high that it is not worth to be built .
It cannot be denied the cost of nuclear reactor is very high , but according to The Economics Of Nuclear Power , in 2008 in America , the electricity cost for nuclear energy per kwh was 8 .34 cents while the cost of coal energy was 8 .51cents .
Besides , the external cost including the pollution to environment of nuclear energy was 0 .4eruo cents/kwh while for coal energy it was 4 .0 euro cents .
The cost of nuclear energy is actually less than coal energy and it is much more environmentally friendly .
Moreover , according to Generation VI Reactors  the generation IV reactors will all reduce the cost of electricity and have higher productivity of electricity with lower use of fuels compared to the previous reactors .
These evidences all show us that the molten salt reactor will cost little .
Modern life depends on energy supply to a great extent .
All the inventions have improved our quality of life and made each human being a large consumer of electricity and fossil fuels .
With the development of technology and the increase of population , energy demand explodes .
Contrarily , the main energy supplier which is non renewable energy resource is disappearing from the earth .
To solve the problem , one way is to gather energy from nature .
However , it is inefficient to feed the whole human beings .
Nuclear reactions were found generating lots of energy rapidly .
Unfortunately , chemical species used in nuclear reactions have incredible destructive power and people are fear of the leakage .
In history , the leakage happened in Bhopal , India in 1984 was a "terrible tragedy"  during which "approximately 3 ,800 people died and several thousand other individuals experienced permanent or partial disabilities"  .
The fear of leakage has result in small number of nuclear plants being built on earth .
Nowadays , the generation IV reactors are in development and one of them called Very High Temperature Reactor  is worth being developed .
The VHTR has high safety , high working efficiency and ultra-long lifetime which make it the best of the six generation IV reactor .
VHTR has high working efficiency .
The VHTR operates at about 1000 Celsius degree which is enough to produce hydrogen .
Thus , VHTR produces electricity , hydrogen and large amount of process heat concurrently in its working process .
As an energy supplier , VHTR are able to work more efficiently than the others that produce only electricity .
Some may say that the temperature needed for VHTR to operate is high and it is not easy to provide the operating temperature for VHTR .
It is true that VHTR needs more energy to start operation but once it started , it produces energy more efficiently than others .
It is reasonable to say that in the long run , the gain in energy would be more than the excess of cost .
Thus , VHTR is promising in providing energy and solving energy shortage .
On the other hand , many countries , such as Pakistan , Japan , China , India as well as the United States are active in nuclear power regardless of the worry of public for safety issue .
The World Nuclear Association mentioned that on average in every 17 days , one new nuclear reactor was set up during the 1980 and this rate may increase to one nuclear reactor per every five days in 2015 .
In 2005 , 2 .1% of world energy was provided by nuclear power and 14% of electricity was produced by nuclear power in 2007 .
Although nuclear power plants' construction cost is much expensive compared to the cost of other alternative sources , for example , solar panels and wind turbines , nuclear power has efficiency output and sustainable energy .
The lower initial cost of alternatives sources make more economical but for the mass product nuclear power should be considered  .
Supporters claimed that third generation power plants would be cheaper as well as faster to construct than second generation power plants by previous experience of constructing nuclear power plants .
However , there are also proofs that some of the new generation reactors cannot fulfill their promise .
For example , Westinghouse claimed that its advanced AP1000 will cost $1000 per KW construction cost , finish within 3 year for construction and provide cheaper electricity than other Fossil Fuel based generating , including Australian Coal power , with no sequestration charges .
But the promise had not been fulfilled and the cost was over $3500 per KW which is even higher than the previous generator .

Backgrounder on the Three Mile Island accident  .
october 1 , 2009 , from w .nrc .gov/: w .nrc .gov/reading-rm/doc- collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle .html
Since nuclear power plants do not release any harmful materials , nuclear energy is ideal for cleaner environment .
Nuclear power plant emits significantly low carbon while fossil fuel pollution kills around ten thousand people per year due to respiratory problems in the United States .
But some opponents also claimed that an average nuclear power plant creates twenty to thirty tones of high level waste per year and that waste has to cool on site for at least five years before they are moved .
According to that Environmental working group , Yucca fills up 2495 tons of nuclear waste currently  .
Some people claimed that the chances of accidents in the nuclear reactors are very low because of advanced technology .But the accident at the Three Mile Island Unit2 nuclear power plant which is the most serious in the US as well as the explosion at the Chernobyl power station proved that nuclear reactor are still dangerous and not 100 percent secure .
Besides killing people on the spot , increased radiation was also detected around the area of explosion .
The death by cancer also increased because of these incidents .
Not just health and environmental facts , psychological factors should also be considered .
The worst situation is using nuclear as weapon  .
In conclusion , nuclear power should not be widely produced because of security as well as environmental issue .
Alternative energy sources such as wind , solar , hydrogen as well as hydroelectric should be used instead for more secure future for the next generation .

Storing nuclear waste .
October 1 , 2009 from w .ewg .org/node/16996
Recently , there has been an increasing debate about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Evidence also shows that very few new reactors have been built since serious accidents had taken place due to explosion or meltdown of nuclear reactors in the 1980s  .
To date , people are still suffering a lot of the repercussions from the past incidents .
However , with the expected increase in energy demand worldwide and the growing awareness about global warming , climate change issues and sustainable development , the new Generation IV  nuclear reactors seem to be the ultimate solution .
According to Gerstner , the Gen IV nuclear reactors will promise a safe , economically competitive , proliferation-resistant nuclear power without the danger of increasing greenhouse gas emissions .
Many developed countries are starting to express interests in this new nuclear technology and some even form a consortium to pool their expertise and funding to research on the six most promising prospects for the future Gen IV reactors .
Thus , I agree that there should be a research and development  funding for the Gen IV nuclear reactors .
Opponents of nuclear energy claim that before the first one of Gen IV reactors would be built , optimistically in 2030 and possibly 2040 to 2050 , solar power system will be highly mature and widely developed by that time .
However , a report  pointed out that most of the solar power plants can only generate 20% of its average efficiency .
What that means is that most photovoltaic  panels convert only about 20% of the captured {solar energy} to electricity .
Even the most advanced designs using silicon are only able to operate at around 40% efficiency .
Nuclear reactors can produce greenhouse-gas-free energy which currently contributes to 15% of the global electric power .
They are most efficient and require less resource to operate compared to fossil fuels and solar energy .
Thus , it is important to channel the funding to the R&D for Gen IV reactors as they provide the energy that will meet our future energy needs .
There is a profound need for a new generation of nuclear reactor as it not only brings a cleaner energy for our future generation but it is also a waste-free , terrorism-proof and affordable source of energy .
Although the nuclear industry faces a lot of challenges in the form of nuclear accidents , high capital costs of constructing new plants , and the need to establish final repositories for spent nuclear fuel , the nuclear energy industry has experienced economic and regulatory recovery in many parts of the world in recent years .
As countries such as China and the U .S . are showing interests in constructing new nuclear power plants , large amount of nuclear waste is expected in the next 20 to 30 years .
Hence , channeling funds to the R&D in Gen IV reactors is necessary as it helps to solve the waste problem .
With rapidly rising demand for energy , scientists and big energy companies are aggressively looking for an alternative source of energy to fossil fuel which is a depleting natural resource .
In addition , burning fossil fuel emits greenhouse gas , a main cause of global warming .
Therefore , scientists and engineers are placing high hopes on the new generation of nuclear reactors which are seen as a clean source of energy without emission of green-house gas .
However , some people argue that nuclear power is unstable , extremely dangerous and expensive based on past nuclear accidents and technical hurdles .
Fortunately , generation IV nuclear reactors are in the horizon , promising "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant" nuclear power plants  .
In this essay , I will compare two outstanding generation IV models: the very-high-temperature reactor  and the sodium-cooled fast reactor  , and argue that the VHTR is safer , more economical and proliferation-resistant than SFR .
Even though the VHTR excels at safety , economical factors would still be the most crucial deciding factor .
Proponents of SFR claim that the VHTR would incur a higher capital investment .
As a matter of fact , the overall cost of building , operating and maintaining of the VHTR is more cost-effective than the SFR .
According to "Cost Estimating Guidelines For Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems" , the VHTR has a lower overall cost of building , operating and maintaining compared with other models of generation IV  .
Outdoing the SFR , the VHTR has lower fuel cost and higher hydrogen production due to its high operation temperature , allowing high burnup of the fuels .
Moreover , the VHTR adopts a closed cycle to ensure thorough burning of transuranics .
In a nutshell , the VHTR is more economically competitive than the SFR .
In contrast to the SFR , the VHTR is resistant to nuclear weapon proliferation as it abandons the reprocessing process .
The reprocessing process incorporated in the SFR extracts plutonium , which is an indispensable part for nuclear weapons .
According to "GIF and generation IV" , among the six nuclear power reactors , only the VHTR does not have this process .
The reprocessing process is mainly aimed at cutting down the amount of waste finally produced .
Because VHTR is operated at an extremely high temperature and within a closed circle system , high utilization of uranium can be achieved even without reprocessing .
The VHTR prevents potential nuclear wars that the SFR may lead to .
To conclude , simple operation and transparent safety concept is inherently embedded in the VHTR , ensuring high level of safety .
The VHTR is more economically competitive than the SFR by lowering the overall cost of building , operating and maintaining .
The VHTR also has the unique feature of proliferation resistance among generation IV reactors which would prevent potential nuclear wars .
Therefore , the VHTR is the one which is the most likely to achieve the vision of "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant" nuclear power .
The railway line in Eschede is a quadruple track .
It allows the high speed train to separate from other slower trains .
The railway track used is not dedicated for high speed train .
However it has been upgraded to so that it can be shared between high speed trains and other slower trains .
In addition , rail switches is used to maximize the usage of the tracks .
The rail switches transfers the trains from a slow track to a fast track and vice versa .
However seconds before the accident happened , the wheel rim which pierces through the cabin floor slammed against the rail switch forcing some of the train cabins to disconnect with the from the first cabin and switch to another track .
The entire disconnected cabin is thereby thrown into the bridge .
In conclusion , improvement of a new design is undeniably good as it makes our life better .
However , besides focusing on the improvement of a new design , one should also pay attention to the possible tradeoffs .
When the improvement of the new design is unable to compensate the limitation , designers should abandon the design .
If we have put in much consideration into the psychology approach in the process of design , many accidents can be avoided .
The use of psychology would assist engineers and designers to think creatively and better and therefore they will come out a safe and good invention .
In addition , by exploring further in the psychological aspect and applying it in our daily routines , many of such major accidents can be prevented or minimized .
"People running trying to evade the incessant radiation ,people dying on the ground , people in chaos .
That is what my eyes , who have seen no death before , see ."
By a survivor of Chernobyl  .
The Chernobyl disaster has been described as 'the greatest technological catastrophe in human history' .
The total radioactivity of the material from Chernobyl was 200 times that of the combined releases from the atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima .
And 21 million square meter of land was polluted and couldn't use for living .
Someone may doubt , is it really helpful to apply psychology ?
They think that in the modern society  , automation is widely used in many ways and man is much less important .
The normal , experienced staff at the plant were planning a test on reactor four .
The first thing working against then is that another power plant on the circuit went down , so Chernobyl was producing more power than usual to compensate .
Then the day staff never ran the test .
Nobody ever told the night staff not to do it , so they tried to perform the test as planned .
Then , the reactor started getting out of control .
The staff tried to use an emergency shutdown mechanism that failed .
Now the had an uncontrolled nuclear reaction .
Because they didn't have the right Geiger counters , they didn't know what a serious danger they were in cause they couldn't got the actual radiation levels .
They stayed for about 3 days till the explosion , trying to pump water into the reactor to control it .
They died weeks later from radiation poisoning .
It is obvious that human factors play an important role in this accident .
Though the original cause is technical , but if anyone find the mistake and correct it  , it wouldn't happen .
What's more , regardless of what extent do the automation achieve , man can never be neglected in production .
And , nobody can avoid mistakes , so applying psychology in design processes could reduce the probability of human errors , thus increased safety coefficient .
Never the less , someone hold the opinion that if technology improves enough , we could get rid of the accident without applying psychology in the design processes .
On 26 April 1986 , a catastrophic disaster , which destroyed the city and killed 30 people in few seconds , fell on Chernobyl .
Massive amount of radioactive substances spread , and eventually caused approximately 270000 cancer cases and 93000 fatal cancers  .
Ever since the disaster occurred , the cause of the accident was extensively looked into .
Most of the studies have shown that it was the carelessness of the operator and large amount of design errors which lead to the disastrous explosion .
Therefore , wide range of approaches arises to enhance safety in engineering process , and psychology is among one of these approaches .
Engineering psychology provides methods to enhance the safety of a system from the human point of view  .
While opponents denied the capability of psychology to prevent the accident , proponents insisted that psychology is applicable to enhance safety of a system .
Although some people perceived that psychology would not influence much in engineering process , I do believe that the use of psychology during design process effectively provide alternative to prevent the accident .
Opponents perceived that the Chernobyl accident is mainly due to the insufficient knowledge of the designers and operators , and advanced technical knowledge could be able to prevent the accident instead of the use of psychology .
However , the study of Jacques  stated that it was the dictatorship of Soviet Union , rather than technical incompetence , which brought the Chernobyl accident .
In fact , the scientists in Soviet Union were equipped with deep technical knowledge , but they were more motivated to produce nuclear weapon for self interest .
Therefore , the ignorance of safety field eventually led to bad decision during design process .
On the other hands , engineering psychology , which comprises 'decision gate' in each design phase , would effectively enhance safety from the human point of view .
In fact , the Chernobyl accident arises from chain of human errors .
Other than political factor and use of inappropriate rod materials , incompetence of operator , unwise decision making during test plan , and deliberate violation against procedure for safe operation account to this disaster  .
In my opinion , input of psychology in each stage would be able to change the erroneous part of design process and effectively enhance the safety of a system .
Although a precise definition of human error is hard to develop , some errors are predictable using existing psychological studies  .
With the modernization of the world , the consumption of energy has increased drastically .
Nuclear reactants have helped improve the situation in recent years .
One of the nuclear reactors is the very high temperature reactor  which is used to produce both hydrogen and electricity .
There have been oppositions discouraging further research and development of the VHTR due to high costs , unsafe conditions and low efficiency of the VHTR .
However , I feel that despite these , we should still continue with the further developments of the VHTR .
The main issue that the public is concerned with is safety .
The VHTR operates at a very high temperature .
There are fears that the reactor may get overheated as it operates at very high temperature .
However , with the improvement in the design of machine and materials used , the VHTR is cooled via helium which is an inert gas .
The helium gas does not react readily with other gases and thus making it safe to use .
In addition , the material used to build the reactor is graphite which has high melting point .
Graphite also has high heat capacity and thermal inertia , thus allowing it to withstand high temperature .
It has high structural stability despite being heated up to high temperatures .
Graphite and helium make the VHTR safer to use as it now heats up less readily .
Thus , the VTHR is safe to use even though it requires high temperatures to operate .
There are skeptics who argue that high start up cost , due to the materials of the reactor , make the VHTR not worth undergoing further research and development .
They feel that the government should channel the funds to produce other useful products which may directly benefit them .
The aim of the government should be revised and other important needs such as healthcare of citizens should be considered before building these reactors .
Funds could be better allocated in order to not neglect important areas .
I agree that the start-up cost of VHTR is high as it costs about 114 .9 billion US dollars to build it .
However , the performance and maintenance cost are much lower as compared to the start up cost .
The fuel used in VHTR produces a large amount of energy when burnt , thus reducing the amount of fuel burnt .
As the VHTR is able to produce two products , hydrogen and electricity concurrently , it helps to reduce the cost of producing both products separately .
Furthermore , in the long run , the high cost is spread over the products , thus reducing the daily cost .
The VTHR is able to produce electricity which the world is in need of .
Furthermore , it is also able to produce hydrogen , a side product which is useful too .
Furthermore , it has high efficiency and the reactor is safe to use .
Cost should not be an issue as it will eventually be reduced with the spread overhead costs .
Therefore , the VTHR should continue undergoing research and development .
Generation IV nuclear energy systems are very promising technologies which will probably be available from 2030 onwards .
These technologies have many advantages , such as enhancing nuclear safety , minimizing generation of nuclear waste and decreasing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation  .
Although Generation IV nuclear energy systems have so many advantages and plans for four systems have been finalized , public opposition doubts whether further research and development are still needed for them .
However , the opposite's concerns will not matter through long-run modification of the plans and the Gen IV systems will definitely benefit most of the nations .
It is essential to do more research for the Very High Temperature Reactor or VHTR which is the most promising system out of all the Generation IV systems .
Secondly , critics argue that the VHTR is too costly and it will ultimately be eliminated in the future due to economic factors just as what happened to the HTGR or High-Temperature-Gas-Reactor in 1989  .
To some extent , the VHTR system is indeed more expensive than the Generation III Nuclear Energy Systems .
However , even though the one-time economic input is high , the VHTR has low operating and maintenance cost  .
In an economic view , low variable cost will finally lead to low average cost despite the fact that the fixed cost is quite high .
Moreover , the electricity generation of the VHTR system has an efficiency ratio larger than 50 percent and it is much more efficient than the Generation III systems .
The efficient electricity generation will overweigh the high cost of the machine and engineering design  .
In addition , abundant heat produced in the VHTR system raises the efficiency of hydrogen gas production to a significant level .
Hence , the high one-time economic input does not seem to be a problem compared with the high efficiency and the significant side product of the VHTR system .
Thirdly , some people are concerned about whether the Generational IV Nuclear Energy System will become a privilege of the wealth or technology developed countries and enlarge the gap between the developed countries and the developing countries .
However this concern is actually redundant since most of countries have reached a consensus that the development of Generation IV systems is an international initiative rather than an independent investigation .
As estimated , these systems will be available by 2030 in both developed countries and developing countries  .
To sum up , even though there are concerns about Generation IV VHTR system , such as potential danger of the system , high cost of the system and the side effect of the system , the advantages of Generation IV VHTR system surpass its disadvantages .
Generation IV VHTR system should be fully developed since the VHTR system intends to increase safety , efficiency and reliability and provides other economic benefits , such as hydrogen production .
Nowadays , with the development of our society , more and more energy is consumed by the whole world .
However , most people never consider the question how many years the petroleum and coal can support our lives .
Scientists said that human being can only use petroleum and coal for no more than one or two hundred years .
On that condition , new energy , especially nuclear power , will be our first choice to carry on our development , for which we must change our attitude towards nuclear power .
Nowadays , many people still resist nuclear power because of the fear of terrorists , its so-called danger and the heavy metal from its waste .
I cannot deny some tragedies occurred during the exploration and development of nuclear power .
However I want to emphasize that nuclear power is still our first choice and many people resist it just because some misunderstanding about its history .
I suggest that we can use Supercritical-water-cooled reactors , which are efficient , safe and environmental-friendly .
In my opinion , nuclear power is a must for our further development and we have the ability to control it and make full use of it .
From the angle of safety , many people are afraid of the hypothesis that terrorists may attack the reactors because they are the best target to make chaos and mass destruction .
Actually , the issue is being considered in the country where these nuclear reactors are widely built .
As Pittsburgh Tribune Review January 18 , 2007 reported , US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that in the future , the design of nuclear power reactors , such as SWCR , will consider avoiding the large-type aircraft collision to prevent the attack comes from terrorists .
In addition , according to a research group , concrete structure used in such kind of reactor can withstand a deliberately crash by a military jet .
Besides , most countries in the world have regarded anti-terrorism as one of their main tasks in the future .
They will try their best to avoid terrorism and spare no effect to protect their nation from being attacked .
Therefore , terrorism should not become the obstacle of the development of nuclear reactor .
However , many people fear of nuclear reactor because they do not believe the safety of it .
Take the SWCR for example; its high temperature can reach 550 and the pressure is very high .
People may be afraid that some accident may happen at such a tough environment .
But nowadays , a nuclear reactor contains a lot of Safety features , such as automatic shutdown of the fission process by insertion of control rods , emergency water-cooling for the core in case of pipeline breakage , and a concrete containment shell , which can help avoid emergence .
I believe with these safety features , the nuclear power reactor will be very safe .
Last but not least , some people say that the heavy metal comes from the nuclear waster may cause a lot of environmental problems .
I agree that the old generation reactors generate a lot of heavy metal waste , which is still a problem .
However , this new kind of reactor is quite environmental-friendly .
Its coolant is water , which is cheap and will not generate pollution .
What's more , it also has a waste recycling system , which is combined by two parts .
Firstly , there is a reprocessing plant to reuse the spent SWAC fuel .
Secondly , there is a dry process to dry the used fuel to minimize the waste .
This recycling system makes it more environmental-friendly than others .
I think we need not to worry about how to deal with the waste because of these two significant steps .
Nowadays , with the development of nuclear power , more and more problems have been solved by these scientists and engineers .
As to the potential terrorism attract , we can build solid reactor as well as emphasis anti-terrorism in a global level .
In addition , we have developed many important features to improve the safety of a reactor .
We also try different ways , such as a reprocessing plant and dry the waste to reduce the emitting of waste from a reactor .
I think we have already had enough reason to make full use of the nuclear power , to benefit the whole world as well as our next generations .

There are accidents happening every year , whether due to human mistakes or design defects .
People have been putting efforts to improve the design and eliminate unexpected accidents .
Not surprisingly , psychology plays a crucial role in engineering design process .
Engineering psychology can be understood as the study of human behaviors , as well as designing , building mechanical devices or artificial environments to improve human interaction with the system , and to satisfy anthropometric or psychological requirements so that people will use them  .
Until now , the most deadly aircraft accident in aviation history is the Tenerife accident on March 27 , 1977 , with a death toll of 583 .
In Tenerife airport , two planes , KLM 4805 and Pan Am Clipper 1736 , collided with each other .
Basically , both human aspects and system aspects led to this tragedy .
Although there is not a definite cause for such accident , the correct use of psychology in certain areas , including the design of the airport , the communication procedure and the training of manpower , may help to prevent similar disaster in the future .
Last but not least , the training of the captains and the crews somewhat contributed to the accident in a sense .
The captain of the KLM was used to be a training captain , which means he conducted training flights more than regular line flights .
But many operational problems only turn up during the actually flight .
So whenever the captain encountered problems , he may not keep sober and make the correct decision .
Though the accident cannot entirely attribute to the captain , he had the highest power and should be experienced enough to seek safety for all the passengers .
So whenever training captains or crews , both theoretical training and operational training should be reinforced .
In conclusion , in the Tenerife accident , the failure to consider several crucial factors in the airport design , the communication systems and the manpower training , indirectly caused the accident to happen .
The use of psychology in the design process can help the designers to consider these issues more thoroughly and perhaps influencing his decision .
The result of any of these minor changes could perhaps have prevented the accident from ever occurring .
According to a BBC report , in Europe alone , there are 165 nuclear reactors .
On the other hand , there are also countries that are against this idea , such as Germany , who is drawing out from their nuclear programme  .
The reason for opposing is that nuclear accidents release harmful radiation that has adverse effects on humans and the environment .
This is seen in the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 followed by the Chernobyl accident in 1986 , which have reinforced fears in the people .
In addition , many are concerned that nuclear reactors are prone to being used as a weapon of mass destruction by terrorists and hostile countries .
Thus , they are against the idea of building nuclear plants .
With these concerns in mind , scientists and engineers have developed six Generation IV nuclear reactor concepts with enhanced safety features that would prevent another Chernobyl .
Furthermore , nuclear energy is a clean alternative to fossil fuel as it emits far less greenhouse gases  .
In this essay , I will discuss the benefits of the molten salt reactor  , which is one of the six Generation IV concepts , and show that it is superior to the very high temperature reactor  in terms of safety , performance and cost .
Firstly , on safety , the VHTR is said to be a relatively safe nuclear reactor because it includes a back-up emergency core cooling system .
However , the MSR operates under a much safer condition .
Unlike the VHTR , the MSR adopts a passive emergency cooling system .
The method of cooling in the MSR is more efficient than the VHTR because if the MSR coolant salt overheats and overflows , the coolant salt will be transported to various storage tanks which are installed with passive decay heat cooling systems , thus they are verified to be critically-safe .
Besides the storage tanks , freeze valves that will automatically open whenever it detects overheating of the salt are also installed .
As a result , heated fuel will be disposed of immediately without threatening an explosion or leakage  .
Therefore , the MSR is a much safer reactor than the VHTR .
Secondly , the overall performance of the MSR also surpasses the VHTR making the MSR a better nuclear reactor .
The VHTR operates at a core outlet gas temperature of more than 900 to 1000 with output power estimated to be 600MW .
On the other hand , the MSR is able to not only operate in small sizes , but also in large sizes .
Besides the varying sizes that a MSR could work in , it is also able to operate at two varying temperatures of 705 and 1000  .
At 1000 , the VHTR's overall plant efficiency is about 50% while the MSR's overall plant efficiency is about 60% .
This shows that at constant temperature , the MSR is at least 10% more efficient than the VHTR .
Therefore , countries should invest on the MSR which is more efficient than the VHTR in terms of overall plant efficiency .
Last but not least , waste recycling in the MSR allows better usage of materials as well as ensuring a lower cost of operation .
The wastes produced in VHTR go directly to the repository .
However , in the MSR system , wastes produced from generation of electricity will be recycled .
The system collects , processes the wastes according to their physical and chemical properties , and separates the residual fuel from the wastes .
During the process , plutonium and uranium would be recovered and then recycled to produce more energy .
This in turn reduces the volume of material disposed since plutonium and uranium makes up almost 97% of the entire mass of fuel used in generating nuclear energy .
This will also lead to reduction of costs since capital spent on reactants are significantly reduced  .
Therefore , adoption of the MSR as an alternative to electricity production is a wiser choice than choosing the VHTR .
In conclusion , the MSR is a much better reactor than the VHTR as the MSR is safer , has higher overall plant efficiency and more efficient recycling method .
Thus , we should invest in the MSR to produce energy efficiently .
Scientists and engineers are now thinking of developing a new generation of nuclear reactors that can solve many problems such as green-house effects , the rising prices of energy , the safety of nuclear reactors .
In "Nuclear power's new dawn" , Butler  mentions six concepts of Generation IV  reactors .
Among them is the supercritical-water-cooled reactor  which is considered a popular one because of its many obvious advantages .
While some proponents totally support further research and development funding for this concept , others still doubt about the benefits of the SCWR since there are many challenging problems in R&D process .
Three of these problems are safety , efficiency and practicality .
It is often argued that the SCWR is rather safe in comparison with other generation IV reactor concepts because it operates at rather low temperature , ranging from 510 to 550 C  .
Although this argument is true , high operating temperature is not the only source of accidents in a reactor .
In fact , the pressure inside a SCWR can reach 25MPa which is ultra-high and dangerous .
At such level of pressure , the current steel is easily corroded by high temperature water .
Another safety problem comes from very fast turbine speed of the SWCR ) .
Moreover , an extremely abnormal event has been recognized which is the loss of feed water   .
Therefore , we must stress the importance of finding suitable materials that are stress-resistant and anti-corrosive and developing a reliable auxiliary feed water system .
The SCWR has very high efficiency  and can churn out electricity at prices that , on paper , are competitive with coal and gas , and vastly cheaper than existing nuclear reactors .
However , one disadvantage of the SWCR is that it , in fact , is the only concept among the GenIV reactors that does not output hydrogen fuel .
The temperature needed to split hydrogen from water in a reactor is from 700 to 900  C and even if the SCWR could produce hydrogen , separating it with the liquid water would become a big problem .
Hydrogen fuel is considered the energy for the future since it is carbon-free , non-toxic , less fire-risk , higher efficiency than petrol .
Furthermore , it should be noted , however , that if most car owners switched to fully electric cars , many countries would need to double their electricity production  .
Therefore , it should be better if we develop reactors that can generate hydrogen fuel rather than ones that can only generate electricity .
The SWCR is preferred than other GenIV concepts because of its simple design which indicates that it will be cheaper and easier to develop and operate .
However , other GenIV reactor concepts seem to be practical , too .
One example is the very-high-temperature reactor  which can produce hydrogen fuel and can be first built in 2020  .
Moreover , the estimated amount of money needed for R&D activities of the VHTR is about 670 M$  .
Last but not least , the efficiency of the VHTR  is also higher than that of the SCWR  .
Although the VHTR also has its own challenges in R&D , it is , besides SCWR , highly interested in by the experts .
Although it cannot be denied that SCWR is a very practical one among six concepts of GenIV reactors , it is not the only choice .
Developing a new generation of nuclear reactor costs us not only a huge amount of money , but also lots of time and manpower .
Therefore , we must be of great considerations when choosing whether the SCWR or other concepts to develop .
The public is very concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors and there have been debates on whether Generation IV nuclear reactor should be built or not .
Issues being discussed were safety of operating the nuclear reactor as there have been catastrophic events in the past like the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl disaster  .
Long term storage of nuclear waste and the amount of time the nuclear waste needs to be fully decomposed .
The cost of building a nuclear reactor as it involves billions of dollars of taxpayer's money .
These were the main factors why few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries and I agree that Generation IV nuclear reactor should not be built .
Over the years , nuclear technology has improved and in principle , created the term 'meltdown proof' reactors whereby the nuclear reactor can cool themselves down in the event of an accident with minimal impact or  ,if any , human intervention  .
Hence , safety of the nuclear reactors has always been the main issue regarding the building of nuclear power plants .
Technically , it is possible to avoid a meltdown given that the new Generation IV has an advanced safety system in place .
However , human error is a factor that decides whether the safety system in place works in an event of a failure  .
Events that clearly show the effects of nuclear meltdown are the Chernobyl disaster that resulted in 336 ,000 people being exposed to radioactive chemicals and had to be relocated .
The result of the explosion had linked to many forms of cancer in Eastern Europe and Russia , as well as destroying animals and plants . 
Waste from the nuclear faculty is another major issue .
Although the development and research of Generation IV reactors produces less nuclear wastes , the main problem lies in getting rid of it rather than storing it .
According to Andrew Blowers , a former member of the Committee for Radioactive Waste Management  , which advised the government , the nuclear waste does not decompose easily and will last for thousands if not millions of years , thus , it will impose a burden on future generations .
Furthermore , the cost of waste disposal and storage of the nuclear waste is huge on top of the at least 2 billion pounds required to build the nuclear plant . 
The cost of building a nuclear reactor has always been one of the biggest issues .
It is true that the cost of developing the Generation IV reactors will result in a cheaper price tag when building future nuclear reactors .
Unfortunately , no more than three of the six designs are likely to survive the feasibility testing phrase and go on to become research prototypes , each costing at least US$1 billion or more to build and test  , thus , wasting taxpayer's money .
To summarize why nuclear reactor should not be built is because no nuclear reactor in the world is inherently safe as all operational reactors have inherent safety flaws , which cannot be eliminated by safety upgrading .
Highly radioactive spent fuel requires constant cooling .
If this fails , it could lead to a catastrophic release of radioactivity .
There will always be nuclear waste irregardless of the amount the development and research of Generation IV nuclear reactors can reduce .
Billions of dollars is taking place in building a nuclear reactor and not a few million .
Furthermore , there is no guaranteed in building a successful nuclear reactor .
With emission of green house gas now soaring , nuclear energy , as a non-carbon dioxide source , is finding its way back on the table .
However , the huge cost and the potential danger make nuclear plants cannot be widely accepted .
Therefore , we need to develop a new generation of reactors to overcome these disadvantages .
Actually , GIF  has already set a R&D funding for the new generation of reactorsthe Generation IV reactors  .
Although there are some opposing voices against this funding , it is a wise decision to set R&D funding for Generation IV reactors .
Opponents of R&D funding for generation IV reactors claim that nuclear plants are very dangerous  because of the radioactive wastes and the radioactive materials escaping from the reactors  .
However , these two disadvantages are no longer problems for the Generation IV reactors .
It is because all the six concepts of Generation IV reactors are operating at a very high temperature ranging from 510 degrees C to 1000 degrees C and have a highly automatic circular system , the radioactive waste can be minimized to a very safe level  .
Besides , unlike what the public thinks , there is almost no radioactive materials escaping from the reactors unless in an unexpected accident .
However , the new technologies applied in the new generation of reactors such as pebble-bed , in principle , can prevent any radioactive material escaping from the reactors in an accident  .
Opponents also mention that it costs too much to build and run nuclear plants  .
In fact , it is true for the previous generations of reactors .
However , if the Generation IV reactors really work , on paper , they are competitive with coals and gas  .
As mentioned above , the new reactors are operating at very high temperatures and have highly automatic cycle system , so they are more efficient .
For instance , the VHTR  can produce half more electricity with the same amount of resources  .
Therefore , the cost on the resources can be significantly reduced .
Also , due to the highly automatic system , the capital spent on hiring experienced operators and building offsite monitoring systems can be reduced .
Both of these make it cheaper to build nuclear plants .
It should be evident that arguments against the setting of R&D funding for Generation IV reactors are not valid .
The high operating temperature and the highly automatic cycle system make the new generation reactors not only more inexpensive but also much safer .
Moreover , the simplified safety feature makes those new reactors be less of a terrorist target .
Therefore , in my opinion , there should be R&D funding for Generation IV reactors .
VHTR systems do not use waste recycling thus reducing the risk of proliferation .
Public opinion is against the construction of nuclear reactors due to the partial reactor meltdown accident in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and of 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine  .
It is generally recognized that it is a practical impossibility to render civilian nuclear energy systems proliferation-proof CITATION Hir05 \l 1033  .
The development of Gen IV nuclear reactors is necessary to respond to the upcoming scarcity of fissile material , the issue of proliferation and the requirement of safe repositories for nuclear waste .
Research has still to be done to work on a better cooling system and material that can withstand very high temperatures  .
Shortages in energy supply and insecurities caused due to the rising oil prices and the threat of climate change clearly show the need for the development of Nuclear power .
Due to extreme operational conditions , Gen IV systems could even turn out to be more dangerous than currently operated installations CITATION Aus09 \l 1033  .
Countries should invest in the development of VHTR to satisfy their energy demands and to decrease the dependence on fossil fuels for energy .
Nowadays , as the population of the world is increasing rapidly , humans are facing severe food crisis .
In order to solve this problem , one good way is to develop Genetically Modified Food .
Currently , because of some uncertain effects of Genetically Modified Food  , it has not been widely accepted by us .
However , I believe that if GMF has a very bright future .
According to Whitman  , the term GM foods is commonly used to refer to crop plants created for human or animal consumption using the latest molecular biology techniques , and these food have been modified to meet people's demand in the laboratory .
GM foods have advantages over traditional plants .
Firstly , most of them have higher pest and disease resistance .
So the usage amount of chemical substances will be largely reduced .
Besides , we can increase the crop yield by cultivating GM plants .
As the food situation is becoming desperate in today's context , these two features are significant .
On 26th April 1986 , a severe reactor's meltdown occurred in Chernobyl nuclear plant , Ukraine which released more radioactivity compared to the time when atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
In the accident , 56 people were killed and about 600000 people were exposed to significant levels of radiation  .
This accident is considered as the worst nuclear disaster in the world .
As the result , many people were afraid of nuclear power even until today .
Hence , most people oppose the revival of nuclear reactor while support the renewable power such as solar power and wind power .
Despite there are a lot of opposition to the reborn of nuclear power; there is some evidence which show that the potential benefits of molten salt reactor  far outweigh its dangers .
Opponents of nuclear power claim that nuclear reactors are totally insecure as the incidents of Three Miles Island and Chernobyl led to catastrophes .
Another example was the technical failure in the Forsmark nuclear power plant in Sweden , 2006 .
According to the former director of that plant , it was pure luck that the plant had no meltdown; otherwise , it could be another disaster  .
However , the possibility for a MSR to melt is relatively small compared to the old nuclear power plant .
This is because molten salt reactor has different safety approaches which can prevent the meltdown .
Firstly , the molten salts have low chemical activity at the sea-level pressure .
They are also mechanically stable as their boiling point is very high .
Besides that , there is a passive cooling system which includes passively cooled dump tanks that will perform emergency cooling and shutdown in any emergency conditions  .
Moreover , in a MSR , the mobile fission products are removed continuously and reused afterward .
This means that the accident rate can be reduced to the minimum .
Opponents also mention that there is no solution to radioactive waste .
Since the beginning of nuclear power , radioactive waste has remained as a major problem .
Reprocessing the radioactive waste once became a useful method .
However , according to a study published in 2001 , there was a significant increment of leukaemia among under-25 year olds who were living within 10 km of La Hague nuclear reprocessing plants , in northwest France  .
Yet , reprocessing the radioactive waste and recycle the salts seem to be possible in MSR .
In fact , MSR would still produce hazardous waste and radionuclide .
Nevertheless , the organic components in that waste would be oxidized in the molten salt oxidizer  and radionuclide would be retained in the salt .
The salt would then be recycled and reused in the MSR  .
Some of the radionuclide still left out in this recycling process .
In order to get a shorter-lived radioactivity , the radionuclide is combined with some mixtures such as glass , ceramic and concrete .
Hence , the radioactive waste is brought to an optimum for disposal and lesser harmful radioactive waste is produced by MSR .
In conclusion , despite many people are still opposing the concept of reactor generation IV , I believe that MSR could bring the nuclear power to another new age .
MSR has many advantages such as cost-effective , minimize the danger of disposal and it has a nearly perfect safety precaution which reduce the accident rate greatly .
Hence , it has the potential to become the main source of energy in the next decade .
Engineering is concerned with improving equipment from the point of view of mechanical and electrical design , whereas psychology is concerned with the mind and behavior  .
As such , people often find it difficult to associate psychology with engineering .
However , psychology in fact complements engineering process .
As defined by Blum  , psychology in engineering is concerned with adapting the equipment to people , based upon their psychological capacities and limitations with the objective of improving overall system performance .
Theoretically , analysis of the mind and behavior of man can effectively reduce accidents due to human error , by adopting measures that takes into consideration the limitation and capacities of man .
Opponents often argue that psychology is unnecessary in engineering .
The employment of psychologists would simply incur unnecessary cost .
In fact , many engineers would rather consult their intuition than a professional ergonomist in the designing process .
Furthermore , the effectiveness of the use of psychology in ensuring safety in engineering processes is being questioned .
The safety issues in engineering processes are often seen with great concern and various rules and regulations are set to ensure mishaps from occurring .
Thus , with these precautions , the use of psychology is deemed as unnecessary .
Another point of contend is the use of psychology to prevent engineering errors .
Engineering errors are integral parts in the designing process and engineers have adopted the measure of introducing corrective actions such as adding on to the system to minimize or eliminate such errors .
Hence , the use of psychology would serve little use .
However , the safety precautions and corrective actions are not fail-proof .
The likelihood of accidents occurring stays high despite these measures .
Although safety precautions are set , the tendencies of violation of the rules are not to be neglected .
The rules and regulations are drawn down with consideration of ideal behavior of system users yet it is unlikely that all men follow the same code of behavior .
Thus measures to reduce errors resulting from deviation from ideal behavior should be formulated with the aid of psychology which analyses the behavior of man .
In addition , psychology can be applied to predict errors in the designing process due to human factors and preventive measure can be taken to avoid mishaps due to these errors .
Furthermore , it is essential to note that the most damaging errors made by the engineering team is not regarding the technical aspect of the engineering process but with regard to ethic issue which often jeopardize safety .
Hence analysis of the mind and behavior of man may potentially help rule out the possibilities of such occurring .
In the case of Hyatt Regency walkway collapse , human error was undeniably one of the most influencing factors underlying the failure of the structure .
Even though the collapse of the walkway is due to the failure of components of the structure , it would not have been fatal if the errors was identified and corrected in time .
Psychology can be applied to various stages of design processes to prevent accidents .
Use of psychology in engineering process is also necessary in predicting the possible dilemma faced by end users using the product and the possibility of wrong usage which can cause potential harm .
Study of behavior of man is necessary in the prediction and adjustment of the system to suit users .
In the case of Hyatt Regency accident , the failure to foresee the large crowd and hence larger workload is one great mistake made by the engineers .
As a heavily advertised project , engineers should have anticipated response from the people .
Hence , it will be utmost importance to verify the maximum load that the walkway is able to withstand .
In the event that the crowd predicted is above the maximum load the walkway can withstand , possible measures can be taken to divert the crowd , and ensure load within a safe boundary .
In the case of Hyatt Regency accident , the application of psychology would have possibly prevented the accident .
It is apparent that the negligence of the engineering teams was to be blamed for the accident .
Since the first use of nuclear reactor as electricity generator in 1957 , the public have been very concerned about its safe operation  .
Public opposition is even more intense after the accidents at {Three Mile Island } and Chernobyl .
But recently , vast amount of supporters surfaced , mainly due to the urgent need in reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
One of the proponents , James Lovelock , has even stated that nuclear power is the only green solution for global warming  .
As a result , six generation 4 reactor concepts were proposed by the Generation 4 International Forum  , offering substantial advancement in safety and reliability , sustainability , cost and physical protection  .
Although all six concepts are brilliant , the very-high-temperature reactor  should be placed above all other reactors in further research and development funding , as it has clear advantages over other reactors in the aspect of safety and security , performance , and proliferation resistance .
Since reprocessing of nuclear waste can eminently reduces raw fuel input and conserves the world's uranium supplies  , opponents might argue that the {Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor}  , {Molten Salt Reactor}  , {Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor}  , and LFR offer better performance with the adoption of reprocessing  .
However , the VHTR offers high thermal efficiency in supplying electricity and producing hydrogen , alongside process heat applications .
Operating at 1000 degree Celsius , the VHTR is able to produce 50% more electricity using the same amount of fuel compared with conventional plants .
The high operating temperature also enables hydrogen production using thermochemical process , with superior efficiency .
In addition , heat produced by the VHTR can also be utilized in a broad range of process heat applications , such as coal gasification  .
On the other hand , reprocessing is extremely expensive , costing more than uranium fuel itself  .
Hence , it would be impossible for nuclear power to compete with coal and gas in the market for electricity .
Opponents might also maintain that GFR , MSR , SFR , and LFR provide better waste management , seeing that up to 96% of waste produced is being recycled through reprocessing  .
However , this would oppose the aim of creating a proliferation resistant reactor .
In contrary , the VHTR does not have this issue , for it operates in a once-through uranium cycle .
Since plutonium - the main substance in manufacturing nuclear weapon - is not separated with the nuclear waste , it cannot be easily extracted to build nuclear weapons  .
The great proliferation resistance provides assurance to the society , avoiding suspicion between countries about any secret nuclear weapons program that might cause misunderstandings .
Therefore , the high proliferation resistance that comes with VHTR averts the emergence of new nuclear weapons states , and keeps nuclear weapons capability out of terrorist hands .
It should be evident that the Very-High-Temperature Reactor is the best among the 6 evolutionary concepts of generation 4 reactors .
The VHTR is equipped with superior passive safety feature with its underground construction , which also greatly increases its security and physical protection .
Furthermore , the VHTR offers high thermal efficiency , while retain the capability of hydrogen production and utilization in heat process applications .
Finally , the VHTR also provides high proliferation resistance , which prevents the surfacing of new nuclear weapons , maintaining peace in the world .
Therefore , in my opinion , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor should be given priority for further research and development funding .
With the fast growth of Earth's population , the demand for nuclear power is rapidly increasing because of its higher efficiency in producing electricity among the non greenhouse-gas-emitting sources .
The potential benefits of nuclear energy have led many countries to do extensive research and development on nuclear reactors .
However , many controversies emerge over the development of nuclear reactors because of fear of nuclear leakage and accident .
No new nuclear power plants were built in the United States since the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 .
Considering the fact that the global warming has becoming an increasingly serious problem nowadays , the development of nuclear power is quite necessary .
"Global warming and rising energy needs are rehabilitating the concept of nuclear power .
But if it is to figure in the energy equation , it will need to be cheaper , cleaner and safer" , says Declan Butler .
In the research for cleaner and safer nuclear reactor to meet the increasing demand for energy , new generation nuclear reactors have been researched by a consortium of ten nations .
Furthermore , it is quite necessary and urgent to set an overall direction of nuclear reactors .
Some people believe that the very high temperature reactor  is the most promising reactor and should be largely put into use in the near future .
However , compared with VHTR , the sodium-cooled fast reactor  has more advantages and should be chosen as a main type of reactors in the future .
Proponents of VHTR claim that it operates at a higher temperature which is much more efficient than the SFR .
It is true that the higher temperature enables the reactor to work more efficiently; however , it also raises a huge inherent safety problem .
As a reactor which also produces hydrogen which is combustible , it is likely for the VHTR to explode at high temperatures .
Once the accident happens , the related safety components of the reactor would not work .
In contrast , the SFR does not have this safety concern for its operating temperature is just half of that of the VHTR .
Furthermore , the closed fuel of SFR can utilize almost all the energy provided by the fuels and the recovery and recycle of the actinides in SFR can reach about 99 .9% , which indicate the a high efficiency of SFR .
Opponents of SFR claim that the radioactivity of its coolant sodium is harmful to the environment .
Although the sodium is radioactive and easy to have chemical reaction with water and air , the self-activated shutdown system of SFR has largely reduced the possibilities of the leakage of sodium .
Furthermore , SFR has a relatively large thermal inertia and a large margin to coolant boiling which ensure the safety of the use of sodium .
More important , there is an extra loop which is called secondary system acts as a buffer in case of the reactions between the sodium and water  .
In this way , it can largely avoid the release of radioactive elements and become safe and environmentally friendly .
Another argument advanced by opponents of SFR is that it can only produce electricity and it has shown little promise of becoming an economical reactor so far  .
It is true that the VHTR can produce not only electricity but also hydrogen; however , the electricity is more widely used than the hydrogen nowadays .
Actually , the hydrogen energy system is not very mature because of the limited technology so far .
The electricity is still in high demand nowadays and the SFR can completely meet the demand of markets for electricity .
.On the other hand , the cost of the research and development of SFR is only about 610 million dollars , which is much less than that of VHTR .
All of these facts show that the SFR is more economic and flexible than VHTR .
In a nutshell , it can be seen that the arguments against the sodium cooled fast reactor are inconclusive and not valid .
On the contrary , the SFR system has more advantages over VHTR on its safety , efficiency and costs , which made the SFR a promising reactor .
Therefore , the research and development of sodium cooled fast reactor is necessary and overwhelming .
However , if a psychologist was present during the designing phase of the wheel , he could have pointed out that the datasheets were prepared by other engineers also , and engineers can make mistakes too .
During the testing phase , the psychologist could have proposed that the engineers further test the wheel at a much higher speed , and what problems the wheels might develop under wear and tear conditions .
He could also have said that since there are no testing facilities present , the engineers could have brought the wheel out to other country to run the required tests .
Furthermore , Fraunhofer Institute has already told the company that it is possible that the wheels would fail earlier than expected  .
Yet , no actions have been done by the company to replace the failing wheels .
To ensure that the wheels would be replaced , the psychologist , in this case , can keep reminding the engineers to correct the errors present on the wheels .
One of the important issues bothering people nowadays is the lack of energy supply and an increase in global warming due to the emission of greenhouse gases from current generation reactors .
This issue has been raised in various contexts and different views of the issue are shared and discussed .
Mainly , the controversies of the issue are on the safe and clean operation of nuclear reactors , such as the handling of nuclear waste and prevention of terrorist acts  .
In addition , the cost of constructing nuclear reactors must be considered given the economic constraints today .
One way to address this issue is to provide funding to further research and develop Generation IV reactors , particularly the Very- High-Temperature Reactors  .
Although the cost for building Generation IV reactors is very high , the issue of the increase in demand of energy today needs to be addressed .
In fact , an amount of $1 .1 billion is needed to build a Generation IV reactor prototype  .
Moreover , the cost estimated also needs to take into account plant decommissioning and nuclear waste storage costs .
On the other hand , the VHTR produces both electricity and hydrogen .
As a result , many countries that largely depend on oil for their energy needs realise that hydrogen might be the fuel of the future and solution to their problems .
Furthermore , it is reported that if oil continues to be used , the energy demand from US transport alone will cause the nation's oil imports to soar by 78% by 2025  .
Next , the society is concerned on the safety and security aspect of Generation IV reactors .
Even though Generation IV reactors might generate threats from terrorist attacks to acts of wars , stricter laws and policies could be set in place for counter measures  .
The recent Iran's nuclear disclosure to the world has threatened the equilibrium of power within that particular region of the world  .
A solution to this could be to enforce countries that are intending to build nuclear reactors to sign the nuclear pact with International Atomic Energy Agency  or else legal actions might be taken against them .
In addition , it is reported that the generation IV reactors will quietly switch themselves off and cool down in an event of an earthquake , a terrorist attack or human errors  .
The waste and pollution produced by nuclear reactors is a worrying issue to both the environmentalists and the public , however the U .S . Department of Energy  has already considered this issue and more attention are paid to it .
Today , we have about 270 tons of separated plutonium essentially in storage in multiple countries  .
Therefore , the U .S . DOE has named out a few important researches and development challenges if generation IV reactors were specifically used for nuclear purposes .
The U .S . DOE realises that nuclear energy has a reputation as a polluting technology , hence it must be addressed  .
Moreover , since VHTR is a CO2 emission free reactor , it will not contribute to global warming .
In addition , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  experts suggest that the U .S . should take time now to develop different "advanced fuel cycle" technologies  .
For these reasons , it is acceptable to jump into the conclusion that generation IV reactors would have the required technology to prevent the waste problem if it is going to be built .
On the whole , the debate on the provision of funds to further research and develop on generation IV reactors has been around for quite sometime .
The reasons for my support on the provision of funds are because there is a global shortage of energy supply and generation IV reactors are generally more efficient and environmental friendly .
In addition , new technologies could be researched to provide a solution to those problems that remain unsolved .
In order to do so , additional funds , efforts and assistance need to be provided to the research and development of generation IV reactors .
'Design process' is a linear sequence of events that has a start and an end point while 'psychology' is the study of the mind , its mental function and behaviour .
By approaching the design process from a psychological angle , the usability , functionality , safety and requite user competencies of the design product are ensured to match user expectations .
The major engineering accident chosen for this essay is the space shuttle Challenger accident .
The accident occurred on the 28 January , 1986 when Challenger disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean seventy-three seconds into its flight , causing the death of its seven crew members .
Why is the psychology approach important to the design process ?
A system of machines , however advanced it is , can never operate by itself .
Everything that involves management , operation and decision-making comes back down to humans .
However , the human mind is a very complicated subject and a lot of problems might surface during the design process .
Therefore , psychology plays an important role during the design process in order to prevent any accidents from happening .
The Challenger accident was caused by faulty components and poor launch conditions .
The failure of the O-rings in its right solid rocket booster ignited a spark and subsequently , the flame impinged on the external fuel tank .
This then caused its structural failure and aerodynamic forces further brought about the disintegration of the space shuttle .
One human error , or more specifically a design error , led to the accident .
The two rubber O-rings in the booster were not resilient enough to withstand the hot high-pressure gases produced .
It was not known if the O-rings are able to seal properly at temperatures less than 12 C and the launch was done in cold weather at a temperature of -1 C . The booster's O-rings had been designated as a "Criticality 1" component which means that the failure of both the O-rings would result to the destruction of the orbiter and its crew .
The defect should have been identified and rectified first before the O-rings were used .
Secondly , poor decision-making also contributed to the Challenger accident .
The NASA management felt invulnerable from the accomplishment of its Apollo programme .
NASA was pressured to meet Challenger's launch schedule when the launching was delayed because of the poor weather conditions , low surrounding temperature and a defective micro switch .
The pressure was further increased when the then Vice President of the United States of America , George H . W . Bush was present to watch the launch .
All of these subconsciously affected NASA's decision-making to reduce the safety and quality of the system .
Back in 1977 , Morton-Thiokol , the contractor in charge of the Challenger's solid rocket boosters , knew that the boosters had problems when the O-rings experienced erosion in the booster joints in almost half of the shuttle flights .
In 1985 , a redesign effort was started .
The NASA management was briefed on the problem but they were not in support of the redesign team .
If better decisions were made , there would have been fewer problems .
Other than that , there was also communication failure between the Morton-Thiokol engineers and the top NASA officials .
The engineers can only report to their immediate managers who only report to their direct supervisors .
Because of this mindset , the engineers dare not go above supervisors with their concerns for fear that they might lose their job .
On several occasions , the manager of the Solid Rocket Booster project , George Hardy from Morton-Thiokol , was told by the Marshall Space Flight Centre engineers that Thiokol's booster's field joint design could not be accepted .
An engineer suggested that the secondary O-ring is useless with that joint rotation .
Despite that , Hardy did not inform Morton-Thiokol and it was accepted for flight in 1980 .
It is clear that communication failure was also the cause of the accident .
In conclusion , if psychology is not given consideration during the design process , the possibility for an accident to occur will be high .
Thus , it is important to include psychology in the design process as human factors can affect the safety and quality of a system .
In view of today's environmental problems of global warming , there is an increasing necessity to introduce a clean , safe and efficient alternative energy source .
Although the nuclear power plant is considered safer and cleaner than fossil power plants , the devastating consequences of its occasional meltdowns deter the general public and policy makers from accepting it .
However , the development of technology results a continuous evolution of nuclear energy systems .
One of the latest prototypes of generation IV nuclear reactor is the Lead Cooled fast reactor  .
Unlike the previous generations of nuclear reactors which are constantly critiqued by opponents , the LFR is considered to be not only safer in different aspects , but also more sustainable and economical .
Social security is another safety issue that involves much dispute .
Since the 911 incident , there have been concerns about the unimaginable consequences of terrorist attacks on nuclear plants .
However , the LFR has made improvements on its physical structure to minimize physical damage from external attacks .
For example , the reactor uses independent , redundant and diversified Decay Heat Removal  loops to control damages and prevent potential radioactive releases  .
There is no flammable or reactive coolant materials used to ensure that no big scale explosion occurs when being attacked .
In fact , various studies have shown that nuclear power plants can withstand such attacks better than almost any other civil constructions  .
The physical protections promises top security of building nuclear power plants like the LFR .
While the benefits of the LFR are largely acknowledged , its limitations and potential risks should also be recognized .
For example , as corrosion of lead may take place under high temperature , the LFR only works under 550 , which in turn limits its overall efficiency .
Also , operation of nuclear plant should be closely regulated to prevent any abuse use of nuclear materials .
This requires a concerted effort from countries around the world .
In fact , such regulatory agreements already exist .
An example will be the International Atomic Energy Agency's  safeguards system under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty  .
Nuclear power plants are gaining importance in the world as they help many countries , such as France , to maintain power independence .
Yet the non-nuclear weapon states should be monitored to prevent any undeclared nuclear activities .
In conclusion , the LFR helps enhance safety of nuclear power stations while not compromising economic factors .
Though it may not be the optimal design because of its potential risks and limitations , the LFR is still one of the possible future energy plants .
After all , we should expect the nuclear industry to dominate in generating world's electricity in the future as technology matures .
Nowadays , with the increasing population of the society , the limited resources cannot meet the large amount of demand of energy .
In order to overcome the energy shortage situation today , human beings has tried many ways to explore new kinds of energy , for instance , natural energy which includes wind energy and water energy .
However , the consequence is not that satisfactory , due to its low efficiency and high cost .
Therefore , scientists and publics suggested that we can develop one kind of energy which can produce high energy efficiently , and that kind of energy is known as nuclear energy .
It seems a perfect solution to the bad situation nowadays , however , the use of nuclear energy becomes a controversial issue which causes fierce discussion among not only scientists , but also publics .
In my point of view , using nuclear energy is the right way to meet today's increasing energy demand , due to its high efficiency , environmental emission .
Also , the opposing terms of using nuclear energy , which are: the funds paid on developing this technology is high , the time taking to explore the technology is long and there exists dangers can actually be solved .
Besides the above two factors , some opponents may believe that it is dangerous to use nuclear energy .
We use Very-High-Temperature-Reactors  , which is one of Generation IV reactor concepts , as an example .
Due to the special design of its Helium Coolant , Graphite Reactor Core and temperature controlled system , the danger can be greatly reduced .
It is true that there still exists dangers , however , with the develop of the technology , it is desirable that those dangers could be overcome .
Design process is a linear sequence of events which was started by creative human act and ended with an invention of a new product .
It is also a kind of planning on how to apply the knowledge to the making of an object or a system .
Psychology is the characteristics of mental states and the science of human behavior .
It plays an important role in every human attempt in design processes . .
There is a relationship between psychology and design process which can preventing accident from happening .
Design errors in socio-technical system have really made a significant difference to their reliability and safe operation .
Researches from the nuclear and chemical industry show that 20% to 50% of accidents and failures involve errors in design .
Moreover , since design errors are always corrected before they are involved in these incidents , the real percentage is actually much higher .
If corrective action is taken after an incident , it entails either the redesigning of the operational processes or the installation of another barrier .
These are feedback controls of safety .
They are just add-ons to the system .
However , it is better to use the path of feed-forward control of safety that is to do a correct original system design right from the beginning .
To improve design safety , a human scientist is needed .
This person can help to analyze the future requirements of the system and to improve accident prevention .
Apart from this , a human scientist may also be called upon to help evaluate the prototype by using simulation techniques .
It is necessary to introduce add-ons as all possible design errors will not be discovered until the system is used . 
In conclusion , an accident is never caused by a single component failure or a single human error .
Psychology plays an essential role in design processes .
The role of humans in safeguarding complicated socio-technical systems cannot be neglected .
If the psychology factor is not considered in design processes , accidents may happen easily .
Hence , psychological inputs should be incorporated in design processes .
"The reasonable person adapts them self to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to them self .
Therefore , all progress depends upon the unreasonable person ."
.
This sentence indicates why engineering psychology will become closer and closer to our life .
What is engineering psychology ?
Generally speaking , engineering psychology is concerned with adapting equipment and environment to people  .
This adjustment is based on people's psychological capacities and limitations , and the aim of it is to improve the overall system performance .
The conception of engineering psychology is first brought out during the First World War , when people found that the efficiency of machines was reduced sharply when they were operated by women instead of men  .
Since then people began to realize that sometimes the engineering problem was related to equipment design rather than the people who operate or other mechanical reasons .
However it is hard to say that whether we can solve the engineering problem by simply improving the psychological problems , since for many engineering incidences the technical problems had occupied an overwhelming part .
Hence in this essay I will argue about the proportion of psychological problem and technological problems during engineering incidence and give a conclusion from my own view .
Based on the report provided by Reason  , 92% of all nuclear utility accidents between 1983-1984 were caused by people and only 8% of them were cause by control room operator .
For instance , there are two serious incidences which are cited frequently in technical literature .
They were happened in Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
The failing for the first one include: operators are unprepared to handle serious accident due to the lack of training; complex and confusing operating procedure led to the operators' incorrect action; serious managerial problem within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
None of these deficiencies explain the basic causes in terms of the 'operating error' .
Moreover Reason suggests two main reasons for this kind of incidence in his own report for Chernobyl .
The first factor related to people misunderstands of effect of their action on the whole system , and the second factor is kind of persistent action which is made by a small and cohesive group in the process of pursuing an unsuitable aim .
What is the most iron evidences for his theories is that after realizing these engineering psychology problems , quite a lot of America's nuclear institutes begin to train their staff in a psychology-related way , which indeed prevent the nuclear accidents from happening again till now .
To sum up we can conclude from these two aspects that the human factors and the technical factor are connected and have both played a role in the accident .
To simply solve one of them will contribute nothing to the accident .
Engineering accidents are not always caused by technical problems and the issue of engineering psychology will become hotter and hotter with the development of technology in the area of advanced transportation , co-operative work , teleworking , health , pollution and leisure .

With the fast development of human society , we are facing more and more demanding energy requirements .
After centuries' exploitation , oil and coal , which human have deeply relied on in the past few hundred years , will dry up soon .
As prediction shows , the two main energy resources will be unable to sustain the industry demands in less than one hundred years time .
To solve this problem , people tried to find different energy substitutions , among which is nuclear energy .
Nuclear energy has many advantages .
Firstly , it is environmental-friendly , with no greenhouse gas emitted .
Secondly , nuclear energy has incomparable working efficiency with other energy resources .
One kilogram uranium can release the same amount of energy as that released by 2400 tons of standard coal .
As carbon dioxide emission soars and energy demands increase rapidly recent years , the nuclear option is finding its way to the table .
To satisfy the increasing demands of nuclear energy , scientists are desperately searching for ways to improve the reactors' work efficiency .
Consequently , generation IV nuclear systems are born , including six models .
They are Gas-cooled fast reactor , lead-cooled fast reactor , molten salt reactor , sodium-cooled fast reactor supercritical-water-cooled reactor and very-high-temperature reactor .
Among all kinds of nuclear reactors , very-high-temperature reactor is an advanced one and has a broad prospect .
It supplies heat with high core outlet temperatures , which enables applications such as hydrogen production or process heat for the petrochemical industry .
This allows for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity .
What's more , the recycling system is well-developed .
Given so many advantages of VHTR , we should devote more effort in promoting the reactor development .
However , some people may doubt the practicability of building such a high-efficiency nuclear reactor since it operates under such a high temperature .
Actually this should not be a worry .
Generation IV International Forum  , as the authority in nuclear power development , has shown the data which demonstrates that the basic technology for the VHTR has been well established in former High Temperature Gas Reactors plants .
Many prototypes are available as experience to develop VHTR .
Many national laboratory and vendors are very keen in the research of VHTR , such as: PBMR , GT-HTR300C , ANTARES , NHDD , GT-MHR and NGNP in South Africa , Japan , France , Republic of Korea and the United States .
Many of them have made significant breakthrough .
Hence , there is a great chance that VHTR will come to the world soon .
As the result of scary impressions left by two severe nuclear plants accidents in history , many people reject VHTR because of the security issue .
However , we should see the two accidents are both due to human factors rather than the reactors' own deflects .
What's more , many scientists have studied the operation security of VHTR , like Hu , S . , Liang , X . , Wei , L . He reported his research results in "{Commissioning and Operation experience and safety experiment at HTR-10}" , on the Third International Topical Meeting on High Temperature Reactor Technology in South Africa and put forwards some constructive suggestions to improve the security condition of high temperature reactors .
Considering all these inspiring achievements on VHTR , we should have confidence that we will build secure nuclear reactors which will avoid tragedies happening .
After all the above , we can see that we have many reasons to support the development and further research on VHTR .
It deserves all the effort , no matter in terms of security insurance or work efficiency .
In other words , VHTR has the promising potential to be the future energy supplier .
So now we should pay more attention on the developing progress and give more financial support .
And we should be optimistic that we can realize our dreamto build VHTR before 2020 and have abundant and clear energy .
Originated from the Ernest Rutherford's theory about atomic structure and Albert Einstein's well known mass-energy formula , the development of nuclear power has bypassed a glorious century and become one of the major electrical energy sources now  .
While amazed by the enormous energy generated by the tiny mass , people are also concerned about the negative perspectives of nuclear power .
Those against the development of nuclear power claim that it is safety threatening , costly in research and building plants , and not renewable  .
Nevertheless , with the gas-cooled fast reactors  concept in hand , further research and funding should be devoted to expanding nuclear power .
The major refutation to developing nuclear power is about its threat to the safety of the public since conventional nuclear power produces radioactive waste and has a possibility of nuclear power proliferation  .
However , safety issue would be less of a concern once the GFR concept is deployed .
GFR utilizes the waste reprocessing method , which minimizes the public's exposure to nuclear waste's radioactivity  .
Besides , the primary GFR core is loaded with transuranics from spent LWR fuel such that the plutonium created in waste reprocessing is diluted and consequently the proliferation resistance of the nuclear power plants is enhanced  .
Furthermore , GFR adopts a passive cool-down system that reduces human's intervention substantially and thus enhances the safety of nuclear power plants  .
People also argue that developing nuclear power technology and constructing nuclear power plants are too expensive and it is not worthwhile since other cleaner energy sources could be cheaper in the future  .
Nevertheless , analyses have been done with the result that plant capital cost can be reduced by up to 25% compared to the traditional Rankine cycle using the supercritical CO2 direct cycle  .
Moreover , besides electricity power , GFR concept plants can also output hydrogen  .
Subsequently , it counterbalances its large cost to a great extent .
The Chernobyl incident on 26 April 1986 at Soviet Union was one of the most tragic catastrophes .
When the nuclear reactor exploded , tons of radioactive substances were released into the atmosphere .
The result was a contaminated food cycle and acute cancer-related illnesses .
Some of the damage reports done by scientists suggest that a minimal of 30000 deaths in 1986 are related to cancer arising from extreme exposure to the radiation .
To add on to the figures , the current death toll stands at a frightening 500000 .
According to Blackeye , the accident was primarily caused by a flawed Soviet designed reactor .
This reactor , named reactor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny was actually meant for producing nuclear weapons .
Design of the reactor was such that even when the rate of cooling of the reactor was insufficient to compensate the increase in temperature , it will still be operational .
In other reactor designs , either the plant or the reactors will be automatically shut down .
This tragic event could have been avoided , or at least , the resultant damage be kept minimal if psychology was implemented in the operating process and procedures of the plant .
The use of psychology could have minimized the damage or even prevented the accident by influencing the engineers to use a reactor that is safer and has a negative void coefficient .
This is because should things turn out not be as expected , thousands or even millions of people could be affected .
Also , the people working in the power station should not be placed under danger
Next , in order to make the power plant as profitable as possible , use of psychology was omitted .
Steps associated with safety were excluded from the daily routine .
Also , accident prevention system coverage was not extensive .
Companies running the plant would only see the extra steps mentioned above to be unnecessary .
If psychology was used , the accident would probably not have happened as the Soviet government would fund part of the maintenance cost so that the necessary steps to ensure a safe working environment could be implemented .
Hence , the accident could have been prevented .
With reference to the points mentioned above , it can be clearly seen that in today's context , where technology is getting more and more advanced , the consequences of a failure or breakdown in high-tech installations is devastating .
Applying the use of psychology in the engineering design processes may make it more costly and slow it down .
Nevertheless , when it comes to safety aspect , it definitely pays to add another step to the process and take precautions .
26 April 1986 marked the day when the lives of many in Ukraine changed forever .
Stemming from a simple experiment by engineers to test the cooling pump system when there is no power supply , the series of events that followed snowballed into the better known Chernobyl disaster .
At the end of it all , many were left dead and many more affected by the radioactive plume .
If the decisions by the engineers at duty in the plant were delivered with consideration , the Chernobyl disaster would not have tainted history .
Therefore the use of psychology in influencing engineers towards making proper decisions is a crucial one .
Psychology enhances understanding of design processes , helps foresee problems and as a result reduces problems too .
The opposition might argue on the cost and the need to implement psychology in an engineering design process but the imminent need to prevent accidents overpowers all opposition .
The use of psychology in design processes reduces problem by enabling an engineer to consider the pros and cons of his decision .
With psychology as a guiding tool , engineers are able to think of the possible fallbacks of their decisions .
Most design related problems are because of the difficulty people face in understanding the consequences of their actions  .
While opponents might argue on the impertinence of the use of psychology and its effectiveness in reducing problems , it is undeniable that the use of psychology makes all team members take meticulous care in implementing decisions and hence make the design process safer .
Furthermore , the use of psychology lubricates cohesiveness among team members making the working environment friendlier .
A friendly environment would mean opinions are effectively shared .
Stanton  remarked that the Chernobyl incident sparked due to the syndrome he terms as "groupthink" where small groups become unswerving in the face of an unfavorable situation .
With the use of psychology , members in the team are at greater ease in challenging a wrong decision and thus stalling an accident .
On the other hand , one could argue that the cost of hiring a psychologist is too high and cohesiveness can be easily achieved through games and interaction .
However , many of these people fail to consider the number of lives that are placed in jeopardy should the design process fail .
Therefore , the use of psychology and thus the need to hire a psychologist can be considered as an investment to prevent accidents .
The use of psychology would seek to improve engineering designs by preventing the human errors associated with the process .
A psychologist will seek to understand the mindsets of various members and thus foresee human error on their parts .
Shelton  discussed the impact of human error on even the simplest tasks .
With human error being the trigger to accidents  , it is very crucial to nip human error in the bud .
Opponents might suggest ergonomics instead .
They would challenge that the design process should be made to suit the engineer so that human error on man's part can be avoided .
This argument cannot hold mainly because human error is evident everywhere and changing the design process would only mean a new set of human errors .
Instead with the use of psychology aiding the sculpting of a safe design process  , we can prevent accidents .
In conclusion , the use of psychology plays a huge role in facilitating any design process and ensuring that mishaps are completely avoided .
In the case of the Chernobyl accident , if psychology was inculcated , the mistakes by the engineers could have been prevented .
Many lives could have been spared .
Many people would have been freed from the painful marks of the Chernobyl accident .
Even though many would argue on the prospects of using psychology in design processes , one can say that the use of psychology depicts an accident free future vividly .
As more engineers feel stressful from their high workload , psychologist plays an important role in their work .
Most engineers only care about how to apply technology into practice , but they seldom care about how to make products that can be used easily .
Designing products should considering psychological factors for consumers and operators .
An inadequate industrial design may lead catastrophic consequences .
Many people argue that psychology is non-related with engineering design; companies do not need to spend extra money on the unnecessary outcome .
But I consider psychology as the requisite factor for engineering work .
Human error has been recognized as the main reason for industry accidents; psychology can prevent human error happening . 
Some managers are against employing psychologists because they must spend extra money on psychologists' salaries .
If 3 psycholists serve the whole company , every psychologist can get 4000 Singapore dollars per month , and then three psychologists will get 144000 Singapore dollars from their company for one year .
The amount is a large outcome .
Three Mile Island accident was resulted by human error and design problems  .
The whole factory was in ruin , all the residents living in the villages that close to the Three Mile Island must move away .
It is much expensive then S$144000 , and thousands of lives were threatened .
People hold the opposite views insist that psychologists can help engineers release their high working pressures out of company .
They forget that counseling fee is very expensive; engineers usually do not look for psychologists by themselves .
The work efficiency is different when people work in different feelings .
People cannot have an active attitude when they are under high pressure .
Psychology can help them to have an active attitude and optimistic emotions to work .
The earth is facing an increase in global temperature , which is commonly known as global warming .
This is resulted from the emissions of greenhouse gas , such as carbon dioxide , in energy generation using fossil fuels .
Besides , with the rapid development of industry and huge increase of population , there are booming energy demands in every country .
As a result , there is an urgent need to find substitute for coal and oil .
Under such circumstances , scientists and engineers find out a new kind of energy-nuclear energy .
Nuclear power technology is expected to provide clean and sufficient energy in the future .
However , there is much debate over this technology .
Cost and security are the two main reasons for opposition to nuclear power technology in many countries .
Even with these two reasons , it is still necessary to provide funding for research on nuclear power .
Opponents of nuclear power technology argue over the security of such technology .
Many people worry about nuclear radiation and other serious accidents .
According to Butler  , partial reactor melted down in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , and of the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , during which the reactor core exploded , killing some 31 people immediately  .
However , nuclear reactor designers take security into account when they are designing and constructing a nuclear plant .
There are many internal and external facilities built to ensure secure operation .
Thus , current nuclear power plants are able to withstand accidents from various events based on design .
For example , in England , the controlling computers will shut down the reactor automatically if something abnormal happens .
Moreover , "Laws and statues exist in most countries to ensure the safe operation of nuclear plant"   .
Hence , security of nuclear energy generation can be guaranteed and it is no need to worry too much about security .
Another reason for opposition to nuclear power is the high cost of reactor construction .
It is very expensive to construct and maintain and run a nuclear power plant .
However , scientists and engineers are trying to simplify the reactors .
In generation IV , in supercritical-water-cooled reactor  , many parts can be cut from the design compared to previous light water reactor  , thus reducing construction cost .
According to Stephens  , the US spends $1 billion on FutureGen project which aims at development of carbon capture and storage technologies   .
In addition , the global warming effects may result in droughts which will reduce crop production and air pollution can result in acid rain which can corrode many properties .
The usage of nuclear power helps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas , slowing down global warming and purifying air which will in turn reduce the indirect cost of greenhouse gas .
Finally , funding should be provided for research on nuclear power technology .
Fossil fuel is depletable energy .
It is running out at a high speed .
Substitute must be found before fossil fuel is totally run out .
Nuclear energy is a good alternative .
Currently , nuclear industry is generating 17% of the world's electricity .
If technical hurdles involved in building the next generation of reactors can be solved by scientists and engineers , then we can get secure , inexpensive , and abundant energy .
It is very likely that in the near future , nuclear energy will be one of the main energy resources .
In conclusion , the opposition reasons of nuclear power technology can be overthrow .
The nuclear power technology can solve not only environmental problem caused by the combustion of fossil fuel , but also energy shortage at low cost and in environmental-friendly way .
In this situation , nuclear power deserves the research funding for further development .
Supercritical-water-cooled reactor is a nuclear reactor which uses supercritical-water , water at very high pressure , as coolant .
It functions in temperature ranging from approximately 500 to 650 degrees Celsius and at very high pressure .
Many skeptics oppose the idea of building nuclear reactors as they fear similar incident to that in Chernobyl might happen again .
However , I believe this is not very likely as supercritical-water-cooled reactor is designed differently to avoid such incident from reoccurring .
In addition , the benefits that a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could bring are worth further researching and funding in the supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
Many skeptics oppose the idea of building nuclear reactors due to worries of their safe operation .
One major nuclear incident was that in Chernobyl CITATION Dav04 \l 1033  .
This reactor back then work on a positive void coefficient of reactivity .
Therefore , when the control rods went wrong , the reactor entered a series of positive feedbacks and was unable to stop the reactivity of the nuclear reactor .
This resulted in continuous rise in temperature which caused the carbon part of the nuclear core to catch fire due to the high heat within the reactor .
The fire and explosion from the reactors caused the widespread of nuclear substance into the air and hence a devastating nuclear incident .
However , the supercritical-water-cooled reactor works on a negative void coefficient which will reduce the reactivity of the reactors , should any problem arise .
The nuclear reactor would be shut down if the nuclear core was to malfunction or the cooling system was to leak , thereby halting all nuclear reactivity .
These will put the nuclear reactivity under control .
Therefore the worries of the skeptics are unnecessary and further research and funding of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor should take place .
Secondly , skeptics argue that under high temperature and pressure , materials tend to deteriorate faster and become weak .
Therefore building a reactor to run under the conditions of a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could be dangerous .
I agree that under high temperature and pressure , materials generally tend to deteriorate faster and would have a lower lifespan .
However , the structure of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor is designed such that its pressure threshold rises with temperature .
CITATION Sat08 \l 1033  This makes the skeptics' worry redundant as the structure is designed to specifically operate under the high temperature and pressure .
Therefore , further research and funding in the supercritical-water-cooled reactor should take place .
Lastly , the benefits that a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could bring make it worth further researching and funding into the reactor .
The reactor is much more efficient than conventional light water reactors: the supercritical-water-cooled reactor has a thermal efficiency of 45% which is approximately one-third higher than that of conventional light water reactors CITATION Sat08 \l 1033  .
Furthermore , the supercritical-water-cooled reactor is just an improvement of the conventional water reactor , making it relatively cheap to build .
Also , nuclear power is not a source of carbon dioxide , a major greenhouse gas that causes global warming .
The high thermal efficiency and environmental friendly characteristic of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor make it attractive to build the reactor .
Therefore , there should be further research and funding into the building of supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
In conclusion , the skeptics' worries of safety are redundant with the current level of technology .
In addition , the high efficiency and environmental friendly characteristic of a supercritical-water-cooled reactor make it profitable , in the long run , to build .
Hence there should be further research and funding into the building of supercritical-water-cooled reactors to further improve on this new generation IV reactor concept .
Title: Should countries support further research and development funding for Very-High-Temperature Reactors ?
Opponents are also worried about the difficulty in controlling the temperature of the VHTR in the event of an accident .
Vivid in people's minds is the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania .
Opponents argue that the VHTR's very high operating temperature may lead to similar accidents due to reactor meltdown if it were to be built .
However , the opponents are probably unaware of the safety measures specially designed for the VHTR .
The core of the VHTR with multiple protection layers inside is able to withstand stresses at temperatures up to 1600  C without cracking .
Even in the case of core cracking down , there is also a backup system in place .
Heat can be conducted from the core through air-cooled panels so that the core can be cooled down in a few seconds .
Thus the VHTR will be a very safe prototype given it multiple protection layers and effective backup system .
TS
In addition , the VHTR is a highly efficient reactor .
TS Very high gas temperatures can be achieved  within the VHTR to separate hydrogen gas efficiently , thus it offers highly efficient electricity generation .
It can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared to conventional nuclear plants . 
In conclusion , the VHTR is highly feasible , safe and efficient .
Though the danger of nuclear reactors can never be completely avoided , the VHTR may offer the best solution to the increasingly sever energy shortage .
Therefore , countries should support further research and development funding for the very-high-temperature reactor .
The design and construction of building are regarded as the work of engineers and irrelevant with psychology .
However , people are likely to make mistakes in every aspect in life , including engineering processing .
Lots of accidents are caused by human factors rather than technical problems or financial liability .
Previous research finds that about 90 percent of engineering accidents are due to human errors .
Hence , psychology , a human science which studies human's mental processes and behaviors can help to decrease the mistakes caused by human factors .
To further explain it , psychology can be used to analysis the man-made reasons which causes errors , such as engineers' attitudes , habits and social ability .
After that we can obtain some strategies from the analysis and utilize them in the engineering processing to prevent accidents from happening .
In the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse , the design was modified halfway , which was thought as a small trivial by both the designers and the constructors .
They believed that the other have rechecked the details , while in fact nobody did before construction .
Therefore it can be expected that if psychology was involved during the construction , this tragedy caused by lack of responsibility would not occur at all !
To summarize , If psychology was involved in the building of Hyatt Regency walkway collapse , which was a practicable measure , this unfortunate accident would have been eliminate at the very beginning .
Nuclear power is a great discovery in human history .
Nowadays , nuclear technology is widely used as an extra resource for electric generators .
It is clean and stable .
Many people believe that nuclear power plant will take the place of our traditional electric generators in the future .
However , people don't realize that there will be many problems caused by using nuclear technology , in terms of environment , cost , and nature resources .
In twentieth century , the safety of using Uranium is still under the discussion .
There were a few accident happened during the Uranium's purification process and reaction process .
Our human's ability is limited .
We cannot say that we have fully control the nuclear reaction process , but it now can be controlled and react at a peaceful rate .
What our government is happy to hear is that , Uranium is still enough to support us for hundreds of years , although it is hard to be purified .
There were many Uranium mine exits underground .
Nuclear power plants first started in 1954 and proliferated rapidly due to its many advantages over conventional fossil-fuel plants .
Today , there are altogether 439 nuclear power reactors in operation throughout the world .
However in the 1970s , nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl stirred up a big controversy over nuclear power and practically halted the development of nuclear power in many countries  .
The argument is that the nuclear plants are a safety hazard to the country and is a probable target for terrorists .
In addition , environmental risks from nuclear waste and discovery of other renewable energy sources also contributed to the push for phasing out nuclear power which had lasted for several decades .
Lately , a number of new designs for nuclear power generation , known as Generation IV reactors , are the subject of active research and may lead to the revival of nuclear power in the future .
One such design is the SCWR which attempts to eliminate or reduce previously debated risks surrounding nuclear power .
While some may be skeptical on tapping nuclear power due to various issues , the new SCWR will alleviate their concerns if there is continual research and development funding for the design to materialize .
Critics believe that nuclear power is not safe as it poses a health risk to workers and the public due to low-level radiation from the plants .
They are also concerned that the new reactors will reenact the events leading to past disastrous nuclear accidents that had resulted in high fatality .
On the contrary , studies conducted by non-profit , neutral agencies have found no compelling evidence of a correlation between nuclear power and risk of cancer caused by exposure to high radiation level .
The studies done are based on comparing the number of cancer patients in the vicinity of nuclear power and non nuclear power settlements .
According to another report , nuclear power accidents have also caused fewer deaths than accidents related to other forms of energy .
Besides that , the SCWR is also integrated with passive simplified safety system that can eliminate boiling crisis instances common in nuclear accidents .
Hence , there is less reliance on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators .
Less dependence on human will equate to lower risks as human error was a significant factor in most nuclear accidents .
In the event of an unlikely emergency , extensive evacuation plan and protective actions will be carried out and coordinated between governments and power plant officials .
Opponents perceive costs and performance of nuclear reactors as inferior to conventional reactors .
It was pointed out that the costs of constructing a nuclear plant , decommissioning nuclear facilities and the costs of storing nuclear waste are expensive .
Materials needed for the plants are also either costly , rare or do not exist yet .
Moreover , much public subsidy funds and tax expenditures are consumed in nuclear research and development projects when they could be used to invest in alternative renewable energy technologies .
However , the SCWR will actually be economically viable .
Far simpler designs , with elimination of circulation pumps , pressurizers , steam generators , steam separators and dryers reduces its capital and building costs .
Additionally , the supercritical coolant has a high specific enthalpy and promises to deliver high thermal efficiencies of approximately 45% versus the current 33% of light water reactors .
Combination of higher operating temperature which increases power output and low fuel utilization translates to cheaper energy .
The SCWR estimates are at $900/kWe and  2 .9/kWh which can be considered to meet the economic and sustainability requirements .
So despite its high initial capital cost and operation , nuclear power is still competitive with fossil fuel for electricity generation .
If the social , health and environmental costs are also taken into account , nuclear power plants will be exceedingly outstanding compared to fossil-fueled plants .
Finally , experts speculated that increasing scarcity of oil will drive oil prices up to $100 and $150 per barrel in the future which will lead to an increase in energy prices for fossil-fueled power plants .
It is evident that in the long run , when energy cost for fossil-fueled plant increase continually , using nuclear power for electricity generation is much more economical .
To sum it all , SCWR can effectively meet the requirements of modern globalised world while addressing all the various concerns .
It is specifically designed to be very safe and free from accidents .
Newer technology helps to increase energy security as well as produces cleaner energy .
Many security enhancements will also be put in place to protect the plants from potential terrorist threats .
In fact , SCWR is considered to be proliferation resistant .
In addition , it is categorised as a more efficient and cheaper energy source than conventional power technologies .
SCWR could indeed replace prevalent fossil-fuel reactors by economical standards .
With continual R&D funding for development , SCWR will become a reliable and bountiful source of power in the future .
"Nuclear power is going to be an important part of our energy mix !"
declared President Obama's secretary of energy  .
To the mind of opponents of nuclear power , the construction of nuclear power plant will put Mother Earth under threat as nuclear accidents , such as the notorious Chernobyl in year 1986 , can cause massive destruction to the environment and more importantly , they are inevitable .
However , as the days go by , the number of opposition against nuclear energy is decreasing due to the advancements in technology and the realization of the need for alternative sources of power .
Out of the six Generation-IV  nuclear reactors that are introduced , the supercritical water-cooled reactor  appears to show the most potential to be the nuclear power plant for the next generation to come .
Not only is it safer and more cost efficient , it also yields the most consistent performance as compared to the other types of nuclear reactors .
As the name suggest , the coolant of the SCWR uses water , which is safer than other types of cooling agents .
This gives people a sense of security when SCWR is used .
However , advocates may argue that water in such nuclear reactor behaves differently due to the high pressurization required for it to reach a temperature of as high as 300 Degrees Celsius .
Comparatively , other types of coolant agent , such as sodium , react more actively in air and it may cause a massive explosion and a sudden discharge of radioactive particle in the air if leakage were to occur .
As such , water is the preferred option as a leakage will , at most , contaminate the water at the surrounding of the nuclear power plant and such an occurrence will only pose limited damage to our environment .
Moreover , SCWR is a modification of the proven light water reactor technology , which is operating extensively in the world currently  .
With the absence of any major accidents involving these nuclear reactors , we can safely conclude that the usage of SCWR is more secured than the new concepts of power plants , for which their technology is yet to be fully enhanced .
The cost of electricity generated is another factor that will be of immense concern to the public .
It will be unrealistic if one has to pay a lot more for every kilowatt of electricity used .
Ideally , SCWR uses water which is available at a very low cost , as compared to lead and helium .
Nevertheless , critics will point to the unavailability of technology to develop materials , such as the corrosive-resistant core structure that will be able to withstand SCWR conditions  , resulting in the large amount of investments required to be pumped into the research of such materials .
The cost of implementation of the SCWR may then seem to be too steep .
In spite of this argument , the capital cost of electricity generated from the SCWR will be lower in the long run , due to the simplicity its structure that will make up for the high initial building cost  .
This can be backed up from the fact that most nuclear power plants can operate beyond their typical design lifespan of 30-40 years with proper maintenance and the gradual improvement of technology  .
Consequently , it will be wise to choose the SCWR ahead of the other Gen-IV reactors if it comes to producing low cost power for the future .
Looking at the rate of performance of the SCWR , it is incomparable to the other Gen-IV reactors .
Due to the low temperature where the SCWR process lies , the amount of output power will be at a slight disadvantage over the other forms of Gen-IV reactors .
Furthermore , SCWR produces only electricity as compared to lead-cooled fast reactors which produce both electricity and hydrogen power  .
Nonetheless , the inferiority in the rate of performance of the SCWR should not be a discouraging factor to its construction .
Instead , the reliability of the Gen-IV reactors should be the utmost concern while their performance rate should only be the secondary consideration .
If the reactors can operate safely without serious incidents of malfunctioning , which are more likely in the case of SCWR , a continuous supply of power can then be generated without disrupting the lives of the public .
This is evident from the fact that SCWR is a simpler plant , in terms of its design and structure as compared to other types of reactors  .
Otherwise , there will be a shortage of power supply for months in an event of a breakdown; these nuclear reactors will prove to be a liability , rather than a power generation asset to the public during these periods .
As such , the consistent performance of the SCWR will be a crucial factor that allows it to stand out among the other Gen-IV reactors .
In conclusion , the SCWR is the most ideal candidate for the next generation of nuclear power reactor .
Besides being dependable for its continuous supply of power , it is also the cheapest and the safest alternative among all choices .
As we move away from our dependency on the combustion of coals for energy , we must , at the same time , ensure that the alternative source will be able to perform as well .
In the meantime , this is impossible but at the rate which environmental organizations are progressing , I envision the day where we have zero dependence on coal for energy and SCWR takes its place at full speed !
The soundtrack , My Heart Will Go On sung by Celine Dion , was the theme song for the Oscar winning mega blockbuster movie , Titanic .
The movie was based on a true story whereby the ship named , Titanic , collided with an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage .
Eventually , it became one the worst maritime accident that occurred during peacetime .
Being the largest , most luxurious and technologically advanced liner of her time  , the Titanic clearly enjoyed the prestige .
However , her downfall was partly due to human error .
Since then , more attention had been given to the area of human psychology in relation to engineering design process .
In view of this , I believe that this is the appropriate direction we should adopt to prevent major accidents from happening .
According to Jones , some experts believe that technology is increasing equipment reliability and at the same time , reducing human reliability  .
As such , many critics tend to argue that the role for psychology in engineering design is insignificant .
It is true that technology is able to perform complex and multiple functions at the shortest possible time with precise readings .
However , we often fail to realize that it is actually we , humans who create and manage technology .
Since we do make mistakes and assumptions , we cannot simply assume that all technologies are perfect .
Not surprisingly , many detractors suggest that the main reason why Titanic sank was due to the fact that the terrain at which Titanic was sailing was poor .
During the night before the collision , the ocean was icy cold and was filled with icebergs .
This made navigation difficult .
There were more icebergs in the North Atlantic that year than it had been for fifty years  .
While it is true that we cannot control the climate to suit our needs , we can always suit the environment by taking a proactive stance in contingency planning .
By taking a proactive stance in planning , we can identify our main priorities and set goals achieving it in view of possible setback .
In conclusion , we cannot deny that the fact that psychology had an impact in the way we process and manage technology .
So long as there is a human factor in the engineering process , the use of psychology is inevitable .
In fact as we rely more on technology , we place more responsibilities on the few individuals who manage it .
In addition , we need to pay more attention to the way we place our priorities .
When we set wrong priorities , we head in the wrong direction despite having the best technology available .
After all , technology only assists us in achieving our material goals but when it comes to psychology , it has no part to play .
Sophistication , this term has made quite an impact in the lives of people all over the globe .
Technical advancement and uplift in standards of live has resulted ultimately in the rapid consumption of natural resources .
So viewing the present situation in this ominous light , the ultimate solution we get to think of is to find new means to sustain the exploding population .
Electric power is as important to the people now as how food clothing and shelter is .
How do we meet the power needs of the growing world with this limited power sources we have ?
The solution is offered by the Generaton IV nuclear power plants .
The Generation IV concepts offer a lucrative solution to the power issue through their very high efficiency in conversion of thermal energy to electricity when compared to their Generation 3 counterparts .
They also offer security in event of an onsite emergency which assures us of the non repeatal of another Chernobyl incident and wins our support .
There are several Generation IV nuclear power plant concepts which can be incorporated .
What we must remember is that we do not have the luxury of time to sit and research each and every concept as time is critical .
Our resources are fast dying and if we have to take some radical steps now .
The safety features of SCWR are passive , they don't need human instructions in case of an onsite emergency .
The main concept of the safety features is that when there is an emergency , depressurization of the plant takes place , i . e the pressure inside the plant decreases .
However if there is a large break in the feed water lines , the heating of fuel will be rapid and this will result in an emergency .
Though the passive safety features will take over  ,the plant will be non operational .
The GFR has a similar passive safety feature .
It has few elements added in it which shuts down system during an onsite emergency .Besides this the plant is made up of materials which can withstand very high temperature .
So there won't be any calamities possible .
And it also doesn't lead to problems of plutonium fuel as it serves as an incinerator which burns away the wastes .
.
Thus on the whole if we compare the two models on the basis of these three very important criteria , we find it very clearly that the GFR has an edge over that of the SCWR and hence it should be pursued for research and not SCWR .

The nuclear power models are chosen and approved by the IAEA  based on the aspects of its cost , security and performance .
Two popular models under debate are Gas Cooled Fast Reactor and Super critical water reactor .
I prefer the GFR over SCWR for many reasons which we will justify in this essay .
Performance
On the basis of performance the SCWR has a net thermal efficiency of 45%  .
It is a simplified model of the light water reactor which is very efficient in providing electricity  .
It has both open and closed fuel cycle models which can be incorporated .
In addition to this it can also be suited to provide hydrogen upon further modifications .
2 .COST
3 .SECURITY
In recent years , there have been unremitting arguments on whether developing countries should proceed with building generation IV reactors .
For a developing country where economy is rather unstable , people are facing poverty and high unemployment thus it is vital for the country to solve these problems before handling other issues like developing power reactors .
For example in Afghanistan , according to statistics , the unemployment rate is estimated to be as high as 40% in 2008  .
Even though it is known that developing generation IV reactors will benefit the country significantly , we cannot neglect the unconstructive effects that come simultaneously .
Therefore , developing countries need to solve unemployment and poverty in rural areas first , before they provide huge funding to build generation IV reactors .
Oppositions maintain that with the developing power reactors would enable the public to benefit from low-priced electricity that can build more factories which will eventually help to create jobs for the people as well as improve poverty .
However , this claim only takes into consideration the operation cost in the long run and does not take into account for the high set up cost estimated in 2009 to be around 10 billion dollars for just one reactor  .
The maintenance cost , money required for storage of waste was investigated to be about 13 .
3 billion today  and money to conduct continuous research and development  to be estimated around 1 .275 billion dollars  .
This large sum of money would ultimately be the main reason that might lead to the termination of the development since developing countries with an unstable economy will find it too costly to provide such a huge fund in the long run  .
This will then lead us back to our issue where poverty and unemployment remain unsolved and the huge sum that goes to developing the power reactor has also gone to waste .
Thus , developing countries should strengthen its economy by solving the problem for unemployment and poverty first before the developing of power reactors .
Apart from the above points , it is mentioned by the opponents that by developing power reactors , many job opportunities will be created for the people since they need labour force to run the plant .
However , it is important to know that the labour force that is required by plants is a highly skilled workforce  .
Examples of such positions are nuclear technicians , radiologic technicians , researchers , monitoring technicians and reactor operators .
These roles demand knowledge on physics , mathematics , chemistry , public safety and security .
In developing countries , there will not be sufficient talented labours to support the development since most of the people are not equipped with such skills  .
In due course , developing countries will need to hire foreign talent to take up those professions .
In the end , the locals will still suffer from poverty and remain unemployed while foreign talent will have numerous jobs to choose from .
In addition , power reactor plants are dealing with very-high-temperature reactors , some of the reactors like Gas-cooled fast reactors and Supercritical-water-cooled reactors even need high pressure to operate .
Furthermore , to prevent radioactive waste from being stolen for the creation of nuclear weapon , scientists are going to modify radioactive elements in such a way that they will be too hot for human beings to handle even with the use of gloves   .
Under such conditions where the high temperature is not a suitable work environment , the plants must involve highly automated machineries in order for the operations to be carried out .
In order words , the plant only creates a handful of employment opportunities for the people given that the plant is functioning automatically .
Hence , by developing power reactors in developing countries , only limited jobs will be created for the local people .
Nuclear power involves the energy generated from the splitting of atoms , also known as nuclear fission .
The reason why the public reject the idea of nuclear power could be due to the Chernobyl power plant meltdown , one of the most tragic nuclear-related disaster in human history .
The ramification of the Chernobyl incident is so severe to the extent where it reminds everyone of death when nuclear power is mentioned .
We cannot prevent the public from having their biased and negative perspective on nuclear power but we cannot deny the fact that the Chernobyl disaster is a result of poor management and design of the power plant ) .
Although the public oppose nuclear power due to its dangerous drawbacks on the world and its environment , it is crucial to support and fund further research and development for Very High Temperature Reactors  .
The public feel that nuclear proliferation is imminent and fear the danger of excessive nuclear waste .
In other words , every nuclear plant is like a potential nuclear bomb and terrorist's attacks are inevitable .
However , such claims would be deemed invalid in the context of a VHTR .
Among the proposed Generation IV nuclear plants , VHTR is one of the few which does not reprocess the resultant nuclear waste .
Reprocessing involves the separation of uranium and weapon-grade plutonium from radioactive waste which sums up the fear of plutonium war .
Therefore , VHTR is proliferation-proof as it does not reprocess nuclear waste .
Furthermore , VHTR produces lesser amount of radioactive waste compared to other proposed reactors .
Shropshire and Herring  claim that the heavy metal radioactive waste produced in VHTR is significantly low with every unit of energy generated and this is due to the plant's high thermal efficiency and high fuel burn up .
It implies that the total plutonium generated is lesser per unit of energy produced .
Waste treatment plans are also in place to tackle the lingering problem of long-live radioactive waste .
For instance , in the liquid state treatment , the by-products are constantly evaporated to reduce its radioactivity  .
As for the remaining nuclear waste , it is stored in underground repository where multilayers of anti-radiation materials are installed to shield them from the external environment .
It may be true that nuclear power , akin to fossil fuel , is a non-renewable resource .
Naturally , the public would argue that it is not worth the funding and time to develop something which does not offer a long term solution .
Though , from a general point of view , it is possible to recycle nuclear fuel but it is not ideal as reprocessing is costly and generates the dreaded plutonium .
Langwith states that uranium in Canada can only last for 40 years .
The projected time span definitely does not appeal to what the public see as long term , however , it is shallow to predict the outcome to be the same as fossil fuel power plants .
Furthermore , Canada's participation in the Generation IV International Forum  to perform further research on nuclear power , particularly VHTR ) , shows that they do not share the public's myopic view on the potential of nuclear power .
In addition , VHTR offers an alternate clean fuel , hydrogen .
At 1100 degree Celsius , hydrogen production efficiency is at 50 percent compared to electrical generation efficiency at 56 percent VHTR  .
There is plenty of radioactive material on earth to run nuclear power for a long time just like how we operate coal power plants .
The difference is that it extents the time needed to find more sources of electricity , probably nuclear fusion .
Opponents may claim that nuclear power plants are incapable of making significant changes to the climate and will even appear as environmental risk .
Nonetheless , VHTR are almost emission free as nuclear power contributes the biggest portion of the world's electricity from non-greenhouse gas emitting sources  .
Consequently , the alternate fuel source generated is also emission free .
30 percent of the world primary fuel use is to generate electricity and 17 percent of electricity uses nuclear power  .
In other words , VHTR reduces the general demand for fossil fuels .
Robinson  also mentioned that the amount of electricity generated by one ton of uranium is similar to that produced by 16 ,000 tons of coal or 80 ,000 barrels of oil .
The amount of waste produced by fossil fuel plants is significantly higher than that of VHTR .
further state that the dominant VHTR has a better plant efficiency which indirectly implies that it requires 20 percent fewer tunnels to store its waste .
Hence , the resultant land pollution caused by VHTR will be milder in contrast with that of coal power
The public opinions on nuclear power are inconclusive .
The advantages of VHTR clearly outweigh the cons of nuclear power .
They directly neutralize the fears of nuclear proliferation due to its once-through uranium fuel cycle .
Moreover , it offers non-electrical fuel source , hydrogen , which prolongs the time needed to develop another source .
As for the environment aspect , VHTR is ultimately emission free and it causes milder land pollution compared to coal power plants .
Therefore , in my opinion , it is justified to support further research and development funding for VHTR .
The development of nuclear power plant becomes more and more important as nuclear power is a more efficient and environmental friendly source of energy .
From 1951 , when the first nuclear power plant generated electricity , the technology of nuclear power has become more efficient and safety .
The Very-High-Temperature Reactor  is one of the most recent prototypes of the generation IV reactors .
VHTR is a graphite-moderated , helium-cooled reactor with a once-through uranium fuel cycle .
It supplies heat with high core outlet temperatures  which enables applications such as hydrogen production or process heat for the petrochemical industry or others .
Further research and development funding for VHTR should be supported by the governments or companies , because it is an efficient , secure and practicable technology , despite the worries raised by the oppositions .
Many people consider nuclear power industry is highly dangerous since the radioactive fuels can be very harmful to our bodies and environment .
According to a survey conducted in Australia in 2009 on the public opinions of building nuclear power plants in Australia , there were 43 percent of the public opposing the plan because of the safety and security issues with nuclear power plants .
However , nuclear power reactors are much safer and securer than most of people can image even when the reactive temperature is very high .
Firstly , in VHTR , the fuel used is uranium dioxide in a TRISO configuration , where TRISO is the type of fuel that small amount of uranium dioxide is in the center and coated with four layers of three isotropic materials  .
The TRISO particles are either dispersed in a pebble for the pebble bed design or molded into the hexagonal graphite blocks .
Such designs are able to slow down neutrons to control the nuclear chain reaction , thus the reactivity can be controlled in a reasonable range and explosions can be prevented .
Secondly , because helium is used as coolant of VHTR , unexpected reactions can be prevented .
One reason is that helium is an inert gas , which is hardly reacts with any material .
Additionally , exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive , unlike most other possible coolants , for example light water , therefore it is a safer choice of coolant .
Moreover , since the reactor can only operate under a high temperature , in case of destructions by terrorism or other outside forces , the system will cool down and automatically stop the reaction .
This function ensures VHTR is very safe under attacks .
Therefore , VHTR is a very safe and secure prototype of the generation IV reactor .
Other than the safety issue , the efficiency of VHTR is also a concern for those who want to invest in the project .
A Molten salt reactor can burn 99% of initial fuel , while VHTR can burn 65% of its initial fuel , which is less than that of a molten salt reactor .
However , VHTR is very efficient comparing with the conventional light-water reactor , which can only burn-up 5% of the initial amount  .
VHTR is not only able to produce electrical power but also produce hydrogen via electrolysis of water at high temperature .
Besides generating energy , the energy generated from nuclear reaction can also be used in crude oil refining or metal production  .
In this sense , VHTR is efficient in using of energy .
Comparing to a molten salt reactor , VHTR has a simpler design and this leads to another advantage which is its high feasibility .
In conclusion , VHTR should be chosen to proceed on for further research and development .
This is because of its relative high efficiency , high safety and practicability .
There are many researches undergoing in U .S . , China and Japan to improve the Very-High-Temperature Reactors .
Optimistically , by about 2020 , the first commercial VHTR would be in operation .
Generation IV nuclear reactorshave drawn many controversies since they were introduced in the Generation IV International Forum in 2000 .
This arises public concern , due to the previous nuclear accidents which happened at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl , in 1979 and 1986 separately .
In theory , Generation IV reactors are a set of theoretical reactors which are still being under research to replace Generation III reactors , which are in use for power generation currently .
In comparison with current nuclear plant technology , Generation IV nuclear technology brings us more benefits , according to the researchers .
To point out a few of them , the claimed benefits include minimised nuclear waste and improved safety .
With this , we can reduce nuclear waste as it accumulates when we generate nuclear electricity .
In addition to that , the experts from laboratory also claimed that Generation IV reactors are able to consume nuclear waste to generate more electricity .
However , they are just theories with no solid evidence to support them .
To focus the research on Generation IV technology , we have narrowed down into two reactors , which are lead-cooled fast reactor and sodium cooled fast reactor .
According to the data I have collected , I think sodium-cooled reactor would be a better choice than lead-cooled fast reactor .
Fromsafety perspective , lead-cooled reactor has low likelihood of damage .
This is due to the characteristic of lead as a good heat transfer medium with high specific heat and thermal expansion coefficient .
Moreover , lead makes the operation reliable as it possesses good fuel compatibility and fission product retention .
This is a vital safety feature together with the ability of lead to retain released fission products that enables us to avoid offsite emergency .
On the other hand , sodium-cooled reactor strengthens its safety with long thermal response time and large margin to coolant boiling .
Sodium-cooled reactor focuses its safety in its primary system and intermediate system which operate near atmospheric pressure .
Given the fact that the two reactors focus on different aspect on safety , where the latter focuses on system operation rather than coolant , it is difficult to gauge the effectiveness of their practice based on theories .
Thus , it is inconsistent to compare when we are talking on safety issue .
However , lead has a tendency for material corrosion at high temperature .
Thus , sodium-cooled reactor is a better choice as it has less dependence on the coolant itself .
In term of performance , lead-cooled reactor has high sustainability .
The mentioned reactor has high sustainability due to its coolant , lead which is a low moderating medium as well as a medium with low absorption cross section that enable a core with fast neutron spectrum even with a large coolant fraction .
To compare the performance of the two clearly , we will have a look at the burn-up performance .
For sodium fast reactor , it has a tight pin structure , which in turn offers better neutron economy than lead-cooled reactor .
As a result , when both reactors operate to acquire criticality , the average plutonium fraction in the lead-cooled reactor core is slightly higher than sodium-cooled reactor .
This can clearly show the better performer .
After safety and performance issue , production cost of the reactor plays an equally important role in deciding which reactor to put in use .
From the researchers of lead-cooled reactor , we can clearly see the economics side of the reactor .
As being claimed , the life cycle cost of lead-cooled reactor is relatively cheaper than any other reactor .
This claim is based on the fact that lead is not reactive with water and air .
As an addition point , lead is inexpensive , in theory .
As a matter of fact , sodium ranked sixth as the most abundance material on earth .
.
If we take in the consideration of the supply and demand theories , lead will be more costly as the demand soars , just like what happened to the crude oil .
In contrast , sodium which is more abundant will experience less effect on its price when the demand soars .
Furthermore , sodium-cooled reactor benefits from the researches which were done earlier .
So there can be a big difference in research cost when compared to lead-cooled reactor .
Plus , the earliest delivery of sodium-cooled reactor is 10 years earlier than lead-cooled reactor .
.
Thus , sodium-cooled reactor is better from economic aspect .
From the evidence I have collected , I have come to a conclusion that sodium-cooled reactor is a better choice than lead-cooled reactor as it outperforms the latter in three aspects , which are safety , performance and cost .
Have you ever imagined that communication is possible with a virtual character from your television screen ?
Microsoft is now spearing project Natal , which is involves a controller-free gaming interface , Microsoft Xbox  .
The current game consoles require users to use controllers as their interface to the virtual world .
User's expressions and desires are somewhat restricted by the buttons on the controller .
Thus , the enjoyment factor is somehow limited by the controller .
If project Natal succeeds , gamers will be able to fully indulge in their will and emotions and send this information via the motion detector and video camera into the game console .
This is a concept that is still in research and has yet to be be seen in the market .
A similar product , Wii , is currently in the market .
Although it is less tech-savvy than Natal , but the safety issues it faces might be quite similar in nature .
Let us evaluate some of the safety issues below .
Cracked television screens , broken vases , cuts and bruise are some of the symptoms experienced by an avid or amateur Wii gamer .
This game console uses an external wireless remote control that senses the motion of the user .
Thus , when the players are too engrossed and when their adrenalin runs , they might try to move their limbs and body more aggressively .
In this situation , they might be caught off guard when their controller flies out of their grip , which might cause a cracked television screen , or injure people who are in the vicinity .
One such example can be seen from Kar Hoe  .
Thus , gamers risk a certain amount of injury when they are too focused on the game .
As playing a game with Natal will seem so real , we could expect more serious injuries occurring compared to injuries resulting from playing Wii .
Some gamers involving in a combat with a virtual opponent might accidentally throw his punches into the television screen , resulting in his fist being trapped within .
This injury is more serious than one arising from playing Wii .
The designers could make it safer by adding a barrier between the screen and the player .
The player could also be demanded by the system to wear safety boxing gloves , and limb guards .
However , some game activists might argue that it results in Natal losing its true entertainment value that it is first set to achieve .
Wearing such cumbersome equipment makes playing games using Natal a turn off .
In addition , it will add a substantial amount of cost to the already expensive-to-manufacture console , as the equipment might have to scan for motion further a distance away due to its exaggerated setup .
As quoted by Oli Welsh  , " . . . it to be quite expensive to begin with ."
Hence , this idea of improving safety might not be feasible as it is going to be costly and its entertainment value will be affected .
Natal gamers might also suffer similar cases of "Nintendonitis" , muscle injuries owing to excessive playing hours of spent on Sony's Nintendo Wii , Thaindian News  .
Gamers might have to jump , kick , dance , or perform some repetitive movement during the course of the game .
Injuries as stated above might arise when their muscles gets overused .
Furthermore , the player might be prone to more injuries , such as falling and twisting his ankle , when he starts to feel lethargic .
To enhance safety , Natal could use its motion detection system to analyse whether the movement of the player is alright or he should take a rest , and then sends out the respective warning to the player .
This could also help to prevent gamers who are glued to the game to realise that they have played too much .
It has happened before that gamers dies after several hours of continuous gaming .
There are reports showing teenagers' death from brain stroke after hours of continuous gaming .
One such example is elaborated in a report by Pravda .R  , where a teenager in the Russian city of Ekaterinburg died after 12 hours of playing computer games .
Thus by using such gizmo , such occurrence of death could be reduced .
We can conclude that Natal is actually a double-edged sword .
It may allow us to have reality in the virtual paradise , increasing our degree of satisfaction when we can fully indulge into the playing of our favourite games , but when we get too carried away , it might cause injuries or death .
Safety can be slightly improved through software tweaking , advising the user to take a rest or stop the activity when he seems unfit by the analysis of the console .
However , large scale setup of barriers and tuxedos lookalike safety suit might not be feasible as they increases the cost significantly and limits its actual functionality .
Therefore the bottom line is safety only can be slightly enhanced by an improved design and itt depends more on the self discipline of the gamers .
Perhaps safety can be enhanced by making it mandatory for gamers to attend a safety course .
Nuclear power is not a new technology to the human race .
It has been around since the 1960s , but it is not the main choice for producing energy because society has rejected it for its low security and high cost .
Although public opposition still exist , with the new generation IV reactors , public support for further research and development of higher security and lower cost plants are increasing .
Some upcoming plants are the lead-cooled fast reactor for example , which produces both electricity and hydrogen as its products .
Oppositions of nuclear power claim that the meltdown of the plant is one major reason why it should not exist .
Their concern would be the safety of the public in case of a nuclear meltdown .
This is an issue especially for small countries like Singapore , which stretches about 40 km from east to west , as international safety standards require a 30km buffer zone around the plant  .
However , this does not present a very good argument as looking at statistics over the years , the number of people affected by past major nuclear disasters , only number about an estimated 600 ,000 people  .
Compared to an estimate of 1 .2 million deaths yearly due to traffic accidents  , the nuclear casualties are relatively minor .
Besides this , with technological advancement , nuclear plants now enforce multiple fail-safe systems coupled with simplistic designs so lesser things could go wrong  .
Hence , with a more efficient safety system , there is no need to be afraid of disasters from happening .
Oppositions also claim that there is an ever present threat of terrorism .
For example , terrorists could steal nuclear material out of nuclear plants as easy as in the case when a thief broke into a shipyard in Russia and stole a container of nuclear submarine fuel  .
With this nuclear material , terrorist can create what are known as "Dirty" bombs , and make threats to the public .

However , this argument ignores the fact that terrorism will be around regardless of whether nuclear plants are built or not .
Even without nuclear materials , terrorists have enough technology and materials to create their own "Dirty" bombs .
Also , this emphasizes the need for a better security system and therefore supports the fact that more funds should be used for this development .
With multiple security features to prevent thefts , then there is no need to be afraid of radioactive materials being stolen .
Terrorist can only take advantage of our complacency , as in the case of the September 911 attacks .
With a well implemented security system , terrorist have no chance of infiltrating the plant .
The final argument that oppositions claim is that the cost to society is very huge .
Building one nuclear plant would cost around US $ 2 .6 billion  .
This high cost would be a heavy burden on society and might affect the budgeting for other sectors like the health care system as well .
However this is a short term view of the situation .
Uranium has more than 10 ,000 times the energy potential than fossil fuels and thus it is cheaper to use uranium for the production of energy  .
In the long run , the high start up cost is covered by the savings made from the reduced cost of energy .
Many countries that depend on oil are also placing hopes on hydrogen as the new generation fuel for cars and perhaps home use  .
With hydrogen produced as the secondary product for the lead-cooled fast reactor , one can only expect energy prices to drop further as there is now an abundance of energy sources .
Hence , we would save more than what we would have initially spent on the building of the nuclear plant over time .
Looking at all the arguments that oppositions have made against nuclear power , it can be seen that most are trivial and short termed .
With better technology , one can only expect the research and development to increase in cost .
In the long term view , society will benefit from the research and development of nuclear power .
The advancement in technology will allow nuclear energy to be harnessed with increased safety and efficiently .
Also , more jobs would be created which in turn would aid the country's economy .
Terrorism , safety or high costs are the factors we should base our research on and not be the reasons why we should not further develop nuclear power .
So in my opinion , funds should be injected into further research and development of nuclear power , to create a new generation of cleaner , safer and cheaper power to solve the looming energy crisis .

The world today depends heavily on fossil fuel to generate energy .
However , the burning of fossil fuels produce greenhouse gases which contribute to the effect of global warming .
In addition , experts have estimated that the remaining fuel reserve can only last a maximum of another 120 years  .
With energy demand worldwide projected to increase by 44% in 2030  and the worsening effect of global warming , researchers have proposed the concept of nuclear power .
Despite the benefits promised by Generation IV nuclear reactors , it still requires much effort to convince the public to accept this technology .
This is partly due to the negative memories from the 1986 reactor core explosion at Chernobyl in Ukraine , which resulted in the instant death of 31 people and radioactive debris spewed across Europe  .
Yet , further research and development funding for the Generation IV nuclear prototypes , in particular the very-high-temperature reactor  which is safer and can output greater electricity , should be supported .
Furthermore , economic viability and stability of nuclear power generation is challenged by adversary .
They maintained that compared to coal or oil generators , building and operating nuclear facilities are more expensive and worried that the cost might be passed down to consumers eventually .
The construction and operation cost might be high , but this is so in order not to compromise the quality and safety of the plants .
With countries planning to impose carbon taxes on carbon dioxide emissions , producing electricity from coal or oil combustion might not remain cheap forever .
The depletion of oil supply and increasing difficulty in finding new oil reserves will also further increase the cost of electricity generated from coal or oil .
In contrast , nuclear energy might prove to be more reliable as uranium , the raw material for nuclear fuel , can be supplied by politically stable countries like Australia  and can last for more than 2500 years when used with more efficient reactors  .
Indeed , experts have concluded that the nuclear energy will be competitive enough when the price of oil rises above USS60 per barrel  .
Finally , an argument advanced by anti-nuclear advocators is that although nuclear reaction does not produce greenhouse gases , harmful radioactive waste that must be stored for as long as a thousand years are generated instead .
Despite so , proponents assured that with proper storage and appropriate protection measures , the nuclear waste should not pose any health risk to the public .
In addition , most nuclear wastes are only hazardous for a few tens of years .
High-level waste , the most dangerous of all nuclear waste , are secured tightly in glass or ceramic before being isolated in storage facilities .
The structure of the glass and ceramic is so rigid that the dispersion of radioactive waste by terrorist will be difficult  .
The fact that no solution for disposal of nuclear waste also suggests that there is a need to continue funding further research in nuclear technologies .
In conclusion , it is undeniable that nuclear power is costly .
However , it might be economically viable with cost of fossil fuel expected to increase .
The safety concerns of nuclear plant are also addressed in the design of new nuclear reactors .
The radioactive wastes produced might not necessarily incur health hazard if they are properly stored .
Therefore , nuclear power is a trustworthy technology whose further research and development funding should be supported .
As technology continues to advance at an ever increasing rate , energy is also being consumed at a rapid pace .
Oil is still the main source of energy that drives the economy despite its ill effects on the environment .
Furthermore , it is projected to be depleted in fifty years time .
Therefore , the global issue of today has to do with clean and sustainable energy .
The six Generation IV nuclear reactors that are currently being researched under the supervision of the Generation IV International Forum  are the answers to this very problem .
As of now , the Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor  and the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor  are looking very promising and will likely to be the main choice of nuclear power plant in the near future .
However , further comparison of both the reactors base on cost , performance and safety actually revealed  as the better option .
5 Hejzlar , P . et al  Cross-comparison of fast reactor concepts with various coolants .
Nuclear Engineering and Design .
Regarding performance aspect of the reactors , studies often argued that SFR with multiple reheat and inter-cooling can allow the operating temperature to reach to 650 degree Celsius while having thermal efficiencies of between 39% and 47%  .3 However , as the result of higher operating temperature of  , it is definitely able to convert electricity more efficiently as compared to the former  .4
Furthermore ,  produces hydrogen as part of its processes which  does not .
If fact hydrogen is also an alternate form of clean and efficient energy .
Ultimately , if we are talking about performance based on the total power output of the plant ,  definitely have an edge over  , which operates at lower temperature and does not produce hydrogen as part of its process .
Safety plays an important role in deciding whether a reactor will be chosen over of its rival .
in this sense has vast amount of operation experience under its belt .
In fact , Sodium as a coolant in a nuclear reactor has actually been around for quite sometimes .
This is the reason why many believe that  should be considerably safe and measures must have been in place to prevent any accident .
However , in terms of chemistry property , sodium itself is a very reactive and any leakage during an accident will put the plant operators at risk .
Lead on the other hand has a lower burn-up  .
In the event of an accident , the damage to the whole plant will be considerably lesser .
Furthermore , lead superior neutronic properties and its small coolant temperature reactivity coefficient means that it could be easily controlled when there is an accident  .5 For example , in the event of an accident , the natural circulation in  is enough to take away the nominal power of the system .
However in the case for  , the lack of natural circulation means that the reactivity of the coolant will increase , leading to a possible meltdown of the reactor  .
In conclusion , based on the three most important consideration of a Generation IV reactor , it is clear that Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor is far more superior to to Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor .
Despite the fact that  is slated to be delivered earliest by the year 2015 , more research needs to be done to proof that  is indeed better than  .
However , it would be more logical to channel more resources to the research of  so that it could be delivered earlier .
In addition , the production of hydrogen as a by-product is indeed very attractive for tomorrow's energy market .
The original lead-bismuth proposed for use in the  will also be replaced by lead , further decreasing the cost of the coolant by 10 times  .
Therefore , Lead-Cooled Fast reactor is the obvious choice .

Global warming and energy shortage are two of the most discussed topics nowadays .
We are earnestly looking for solutions to these problems , and nuclear energy , has been proposed as a solution to solve these two problems at one go .
The production of nuclear energy does not have carbon dioxide as a by-product , thus it can reduce the effect of global warming , which is the reason of many other problems , like rising of sea levels .
Nuclear energy can also satisfy the increasing demand of energy , thus solving the problem of energy shortage .
However , choosing nuclear energy as an alternative here has many drawbacks in the areas of cleanliness , safety and cost , this can also be reflected in the very-high-temperature reactors .
Hence , I do not support the building of new nuclear plants and use of nuclear energy .
Some people argue that nuclear energy should be used as it is a cleaner source of energy compared to coal and fossil fuels .
It is true to some extent as no carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are produced during the production of energy through nuclear power .
Nevertheless , we should not neglect the unique wasted which can be produced by nuclear power plants alone during its energy production process .
This refers to nuclear wastes .
The unique thing about nuclear wastes is that it is radioactive , like naturally occurring radioactive material  , which is not only radioactive itself , but will also produce highly dangerous radioactive radon gas .
It is very hard to recycle or dispose those wastes due to their unique nature , like the wastes produced by VHTR .
The radioactive wastes will affect the health of man-kind , animals and plants when they are exposed to it .
The consequences are hazardous .
Even if it is buried underground , it will take hundreds of years for its effect to go off due to its long half-life .
The land used by nuclear power plants cannot be used for other purposes after the plants are decommissioned , as excessive radioactivity is present in the area .
There have been suggestions to solve this problem by using helium , which is not radioactive , and abundant helium can be found on the moon .
However , there are a few things we should concern , the practicality of mining on the moon and the cost of mining on the moon .
It is no doubt that it is extremely expensive to fly to the moon and do the mining there .
At the same time , the technology to dig on the moon , and even use helium as a fuel is still not available yet .
Thus , nuclear energy is not a good alternative .
One more argument for nuclear energy is that it is cheap .
However , the nuclear power plants are all operating at low temperatures now , rendering them inefficient , due to limitations of technologies .
The cost advantage of nuclear energy is not so obvious here .
However , if we take into account of the set up cost of the nuclear plants , which are more high-tech than coal plants , they are definitely much more expensive .
The equally expensive maintenance cost covered will in the end together contribute to the average cost of producing nuclear energy , which is now much higher than that of coal and other sources .
Optimists say that the cost will be greatly reduced when generation IV reactors are developed as they will work with much higher efficiency .
Nevertheless , the technology required is not readily attainable and it will take a long time to be realised .
Thus , nuclear energy should not be accepted .
In conclusion , nuclear energy may have some seemingly advantages , however , the problems associated with it is not negligible .
Specifically the high cost , radioactive wastes and the safety concerns .
Therefore , nuclear energy may not be a desirable alternative , we should put more of our focus on better energy sources like solar power .
Many accidents happened over the past decades , some related to design flaws while others to human errors .
Reasons for human errors range from emotional wellbeing , to the inability in handling the pre-accident situation  .
These accidents may have been prevented should psychology be encompassed into the design process .
The Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 illustrates this notion .
On the 25th of April 1986 , reactor 4 was scheduled for a shut down , and an experiment was planned to test a safety feature during this process .
Request by the capital delayed the test pass midnight resulting in it being conducted by a less proficient night team .
Before the test , an unexpected drop in power resulted in operators retracting control rods in an attempt to restore power .
The reactor however , appeared stable after the retraction although it displayed abnormal readings .
The operators ignored this abnormality and proceeded with the test .
Subsequently two explosions occurred resulting in massive losses  .
Supporters related the accident to a lack of understanding in human psychology during the design phase  .
The test was approved only by the director of plant , without the coordination of the reactor's chief designer or scientific manager  .
Opponents claimed that approval was appropriate as the reactor was muffled at the start of the experiment and should not have devastating effects on its safety  .
Proponents however , argued that the plant director had insufficient specialised knowledge .
The use of psychology would enable designers to acknowledge that operators may encounter faults beyond their abilities and thus gear the design towards user friendliness .
Moreover , a psychologist should be able to relate a high competency requirement to the test and thus limit its handling to upper management .
In this manner , there is a high chance that the accident would not have occurred since the most qualified personnel are managing the test .
In addition these reactors require highly skilled professionals  .
Opponents were firm that should the test be conducted by the more proficient day team , the accident was unlikely to occur  .
On the contrary , proponents refute this , stating that psychology encompasses the understanding of human reaction during panic stages  .
The design of the reactor could thus include simple idiot-proof automated safety mechanisms without relying on operators' competency .
This way , the operators would not have retracted the control rods during the pre test stage since the system would be automated .
Therefore , the accident may not have occurred .
Opponents countered the use of psychology as they felt it stifles creativity in the design process  .
They believed that feedbacks may end up counterproductive and deter engineers from verbalizing their creations in fear of evaluation .
Moreover , they stood firm that the psychologist' lack of relevant knowledge may divert the focus of engineers and lead them away from designing a relevant product .
Proponents agreed to the possibility of limiting creativity should psychology be used in the entire design process .
As such , they suggest the intermittent intervention of psychology or simply the introduction of psychology only after the main design outline is formed  .
This way , the main focus of the product would not be altered and the critical design phases could be assessed through the use of simulation or operators .
This would possibly uproot errors during the entire design sequence thereby preventing the Chernobyl accident .
However , as highlighted by opponents , usage of psychology would inevitably lead to increase in research and consequently production cost  .
In addition , resources for research would now have to be redistributed , thereby diverting focus from the core engineering design .
Proponents argue that the added cost is justifiable should the use of psychology prevent the accident .
The economic cost incurred in the entire aftermath cleanup process amounted to an astounding USD 43 billion not inclusive of intangible cost related to social and psychological effects  .
Therefore supporters stay firm on the notion of prevention being better than cure , and hence propose the use of psychology in the design process .
In conclusion , it is undeniable that the use of psychology would lead to the increase in production cost or the reshuffling of resources allocated to core engineering design .
However , it would translate to designs encompassing user friendly backup systems non reliant on the competency of operators .
It would also match the test complexity to the appropriate management level .
As a result , the use of psychology in the design process may have prevented the Chernobyl accident thereby justifying its cost .
A Germany's Inter-City Express  trains derailed and slammed into an overpass , killed 101 people and injured 200 people in June of 1998 ,  .
The causes of the accident were traced back to a damaged wheel that disintegrated just before the train passed over a switch track .
With a further investigation , people discovered the evidence of poor wheel design , poor bridge construction , insufficient failure detection system , ineffective emergency procedures and insufficient design verification testing .
As a result , safety improvements and major engineering changes were implemented in order to prevent such disaster from happening again and which includes the studies of psychology in design process .
Hence , the use of psychology in design process could have prevented the accident .
First of all , the use of psychology in the design process could have prevented the accident by realizing the need of adding several failure detection systems on the train .
According to the research that has been done by the German national railway company , Deutsche Bahn  , the ICE train did not have a system installed to detect wheel failure and bring the train to an emergency stop .
According to Wilpert , inherent safety which links the design process to safety concerns must be taken into account .
However , in this situation , the engineers did not identify the inherently safer options  which led to insufficient of failure detection systems that were installed in the train .
One example that highlighted this situation is the bullet trains from Japan .
The Japanese bullet trains equipped with a detection system that can alert the train operator about wheel deformation and failure during the operation so that the operator may manually activate the emergency brake .
If the train was installed with this system , the accident might not have happened .
Secondly , the use of psychology in the design process could have prevented the accident through activating the emergency brake despite the company's policy that did not allow the train manager to do so .
During the journey on the train , a large piece of metal came up through the floor and was witnessed by a passenger .
The passenger tried to warn the crew but was refused by the train manager due to the reason that he needs to investigate the problem by himself first .
As a result , valuable time was lost and the accident happened .
In this situation , the problem of psychopathology of design was revealed .
According to Wilpert , the designer 's and the user's conceptual model of a system or a device must be matched in order to reduce the problems that might have occurred during the time of using it , in this case , the train .
If the company policy was made with referenced to a common sense that was agreed by everyone , such as , the train services in Singapore and the United Kingdom that made the control of emergency brakes available to the travelling passengers , the chain of failure would have been broken .
It is unlikely that the subsequent events could have occurred had the train been stopped immediately .
The third and most important thing to use psychology in the design process in this accident is that , it could have revealed the poor design of the wheel that has caused the accident .
The ICE trains were equipped with single-cast wheels which after the accident , the engineers realized that the design of the wheels could makes the metal to fatigue and causes out-of-round conditions that vibrates at cruising speeds .
According to Norman  , the appropriate system image must be ensured by the designer and this is one of the problems of psychopathology of design .
According to the research by Deutsche Bahn  , the design of the wheels that were used did not reveal the actual durability and reliability of the wheels .
Hacker  points out that the quality of co-operative performance depends on the nature of the task at hand .
He says that a design task cannot be solved individually since each person has his own limitation in knowledge .
In this situation , if there were more designers involved in the design of the wheels , the poor design of the wheels could have been spotted and the accident would not have happened .
To sum up , with the use of psychology in the design process , the problems such as insufficient of failure detection systems that were installed in the train , company's policy that was not allowed the train manager to stop the train , and the poor design of the train wheels would not have occurred .
To conclude , the train accident that had happened in Germany could have been prevented with the use of psychology in the design process .
A major accident does not usually happen with merely one error and the accumulation of all the errors will be catastrophic .
For instance the Nicoll Highway incident which occurred on Tuesday 20 April 2004 is the result of this which in turn caused four deaths .
The collapse was due to the retaining wall not able to handle the stress of supporting the tunnel and it gave way  .
Hence , the opposing party argues that this failure is largely due to the technical aspect rather than the human errors .
Nevertheless , there are substantial points to which psychology can prevent the accident from happening if it has been implemented in the design stage .
Nonetheless , the supporters still argue another fact about the structure being used merely for a short period of time .
Thus there is no strict law imposed by the government about how a temporary structure should be built .
Furthermore , the supporters insist that the higher management within LTA and NLC had stringent control of the design phase despite the fact that the structure was used temporary .
However , the truth is about the wrong mindset of the engineers and workers .
The wrong attitude about temporary structure causes them to let off their guards and become ignorant of the risk that the weak structure might pose .
Besides that , the NLC's design engineers ignore its failed risk assessment and continue to proceed with the blueprint without revealing the actual data to LTA  .
This behavior is considered dishonest and immoral .
This is because NLC would want to complete their job within schedule so to avoid paying penalties to LTA  .
Thus the over-eagerness and the time pressure exerted on them often lead to short-cuts and worsen the failure further  .
Lastly , the opposing party argues that all workers involved in this project have a strong sense of safety culture since it is compulsory to attend the Construction Safety Orientation Course  before commencement of any construction work  .
Therefore the opponents emphasize that the failure was not due to the inadequate knowledge about the safety aspect but the failure of the technical aspect .
Although they have attended the CSOC , there were dysfunction relations within the organization  .
The incapability of the project management team failed to address the warning signs present in the early stage and implement corrective measures .
Thus , the failure was further aggravated .
Hence , the negligence and breaching of the project management team statutory duties indeed caused the collapse  .
In conclusion , one would realize the collapse of the Nicoll Highway is mainly due to human errors rather than the technical aspects .
Nevertheless , one would also recognize that failure of the technical aspect is due to the presence of human errors .
These human errors can be referred to some form of psychology which is important in all human endeavors .
Thus , having certain knowledge about it will definitely aid in the understanding of human behavior and the reasons to why human makes mistakes .
As a result , it is vital to implement psychology in the design stage so to prevent the occurrence of any catastrophic accident .
Every nation is caught up with energy shortage problem .
If man continues exhausting natural resources at the present rate , the day is not far off when human beings may run out of coal or oil .
Nuclear power stands out as one of most prospective alternate source .
In the case of nuclear power , the allure is clear: abundant power , no carbon dioxide emissions , no blots on the landscape except an occasional containment dome and cooling tower , according to Michael P . .
However , problems come with nuclear power such as accidents of leakage , waste reprocessing and storage , high construction costs , and even the possible use of nuclear fuel for weapons .
With considerable research background , Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors , or SFR , are able to ease public worry over these safety issues as mentioned before .
It should be evident that none of the opposing statement is valid for SFR .
SFR operates at low temperature and low pressure and has multiple systems to back up safety .
The radioactive waste can also be sustainably used in the fuel cycle with reduction of environmental burden .
High construction is offset not only by multiple construction options , but also by efficient utilization of fuel resources .
More importantly , research is carrying on for SFR , the most promising generation IV reactor .
Chernobyl disaster was a major engineering accident that occurred in the year 1986 .
The causes of the accident were classified to be design flaws of the nuclear reactor system as well as violation of safety regulations by the operators before the accident .
Some people believe that the use of psychology during the design process might have corrected all the flaws of the system , thus preventing the tragedy while others argue that this incident occurred due to severe breaches of safety regulations by the operators .
Therefore psychology plays no role in preventing this accident as the causes were due to human errors .
In my opinion , I trust that the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident .
The use of psychology would rectify the design flaws and safety mechanism implemented to counter human errors .
Opposition might argue that human errors occur on a random basis; therefore they could not be prevented .
It was this violation of safety rules by the operators prior to the accident that caused the explosion , thus psychology during the design process would not contribute anything beneficial to the operations .
An experiment was conducted before the nuclear reactor was due for maintenance .
Before the test , the emergency core cooling system was shut down .
The first human error committed was to continue with the test .
The power of the reactor continued to drop below the lower limit for the experiment .
Control rods which act as absorbers were withdrew from the core to increase the power of the reactor .
This was human error two .
All the circulating pumps were connected to the reactor that had its control rods withdrew .
This caused an unstable thermo-hydraulic status .
The experiment started in these undesirable conditions .
Power began to rise and the absorbers were sent back to the core to control the reaction , however they were unable to plunge fully into the lower stop due to mechanical fault .
The decision to cut off current that holds the absorbers to ensure the falling of rods caused the explosions .
It was through this series of human errors committed prior to the moment that caused this incident .
The impact of human errors could be minimized when appropriate safety mechanism were installed on the system .
Psychologist could brainstorm for possible human errors that could be committed by the operators and recommend counter measurements .
One possible counter measurement against human errors could be to configure the system in such a way that whenever safety has been compromised , the system will be automatically shut down .
The use of psychology will bridge the gap between designers and operators as the system will not be overly complicated for the operators to work on .
All operation knowledge and trainings should be properly imparted by the engineers to the operators so as to guarantee system operation efficiency and safety .
All these measurements taken will reduce the human errors to an insignificant level , thus those mistakes committed might not cause such a huge impact and Chernobyl accident might not has occurred .
A report published by IAEA Nuclear Safety Advisory Group stated that the actual causes were due to design errors .
The reactor constructed for the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant was the second generation nuclear reactor which was almost identical to the first generation .
Engineers failed to rectify the design errors found in the first generation , thus all shortcomings were modeled into the second generation reactor .
The reasons that engineers failed to challenge the errors could be their large working group .
Studies have shown that considerable productivity loss is found when people of different background work together .
Factors affecting a group include evaluation apprehension , free riding and blocking .
The result of all the problems faced by the design engineers was a nuclear reactor which carries several design flaws .
The water channels run through the core vertically where a temperature gradient will be built up .
This causes the reaction within the core to increase greatly .
The control rods end tips were made of graphite which is a more potent neutron moderator and greatly increases the rate of fission reaction when the rods are initially inserted into the reactor .
This defeats the purpose of the control rods .
The use of psychology since the start of design process would rectify all the faults found .
Psychologists are able to give a more objective view on the integrity of the project .
Psychologist , being the middleman , will connects all the engineers together to design the new reactor .
Therefore all the features that compromise safety would be eliminated during the design process .
Therefore the use of psychology during design process would reduce design errors in the new reactor created .
Human errors are unavoidable .
Psychologist must be present to give his or her safety judgments to incorporate addition counter measurements against possible human errors .
The use of psychology could also remove all the design flaws and add in desirable mechanism to the system , thus creating a more efficient reactor for both the engineers and operators .
Therefore the use of psychology during the design process would have possibly prevented the Chernobyl incident .
Almost every day when we read newspaper , articles about energy saving or increasing oil price will jump into our sight .
Actually , global warming and energy crisis have been being extremely hot topics these years and large proportion of governments' revenue has been spent on the research and development of new energy resources , such as solar energy and tidal power .
Among these new energy resources , nuclear power is highly favored by researchers due to its abundant base materials , low quantities of waste and comparatively cheap fuel costs .
CITATION Why06 \l 2052  Such a situation indicates that the new dawn of the nuclear power is at the corner although it means that the public have to struggle to restore their confidence ruined by the past appalling accidents of nuclear power plants .
Hitherto , scientists have successfully proposed the Generation IV nuclear reactor concepts , namely , gas-cooled fast reactors , lead-cooled fast reactors , molten salt reactors , sodium-cooled fast reactors , supercritical-water cooled reactors and very-high-temperature reactors .
CITATION Nuc04 \l 2052  In my opinion , the very-high-temperature reactors  are the best among the six .
In this essay , I will talk about the reasons from the perspectives of safety , work efficiency and cost .
Safety is always the thing that matters most .
After the Chernobyl disaster in Soviet Union , many people started to reject the proposal of wide usage of nuclear power .
But actually , no energy sources can be said to be free of risk .
Coil and oil have brought us problems like global warming and acidic rain; hydro projects have deteriorate the environment of areas flooded and downstream and can lead to great economical loss and mortality once dams are collapsed; the mirrors and panels used for solar energy production can affect the environment too .
CITATION Com09 \l 2052  Hence , what we should concentrate on now is how to make the nuclear power production safer instead of arguing whether to reject it or not .
The good news is that the basic technology for VHTR has been well established and has been tested by many nuclear plants vendors and national laboratories .
Furthermore , the VHTR concept requires "the lowest risk technology development" to "achieve the needed commercial functional requirements" CITATION Ver09 \l 2052 ) among the six Generation IV reactors .
Therefore , safety is highly guaranteed in the development and application of VHTR .
Last but not the least , every technological innovations should be feasible not only technically but also economically .
As far as we know , the ultra-long life VHTR systems can be developed with minor actinides .
Minor actinides used can incinerate burnable poisons or fuel materials to obtain high levels of burn-up , which could "facilitate development of new fuel cycles and support sustainability of a fuel source for nuclear energy" .
CITATION Pav09 \l 2052  So the cost of maintenance and fuels for VHTR can be highly reduced compared to other Generation IV reactors .
Besides , the earliest delivery time for VHTR is 2020 , earlier than that of other Generation IV reactors except Sodium-cooled fast reactors .
The earlier delivery means the earlier alleviation to these impending problems and more payback .
Hence , the VHTR systems are highly practical economically .
In conclusion , to solve the global warming and energy shortage problems , we need the exploration and better utilization of nuclear energy .
And among the six proposed new generation nuclear reactors , the VHTR systems are the best in consideration of various facets .
The strong technological backup provides adequate safety; the specific innovational design of the system ensures high work efficiency; the ultra long lifetime and early delivery brings comparatively lower cost .
Therefore , VHTR is the one which deserves further research and development funding most .
On the 6th of March 1987 the freight ferry 'Herald of Free Enterprise' capsized just ouside the port of Zeebrugge .
The accident took the lives of 150 passengers and 38 crewmembers  . . Could this accident have been avoided or to be specific could the use of psychology during the design process prevent this accident from happening ?
Major accidents besides Zeebrugge such as the 'Three Mile Island' incident and the 'Chernobyl 'disaster is said to be caused by human error .
Statistics show that close to 90% of all accidents is caused by human error .
The major companies have given the excuse of cost and time as the reason why they have not considered implementing psychology during the design process .
Although these major companies have not shown a high enough level of interest to invest in the use of engineering psychology , I believe that engineering psychology can help improve on the safety of operation in their industry and eventually reduce accidents .
I will look into the 'Zeebrugge' incident in detail to prove that it could have been avoided if psychology is used during the design process .
Another cause of the ferry capsizing is the lack of interaction within the organization .
Critics claim that it is important to establish a professional relationship between the workers and make sure the workers do not step over their scope of work .
This way of thinking however is inexcusable as when working in an engineering industry , most departments rely on each other .
When water started to flood in the 'Herald Of Free Enterprise' , one deck hand noticed it but did not report the matter because he thought that others may have notice and it was not his job .
If there were proper interaction between the workers the 'Zeebrugge' incident could have a different ending .
Apart from that there is also the matter of the management's role in the 'Zeebrugge' incident .
The management is said to be pushing their workers to work double shift just for their own profits .
Critics mentioned that the welfare of the workers is not important .
As long as they are being paid for their extra work , it is fine .
That way of management is very harsh as the workers safety and their health is very important .
Looking in the 'Zeebrugge' incident , the worker which was suppose to make sure the bow doors are closed , was asleep .
Because the higher-ups forced the workers into exhaustion an engineering accident have happen .
The workers psychological state and physiological state must be good in order for him to perform his job .
When the workers mind is in the right place , then he will be happy and content when working  .
This will undoubtedly reduce human error .
Generally , nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that does not pollute our environment with tremendous amounts of toxic gases such as nitrogen oxides , sulfur oxides and carbon dioxide .
Compared with fuel oil and coal combustion , nuclear power not only meets the increased global energy demands in the future but also avoids global warming issues .
In Taipei , Taiwan , the government rather extends its oldest nuclear plant's life and willing to take the risk of public safety just to cut down the greenhouse effects .
However , we cannot deny the fact that nuclear energy will produce radioactive wastes that raised the concern of the public .
In fact , nuclear power plant will only emit a very small percentage of radioactive wastes to the air during its operation and the possibility of nuclear wastes leakage is very low .
This safety issues arises is due to the huge information gap besides lack of communication and understanding between the experts and the public about the safety measurements taken during the operation of nuclear power plant .
In term of performance , the Very High Temperature Reactor concept manage to generate 50% more electricity compared with other conventional plants such as Pressurized Water Reactor .
This is because this reactor is designed to run at temperature 10000C which is the highest temperature used among the generation IV reactors to generate electricity by using the same amount of fuel .
Basically , high temperature operations are more efficient to convert heat energy to electrical energy and can avoid wasting of energy in other forms .
This reactor do not has waste recycling process and instead , waste goes directly to repository .
Although reprocessing can decrease the quantity of waste produced , the generation of weapons-grade plutonium is still not a beneficial product to human kind .
We should cut down the amount of plutonium existed and not increase its quantity for further development .
There's no doubt that up-front cost of nuclear power plant building is relatively expensive compare to those associated with fossil fuels .
In fact , there is a lot of ways to mitigate these costs .
The Very High Temperature Reactor is considerably cheap compare to other reactors .
It does not run the conventional reprocessing which is rather expensive and it is among the earliest delivery of generation IV reactor .
Hence , this reactor does not need a very long research period and cut down the unnecessary development funding .
In conclusion , nuclear energy brings many advantages to our society .
It not only decreases world's dependency on fuel oils to generate electricity , but also act as an environment protector .
Although there are few drawbacks of nuclear power , we can reduce these negative effects by using the latest technology in newer reactor and emphasis on public safety .
As long as we use it wisely and efficiently , i believe that nuclear power greatly overweighs other type of energies .
The world is facing an energy crisis .
Current means of generating electricity such as burning of fossil fuels are getting less viable by the day due to its depleting source .
Hence , there is a need for new alternative methods of generating electricity that is capable of satisfying the energy demand of the growing world population .
One such alternative would be nuclear energy .
Nuclear plant takes advantage of the heat generated from nuclear fission and uses it to heat up water , producing steam .
The steam produced is then used to generate electricity .
Although the whole process does sound simple , there is actually more to it than meets the eye .
In fact , most people are not comfortable with the idea of using nuclear reactors to generate electricity , for good reasons .
However there are six new generation IV reactors being developed at the moment that promises to resolve many of the issues posed by generators of the past .
Of these six reactors , the most promising reactor would be the very-high-temperature reactors  .
The chief issue that the public have against nuclear reactors is of course it's safety .
Past events such as the incident in Chernobyl serve as a grim reminder of the dangers that comes with a nuclear reactor .
On top of that , VHTR require a relatively high operating temperature and pressure for optimum function .
To ensure that VHTR does not suffer the same fate as reactor 4 in Chernobyl , new materials such as nickel super-alloys and chromium steel are being looked at as potential candidates for reaction vessels as these materials are capable of withstanding the extreme conditions of VHTR .
The reaction itself , unlike other generation IV plants , is moderated by uranium oxycarbide coated graphite , a naturally safe choice , capable of retaining radioactive waste .
Besides that , helium , the coolant of choice in VHTR is chemically inert .
So , it is not affected by radiation , unlike other coolants such as water .
The public tend to moan about the high economical cost necessary in building and maintaining a nuclear plant .
In fact , each of the generation IV reactors will require a staggering 1 billion USD in construction cost alone .
Apart from that , there is also the research cost as well which requires consideration as it also contributes to the overall cost of the plants .
But then again , people tend to overlook the benefits that these reactors yield as future investments .
For one , constant research and testing ensures that the safety of these reactors are not compromised .
Despite the relatively high volume of research needed for VHTR compared to the other nuclear reactors , the fact that researchers are able to reassure its delivery by the year 2020 , five years earlier than most of the other reactors means that the research work on VHTR is much simpler compared to the other reactors , costing less .
The performance of generation III nuclear reactors have also raised concerns .
In a generation III nuclear plant , only 5% of uranium input is actually converted into electricity while the rest of it turns into nuclear waste .
Compared to other means of generating energy , users will have to pay more for the same amount of electricity generated via nuclear means .
On the other hand , VHTR is said to be able to convert up to 65% of uranium into energy .
That means only less than half of the uranium input will now go to waste .
In addition , due to the high temperature and pressure involved in VHTR , conversion rate is improved and this produces hydrogen gas as well which can be used to fuel green cars of the future .
Among the six proposed generation IV nuclear power plants , VHTR is by far the most promising choice .
Firstly , due to the research already being done on known materials to serve as reaction vessels , safety is no longer an issue as they are capable of withstanding the operating conditions of VHTR .
The cost of building each generation IV nuclear reactor is about the same .
However , the cost of research on VHTR is less than most of the other candidates .
Plus , generation IV nuclear reactors are much more efficient than those of generation III because of the higher energy conversion rate that they have to offer .
At the same time , VHTR also produces useful hydrogen gases as by-products .
In conclusion , unless the world decides to live completely in the dark , a new method of generating electricity needs to replace the constantly depleting fossil fuels that we current rely so heavily on as an energy source .
The best alternative approach on the table at this point in time is nuclear energy .
Despite the current economic downturn , it is only a matter of time before the energy crisis is resolved .
Necessity and the sense of urgency will always be the best motivator .
Annex
In a time where energy sources are depleting rapidly , call for new alternate energy has being made by several countries and large amount of effort and money had been poured for this new cause .
Nuclear power energy has being claimed by many as the most desired new energy source for the new age  .
However in my opinion , other alternate energy sources like solar and hydro energy have more potential to be the new dawn for energy as they have far more advantages than nuclear energy and with lesser risk involved .
Firstly , there have been reports that the use of nuclear energy is much safer as there are much fewer accidents happening in nuclear plant compared to the number of accidents that happened in conventional fuel-burning energy plant .
Indeed , there might be a decrease in the number of accidents in nuclear plant , in contrast to the thousands of death that happened in conventional energy plant .
However , in the event of a nuclear accident there are usually hundreds of thousands who will be affected  .
The sheer number of people affected in one nuclear accident is far more than the number of accidental deaths happened in conventional energy plant over the years .
Furthermore , the adverse effect of the radiation that remains behind after a nuclear accident will cause devastating effects on the environment and the human population in the area .
These effects can range from immediate death to nausea , vomiting , radiation burns , moreover these are just the immediate effect on human health; some indirect effects include death in ten days , leukemia , cancers , genetic damage to offspring and even premature ageing depending on the amount of radiation received  .
A major area of the use of nuclear energy is the issue of safety .
Many researchers like Butler supported that the energy produce by nuclear power plant is safe and it can generate a large amount of energy which will solve the pressing matter of depleting fuel sources .
One of the generation IV reactor concepts is the 'very high temperature reactor' with operating conditions such as high pressure and thousand of degree Celsius  .
These operating conditions can severely injure any worker on-site if there are any leakages .
Another major issue with the nuclear plant will be the security aspect of the use of nuclear power .
It is a well-known fact that the by-product of the nuclear plant; mainly the nuclear waste have being used for developing nuclear weapons  .
The development of nuclear weapons has being condemned by several countries and organizations like the U .N  .
Although some might claimed that the security of these nuclear resources will not be misuse , however it is almost impossible to guard against such cases  .
Moreover , the ever increasing risk of terrorism will result in a much threatening situation if nuclear weapon is been stolen .
It is unimaginable the amount of damage that will occur if the terrorists are able to get their hand on a nuclear power plant .
In conclusion , all the following aspects such as the security , safety and costs component for a nuclear reactor indicates far more disadvantages and risks compared to the advantages that nuclear reactor brings about .
Thus , in my view , there are much better technology and energy than nuclear power around , so there should be more emphasis and support for other technologies .
It is beyond doubt that the Earth has been recently getting warmer .
The most devastating effects of global warming was the South-Eastern Australian heat wave which brought temperatures soaring above 43 degrees Celsius according to the International Committee of the Fourth International  .
One of the main contributors of global warming is the burning of coal and gas to produce energy .
In the year 2007 , it was proven that the coal-generated power plants were the largest source of global warming  .
However , we can reduce global warming by using the Generation IV  reactor concepts nuclear plants .
One such reactor is the Very High Temperature Reactor  where it can produce large volumes of energy cleanly , reliably , safely and affordably .
This would therefore provide future price stability and have environmental attributes .
These characteristics demonstrate why the VHTR is such an imperative in the United States  , but due to public opposition , nuclear reactors are perceived as dangerous and unreliable .
However , we should clear the misunderstandings of nuclear energy and learn to accept it and use it to save the Earth .
Firstly , public citizens argue that future nuclear reactors like the VHTR are too risky to rely on due to events like the Three Mile Island and the Chernobyl disaster .
As a result , the public perceives that having a nuclear reactor is like having a bomb waiting to explode .
However , this is not creditable .
In both disasters , human error was more to blame than the technology itself  .
Furthermore , according to engineers of MPR Associates Inc Engineers , the VHTR will be safe and reliable to operate with improved accident management and mitigation and reduced off-side response with little human intervention .
In addition , the focus of the Gen IV reactor concepts is on the use of inherent safety features and designs .
Thus , we can safely conclude that the VHTR as well as nuclear technology are not as dangerous as perceived by the public .
Furthermore , there is widespread information that nuclear energy is the most expensive and unreliable source of energy .
On the contrary , a team of energy experts from various government , academic and private sector research units noted that wind and solar powers are not very reliable as they are only generated when the wind is right or when the sun is shining  .
Furthermore , they are also very difficult to store hence making it a very unreliable source of energy .
In addition to this , solar and wind technologies are four to ten times more expensive than nuclear energy sources like the VHTR .
For example , a VHTR costs 2 billion dollars and is able to supply electricity to billions of homes and one wind energy system for one home costs 25 ,000 dollars .
In comparison , VHTR supplying electricity is much cheaper  .
In short , Wind and solar power are intermittent and unpredictable and they simply cannot replace coal generating power plants .
Therefore , building a Gen IV nuclear reactor like the VHTR is not as unreliable and expensive as perceived by most .
Another issue widely discussed by the public is the issue of nuclear waste .
It is true that the generation of electricity in a nuclear power plant produces nuclear waste which is difficult to dispose of and harmful to the public as the effects are devastating .
However , according to the {International Atomic Energy Agency}  , there is research being conducted to develop a technology where the VHTR will be powered by using fuels originating from reprocessed nuclear-waste .
This technology would not only destroy most of the nuclear waste , it would also make the existing waste a very valuable source of energy .
Furthermore , it can also be used to deliver ten times the energy of an original fuel .
Hence , with more research and time given to develop the technology , nuclear waste would not become a persecution anymore .
In conclusion , the VHTR can be seen as a safe , reliable and an affordable way to produce electricity since electricity has become a necessity in our everyday lives .
To confront global warming , Gen IV nuclear reactors like the VHTR should be seen as a solution .
According to a study by MIT in 2003 , it was concluded that the use of nuclear energy may be needed to meet future energy demands and to reduce carbon emissions as energy demands continue to rise annually .
Nuclear power has been around for several decades and has transformed itself to become a more efficient way of producing electricity for consumer use .
As of today , the US has 104 reactors , contributing about 20 percent of the nation's power  .
Currently , the reactors have already evolved till the fourth generation and there are six different concepts .
These concepts had evolved due to the Generation IV International Forum  where a team of ten nations will plan the direction for future nuclear reactors  .
The main focus will be on the cost aspects such as high construction costs , operating costs as well as the decommissioning costs .
As such , I do not support to provide funds for further research and development  for the building nuclear power plants .
Firstly , high construction costs are incurred when building the plant for Very-high-temperature reactors  due to the requirements of the reactor .
For VHTR to operate , it needs to be carried out at very high temperature of 1000C and also at high pressure  .
This will require the building materials to be very tough , resulting in higher cost .
There will also be fluctuations in the cost , depending on the period the plant is built and this is a major component of the cost of building nuclear plant .
On the other hand , it should also be noted that price fluctuations will not only affect the construction costs of building a nuclear power plant but also the costs of building other types of plants that produce electricity such as coal and natural gas plants .
As nuclear power plants receive government subsidies due to the fact that it is a cleaner gas , this means that construction costs incurred by the company will be greatly reduced .
A total of $178 billion has been used for nuclear power subsidies between 1947 and 1999  .
Another factor that contributes to the high costs of nuclear plants lies in the operating costs .
Daily costs include labour such as operators and maintenance personnel , overheads such as computers and equipment , expendable materials such as replacement and computer parts , licensing costs such as power reactor licenses which cost $2 ,980 ,000 per unit and local property taxes which cost around $15 to $20 million per year  .
All these daily costs are rather fixed , thus a reduction in the operational side is rather unlikely .
However , in the long run , savings in the operating costs could be a rather large with the help of improved technology .
If technology could help to automate the reactors , then the number of operators required will be reduced and by doing R&D , the parts could have a longer lifespan and hence expenditure of replacing parts will be much lowered .
Lastly , the factor that accounts for the high cost is due to decommissioning costs .
It refers to the nuclear power plant is being treated as nuclear waste .
This is another overwhelming expense of nuclear power .
The average cost of decommissioning a power plant is about $300 million .
The funds for decommissioning accumulate in the operating cost of the plant .
On the contrary , though for nuclear power plants , we have to take into account decommissioning costs which are not found in other types of plants producing electricity but for nuclear power plant , no cost is incurred in the cleaning up of the waste products being produced during the production of electricity .
Due to climate changes , countries are encouraged to lower the amount of carbon dioxide gas  released into the air by treating it so as to remove its toxicity  .
As such , the costs incurred by other power plants will also be increased due to this action .
In conclusion , the different factors of costs , mainly construction costs , operating costs and decommissioning costs contribute to almost the whole cost of building nuclear plant .
The total cost is a very huge figure as compared to other types of power plants .
As such , I do not support the further R&D funding for it .
This is backed up by the fact that no new nuclear power plants have been ordered in the US since 1978 as the high costs have caused many problems such as bankruptcies  .
In a world where technology has fitted seamlessly into , the threat of global warming and raising energy needs which affects the future of our planet has never been greater .
Given the gloom forecast on global warming due to the environmental impacts caused by greenhouse gases , it is not surprising that countries are turning towards nuclear energy as an alternative .
The only issue that stands in the way of the government turning towards this alternative is the memories of past incidents such as the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , and the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania  .
However , over the recent years , research is starting to show that such issues can be overcome , and together with the launch of generation IV reactor concepts , we may be on hand to witness the revival of nuclear reactors which are safer , more valuable and more energy-efficient .
History shows the risk of having nuclear plants in the vicinity of our homes , and the need for more of such plants to meet the increasing demands for energy such as electricity will only heighten the danger further .
However , these plants will only be available in 2025 , as in the case of the Gas-Cooled-Fast-Reactor  , and through extensive research , these plants will contain irradiation-resistant materials as well as heat-resistant fuels and materials .
In the event of accidents caused by high fuel burn-ups , temperature control will be available .
Furthermore , learning from the mistakes of past experiences , accidents caused by human errors can be greatly reduced .
According to a statistical review of world energy consumption done by the EIA  , the total world consumption of marketed energy is projected to increase by 44 percent from 2006 to 2030 .
Given the fact that the current rate of fuel consumption is already causing damage to our planet , such statistics is indeed alarming .
This leads to an increased urgency to turn to the usage of alternative energy such as nuclear energy , as the waste produced does not contain any greenhouse gases , thus it will help reduce global warming , as well as climate change .
As stated in Butler's article  , the production of nuclear power plants may cost up to a hefty US$1 billion , yet it may end up as the cheaper alternative as compared to the rising cost of oil and fuels , since fossil fuels are getting scarcer , and hence more expensive .
Generation II's reactors are known to be less efficient as compared to the energy generated by fossil fuels , which has led to the decrease in the production of such plants , to the point that countries have resorted to using more fossil fuels instead of relying on the nuclear plants .
However , one of the generation IV reactor concepts such as the Gas-Cooled-Fast-Reactor  has new functions which are turning the heads of investors and the government .
The GCFR has a 50% increase in efficiency as compared to Generation II's reactors .
Studies have shown that nuclear fission , the splitting of a heavy atom's nucleus , releases great amounts of energy .
For example , the energy it releases is 10 million times greater than is released by the burning of an atom of fossil fuel .
Besides it would take many hectares of land covered with solar collectors , wind farms or hydro-electric dams to equal this power .
The fact that it is also able to produce both electricity and hydrogen makes it all the more practical .
Hydrogen can then be converted to produce electricity; without this conversion , demand from US transport alone will cause the nation's oil imports to soar by 78% 
The damages caused by global warming may be causing the birth of nuclear technology , and given the benefits that it brings , it comes as no surprise that extensive research is constantly being done to ensure the smooth delivery for this re-new source of energy .
Being equipped with this self sufficient form of energy , mankind can then continue to come up with cutting edge technology without the fear of harming our planet .
There is a proverb 'Fire is a good servant but a bad master' .
Fire is an energy which could be employed to sustain life but at the same time , mismanagement could lead to devastating consequences .
Likewise , nuclear energy handled appropriately is an enormous power which could be harnessed for the good of mankind .
The massive potential of nuclear power as a replacement for fossil fuel and coal in the international energy scene comes into focus amid growing concern caused by global warming .
Nuclear energy being non-polluting could be an environmentally-friendly alternative which would alleviate the profound threat to humanity caused by severe climate change .
While nuclear opponents highlight safety , cost and performance issues , the Very High Temperature  Reactor is a Generation IV reactor concept which should be researched and developed further .
Public unease over the safety of nuclear technology has historically been the principal opposition against its utilisation .
Indeed , a burnt child dreads fire .
The nineteen-eighty-six Chernobyl accident killed thirty- one people and resulted in significant damage to environment and population health in large parts of Europe .
However , as pointed out in a 2008 report by the World Nuclear Association , "to this day , the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents remain the only major accidents to have occurred in more than 12 ,700 cumulative reactor-years of commercial operation in 32 countries" .
Furthermore , statistics from the same report placed coal as the type of energy generation which caused the most related immediate fatalities from 1970 to 1992 with a total death count of six thousand and four hundred .
In contrast , nuclear only resulted in thirty-one for the same period .
Moreover , the safety of nuclear technology was demonstrated during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
The survival of all three directly affected nuclear plants illustrates the high preparedness of the nuclear industry for operation under harsh conditions .
Crucially , when extrapolated to the event of a hypnotised terrorist strike , it showcased the capability of current technology to work during emergency .
Further research into VHT reactors would improve safety standards and ease public concern .
Next , opponents are concerned about the cost of nuclear energy .
They argued that investing resource into constructing the related facilities is not economical .
Studies from the Nuclear Energy Institute showed otherwise .
In the United States in 2008 , the cost of electricity from nuclear production was 1 .87 cents per kilowatt-hour , lower than coal or gas which was 2 .75 and 8 .09 respectively .
Furthermore , the indirect economic cost from global warming would be catastrophic as recently seen in world-wide increase in frequency of natural disasters and their ruthless damage to property and human life .
Moreover , a reason why such facilities are budget taxing is due to lack of construction expertise .
As one of the aims of VHT reactor research is cost reduction , the proposed research and development in this field will draw in resources and bring about a decrease in construction and production cost .
Another reason for opposition is the disputed performance of VHT reactors .
Opponents regard Generation IV reactor as mere concepts which work only in computer simulations .
However , research into enhancing reactors in the last two decades has led to improvement in production efficiency in current plants .
The average capacity factor for plants in the United States was fifty-six percent in 1980 as compared to ninety-one percent in 2008 .
Finally , VHT reactors possess attractive qualities .
The utilisation of non-reactive helium coolant and graphite moderator with high temperature stability makes the design inherently safe .
Waste is not reprocessed , thereby reducing controversy stemming from nuclear weapons proliferation that surrounds other designs .
Furthermore , there is dual output of hydrogen as well as electricity .
Hydrogen , another non-polluting fuel , could be used in smaller-scale energy generation as seen in its application in hybrid- cars .
Therefore , the VHT reactor concept should be further researched and developed .
To conclude , the VHT reactor is a passively safe design which could potentially produce power at reasonable cost without contaminating the environment .
While there are issues relating to the development of nuclear technology , this is precisely why further research is required .
Just like how Prometheus brought fire to mortals , scientists have given us nuclear power .
Although this power is naturally destructive , mankind should not cower in fear .
Instead , we should research into harnessing this great energy .
Nuclear power has always been a very controversial topic over the past a few decades .
The proponents emphasized on its high energy potential while the opponents were so much concerned about its radioactive nature that might cause harms .
As energy resources have become more and more precious and our technologies keep upgrading , the supporting side of nuclear power seems winning in recent years as nuclear power plants are increasing in numbers in America , China , Japan and other countries .
Butler2004says that the Supercritical-water-cooled reactors  should be used .
Hence , it is necessary to have further research and more development funding for nuclear power due to its cost-efficiency , security and safety issues .
Firstly , nuclear power is superior to other energy resources due to its cost-efficiency .
Global warming has drawn people's attention nowadays .
Al Gore's documentary film "An Inconvenient Truth" and the Kyoto Protocol ratified by nations have shown that it is urgent to find a future energy alternative .
Nuclear energy will be the one as nuclear power can produce 50% more electricity compared to coal and it emits less amount of dangerous oxides such carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide and so on .
For instance , 790 to 1182 grams of greenhouse gases are released by a coal plant if 1 kilowatt- hour electricity is generated while only 2 to 59 grams of it is emitted by a nuclear power plant .
The cost for coal and nuclear energies are generally comparative , $300/Mw-hr for nuclear energy and $29 .1/Mw-hr for coal respectively .
SCWRs are also cheap and efficient to run and build .
Thus , nuclear energy is more cost-efficient compared to existing energy resources and it is more environmental-friendly .
Moreover , nuclear power system is much more secure than other energy resource systems .
The establishment of a nuclear plant is under consideration of long-term researches and preparations .
Once the plants are built up , safety precautions will be installed and working staffs will be carefully selected .
Hence , it is indeed not easy for terrorists to attack the plants as they will be spotted and stopped by the high-tech security systems before they do so .
Abuse of nuclear energy is also less likely to happen among countries as international organizations such as United Nations will hinder the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
For instance , North Korea has announced to be a "powerful nation" by 2012 in terms of nuclear weapons .
America , China and other big countries and organizations have stood up and criticized this action .
Many nuclear power projects are not able to implement under pressure such as the one initialized by Korea Peninsula Energy Development Organization  .
From the hindered growth of nuclear energy in North Korea , we can see that the abuse of nuclear power such as SCWRs is less likely to happen nowadays .
The atomic bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 will definitely not happen nowadays as they will be strongly opposed due to its inherent immorality and military unnecessariness .
On the other hand , nuclear energy is much safer than other energy resources .
Governments have spent large amount of money in maintaining the safety of nuclear power plants .
Technologies are kept upgrading to ensure the smooth running of the systems .
The following statistics can illustrate that nuclear power is much safer than others .
The number of immediate fatalities from 1970 to 1992 for nuclear is 31 and those for coal and gases are 6400 and 1200 respectively .
We cannot deny the fact that nuclear disasters have happened in the past such as Chernobyl disaster in 1986 .
However , as compared to coal plant accidents , SCWR is still a superior choice due to its sophisticated safety systems and that is why the governments should have development funding for it to achieve zero nuclear disaster someday in the future .
To sum-up , the nuclear energy is much more environmental-friendly and it is a better choice compared to coals and gases as more electricity can be generated by the same amount of nuclear energy with comparative costs .
Nuclear energy is also under protection of high-tech security systems .
Hence , we should support further research in this area and increase the development funding for nuclear power .
Since the nuclear reactor accident at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl , it has been two decades before the issues regarding conventional nuclear power being brought up once again due to increasing cost of power generation .
Generation IV nuclear energy systems offer advantages in the areas of economics , safety and reliability , sustainability and could be deployed commercially by 2030  .
The Generation IV International Forum  has selected six nuclear systems which have the potential to be used as commercial electricity generator and in my opinion , the supercritical-water-cooled reactor  and the very high temperature reactor  are the better ones compared to the rest of the reactors .
Further , I think that the VHTR deserves further research and development funding compared to the SCWR .
The reactor's performance is also one of the main concerns of GIF .
SWCR has a higher efficiency compared to the current water-cooled reactor by having a burn-up of 45% but VHTR has an even higher burn-up which is 65% .
Another advantage of VHTR over SWCR is the ability to produce hydrogen without consuming fossil fuels or emitting greenhouse gasses  .
Hydrogen production needed a high temperature of 700C , so heat from VHTR can be transferred to hydrogen production plant but SWCR does not produce high enough temperature .
Experts see hydrogen as the future fuel and large amount of hydrogen are needed to convert heavy oils and tar sands to liquid fuel .
Hydrogen is also needed in fertilizer production .
Hydrogen is getting increasingly important because of its potential to be used in fuel cells .
Therefore , the ability of producing hydrogen is a great advantage to VHTR .
The objective of GIF is to produce electricity at a lower cost by using nuclear reactor with the least threat to the society .
Furthermore , they plan to replace fossil fuel generators that cause pollution .
Since VHTR , also known as the 'New Generation Nuclear Plant' , has more advantages over the SCWR , VHTR is definitely a better nuclear system to be further developed .
With the development in industries and technology , the consequences of mistakes in design processes become increasingly disastrous  .
A series of accidents caused by errors in the field of engineering have aroused debates in the practice of psychology in engineering design processes to prevent potential dangers .
Those with opposing views have expressed their doubts about the effectiveness of practice of psychology in design processes .
Many engineers have argued that the practice of psychology will be redundant since safety regulations are already established in engineering to prevent accidents .
Some have also argued that the enrolment of psychologists increase the cost of production and may also hinder engineering creativity .
Despite all these opposing arguments , I firmly believe that the practice of psychology is essential in design processes to help avoid human errors and prevent disasters .
In this article , I would like to focus on the Eschede tain disaster and discuss how the practice of psychology can help prevent the disaster .
Among those opposing views , there is a common misconception that psychology has nothing to do with design process .
This point of view is not true since design processes are human activities and human activities are always accomplished by human errors .
Psychology , by studying human behaviours and activities , is able to detect these human errors and help avoid and eliminate accidents  .
In the case of the Eschede train disaster , the design of the wheel tire only underwent limited tests  and the tire's performance under extreme conditions was only proved theoretically .
The practice of psychology would help spotting such negligence and the accident would probably be avoided .
As such , practice of psychology should be involved in design processes to help eliminate human errors and avoid accidents .
Another opposing view expressed by some managers is that the enrollment of psychologists in design processes will increase the cost and time spent .
This is a valid concern; however it cannot deny the significance of practice of psychology in design processes .
The additional cost spent is far less significant than the payoffs if accident occurs .
In addition , this problem of extra cost can be minimized if managers carefully analyse the nature of the industry and decide how far psychology should be involved in design processes .
For example , for industries where design processes are complex and consequences of errors are tremendous , enrolment of psychologists may be integrated , while for other industries which involves less complicated designs , psychologists may step in only after each design stages or at the end of the designs .
Some engineers have further argued that the presence of psychologists may hinder creativity due to lack of engineering knowledge .
This problem can be perfectly solved if engineers are educated in psychology .
In conclusion , the practice of psychology is undeniably significant in engineering design processes as it can help eliminate human errors and prevent accidents .
Considering the increment in cost of production , psychologists may be enrolled in various degrees according to the nature of the industry and the respective products .
For industries where professional knowledge is required , engineers educated in psychology should be involved in design processes such that safety factors can be given enough attention while innovation process will not be influenced .
The first nuclear reactor was built as part of the Manhattan project back in the 1940's to build an atomic bomb  .
After World War II , nuclear reactors became power generators , providing electrical energy .
However , people opposed the usage of nuclear power .
The opposition can be categorized into three main groups; the public , the government , and the industry .
The public are concerned about health and safety , governments are concerned about security , the environment , and space constraints , and the industries are concerned about profits , the environment , and operation stability .
To resolve these concerns , experts proposed several designs for the next generation of reactors .
These designs are flawed , failing to resolve some of the concerns people have .
However , with fossil fuel depleting fast  , alternative sources of energy needs to be explored; hence research on nuclear power as an energy source should be carried out .
In addition , the Lead-cooled fast reactor  design is the best solution to the people's concerns , so research should be concentrated on this design .
First , the LCFR operates in a moderate temperature , low pressure condition  .
This characteristic is advantageous as operating a reactor under such conditions is simpler compared to the extreme conditions such as high temperature required for the other designs .
Also , according to Butler  , at such temperatures the conversion of heat to electricity is efficient , thus producing more energy than present nuclear plants .
Thus the expenses to develop and operate the LCFR are cheaper than the other designs , increasing profit .
This relieves the considerations industries have for profits and operation stability .
Furthermore , with stability , accidents are unlikely to occur , and therefore resolves the concerns people have for safety .
Next , the LCFR enables waste recycling .
The advantage is the maximized use of uranium , the fuel for nuclear power .
As uranium is a non-renewable resource , wasting should be discouraged , as uranium reserves will deplete as rapidly as fossil fuel .
This is critical as one motive of looking for alternative energy sources is to have a long lasting source , thus this property should be prioritized .
In addition , with waste recycling , the amount of radioactive waste to be disposed is reduced .
This dispels the environmental concerns that governments and industries have .
However , waste recycling is dangerous , as plutonium is separated .
Plutonium is a key ingredient of nuclear weaponry , thus causing the government's security concerns .
Nevertheless , this can be resolved by implementing restrictions on nations , preventing nuclear weaponry development .
Hence this property should be present in the future nuclear plant .
Another property of the new nuclear plant is the production of hydrogen fuel together with electricity .
As hydrogen is capable of replacing fossil fuel as an energy source , having nuclear plants that produce hydrogen will relieve us of our dependence on the fast depleting fossil fuel for energy .
This will benefit the world , as carbon emissions will then decrease , slowing down global warming .
However , considering the large amount of space taken up by a plant and its hydrogen output , governments will debate over whether it is worthwhile to use so much land to produce enough fuel for the nation .
In addition , for small countries such as Singapore , there is no room to even construct a plant to power the country .
Nonetheless , land constraints may be resolved by situating the nuclear plant offshore , listed as one of the considerations by the government of Singapore  .
With alterations to the operating temperature , pressure , waste recycling ability and power output of present nuclear reactors , the LCFR design is able to address many concerns the world has towards the utilization of nuclear power .
In addition , with the advantages of the LCFR design heavily outweighing the possible problems it may bring , the LCFR design is arguably the most suited solution amongst the six designs to the concerns the world has towards nuclear power .
Therefore , more funding should be provided for research and development to be carried out on the LCFR design .
Sodium-cooled fast reactors
Nuclear power has always been a dilemma to humans .
As it's a very promising energy source , it is not a wonder that nuclear power is extremely enticing to mankind .
This advantage , however , comes with a price .
The danger , which nuclear power hold , is a big concern and it has holding the development of nuclear technology back for decades .
The radioactive waste produced in a nuclear process is also dangerous and last for a very long time .
After years of development , the scientists published six generation IV reactor concepts which should solve most of today problem in nuclear plants .
The most promising would be the sodium-cooled fast reactors  because , from safety wise , SFR needs low pressure and temperature to operate and it doesn't produce hydrogen which is volatile .
For the product , only electricity is produced , making it one of the most efficient reactors .
In terms of safety , SFR is safer because of its necessary condition , like temperature and pressure , to operate and the waste it produced .
SFR operates on a temperature around 5500C which for a nuclear plants , this is considered a low temperature for a nuclear plant to operate .
The low temperature indicates that we don't need to manufacture a new kind of material to withstand the temperature .
It can be seen from other concepts; most of the concepts are operated at almost twice the temperature SFR is operating .
SFR is also operating on a pressure around atmospheric level so it's safer because the high pressure will increase not only the stress emitted to the walls of the plant but also the damage if an explosion happens .
Using radioactive material such as Uranium238 , plutonium and lanthanum , the SFR runs a full cycle which nearly consumes all the material to produce electricity .
This means that no radioactive waste released to the public and also no hydrogen as a byproduct .
As no radioactive waste was thrown out , there is no danger of radioactive poisoning .
The risk of explosion is lowered because no hydrogen is produced but it still need to be cautioned as we are using sodium as a coolant and sodium not only explodes if it's in contact with water but also burns if it touches air .
From all the advantage like the low pressure and temperature condition , almost no radioactive waste and no other byproduct like Hydrogen , it can be seen that SFR is the most promising and advantageous model compare to other reactor concepts and it is worth every dollar spent to pursue deeper research and development .
This model's weaknesses like the high capital cost and the danger of using sodium are actually solvable by producing a new metal that incapable of reacting to sodium .

Nuclear energy has been a topic of discussion among the society given the memories of the partial nuclear meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , during which the reactor core exploded  .
The radioactive effects of the aftermath can still be felt even years after the accident with common side effects that include deformities in newborn babies .
The issue of safety is of most concern over the debate of whether nuclear reactors should even be in operation .
The world's natural resources are depleting rapidly fast and there is a need to search for alternatives to meet the ever increasing energy demands of the world .
Generation IV reactors may just be the solution to meet these demands .
In addition , their new designs will address safety issues .
Two of such Generation IV reactors include the very high temperature reactor  and the gas cooled fast reactor  .
Both of these designs incorporate helium as a coolant and produces electricity as well as hydrogen as their energy output  .
However , the favourable VHTR has advantages in performance , safety and cost that outweighs those of the GCFR and thus should be given support for further research and development .
Firstly , the VHTR spot better performance than the GCFR .
The GCFR produces less waste than the VHTR  .
However , with less waste produced means that the same fuel is reused several times .
As a result , the fuel loses its properties to generate energy over time .
In contrast , the VHTR uses fresh fuel each time and therefore , output efficiency remains high .
Furthermore , the VHTR has a higher operating temperature , which is essential in achieving better efficiency , as energy output is dependent on temperature  .
This will result in the VHTR producing more energy with the same amount of fuel .
Secondly , the VHTR incorporates a safety feature that is not present in the GCFR .
The GCFR operates at a much safer lower operating temperature compared to the VHTR .
In contrast , the VHTR operates at a higher operating temperature .
However , the VHTR has a temperature monitoring system that constantly monitors the temperature of the core to prevent any meltdowns from occurring and a proper back up system that continues producing energy during a malfunction .
This is particularly important for a country like France where 80% of its energy depends on nuclear  .
Moreover , with such a system , human intervention can be avoided during emergencies .
Also , we have to understand that every system is bound to fail .
Relying on visual inspection of the core will not do sufficient for the GCFR to meet safety standards .
In addition , the issue of waste recycling in GCFR will pose a huge problem .
Waste recycling will produce plutonium and uranium in its pure form , which is an active ingredient use in the making of nuclear weapons  .
This problem is not present in the VHTR that stores waste instead of recycling them  .
Lastly , implementing the VHTR is more cost saving than GCFR .
The GCFR operates at a lower temperature and thus choices of materials are wider and cheaper as compared to the VHTR .
In contrast , the VHTR needs special materials to withstand high temperatures  .
Thus , the choices of materials are limited and expensive .
However , the VHTR in the long run will be able to balance off the high cost of materials with its high energy output .
Moreover , the VHTR can be implemented 5 years earlier  .
The cost saved can be channeled into many years of project planning and research .
In conclusion , the VHTR should receive further funding for research and development given the advantages it holds over the GCFR .
The VHTR has a better performance in terms of high energy output , a safer design that meets safety standards and ultimately a more cost effective solution .
In July 17 , 1981 , the interconnected second level and fourth level hanging walkways in the Hyatt Regency in Kansas City collapsed , killing 114 and injuring an additional 200 more  .
The reason for this disaster boiled down to gross negligence by the project engineer for not checking with the calculations before agreeing to design changes as a result of material constraints .
The use of psychology as described by Wilpert in preventing the errors in design by the designers who are also only human involves the introduction of applied psychology as a method of curbing the potentially negative effects that may arise from the dynamics of individual and group psychology in design teams .
As described , the inputs of applied psychology can also be provided through the different organizational levels in a design team .
As such , the discussion shall pertain to the application of psychology on three of the organization levels of the architecture firm with the aim of preventing the accident .
These levels are namely:
* The designer
* The process of designing
* The organizational hierarchy of the firm
In the case of the accident at the Hyatt Regency , the introduction of a psychologist to the errant architecture design firm could have brought to light the negligent behavior of the engineer in question .
However , the identification of this particular problem through behavioral observation by a psychologist may not be a good method given that the multitudes of other problems that might occur , thus leaving a lot of the fault-finding process to chance .
Indeed , the application of psychology in the design process should not only be in the form of adding personnel well-versed in psychology .
The implementation of safety orientated intervention practices as discussed by Geller can then help cast a wide net of control over the domains of possible human errors .
Geller's article , albeit written in the context of occupational safety , advocates the use of behavior-based safety techniques as tools to help members of a working unit to take better control of their safety performance .
One particular way of implementation , the "Actively Caring Model" , shows promise of cultivating a work attitude of actively caring for the associated benefits of others through promoting the effects of various psychological states of mind like self-pride in ones' field of work , the effects which could have prevented this accident .
The operation hierarchy of the engineering firm is highlighted as there is only one person who is responsible for approving the designs .
Given the importance of this task and the possible stresses of the job , it can very risky to only have one person in charge .
The utilization of elementary psychology would have prevented this accident as these types of windows of opportunities for risk could have been easily identified and rectified if the firm employed introspective reviewing of its operation .
A significant portion of the systems which have failed did so because of human errors of design .
The increasing size and complexity of modern systems means that there are more opportunities for human errors to creep in .
The resulting system is then too complex for efficient fault-finding for safety insurance .
Therefore it is necessary to apply the studies of human psyche to the design of systems so as to prevent the loss of human life by such errors .
Since the beginning of the 20th century , a number of major engineering accidents have occurred with increasing complexity of large engineering projects .
It is important to study these cases and analyze the causes in order to prevent potential accidents .
This essay will bring one particular accident , the Eschede train disaster , back to the table .
The ICE train accident in Eschede happed in June 1998 .
It causes 101 death and 88 injured , which made it the worst accident in the history of Germany  .
The main factors that lead to the disaster include the failure in wheel and train track design , as well as an inefficient feedback system .
This essay will present that the use of psychology during the design process will improve product safety and it may help prevent the Eschede train disaster .
First of all , if psychology approaches were introduced in the design process , product safety could be better guaranteed .
It is very often that managers of large projects tend to believe that engineers would never make mistakes .
However , the fact is human errors widely exist in engineering designs process , which may result in the failure of product functions  .
In the case of Eschede train disaster , the newly designed high-speed wheels were used for operation without physically tested  .
A single fatigue crack later contributed the most to the train accident .
It reveals the fact that engineers sometime neglect certain steps of design process .
If the wheels were tested and improved before put into service , the accident would likely to be prevented .
Therefore , a human scientist is in need to analyze the design process and ensure every step is completed before the product is commissioned .
In addition , human scientist will focus on factors that are closely related to the design , such as the environment in which the product will be implemented .
Companies hire engineers to design certain product and they expect them to consider every detail related to the design .
But in reality , engineers often focus on the product itself while ignoring the environment .
In the case of high-speed train , the track is important to analyze .
The limit of the track , upon which the ICE train was travelling , was exceeded by the train's maximum speed .
Besides , when travelling from high to low speed track , the train passes through a switch points which caused one carriage to stray from the straight-line .
It is analyzed by scientist that it is likely that the train could have passed safely under the bridge if the track was plain  .
Suppose a human scientist was present during the design process , he probably would remind the engineers to consider the track and the accident would be prevented .
Furthermore , psychologist can help analyze and improve the operating system and company policy of large engineering projects .
Just before the Eschede train disaster occurred , valuable time was lost due to inefficient feedback system .
The train staffs did not stop and exam the problem when a passenger reported strange noise and a large piece of metal coming up through the floor .
Engineers and project manager may not be experts in designing operation rules .
A human scientist can assist them and improve the system .
If the "stop and examine" rule was suggested before the accident for dealing with danger signals , the disaster will be prevented  .
To conclude , using psychology approaches during design process will help improve product safety as well as the efficiency of operating systems .
Human scientists are able to analyze each step of the process and remind engineers the important factors that they ignore .
Many major accidents might be prevented if psychology is involved .
Therefore , it is vital to introduce psychology into engineering design process .
It has been argued for a long time whether the use of the nuclear power should be encouraged or prevented .
In recent years , scientists have developed a new concept of nuclear energyGeneration IV reactors .
Generation IV reactors have features such as high operation temperature , simplified safety measures , and proliferation-resistant  .
One type of Generation IV reactors would be the very-high-temperature reactor  .
Many people think that there should not be any more funding for the research and development of VHTR because of its high cost , low reliability , as well as its potential threats .
However , by considering the tremendous benefits it will bring , funding for further research and development of this reactor should still be encouraged .
One reason that causes the public to disapprove the idea of providing funds for the research and development of VHTR is the high expenses on it which most believe that many countries cannot afford .
In fact , even a prototype of VHTR will cost US$1 billion to build  .
However , despite the actual construction cost in building the reactors , VHTR would be economically beneficial because of its high efficiency in electricity and hydrogen production .
It has been proven that the amount of electricity produced by VHTR will be 50% more than that produced by the older nuclear reactors  .
In fact , many of the developed countries such as the US and Europe have already started the research and development of VHTR and planned to finish by 2021  .
Therefore , if we consider the future benefits that VHTR will bring , the funding would be trivial .
Besides cost , some people also believe that VHTR is unreliable compared to the conventional sources of energy .
The construction of VHTR is to totally replace the conventional sources of energy in order to benefit the human population .
However , its high operating temperature of above 1000 C presents significant challenges in terms of fuel and material development  .
It was also believed that in order to replace the conventional sources of energy , we have to build many huge reactors which would occupy a large area , making the problem of land shortage even worse  .
However , many of these problems have been solved by scientists and researchers in recent years .
Moreover , the new nuclear reactor is able to save our environment by emitting much less waste gases than that produced by burning fossil fuels .
Therefore , we should provide funding for the research and development of VHTR .
Lastly , despite all the safety measures implemented , it is still believed that the nuclear reactors are potentially dangerous .
It is doubtless to say that there is a possibility that radioactive leak will occur .
However , the VHTR has been developed into such a stage that in an event of accident , the reactor itself is able to shutdown itself without human intervention  .
This will greatly reduce the possibility of a radioactive leak and make the nuclear reactors safer than ever .
Another problem may be dumping the nuclear waste which , if not carefully considered , may cause serious consequences  .
However , VHTR has its unique design which makes the disposal of nuclear wastes convenient and safe .
It has a corrosion-resistant repository which collects all the nuclear wastes before they start decay  .
On the whole , the VHTR has showed great potential in becoming the future source of energy .
It is not only more efficient in generating energy , but also more environmentally friendly than those conventional sources of energy .
Therefore , despite the current challenges for this new energy source , the society should provide funding for the research and development of VHTR .
"Robotic surgery is a technique in which a surgeon performs surgery using a computer that remotely controls very small instruments attached to a robot" , according to Robot  .
In fact , robotic surgery has a history of about 75 years , however; it is only during the last 5 years that it was gradually recognized by the medical community .
Because this technology appears to be quite controversial regarding the cost , time required and safety .
Opponents of this technology argue that since this technology is still not mature enough , the cost for the surgery is high , the time required for the surgery is longer than traditional surgery , and there are many variables that will affect the safety of the patients .
However , the opponents failed to consider the advantages of this technology compared to traditional surgery; and for some of the problems of this technology , solutions are available .
The time required to perform this surgery is twice longer than traditional surgery  .
As a result , patients may have higher risk of encountering danger during the surgery .
According to the data collected by David and SamadiRobot Oncology , 2009 , robotic surgery is not the longest surgery , and it is about less than 20 minutes longer than the open surgery . . Usually the surgery will performed with back up treatment .
Furthermore , with the development of the technology and more experienced surgeons , the time will become shorter .
The size of the machine is too huge , making it impossible for assistant surgeons to help perform the surgery .
Moreover , the variables involved in the surgery are too many for a machine to handle .
With the development of new software and hardware , minimizing the size of robots can be achieved  .
The role of robots in the surgery is just to help the surgeons instead of performing the surgery by itself .
Thus , any situations happens during the surgery can be handled by the trained and experienced surgeons .
In addition , robot arms may contain more checking functions to help check the inside of tissues .During robotic surgery , the surgeon can more easily see the area being operated on .
More importantly , less blood lose , less infection and small incisions make the procedure safer and less painful .
Although this nascent technology has its disadvantages regarding cost , time and safety , both technological and non-technological solutions are almost possible to overcome those problems .
Researches in this field , increasing training of surgeons , and improvements of other significant issues are conducted to achieve better acceptance of this technology .
Given more time , this technology will prove its efficiency by giving us fruitful research results and evidence-based outcomes .
Hopefully , robotic surgery will possibly improve our surgical practice and bring high quality of surgical care to patients .
While the demand of energy is constantly increasing , earth is running low in coal , oil , and gas supply .
Based on 2003 rates of production of fossil fuels , the global oil , gas , and coal reserves were predicted to exhaust in the next 41 , 67 .1 , and 192 years respectively  .
Due to the scarcity of fossil fuels , nuclear power made its way back onto the table .
The concept of Generation IV reactors was introduced and the several countries in the Generation IV International Forum  were in favor of the Very High Temperature Reactors  .
However , safety , cost , and performance are the three main reasons for opposition to the VHTR .
Even with these three reasons , there is still a need to do further research and development funding for it .
Opponents of VHTR claim that production of nuclear energy is expensive .
Special materials are required to build a nuclear reactor .
The construction costs for VHTR will be significantly higher compared to other power plants .
However , the construction cost of the nuclear reactor is a fixed cost and the nuclear power plant will be operating for a long period of time .
Eventually , in the long-run , the fixed cost would be minimal .
According to The Economics of Nuclear Power  , uranium has the tendency to yield about 20 ,000 times as much energy as the same amount of coal .
The cost of uranium is also much lower compared to oil , gas and coal .
In addition , if the coal-fired power plants were to pay a carbon tax-a tax based on the carbon they release into the atmosphere , then the energy generated by VHTR would be much cheaper .
Another reason for opposition is the danger of the operation of nuclear reactors .
Haunted by the memories of the catastrophe at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and Chernobyl in Ukraine , the public requires some convincing  .
One of the main safety principles for Generation IV reactors is the concept of defence in depth .
This concept involves several "overlapping layers of safety and multiple barriers , such that if one safety provision should fail , another will be available to prevent unacceptable damage from occurring"  .
Hence , with multiple layer of safety , operation of VHTR would not pose any threat to the public .
The final argument purpose by opponents is availability of the coolant of VHTR .
VHTR uses helium as a coolant which is extracted from natural gas reserves .
Given the fact that natural gas reserves is depleting , the same goes to helium as well .
Hence , VHTR will not be able to operate in the absence of helium .
The characteristic of helium as an inert gas had made helium recyclable  .
Furthermore , having helium exposed to radiation in the nuclear reactor does not turn helium into a radioactive compound .
VHTR could recycle their coolants and requires minimal addition of helium from time to time .
In a nutshell , the opponent's reasons are debatable .
Energy generated by VHTR is abundant , inexpensive , safe and reliable .
Nuclear energy will do more good than harm to the human mankind .
Therefore , further research and development funding for the very-high-temperature reactors should be supported not only by GIF but also other countries as well .

The first nuclear power plant provided electricity to the power grid in the 1950s .
What separates the first nuclear plant from recent one is the reactor , which has undergone a series of advancements .
The reactor has evolved from Generation I to Generation III over the past five decades with Generation IV being the next prototype .
However , the one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built over the years is public opposition .
Despite the public claiming that nuclear energy is dangerous , an expensive form of energy or of poor performance , the use of molten salt reactor can address their protestations with new designs of the reactor and a cheaper , cleaner and sustainable form of energy .
Thesis statement
The major reactor meltdown happened in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and in 1986 at Chernobyl , Ukraine .
Close to a hundred people died and a few thousand people suffered from cancer due to exposure to radiation from the reactor meltdown over the decades .
Hence , the radioactive materials are contained within the chamber and if there is a reactor meltdown , the release of large amount of radiation can be prevented .
Most of the public has the misconception that nuclear energy is expensive therefore opposing it .
However , it is easy to conclude without substantiating with a proper cost analysis .
The cost of building a nuclear plant is admittedly more than other kind of power plants but the consideration should be based on performance and cost per unit energy .
According to statistics from the Nuclear Energy Institute , nuclear power plants have achieved increasingly higher capacity factors with the same or greater levels of safety over the past two decades .
In the United States , for example , the average capacity factor for nuclear plants in operation in 1980 was 56 .3 percent .
By 1990 , it had risen to 66 percent , and in 2007 to 91 .8 percent . 
Some oppositions of nuclear energy argue that coal reserves can last another 120 years and funds should be spent on researching technology for coal .
However , this is based on the assumption that coal is used solely for producing electricity .
In fact , coal is an alternative raw material to manufacture plastics in place of oil which will be depleted in 40 years , meaning that coal will last much lesser than the allegedly 120 years .
Unlike coal , nuclear energy uses the fission of atoms to generate electricity .
There are many types of elements and their isotopes available for fission like Thorium , Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 , and reprocessing is possible , resulting in at least a thousand more years for nuclear energy .
The burning of coal also produces carbon dioxide and other air pollutants , contributing to the global warming .
Thus , nuclear energy could be a long term solution and it does not contribute to global warming .
It is evident that the claims from the oppositions of nuclear energy are flawed .
In spite of them claiming that nuclear energy is unsafe , pricey and of low output , there are researches and data to show otherwise with Generation IV reactors .
In conclusion , it could be a wise decision for the public to evaluate nuclear energy as a form of energy and eventually , support further research and development funding for it .
Nuclear reactors are often believed to be accompanied with the danger of leak and explosion .
However , few people know that the Generation IV Reactors , which will be put into use in about 10 to 20 years' time , will produce energy that can be "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant" , just like what Spencer Abraham , one of the US energy secretaries , said at the 2002 gathering of GIF  representatives .
The VHTR  is one of these reactors .
It can produce heat and hydrogen simultaneously with an outlet temperature as high as 1000 C . Although there are still many people concerning about the safety and economy factors , the VHTR is indeed one of the most advanced and valuable design in the world and deserves further research and development funding for it .
Even among all the Generation IV Reactors , the VHTR has the highest operating temperature .
The higher the temperature is the higher heat resisting level the materials must achieve .
So some people worry that whether the existing materials could meet the needs or not .
And in case of accident , the very severe reaction may be difficult to control .
In fact , the VHTR uses Helium as the coolant and graphite as the material of the core .
Helium is a kind of inert gas and will seldom react even in the very high temperature .
Numerous tests and calculations have shown that it is nearly impossible to burn high-purity , nuclear-grade graphite , since graphite could be heated to more than 1650  C without incurring ignition or self-sustained combustion .
Therefore , during the normal circumstance , there will be no problem for the materials to stand the requiring high temperature .
Moreover , the reactor adapts the self-regulating system .
If there is some trouble , the reaction will automatically stop and the temperature will gradually cool down to avoid dangers .
The earliest VHTR will not appear on the earth until 2020 while the research has began since 1990s with a total research funding of more than 1 .6 billion dollars .
Opponents may argue that it will cost too much to make the design into practice .
It is true that the early investment of VHTR is much higher than the existing normal nuclear reactor or others; however , the VHTR could produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with other conventional plants , and its deign life is as long as 60 years compared with 40 years of the normal nuclear reactors .
Besides , the VHTR can gain hydrogen through regular running , which could be converted into electricity for cars and homes .
In other words , the side products are worth a great deal of money .
So , it is easy to find that after long period of running , the total cost of VHTR will not exceed that of other existing reactors any more .
In conclusion , the VHTR has own safety features , such as very high system temperature , enhanced reliability , low system pressure and so on .
The early research and development cost might be high but in the long run there seems no obvious difference .
So it is worth developing and investing .
The two general IV nuclear reactors that we will be discussing are very high temperature reactor  and gas cooled fast reactor  .
I personally feel that VHTR deserves more funding and research than GCFR in terms of performance , safety and cost .
The similarities between these two reactors are both using helium as a coolant , no need working at high pressure and producing same output of hydrogen and electricity .
.
We will be comparing which reactors should have more emphasis to have further research and development funding for it .
In terms of performance , Gas cooled fast reactors are dependent on VHTR in terms of modification in design and characteristic , minimizing the effort required for GCFR .
.
the waste material produced by GCFR is being recycled .
As a result , there is a decrease in efficiency as it is being used many times and loses its capability to generate the same amount of energy .
.
In addition , according to theory , we know that output efficiency is dependent on temperature .
So a higher operating temperature of VHTR would allow for more electricity to be produced as compared to gas cooled reactors .
Not only that , the waste material being produced by gas cooled fast reactors is pure plutonium and this material is mainly used for weapon making .
This is dangerous if it goes out of hand .
In terms of safety or security , there is a temperature monitoring system in VHTR to ensure safety .
It monitors the reactors to avoid any meltdown .
Such system does not exist in gas cooled reactors that operates at lower temperature .
.
VHTR has a better back-up system .
In the event of sudden shutdown due to malfunction , VHTR still can produce energy .
.
It is especially useful for country like France , which 80% of the electricity generated is dependent on nuclear energy .
.
For GCFR , there is a presence of safe accommodation of low thermal inertia and poor heat transfer properties of coolant .
In VHTR , waste is not recycled but instead stored away .
In conclusion , I personally feel that VHTR does deserve more research and funding in it than gas cooled fast reactors .
This is because it is better in terms of performance , cost and safety .
The incoming shortage of energy and nature fuels is enhancing the price of electricity in China , India and other developing countries .
At the meanwhile , the globle warming and other environmental concerns are pushing the entire world to some more powerful , sustainable and clean solutions for future energy .
Our future method should also be safty , economic , efficient and flexble for applications .
In order to satisfy all the requirements , nuclear power is the one with a high chance among the realistic alternatives .
Nevertheless , the current common nuclear power reactant  is not ideal due to its high cost and security considerations .
Therefore , we need some other nuclear solutions for future reactants , the molten salt reactor , is one of the most promising .
For the consideration of Economic motivation , the Oak Ridge National Laboratory  has made capital and operating cost estimates based on detailed conceptual studies of various MSRs .
The result showed that the capital of MSR is 20 .1 $/MWh and the total cost is 38 .4$/MWh .
Compared with 15 .8$/MWh and 41 .9$/MWh of normal coal reactants the MSR is actually 7% lower than the pressurized water reactant and 8% lower than coal , which gave an encouraging result .
Nevertheless , the capital cost of MSR is relatively much higher than common reactors , which may be the overwhemling limitation for developing countries .
Finally , since MSR use redioactive materials , it is necessary to concern about waste transmutation and nuclear proliferation .
Concluding from the study of Bj rn Becker , Massimiliano Fratoni and Ehud Greenspan , "the MSR core using LiF  , NaF  and BeF2  salt without graphite offers the best neutron balance , most compact design and alleviated graphite lifetime problem ."
and the critical MSR also provides a very high transmutation capability "fissioning of over 99% of the TRU fed , accounting for loss of actinides in the process of soluble FP extraction from the MS . " Moreover , the Thorium's fuel cycle in MSR resists proliferation .
The Th230 produced will contaminate the Th232 breeding material and is inseparable from it .
When Th230 decays , it emmits strong gamma-ray ,which would harm the electrons needed to process the chain reaction of U232 .
Besides , the consentration of Th232 is only 9% , which is far away from the concentrition of building weapons .
To sum up , MSR is qualified as a future nuclear reactant .
Therefore it worth more research on its development .
People hardly link engineering problems with psychology since the previous one belongs to pure technology problems while the later one is a branch of social science .
However , as time comes along , psychology is gradually applied in various fields , including law , medicine , architecture , design and so on .
People start to consider whether psychology can be applied to the field of engineering , so does Wilpert Bernhard , an expert from Institute of Psychology and Ergonomics , Technical University of Berlin .
Wilpert .
He pointed out that psychology is crucial to engineering process , especially to highly complex socio-technical systems with high risks , since the application of psychology can reduce the risk and prevent accidents from happening .
I agree with his point that psychology works well in mitigating accidents .
First of all , occupational mistakes is the main reason of triggering accidents as well as in mitigating consequences , so applying psychology can help people make less mistakes and prevent accidents from happening .
On 20 , April , 2004 , the Nicoll Highway collapsed when a tunnel was being constructed for use by MRT , which killed four people and injured three .
It was one of the largest failures of a civil engineering project under construction in about 50 years  .
The main fault is the original design misinterpreted the local geology and overestimated the soil shear strength , which results in the falling down of the whole structure  .
People who oppose applying psychology may argue that this accident is due to technical problems , having nothing to do with psychology .
However , the misinterpretation of local earth is a typical incident of occupational hazards which is at the center of psychological attention .
Psychology help engineers find the root of the problems instead of staying on the surface of the problems .
Applying psychology , engineers can analyze the reason from a more objective and more scientific angel .
After a complete analysis and a better understanding of mistakes , the possibilities of making mistakes can be reduced , thus can prevent accidents from happening .
Secondly , the ineffective communication and misunderstanding between departments , between sponsors and contractors also lead to engineering accidents .
Applying psychology can tackle this problem .
Another error of Nicoll Highway collapse is made in detailing the structural connections for the structural bracing system .
When one bracing was overloaded , there was inadequate capacity to redistribute the loads among the remaining supporters .
Apart from this , the loads of the strut used were smaller than expected .
The previous two errors directly resulted in the catastrophic failure of this project .
People may argue that these two errors are design errors , irrelevant to psychology .
However , analyzing the source of the errors , it is not hard to find that the poor communication and cooperation between different departments are liable for this accident .
If the designers and material scientists communicate frequently , they may find the flaws in the bracing system .
If the quality inspector is aware of his liability , he may be more careful when he or she is testing the strength of strut .
To be concise , as a whole integrity which is accountable for a project , each department should be aware of the importance of their work , the effective communication and cooperation between each other .
With psychology , the engineers will become aware of this and probably the accident will not happen .
Lastly , no technology can bloom without considering social factors , such as economy , marketing and so on .
A third reason of Nicoll Highway collapse is due to the poor quality of the supporting material and equipment .
Wilpert  pointed out that the final objective of a project is to meet user expectation and social need .
Contractors only focus on profit and omit the most important thing that user and society expect- the safety of a product or a project .
People may hold the opinion that even with psychology , the fact of better quality and less profit can not be changed , so psychology is not useful in this case .
Nevertheless , with psychology applying in this project , every social factor will be considered and balanced , which means creating the best quality at the lowest cost instead of lowering the quality to make more profit .
In this sense , psychology can help engineers make better quality product and earn more profit , which indirectly mitigates the possibility of accidents .
To sum up , psychology should be applied in the field of engineering because psychology can help engineers find the root of mistakes , help engineers to communicate effectively and cooperate smoothly with other and finally help engineers to develop the products which will meet social need .
To conclude , applying psychology in engineering process can prevent accidents from happening .

People nowadays have fierce controversy over the use of nuclear power due to the appalling nuclear accidents happened at Three Mile island and Chernobyl , or even the recent nuclear accident at Sellafield , England .
These accidents destroy cities , take people's lives and leave many deadly post-effects in the future decades .
Then , why do people continue using nuclear power ?
In fact , nuclear power is the cheapest power people can produce  .
Therefore , facing this benefit , safety becomes the main concern when people choose to continue using nuclear power .
A series of generation IV nuclear reactors are newly designed for better efficiency , in the meantime , they are also improved on safety issues .
Among all the reactors , supercritical water reactor  is outstanding for its high thermal efficiency and also better reliability .
However , opponents argue that SCWR is not reliable since it has no prototype .
Moreover , SCWR is operating under very high temperature and pressure , which makes SCWR less likely to be further developed .
Even though SCWR has not been tested yet , it is proved to have less possibility to cause nuclear accidents that happened before; it is easier to implement compared to other generation VI reactors , and it has a relatively high thermal efficiency which makes its long-term cost relatively low .
Firstly , opponents may doubt the safety and reliability of SCWR .
This doubt arises from the lack of knowledge of the design of this reactor .
The nuclear accident happened at Chernobyl was mainly because the nuclear plant utilized positive void coefficient of reactivity , causing it impossible to stop the working process when things went wrong .
On the contrary , SCWR uses negative void coefficient instead , which could effectively reduce the possibility of this kind of fatal accidents  .
Finally , SCWR has a higher thermal efficiency of 44% compared to LWR of 33-35%  .
However , opponents may point out that this high thermal efficiency is achieved at the expense of operating under very high temperature and pressure , which could increase its potential danger .
This concern is necessary but SCWR has overcome this issue .
The coolant in the SCWR system is supercritical water , which has very high specific heat , so that it is very effective acting as a coolant .
Besides , this system is simple to construct and control since only one phase of coolant is present throughout the process  .
Therefore , the safety issue concerning high temperature and pressure is overcome to some extent .
To sum up , although there exists disagreement of the use of SCWR due to its issue of reliability and safety , SCWR is worthy for further research because it bases on two current technologies , which increases its reliability , and its design principle improves its thermal efficiency compared to LWR and reduce the possibility of causing nuclear accidents .
Hopefully , SCWR could be better improved on current problems in the future development .
Given the memories of the two accidents happened in 1979 at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and in 1986 at Chernobyl of Ukraine , some people may still have not recovered from the great horror when they hear nuclear power .
However , instead of nuclear power , the fossil fuels people have been using are bringing various challenges to human beings .
On one hand , people are facing the challenge of energy shortage because fossil fuels are nonrenewable .
On the other hand , burning fossil fuels produces the "green gases" such as carbon dioxide that have resulted serious problems like global warming .
Therefore , some high-efficient , sufficient and environment-friendly energy is urged .
And because of high-efficiency and cleanliness , nuclear power is coming back into human consideration .
Recently , the generation IV International Forum  came up with six generation IV reactor concepts .
Among the six reactors , the Very-high-temperature reactor  stands out and may probably be the first choice as future fuel although some people may worry about its safety and cost .
Opponents may also argue that VHTR will cost a lot .
It is a fact that the cost for VHTR is high .
But among the 6 generation IV reactors , the cost of the VHTR is the second lowest , which is about $670 million .
Except the Sodium-cooled fast reactor  whose cost is $610 million , the cost of the other 4 reactors ranges from $870 to $1000 million .
However , the VHTR can generate electricity with high efficiency , which is over 50% at 1000 C , whereas , normally other reactors only have an efficiency of 33%-50%  .
Moreover , VHTR produces hydrogen for vehicles' fuel .
And the US Department of Energy  has claimed "Without a switch to hydrogen , the energy demand from US transport alone will cause the nation's oil imports to soar by 78% by 2025" .
Thus , USDE has made the VHTR its first choice  .
To conclude , it should be evident the arguments against the safety and cost of VHTR are invalid .
Since VHTR uses helium as coolant , the research of the materials for VHTR is also ongoing , and also there are unique designs for VHTR , the safety of VHTR would be enhanced a lot .
Besides , compared with other generation IV reactors , VHTR costs less .
Furthermore , VHTR produces hydrogen as future fuel , which is environment-friendly and can effectively solve the energy shortage as well .
Therefore , VHTR is the promising and practical power .
According to recent findings , the current fossil fuel reserves are expected to be depleted in less than 40 years  and at the same time our energy consumption is increasing exponentially .
So , does mankind have a solution ?
Actually , we do and the answer is non-conventional sources of energy like Wind , Geothermal , Hydroelectric , Solar energy and the most promising one being Nuclear Energy .
The current generation of nuclear reactors look very promising , though not all of them seem to address the problems of safety , cost and performance .
However , one particular reactor seems to address all these problems , the VHTR  .
Firstly , the VHTR has a core outlet temperature of about 1000 degrees Celsius this high temperature increases the efficiency of reactor and also enables us to use it for applications such as hydrogen production  .
The hydrogen produced can be used in automobiles , which in turn help decrease the carbon emissions by 30% when compared to modern day diesel engines  .
Although some people have raised the argument that current generation materials which are used to build nuclear reactors cannot withstand such high temperatures , it is now safe to say that an ideal candidate for the material has been found .
The material is moulded and extruded fine grained isotropic graphite which can be used for both core and support applications .
This is the same material which is being used in the Japanese , South African and Chinese high temperature test reactors  and has proven to be very successful .
Secondly , the reactor has been designed with a lot of safety concerns in mind .
After seeing the incidents at the 3 Mile Island and Chernobyl , people are worried about having a nuclear reactor in their country and have questioned the safety of the Generation IV reactors .
The VHTR is designed to operate on a pebble bed core in which the fuel is coated with silicon carbide which ensures that the radioactive fissile material never leaves fuel spheres or pebbles  .
The reactor is helium cooled and uses graphite moderated core , which takes advantage of the fact that the helium coolant is inert and has no reactivity effects and that graphite has a high thermal inertia and is stable at high temperatures  .Also , any waste produced goes directly to the repository and this means an additional waste recycling process can be avoided .Thus , in case of any failure the damage does not spread to the surrounding regions but is contained within the plant itself .
Lastly , most of the technology involved in the VHTR is already in its development phase and the reactor can be shelled out as early as 2020 Butler , Nuclear Power's New Dawn , 2004) .
This is a deciding factor as the current reserves of fossil fuels won't last long and the sooner we make nuclear power the mainstream source of energy , the better it would be for us and Mother Nature .
Although people might suggest the use of Carbon Capture and Storage in the existing power plants , which costs less and decreases the CO2 emissions to a great extent , it should be pointed out that this is merely a solution to delay the problem that we would eventually face .
In summary , it can be concluded that nuclear power is the answer to the current energy crisis and the VHTR is an ideal candidate because it not only produces thermal and electric energy efficiently but also provides hydrogen which can help decrease CO2 emissions .
It is also much safer than the current generation reactors and has been well designed to counter any possible error that might occur due to human or technological factors .
Clearly , the reactor is the future of nuclear power generation .
There was a train disaster occurred on 3 June 1998 near a small town in Lower Saxony , Germany .
No one would have thought it would happen .
Such a super fast , state-of-the-art Inter Express trains of German Railways rolled out of tracks and split in two , due to a bridge falling onto the train .
It resulted 101 dead and 88 injured .
Although there were many causes to be pointed out to cause this train accident , I think the biggest cause is that no one is aware of the importance of the use of psychology during the design process .
It was reported that the directly cause was a wheel with a composite construction which is relatively common on light railway transit vehicles , but are unique to ICE 884 in high speed trains replaced the original wheel .
Furthermore , those replaced wheels just were inspected regularly .
However , it has still carried out some of discussion about the difficulties of such inspections and the frequency with which they take place to be used to debate with the method .
It cannot be denied that this is a human mistake which can be avoided by applying the psychology .
Psychology can make engineers aware that they are not only the normal person , but also are professionals .
Their professional specialty can change other people's life , even save a life .
If they understand that , I believe that the engineers would not use those composite construction wheels and wheels which have not been checked properly and approved that can be used without any potential problems .
Observing the pictures which recorded the scene of accident , there at least one of the cars detached its underframe .
It showed another construction problem of the train - the car's ability to contain its occupants was severely compromised .
It was reported that the construction of ICE did not follow traditional practice .
The floor forms parts of the underframe were welded onto the body .
In order to pursue the high-speed , the bodies were made from aluminum extrusions instead of steel to achieve light weight .
However , the heat-treated method for achieving light weight affected and reduced the tensile strength at the site of the weld .
If designers considered more about that for the high-speed trains must take into account the forces to be absorbed in the event of the vehicle being in a collision , there would not be so many people who were thrown through the air to injure , even die .
After the accident , there were other causes to be found to result this disaster .
Indeed , all the causes can be reduced , even avoided , as long as consider the use of the psychology during the design process .
It was known that the track which ICE 884 was travelling was not a dedicated high-speed line .
It was shared with other slower services .
Although it has been upgraded for high-speed trains , it still less than the ICE's maximum service speed .
If government can understand that although the tracks were upgraded to try to match the ICE's maximum speed as much as possible , there is the fact that the maximum speed exists; I think government would plan to construct a new line for ICE 884 instead of upgrading the tracks .
To sum up , any design process is applied psychology can minimize a probability of danger , even can avoid .
Because all design processes are to fulfill needs of human; and all products are produced by human .
Therefore , anything as long as people-oriented will get the biggest benefits .
Of course , can avoiding accident occurred is the biggest benefits for people .
Introduction
The Chernobyl accident that happened on 26 April 1986 , has led everyone to realize the damages and consequences that we might face when we built a nuclear power plant .
Nonetheless , the Chernobyl accident was an outcome due to an old technology and poor management in the past .
In the next 50 years , demand for energy would definitely double with rapidly growing technology and production  .
In conclusion , although the there are several advantages of the VHTR but however there are factors that makes it difficult to implement as it is more expensive and limited by choices of construction materials as compared with the GCFR .
I would give my fullest support for the concept of GCFR among the six concepts proposed in the Generation IV International forum .
Nonetheless , the decision to implement the reactors still falls in the hands of the countries that are highly interested as budget for every country is different . 
With present day technologies , the Generation IV International Forum has proposed six new and advance nuclear reactors .
The six nuclear reactors are not only sustainable and economically viable solutions; they are also safe and reliable source of energy .
Among the six concepts of nuclear reactors , the Very High Temperature Reactor ,  and the Gas Cooled Fast Reactor ,  are quite similar , but has more benefits than VHTR in terms of performance , sustainability and cost .
Performance
VHTR is a high performance reactor which uses helium to cool the heating components during operation .
VHTR uses a mixed fuel composition to operate and this composition can produce improvement in fuel performance thus making it a very effective reactor in generating electricity .
This composition is a mixture of 15% carbide and 85% oxide in the fissile particles .
GCFR is a concept which uses the reference design of VHTR , thus it is also a reactor of high performance .
Since GCFR operates at 850 degrees Celsius , therefore there are more choices of materials that can be used in the construction of GCFR .
Because GCFR operates at a lower temperature as compare to the VTHR , therefore the materials used for construction is cheaper and there are more choices of material available .
Sustainability
GCFR is an excellent choice in terms of sustainability because it is capable in minimizing radioactive waste more effectively as compared to the VHTR .
The nuclear waste of the GCFR is able to be put back into the process multiple times , and this reduces the nuclear waste produced .
The reduction of radioactive waste uses processes called pryo-chemical or hydrometallurgical .
With this there is a great reduction of nuclear waste , and money can be saved on building a storage site for nuclear waste .
Therefore , GCFR not only can have efficient energy conversion with the current design but also has an economic benefit outcome . 
Cost
The cost for building a VHTR prototype would cost US $1 .1 billion .
However for GCFR , the total ten year budget of GCFR is US $940 million and it includes the cost from planning to completion of the reactor .
However this is shared by all eight Generation IV International Forum members .
Therefore the annual budget for each country is US $7-8 million .
In this budget , the required sum of construction cost is US $300 million . 
Conclusion
Nowadays , since the fossil fuel is running out at a very high rate , people are seeking another alternative energy resource to replace the traditional fossil fuel resources , which have been used by human for hundreds of years .
One of the alternatives is nuclear power .
However , public is very concern about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Actually , with the improvement of technology , the generation IV reactors are safe enough .
Moreover , these generation IV reactors are also very economic and promising .
Amongst these generation IV reactor concepts , I think the lead-cooled fast reactor is very competent and should get further research and development funding .
With regard to safety , people are usually afraid of the accident caused by the nuclear reactors .
This is because that once a nuclear reactor accident happened , it would be a huge disaster to both the creatures and the environment within that area .
A very famous accident , which is also used by public to oppose building nuclear reactors , is the accident at Chernobyl which happened on 26 April 1986 .
As a result of this accident , 28 people were killed either immediately or within a few years , and 17 more died during the next ten years .
Moreover , according to the estimation , there would be thousands of people dead from cancer in the next forty years .
Another famous example is the accident happening at the nuclear power station at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania on 28 March 1979 .
Although at Three Mile Island the discharge of radioactive material was too small to cause any harm , it still caused a great public reaction  .
But for Lead-cooled fast reactors , people do not need to worry much about safety .
The temperature needed to operate lead-cooled fast reactors is about five hundred and fifty to eight hundred , which is relatively higher than today's light-water reactors and can avoid the risk of coolant boiling , and the pressure is rather low  .
More importantly , unlike some other materials like sodium , lead does not react with either water or air .
These features give lead-cooled fast reactors a significant safety advantage .
Furthermore , as the technology has improved so much , even an accident happens , the damage is probably not that big .
For example , in the Three Mile Island accident , nobody was either dead or injured .
All radioactivity was contained as designed .
Therefore , lead-cooled fast reactors are very competent in this aspect of safety .
Besides safety , economy is also a very important aspect which people should take into consideration .
At present , to build a nuclear reactor is still costly .
According to a study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  , even reducing completion time to just four or five years , and lowering construction costs by a quarter , would still not put the nuclear plants in contention with coal , and would just barely match the price performance of a combined-cycled natural gas-powered plant   .
However , since we can eliminate the need for an intermediate heat transport circuit in lead-cooled fast reactors , and lead is relatively cheap comparing with other materials used in other fast reactors , a large part of cost would be saved through this .
In addition , the high temperature of the lead-cooled fast reactors can also be used for thermochemical hydrogen production , which would contribute to reducing the cost as well .
According to Weaver  , the lead-cooled fast reactor has a fifteen to thirty years' core lifetime .
That is quite long .
And furthermore , the earliest delivery time for lead-cooled fast reactors is 2025  , which is not far away from now .
And because of its safe and economic property , we can certainly expect a good performance from lead-cooled fast reactors .
In conclusion , with the improvement of technology , nuclear power is becoming a very reasonable alternative for us human beings to choose to replace today's fossil energy resource .
Furthermore , the lead-cooled fast reactor is competent to get further research and development funding , because it is both safe and economic .
The prospective of lead-cooled fast reactor is very promising .
In a modern society , engineering design products are everywhere around us .
I t is true that those products provide us with much convenience; however , at the same time , there are also chances that it brings some dangers as side effects .
Chernobyl explosion is one example showing the seriousness of those dangers .
Chernobyl accident , happened in 1986 , was a nuclear reactor accident .
The explosion finally led to the evacuation and resettlement of over 336 ,000 people .
CITATION Int08 \l 2052  Because of that , the safety of engineering design is very important .
We must have some gatekeepers to protect us .
In current stage , most design team uses the safety laws and rules as their gatekeeper and thinks that is enough .
However , some psychologists argues that those rules are not enough as all the procedures are carried out by human , there is possibility that a human error may occur .
Therefore psychologists are necessary to be involved in the design process to detect the human error and to be the new gate keeper of engineering design .
In my opinion , with a psychologist involved in the design process , possibility of future failure or even disaster can be reduced though may be at a higher cost .
Chernobyl accident can be a good example to see how the use of psychology helps to prevent the accident .
Last of all , designers , especially the group leaders may worry about the cost of employing psychologists in their teams .
However , considering the serious results of Chernobyl accidents and other engineering accidents , such wondering is of no point .
After all , the lives have no price .
And by decreasing the accident and failure rate of the products of one design group , they will earn more chances and reputation .
Such results will lead to more profits .
In conclusion , psychologists may become new gatekeepers of engineering design process by helping correct the human error in design process and increase the team efficiency .
Together with the present rules and laws of safety design , the presence of psychologists decreases the chance of having future failure and accidents .
And the increasing safety will make people enjoy the benefits of engineering design products much better .
As design is defined to be a human activity which aims at altering products' properties or functionalities so as to meet social expectation  , there have been controversies on whether psychology should be considered as an influential factor in the design process or not .
Some insist that insights can be gained when analyzing design process using psychological approach .
However , there are also voices arguing that most of product or system designs are merely driven by technology  .
Both sides of evidences taken into consideration , psychology should be considered as an important factor that is influencing design due to its crucial role in facilitating interactions of social and technological factors , analyzing human expectations as well as planning work process of design .
First of all , psychology serves as the crucial connection between social and technological factors .
Design itself is to combine human expectations and standards with technical specializations .
No matter what the designers are to work on , complex systems or everyday products , psychology is helpful to gain insights of problems that may be encountered or prevent undesirable accidents .
For everyday products design , it is quite understandable that if the technical configurations are similar for all , psychology could help designers make a difference by humanly consider making improvements that are more user-friendly in design .
More impactful consequences of not applying psychology in design are that serious failures can happen in complex projects and systems hence cause loss of life .
For instance , the collapse of Nicall Highway , two stretches of highway road linked by Merdeka Bridge , located in the Central Region of Singapore  , could have been prevented if psychological approach were adopted in the design and construction process .
For the Nicoll Highway incident , some argue that it is merely constrained by technology and only causes are engineering problems .
While it is true that the restrictions set by technology limitations are direct cause for the engineering failure , the application of psychology could help to overcome the negative effects of technology difficulties .
In complex systems like the Nicoll Highway case , management and balance amongst understanding of technical level , small parts of operations , and control of the whole working process is crucial  .
Numerous journals written by engineers and professionals analyzing this disaster were all very absorbed by civil engineering details and theories after Nicoll Highway collapsed , but the disaster was concluded to be unexpected as technology should have been sufficient for this construction project  .
This means that it is not shortcomings in technology that necessarily lead to engineering failure , but lack of psychological analysis .
Finally , another deeper understanding of the importance of psychology in design process can be gained from the Nicoll Highway tragedy .
When some were arguing for objective difficulties in technology , it was admitted by the main contractor that major cause is the overload temporary works and their low quality  .
The contractor admitted that they had foreseen the potential problems that might be caused due to overloading temporary work and their reckless plan , but they somehow still did not pay enough attention and continued with it .
It consequently led to lack of time for examining everything with enough caution and designers even misinterpreted building codes in such a rush .
If it were not for the inappropriate workload distributed and carelessness misinterpretation of building code by design engineers , such failures could have been avoided .
In conclusion , psychology plays a significant role in the design process , as it serves as essential connections between social and technological factors , influences and reflects social expectations , it can be applied to avoid technical errors and failures in complex systems and be used to optimize design plan .
Applying a psychology approach when analyzing or planning a design is crucial and beneficial to ensure safety as well as quality .
It is known that global warming and rising energy consumption are the major challenges for people to solve in the near future .
In order to resolve such problems , a few nuclear reactors have been built in the past decades .
As it is not sufficient to provide energy power and not environmentally friendly , a new set of theoretical nuclear reactor designs are currently being researched to satisfy the requirement of energy .
Research into these reactor types was officially started based on several initial goals .
The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety , efficient thermal performance , reducing cost .
Many reactors are considered to design to meet the generation IV goals today .
Two of the generation IV reactors called Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor and Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor are highly appreciated and accepted in modern nuclear power plant system .
In terms of performance , security , cost , both of two reactors are well designed .
However , to compare the two fast reactors specifically , it is better to choose Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor as the new reactor to meet the generation IV nuclear plan instead of Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor .
To begin with , truly speaking , Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor has high thermal efficiency which converts the raw material to the power energy with range from 39% to 47% .
Comparing with the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor , Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor has the thermal efficiency about 48% , which is generally higher than sodium-cooled fast reactor .
In addition , under the high performance , both of two reactors need to work under high temperature .
Specifically , for Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor , the temperature is about 550 while the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor is about 850 .
Hence , from general chemical knowledge , it is more convenient and efficient to convert energy under higher temperature .
In thermal performance , both of two reactors have quite nice feature especially for energy conversion; Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor may have additional advantages .
Furthermore , in terms of cost , Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor enhanced economics achieved with the use of high burn-up fuels , fuel cycle benefits .
It uses advanced materials and innovative design options to reduce in power plant capital cost and lower operating cost .
However , Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor is also well designed especially for waste recycling; GFR tries to minimize the release of gaseous and liquid effluents to environment .
It takes into account that the management of waste from equipment is also important .
GFR system is designed to allow for self-treatment by applying fuel manufacturing operations .
In addition , GFR can direct energy conversion .
Hence , it makes best use of energy and reduces the entire cost . 
In conclusion , both of Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor and Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor achieve generation IV primary goal to satisfy the requirement of energy .
Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor works with quite good thermal efficiency under a lower temperature when compares to Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor .
Moreover , it is designed well in safety case and cost aspect .
Similarly , GFR system offers significant potential to advance generation IV sustainability goals through its thermal efficiency , direct energy conversion , safety arrangement and proper cost .
Over all , Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor has advantages over Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor with respect to thermal efficiency , security case and cost .
According to Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary , the word "accident" means something bad which happens that is not expected or intended , and which often damages something or injures someone .
Accidents are indeed unpredictable , but are they really unpreventable ?
Let us have a quick scan through one of the world's deadliest high-speed train accident- the Eschede train disaster , which hit a death toll of 101 .
Post accident investigation has shown that the main factors that contribute to this severe train accident are the wheel design of the train , maintenance of the train , and failure to stop the train .
Could this accident have probably been prevented if the usage of psychology as proposed by Bernhard Wilpert in "Psychology and design processes" is being applied ?
Besides that , it is found that accidents are usually caused by chain reactions of a series of factors according to Heinrich Domino theory .
Since human problems are inevitably a large portion in this chain reactions , the removal  of the human factors will undoubtedly , prevent or reduce accidents .
In the case of Eschede train accident for instance , if the wheel of the train was designed in a better way or well maintained , or if the train could be stopped at the right moment before the crash , the accident could probably be avoided .
But on the other hand , not all factors are within the control of human's capability .
Unfavorable environment and natural disaster are the best examples .
Bad weather conditions , earthquake , and et cetera are all hard to be predicted .
To control them is even more ridiculous and impossible .
Therefore most people think that accidents are unavoidable .
It is quite true that these factors are beyond human's control but we do not have to prevent them from happening .
All we have to do is taking all the necessary steps and precautionary methods to prevent these "uncontrollable" from triggering an accident .
All these steps are to be done during the designing stage , which means that the psychology approach will play an important role .
As mentioned in the very first paragraph , accident is usually unexpected .
Despite its unexpectedness , signs or symptoms will always come first no matter how small or unnoticeable they might be .
Moments before the accident of Eschede happened , one of the passengers on the train had noticed that the tire on a wheel broke and peeled away from the wheel , punctured the floor of the train .
He informed the conductor about what he saw but the conductor insisted to further investigate the incident and thus refused to pull the emergency brake .
Psychologically , the conductor did not want to be involved with any troubles because pulling the emergency brake would definitely cause much hassles .
If he chose to give safety the most priority , he would have pulled the emergency brake and the accident could probably be prevented .
However , when things come to emergency , the most important thing is often the individual ability to react rationally to resolve the problem .
How many people could possibly remain calm when facing a sudden emergency ?
However , this ability can be gained through intensive training .
Practice makes perfect .
The more one gets trained , the more readily he is to face an emergency .
Concisely , the approach of psychological knowledge can prevent or at least reduce the probability of accidents occurring .
Studies of human behavior , stages of an accident , investigation on industrial accident , together with some necessary and suitable psychological approach would definitely help in minimizing the occurring of severe accidents , especially those that are due to errors in human judgments .
The drastic industrial development and advancement in science and technology has led to the rising energy demand nowadays .
Searching for alternative energy sources becomes the main effort of the whole world , especially those industry-developed countries due to the dwindling energy supplies from coal and fuel .
The past few years have seen repeated calls from some of the world leaders to introduce nuclear energy as an alternative energy source to replace fuel and coal in the near future .
Generally , nuclear energy is generated through the process of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion of radioactive elements .
The energy loss in this process is dissipated in the form of heat , where it can be used to generate power and electricity .
The invention of Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor  is one of the latest Generation VI nuclear reactors that have high potential to replace the coal and fuel as energy source .
Nonetheless , debate on the using of this nuclear reactor becomes a hot issue today due to the negative effects that would be brought to human as well as other living organisms on the earth .
On the whole , further research and development funding for SWCR should be provided as all these weaknesses of nuclear reactors can be overcome via evidences and discoveries from the research done .
First and foremost , Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor  has good security system and is safe to be used .TS Much have been said about the danger of using nuclear reactors as power generators such as emission and leakage of radioactive waste and explosion of nuclear reactor , where Chernobyl and Three Mile Island emerge to be famous for that reason . )
However , research and current technology have improved the safety of using SWCR .
According to Nation Master  , the coolant of this reactor is supercritical water , which has high specific heat capacity .
This helps to minimize the heating effect of the reactor .
Furthermore , this reactor's pressure vessel is incorporated a core arrangement with three passes to avoid overheating effect and thus , minimizing the probability of the explosion of SWCR .
Emerging plasma surface modification and grain boundary technologies are also applied to modify the near surface chemistry , microstructure and stress state of alloys used , which reduce the corrosion of the body of SWCR .)
Obviously , all these improvements have overcome the weaknesses of nuclear reactor's security system , thus making SWCR into a safe power generator .
Moreover , the cost of construction of Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor  and cost of its power output are cheap and reasonable .TS It is undeniable that uranium oxide , the main input for SWCR , and the construction materials used are expensive .
However , due to the plant simplification , its design is far simpler , that is , without the circulation pumps , pressurizers , steam generators and dryers .
This will help to reduce its cost of construction as compared to other power generators .
Also , its coolant is water which is cheap and can be obtained easily .
Although uranium oxide is expensive , it has a very long half life , about 24000 years . )
Therefore , it promises a continuous energy supply in the long run .
This also helps to reduce the cost to search for alternative input material for SWCR .
Last but not least , Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor  has high efficiency in term of electricity and power generation .TS According to Nuclear Engineering and Design  , Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor  promises to have high thermal efficiencies of approximately 45% , which can generate about 1 ,700 MWe of thermal energy per hour .
Besides , the simplified once- thru direct cycle of coolant also helps to increase its efficiency in power generation .
As a result , less energy is being dissipated as heat and energy wastage can then be prevented .
This will also help to produce low-cost electricity as its cost of generating power is lower .
In conclusion , despite the evident harm nuclear power can cause , we should not immediately rule it out as a possible source of power in the future .
Further researches have shown that Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor  can achieve great safety by its design modification , lower and reasonable cost of its construction and power generation and has high efficiency in terms of electricity and power generation .
Therefore , further research and development funding for Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor  should be provided as it stands in a good stead to become the future's power generator in the near future .
I agreed that the high cost , the safety issue of nuclear power reactor and problems of wastes recycling .
However , the generation IV reactor the supercritical-water-cooled-reactor  will solve these problems straightforwardly .
For first aspect , SCWR is still facing the financial problem .
To build a nuclear reactor and its prototype will cost over US$1 billion .
If the government use this money to build more fossil reactors , the increasing fossil reactors plants will help the situation of lack of energy .
However , in a long term , nuclear reactor plants will reduce the cost compared with fossil reactor plants .
It is true that the initial cost of building fossil plant is low , but the long-term costs which keeping it work are high says PBMR Company international marketing manager Gert Claassen .
Furthermore , the SCWR reactor efficiency and relatively simple design , it would be cheaper to build and run than normal reactors .
Therefore , the cost is not a problem for SCWR .
The second aspect , it is too difficult to find an appropriate coolant for nuclear reactor .
However , the coolant of SCWR is supercritical water .
Normally , the critical point of water is the point at which the water exists as a combination of the liquid phase and vapour phase .
The condition of this point is at temperature of 374centidegrees and a pressure of 22 .1Mpa .
However , for the supercritical water , the critical point is much higher than the normal water .
It is about 510centidegrees at 25Mpa .
Therefore , the coolant can sustain under the high temperature and do not have any phase change .
Thus , it can produce a great amount of energy .
For that reason , to find a suitable coolant will not be a problem because there is no difficulty to find water in earth .
The third part , people are worrying about the waste of nuclear power , because the waste of reactor is radioactive normally .
If we are not able to handle the wastes well , the nuclear pollution will trigger the catastrophe .
Nevertheless , SCWR could work out this problem .
The coolant for SCWR is supercritical water and the waste of water is still water as well .
Therefore , this waste are not radioactive and it is much safer compared with the wastes of last generation of reactor .
Moreover , SCWR build a system for water purification through supercritical oxidation .
This system is to convert the waste water into potable water .
Then the reactor can reuse this water as coolant again .
To sum up , the supercritical-water-cooled reactors solve general problems which the normal nuclear power reactors have .
Therefore , the SCWR is feasibility and reliable .
The SCWR 's revival would benefit the whole population .
For pubic , the problem of global warming and other environmental problem made by emissions of fossil fuel will be eliminated .
For political , the nuclear power will maintain their energy source independence and reduce the conflicts of energy possessing .
To engineers and scientists , the applications of nuclear reactors would encourage them to find more efficient way to generate energy from reactors and the improve the safety of reactor in case of some accidents happened .
Generally speaking , the nuclear power will be the fuel for the future .
People will obtain safer cleaner and cheaper energy generated by nuclear power reactor .
We are now marching into a new era of nuclear age .
Generation IV of nuclear power is now undergoing development and research .
Very-high-temperature Reactor  which is operated by open fuel cycle is one of the six concepts of Generation IV reactors .
It has an operating temperature of 1000 C and uses high pressure during reaction stages .
VHTR is one of the best substitutions for coal plants from a science perspective as it does not pollute the earth and it does not need to use as much fuel as other forms of energy .
The question of whether we should have nuclear power plant as an energy resource is controversial .
People stand against it as they have little idea about the nuclear power plant .
Cost , safety and performance are three major aspects for opposition to this technology; nevertheless , there is still an unyielding need to support further research and development funding for VHTR .
People believe that it would be costly to start up a new nuclear industry .
It is true though .
According to Mansilla  maximizing the system efficiency does not guarantee a minimum cost .
Still , in point of fact , nuclear power plant can reduce the expenditure in producing more energy in the long run .
Comparing with conventional plants , VHTR can bring out 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel .
Since that VHTR uses lower amount of fuel to produce higher amount of energy , it is much more economic than other power plants regardless the start up cost , as the start-up cost can be compensated in the long run .
Needs for energy are neither going to decrease nor are sources of energy going to increase .
Therefore , when sources of conventional plants are severely depleted , its cost will soar up high and become uneconomical; on the other hand , VHTR uses half the amount of fuel to produce equal amount of energy , hence it can last longer .
People assume that VHTR has lower performance compare to other kinds of Generation IV power sources .
According to research , VHTR is a thermal reactor which relies on moderators to slow down neutrons while Gas-cooled Fast Reactor , Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor and Lead-cooled Fast Reactor are relying on fast spectra .
This gives people a wrong assumption that VHTR is not highly performed .
However , the performance of reactors also depends on operating pressure and temperature .
Researchers anticipate that VHTR's cycle efficiency could reach above 50% while comparing to Molten Salt Reactor , for instance , which could only reach around 44% to 50% .
Furthermore , VHTR is designed to efficiently produce both electricity and hydrogen at the meantime .
In conclusion , the opposing reasons for not supporting further research and development for VHTR are arguable .
The initial cost for VHTR is high but it can be covered in the long run by its quantitative energy output .
Likewise , VHTR is being designed with adequate safety precautions to prevent the happening of tragedy .
It has better performance as well since it has high efficiency and both electricity and hydrogen as its reaction product .
Concepts of nuclear power plant in generation IV have shown substantial improvements in cost , safety and efficiency especially VHTR .
Consequently , more research and development funding should be subjected to VHTR .
As the society develops rapidly , the demand for energy also increase in tandem .
However , fossil fuel , our conventional source of energy , is nearly running out , which means we need to find alternative sources of energy .
As a result , nuclear power has received renewed interest after over 30 years when no new nuclear plants have been built .
In adoption of nuclear energy , we need to consider cost , efficiency and safety features .
In recent years , six generation IV reactor concepts have been developed , and in this essay , I will discuss the sodium-cooled fast reactors  and very-high-temperature reactor  .
Some people say that the SFR is good , but evidence shows that the VHTR is better in terms of cost , efficiency and safety .
SFR is basically to use the sodium as coolant to produce nuclear energy .
On the other hand , very-high-temperature reactor is working under a very high temperature environment  .
On cost , building a SFR is estimated at US$ 610 million , while the VHTR would cost US$ 610 millionU .S .
Department Of Energy Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee2002 .
While , the initial cost of constructing the VHTR is higher than the SFR .
In terms of running cost , VHTR is a more cost-effective reactor than the SFR .
With a high efficiency in transferring heat into power , the VHTR costs only US$1 to produce 1 kilogram hydrogen , which is much lower than SFRU .S .
Department Of Energy Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee2002 .
Therefore , in a long run , the VHTR is more economical in producing a large amount of energy .
To conclude , the initial cost of VHTR is higher , but in a long run its cost is much lower .
Besides that , its efficiency is much higher under its rated working temperature .
In addition , the coolant of the VHTR is much safer than the SFR .
By considering the cost , efficiency and safety factors , we can judge that the very high temperature is a better choice in a long run .
Do you want to make a guess of how much electric power is consumed every day ?
500 million kilowatt-hours ?
Two billion kilowatt-hours ?
No , the answer is more than 48 billion kilowatt-hours .
With the speeding development throughout the whole world , the raising energy needs becomes an unavoidable problem nowadays .
In order to satisfy the needs , the generation IV reactor concept is brought forward for further research and utilization of nuclear power , and the Very High Temperature Reactor  , which uses a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor with a once-through uranium fuel cycle under an outlet temperature of 1000 C , is one of such concepts .
However , even before VHTR has been made use of , the public start to debate whether this concept can do more good than harm .
Although quite a number of people have no faith in the concept and provide some reasons , there exist solid evidences to show VHTR is worth of developing and can benefit the society .
First of all , opponents of VHTR doubt whether it is cost-effective and achievable .
As they state , in order to generate as much electricity as it is expensed in the U .S . every day , almost 400 nuclear power plants should be constructed and utilized .
However , today only about 410 nuclear power plants are used in the world .
The great discrepancy as if draws the end of VHTR's development already .
In fact , this analysis is due to the mis-illustration .
One fact need to be clarified is that the opponents misuse the capacity of the conventional plants rather than that of VHTR .
Scientists suggest that the new generation reactor can squeeze 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuels compared with the conventional plants .
By applying this figure , the number of plants calculated by the opponents can significantly be minimized .
Moreover , the opponents misunderstood the distribution of electric power generation .
No matter how excellent one method is , the world's electric power generation can never simply depend on one method .
Instead , this should always be a combination of complex methods .
In that case , whether VHTR can fulfil one country or even the global needs of electricity is unnecessary to be concerned .
As long as the concept is feasible and is better than the old ones , VHTR deserves for further research and thus can bring more advantage to the society .
In addition , opponents are also concern about the safety of the reactor especially when they recall the Chernobyl nuclear accident .
In their view , under such a high temperature , the reaction should be harder to control and thus more dangerous .
Again this concern is no longer a problem actually .
Thanks to the highly-developed technology of the new generation , VHTR is designed with high-level security .
On the one hand , it benefits from the intrinsic safety property of a helium-cooled , graphite-moderated core as well as optimization of specific design .
The great {thermal inertia} graphite and the single-phase , inert helium coolant cannot react .
This makes the reactor stable enough to sustain high temperature .
This can to a great extent ensure the safety during its reaction .
On the other hand , the corresponding design of the constructions of the nuclear power plants can prevent from nuclear leak even when disasters occur .
The designers state , for instance , once a weak earthquake happens , the monitoring system can immediately sense it and make corresponding actions to guarantee the safety of the reactor .
Simultaneously , the system will also bring the stuffs a safe environment .
With the aforementioned technologies , this is no longer the Chernobyl era , and we should have confidence that by the time VHTR is really put into mass practice , the security can be even better guaranteed .
To sum up , the opponents' opinions to oppose VHTR are not valid .
It is cost-effective , feasible , and safe .
In that case , we can safely draw the conclusion that VHTR is worth of further research and development .
We have confidence that it can bring great advantage to the world when technology is mature .
July 17 , 1981 in Kansas City , Missouri , United States , while dozens of people was gathering on the walkway in Hyatt Regency Crown Centre and seeing a dance contest , the walkway collapsed and caused 114 people died and 200 injured .
After the accident investigated , the main cause of the accident was a significant change in the design of the walkway .
The original design by Jack D . Gillum was using a set of steel tie rod to suspend the two walkways to the ceiling , but the contractor proposed to use two separate tie rods: one collected one walkway to the ceiling , and the other connected the two walkways .
Jack D . Gillum and associates did not calculate the alternate plan before they assigned on the paper .
Thus the accident happened . 
In order to prevent such accidents happening , psychology is suggested to be introduced to the design process .
Psychology studies the human mind and behavior .
For example , cognitive psychology focuses on ways to improve memory and how to increase decision-making accuracy and social psychology are interested in the impact that social environment and interaction has on attitudes and behaviors  .
As human action plays a major role in the design process , psychology can help prevent accidents .
For instance , if we introduce psychology to the case above , then the designer and the contractor communicated well; so that the accidents would not happen .
However , can psychology prevent all the accidents ?
Improvement of communication , teaching of social and human relation skills and methods of dealing with problems are applications of psychology .
So the use of psychology during the design process can prevent some accidents .
It cannot prevent all the accidents , as accidents are not only caused by human errors and as for some new designs , they must be tried to see where will the problems happened .

Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse , message from {w .engineering .com/Library/ArticlesPage/tabid/85/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/175/Walkway-Collapse .aspx} )
On January 28th , 1986 , the US Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch , killing the entire crew .
This is a disaster in human history and is a tragedy of NASA .
The cause of the disaster was reported as the failure of an "O-ring" seal in the solid-fuel rocket on the Space Shuttle Challenger's right side .
However , this is not the only factor resulting in the tragedy .
The report also said that the officials of NASA ignored the concerns voiced by engineers and insisted launching the shuttle at risk .
In other words , not only the technical factors , but also the human factors caused this disaster to appear .
Therefore , psychology in design processes , in my opinion , could have prevented this accident .
Firstly , good preparation of psychology in design processes could have saved the Space Shuttle Challenger .
Actually , from the time it was first scheduled to lift off on January 22nd , to the when it was finally launched on January 28th , liftoff was delayed several times for various reasons .
Obviously , the preparation for this project was not good at all .
Arguers may say that no matter how good the preparation was , there were still some unpredictable factors that might lead the mission to failure .
Well , it is true that the errors cannot be prevented completely; nevertheless , we should try our best to reduce the risk to the least level that we can accept .
Apparently , the condition of Challenger was not what we can accept as safe .
Furthermore , if the preparation was well done and the "O-ring" problem was fixed during the process , Challenger could have been saved .
Secondly , should the decision-making system be made better , the tragedy could have been avoided .
Faced with the choice of whether to put off the mission for safety or to carry on the mission at risk to save money , the officials chose the latter one , which was a big mistake .
Furthermore , they also had policy failure on competitive bidding for manufacturing company and defects of supervision system .
All these factors contributed to the unreliability of the safety of the mission .
Although NASA have to face the pressure from the public and the political , they should aware the consequences of the failure , which might make the situation even worse .
If the highest levels of NASA had made the decision more objectively and scientifically with the help of psychology in design , putting the mission off like before , the disaster could have been prevented .
As discussed above , the Challenger disaster's causes lie not only on the technical factors , but also on the human factors .
In my opinion , the root cause is the human factor , the wrong decision made by the officials .
Though it was indirect cause , its influence is so large that it was more important than the technical factor .
Psychology in design processes , whose significance has been showed in this accident , should be paid more attention to in the future engineering design .
Only in this way , can the safety of projects be improved efficiently and guaranteed .
When people are comparing the two types of reactors , they tend to focus on the temperature at which reactors operates .
Then , they discover that the VHTR is operating at a temperature level which is almost twice as that of the SCWR .
As a result , a misleading conception arises , which is the VHTR works much more efficiently than the SCWR does .
Indeed , temperature is an indicator of how efficient the reactor is .
However , it is by no means the only indicator .
According to Prof Mirko Ascic's scientific journal  , the energy of neutrons in the reactor is the dominant factor that affects the process of converting heat to electricity .
The fact is the SCWR has about four times as many neutrons in the energy range above 6 .2 MeV and about 16 times as many neutrons below 0 .1 eV .
These two energy states of neutrons are closely related the fission of two fuels , U235 and Np237 .
As a result , The SCWR has a higher performace up to 4 percent compared to the VHTR .
For people who are obssesed with the VHTR , one main reason would be it allows an easy way to generate a clean natural energyHydrogen .
It is unnecessary to describe how huge the amount of fossil fuel the world consumes everyday and the influence of burning the fuel on the whole environment .
Scientists have been searching the most suitable and the most economical surrogate for fossil fuel for decades .
And reactors with super-high operating temperature seems to be the ultimate answer .
However , in my opinion , reactors that can generate Hydrogen are just "gimmicks" .
After all , electricity is also a perfect energy which has no side-effect on the environment .
Furthermore , unlike technology of using Hydrogen , which has just begun developing and is far from matured , electricity has been with human beings for over a hundred years .
The technology of electricity can be found everywhere on Earth and big automobile manufacturers have started to discuss the possibility of replacing fossil-fuel-powered cars with electricity-powered ones .
Thus , the critical question arises .
How to produce electricity economically ?
In my opinion , the SCWR is the answer .
The SCWR is built for generation of low-cost electricity .
In addition , the two technologies needed build the SCWR are already at hand , which are widely-employed to by current Generatioon Three LWRs .
Unlike the VHTR which uses rare gas Helium as coolant , the SCWR simply uses water to cool down the system .
As a result , the SCWR costs much smaller amount of money to build and greatly simplifies the nuclear plant .
In conclusion , the most advanced stuff may not be suitable in a certain condition .
The SCWR has proven itself to be more capable at either high performance and low cost .
In this sense , the SCWR is a better nuclear reactor compared to the VHTR in our future .
By the year 2030 , many of the current operating nuclear power plants in the world will be at or near the end of their operating licenses .
Therefore , research and development of Generation IV technologies are being conducted by participating countries in the Generation IV International Forum .
Some of the developing concepts include the "Very-high-temperature" and "Molten salt" nuclear reactors .
Competitive costs and financial risks of nuclear energy systems are constantly compared .
In the case of the Very-high-temperature reactors , the cost of running the plant is lower when compared to Molten salt reactors .
The efficiency of the VHTR is also >50% as compared to conventional reactors .
VHTR produces hydrogen as a byproduct , thus increasing the chances of utilizing the reactors for other energy sources .
VHTR's technology is based on an upgrade to current HTR technologies .
Therefore , the estimated time to receive the technologies will be earlier when compared to MSR .
MSR's research requires scientists to work on new materials which can withstand the usage of molten fluoride salts .
On the other hand , VHTR's research had been mapped into proper stages and there is a large pool of researchers working on it .
, the time span needed to reach optimum standards will be later than VHTR , thus putting VHTR ahead in the economy race .
Safety issues involved in generation IV reactors are mainly on temperature and chemical reactions during high pressure operations .
As the generators are designed to operate at temperatures up to 1000 Degree Celsius , prevention of a reactor meltdown would be important as a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster during the year 1986 would not be acceptable .
This is especially for VHTRs as they operate at temperatures up to 1200 Degrees Celsius as compared to the lower pressured MSRs .
There is no doubt that the world is moving towards nuclear energy development in the future 20 years from now .
The current rat race to develop the best reactor for use is still questionable as all the reactors have their own strengths and weaknesses .
However , with the current VHTR's achievable research goals , it will probably be the generation IV reactor to lead the pack in years to come .
At the turn of the millennium , the rising of Asian countries such as China and India has intensified the competition of energy .
In 2007 , China consumes a third as much oil as the United States , which burns a quarter of the world's oil every day .
By 2030 , China and India together will import as much oil as the United States and Japan do today .
In addition , there are concerns about the impact on global warming due to fossil fuel power plants .
Fossil energy use is responsible for about 85% of the human-caused carbon dioxide emission produced annually .
Hence , fossil fuels are not a viable means to meet the increasing demand of energy .
Thus , other reliable means of energy have been considered , of which , nuclear energy holds the greatest potential .
Using nuclear processes to produce energy is not a new concept .
Since the first power reactor was built in the Soviet Union in 1954 , there are 436 nuclear power plants in operation at present .
Meanwhile , nuclear power has not risen to be a top choice because of worries about leakages of radioactive substances from the plants .
For example , the explosion of reactor 4 in the Chernobyl power plant resulted in 237 deaths due to radiation .
In another accident in the Three Mile Island in the US , 140 thousand people living within a five mile radius of the plant evacuated after the meltdown of a cooling system .
Moreover , in this post 911 era , many worry about nuclear power plants becoming the terrorists' targets .
Acknowledging the need of nuclear power to meet the world's energy appetite , several countries have formed the Generation IV International Forum  to research on the possible nuclear technologies and to mitigate the risks posed by them .
Two of the six short listed systems are the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor  and Super Critical Water Reactor  .
Both of these systems , especially the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor , promises higher efficiency , lower operational cost and enhanced safety measures over current generation of reactors .
In the SCWR , liquid water , which is used as coolant for the 650oC reactor core , is pressurized to 2500 times the atmospheric pressure , to the supercritical state .
Firstly , at this high pressure , water has a larger range of operating temperature .
Thus , the reactor can function safely within a greater range of temperature .
Secondly , supercritical water also has the highest heat capacity .
This means that water can absorb a higher amount of energy for the same volume of water , thus having a better rate of heat transfer compared to the current generation of reactors such as Boiling Water Reactors  and Pressurised Water Reactor  .
Better heat transfer also allows the coolant to have a slower flow rate of the coolant , thus saving cost by using of smaller pumps and piping .
Thirdly , water does not change phase within the coolant cycle due to its increased boiling point .
This would allow the coolant to have a laminar flow , increasing the efficiency of the coolant .
Hence , the plant would have 45% thermal cycle efficiency .
Regarding the safety aspects of the nuclear reactors , the GIF has set high targets for all reactors .
For the SCWR , the use of water at the supercritical state allows the coolant to be functional and effective at a right range of temperature .
The absence of a change in phase would also make the reactors safer to operate .
All this is possible with the highly pressurized water .
Meanwhile , SFR does not have the problems regarding maintaining the coolant at high pressure .
Instead , the challenge lies in keeping the sodium coolant from direct contact with air .
As sodium is highly reactive , it reacts violently with the air from the environment .
This difficulty is overcome by using a two-step cooling solution , whereby sodium is used to cool the core , and a secondary coolant , such as water , is used to cool the sodium .
Also , SFR has the added advantage of closed fuel cycle , which helps in the management of highly radioactive actinides .
This would prevent the proliferation of the nuclear waste .
Finally , nuclear-enriched materials being kept at high temperature would prevent them from being stolen and use as weapons by terrorists .
In conclusion , SFR stands as a more viable option to be the solution to the world's energy crisis .
Though the deployment cost is high at present , the burden will be shared by the many countries support the technology .
Also , the performance of SFR is ensured based on the findings of the various researches conducted .
Finally , well-planned safety measures and actinides management would ensure the SFR would function safely within its use .
Nuclear accidents like the Three Mile incident and the Chernobyl disaster left a bad aftertaste in the eyes of the public .
Furthermore , the constant threat of nuclear terrorists and the issue of radiation leakage made nuclear energy even more unpopular .
However , as mankind evolves , nuclear energy could possibly be making a comeback .
Facing the issues of rising oil prices and the long term availability of fossil fuels , governments now are rethinking their national energy strategies .
One of these strategies is harnessing nuclear energy .
Going nuclear would provide the growing economies with a constant and steady supply of energy to sustain their economic development .
Furthermore , it also addresses the issue on global warming as it does not produce greenhouse emissions which could further aggravate the situation .
Though the public may be concerned about the safety of operating a nuclear plant , we should continue to develop nuclear energy as its economic and environmental benefits outweighs its risks .
One potential reactor concept that we should look at would be the Very-high-temperature reactors  , as it addresses the concern over uranium reprocessing and the impact of a nuclear accident .
Furthermore , it gives significant economic and environmental advantages as it is more energy efficient and it also produces hydrogen which could be used for other purposes . 
One of the public's concerns over the safety of operating a nuclear plant is the issue of nuclear waste management .
Given the current controversy regarding Iran's uranium enrichment program , whereby the technology could be used to develop nuclear weapons , the public has the right to worry since there have not been much transparency from Iran .
This concern would be diffused if we are developing VHTR , since its design does not incorporate a waste recycling component hence there would not be a basis for any uranium enrichment program .
Therefore , there is no need to worry about the reprocessing of uranium for weapon proliferation .
Another concern on the safety aspect of nuclear plants is radiation leakage due to improper disposal or infrastructure failure which could be caused by a terrorist attack .
Radiation exposure is an inherent part of nuclear energy and some believe that living near a nuclear plant would increase the risk of cancer and that any nuclear accident would result in high casualties .
After the Chernobyl accident , many scientists predicted that the radiation exposure of that incident would have caused a million deaths hence causing panic and hysteria among the public which eventually made nuclear energy unpopular .
However , in 2005 , a report done by IAEA and the World Health Organization deduced that the incident caused 56 direct deaths and suggested that there may be 4 ,000 extra cancer deaths among the approximately 600 ,000 most highly exposed people which were significantly much lower than previously thought .
Therefore previous claims by scientist were over exaggerated and the public should be educated on the issue of radiation exposure so that they do not oppose the idea because of misinformation .
Furthermore , active safety measures were also put in place , checks for radiation leakage are done frequently by experts and nuclear plants are located at isolated places to minimize exposure .
They are also well guarded to deter any terrorist attacks .
To further put the public's mind at ease , the VHTR is also designed to automatically shut down in a case of an accident hence minimizing radiation leakage and foiling any terrorists' attacks .
Therefore this further enhances the safety aspect of running a nuclear plant and should adequately address the concerns of the public .
As the world copes with the rising cost of oil , governments are investing into different energy fields to diversify their energy sources so as to increase their countries' energy independence .
Some argue that we should not be investing into nuclear energy as it is expensive to build and run and that it is not a renewable energy source , hence we should invest into renewable energies which are more sustainable .
Though renewable energy may be sustainable , their energy supplies are intermittent depending on environmental factors .
Therefore , they are unable to meet the intense energy demand of our growing economies .
Nuclear plants are more expensive to build than the other energy sources , but it is a premium that we have to pay to obtain a reliable and consistent supply of energy to drive our economic progress .
Furthermore , the VHTR concept has a high fuel burn up ratio which translates to an efficiency of 80% which is significantly higher than renewable energies which have efficiencies of 20-30%  .
The VHTR also produces hydrogen which could be used as another source of fuel for power plants or could be sold to industries which use it , hence generates a source of revenue for the state .
It is also good that we diversify our energy sources to booster our energy security .
Hence we should continue to develop nuclear energy as it is a proven tool to obtain constant steady supply of energy .
Furthermore the high energy efficiency and potential uses of hydrogen , gives it more economic advantages over the renewable energies .
Another issue that nuclear energy would address is global warming .
As we know global warming is mainly caused by greenhouse emission from the burning of fossil fuels and its impacts include climate change and the flooding of low lying area hence jeopardizing the survival of our future generations .
Nuclear energy is 'clean' as it does not release any greenhouse emissions .
Furthermore , the ability of the VHTR to produce hydrogen provides another source of clean energy which we could utilize to power our economies and cars which are the main contributors of greenhouse emissions .
By reducing the carbon emissions from these two sources , we would be able to buy us more time to develop technologies to tackle the global warming issue; therefore we should develop the VHTR to aid our cause .
The design of the VHTR has incorporated a lot of safety features which enhances the safety of operating a nuclear plant .
Coupled with that , the strict regulation of the IAEA and its frequent checks ensure that the infrastructure remains safe and intact hence safeguarding the interest of the public .
Furthermore , the high power efficiency of the VHTR makes it economical to operate and the production of hydrogen provide a source of revenue for the state as well as another alternative source of clean energy which reduces greenhouse emissions .
Since the VHTR is able to benefit us economically and environmentally , we should continue to develop it despite its risks .
Opponents said that it is safe to use the electric car on the road , as quoted from "Electro Automotive"  , they claimed that it's fully safe as the battery does not leak even if an accident occur .
However , the car is still not fully safe for operation .
The design has an overall light protection by the lightweight body frame .
The idea of using such is so that lesser battery power will be used to drive the vehicle , in order to travel longer distances , as compared to heavier frames .
Because of the nature of light weight , it will lead to one bigger safety issue , accident consequences .
Accidents can happen anytime , and hardly avoidable .
Roger  mentioned that many mavens , known as car addicts , were worried that if an accident were to occur , especially with heavier vehicles , chances of the electric car being smashed is relatively high , the fact that current population of vehicles is still fuel driven .
This indicates danger to both driver and passengers .
One suggestion is to design better , stronger and safer materials for the frame of the electric car .
At a small cost of a slightly slower speed , accidents can be prevented and reduced if drivers practice safe and considerate driving .
Moreover , there is added protection with the stronger frame .
Opposition claim that the electric car is good as it helps reduce the reducing the rate of greenhouse effects by having no harmful emissions compared to fuel cars , Partha  said .
Even though the car has no emission , which overall helps to save the environment , but many drivers are concerned with the overall cost of owning a car .
From "Electro Automotive"  , cost per mileage for the electric car is $0 .052 , and for fuel car is $0 .08 .
Cost of the electric car EV1 , quoted from "EV1 Electric Car was CRUSHED by GM"  was $25 ,000 , and for an average fuel car , said Bradsher  was $20 ,000 .
Maintenance , which is the greatest nightmare for drivers , is priced at approximately $14 ,000 for 30 ,000 miles to change a new battery of the electric car , Jeffery  said , while the fuel car cost around $6 ,334 for 40 ,000 miles , quoted from "lendingtree"  .
By comparing the prices , it shows that more drivers will prefer choosing the fuel car , as partially because of the need to charge the electric car every 100 miles , while a fuel car go up to 1000km or more , as most drivers need to travel longer distances without visiting the petrol station that frequently .
If there are more users who use the fuel cars , it will hence increase pollution , not decrease even with the technology of electric cars .
One solution is to improve the design of electric cars such that it can run longer distance , with the same battery power .
This may in turn , interest drivers that this will be a better option , as fuel depletes one day , electric cars may become the better choice of transport , which will also saves the environment .
Lastly , with the slow speed of the electric car of 50mph quoted from "Pros And Cons Of Electric Cars" , critics think that it will be safer for the drivers and passengers , and accident rates can be reduced .
However this may not be true .
This is because , comparing the amount of fuel cars owned , to the amount of electric cars owned , electric cars are very low amount in ratio .
Hence there are more heavy fuel vehicles on the road that runs faster than electric cars .
This will increase risk and rate of accidents that may occur , as electric car which is slower may become a potential obstruction to the "faster" fuel cars , and if collision occurs , chances of electric car drivers getting severely injured is high because of the lighter body frame as discusses earlier on .
A solution is to design higher power output of the electric car such that it can travel faster speeds to be on par with current fuel vehicles such that it reduces the accident rates , hence increasing safety of the car .
In conclusion , there is a need to improve the electric car to increase safety and fully utilise its safety features .
For example , reinforcing its body frame with stronger materials , and increasing battery power capacities .
As time passes , the government is likely bound to increase fuel price , making fuel cars an unworthy choice .
But for now , as the technology is not readily available yet and fully safe , there is no reason to get an electric car .
As quoted from Audi's president Johan that it is "a car for idiots ."
In recent years , despite the contentious debate of using nuclear power to meet our ever-increasing energy needs , the world starts to consider nuclear energy as a future fuel source which is believed to be a more environmentally friendly fuel as compared to fossil fuels .
Hence , late in 2002 , GIF  announced the selection of six reactor technologies which they believe represent the future shape of nuclear energy .
These were selected on the basis of being clean , safe and cost-effective means of meeting increased energy demands on a sustainable basis , while being resistant to usage of materials for weapons proliferation and secure from terrorist attacks  .
In this essay , I would present my argument to support further research and development funding for the Very High Temperature Reactor  as opposed to the Supercritical Water Reactor  , from the perspectives of security , performance and costs .
Firstly , proponents of SCWR claimed that the very high-temperature concept of VHTR reactor can be detrimental to safety if a loss-of-coolant accident  occurs .
This means that if there is a break in the pipe , coolant will be lost and cause the reactor to heat up very quickly , resulting in the release of toxic gases and fission products into the environment .
However , this may be an unfounded concern in years to come when we consider the fact that the Korean and the US government have worked for the past three years on developing and validating advanced computational methods for simulating LOCA in a VHTR , in an attempt to prevent such an accident from happening  .

Proponents of SCWR also claimed that VHTR produced high volume of nuclear waste which can be a potential source of nuclear weapons for the terrorists .
However , this claim may not be entirely valid because the waste produced , though in high volume , is considered low-level  .
The fuel pebbles used in VHTR are also very 'durable' in the sense that it is very difficult to extract the trapped fission products inside which rendered it a less favorable choice as a nuclear weapon .
In addition , it is important to note that VHTR is a much safer reactor also because the radioactive content of the fuel is contained even if the reactor reaches temperatures in excess of 500 C more than the normal operating temperature  .
VHTR also adopts a passive safety feature in which in the event of an emergency , it does not require operator's action to shutdown the plant safely .
Furthermore , the fuel pebbles are coated with an impermeable layer of silicon carbide which would not rupture easily , and the plant is also equipped with a reaction vessel that is free of oxygen .
Both features prevent the occurrence of a fire .
Concern of graphite being an easily-combustible material is also addressed by experimental results that have shown that graphite can be heated to 'white-hot' temperatures  without incurring ignition or self-sustained combustion  .
There is also another design feature of VHTR that makes it a preferable choice of reactor over SCWR .
In contrast to SCWR which uses water both as the coolant and moderator  , VHTR uses helium and graphite as coolant and moderator respectively .
This means that if there is a leakage of water in SCWR , the plant will not be able to operate at all .
Next , VHTR has better performance than SCWR in three main aspects .
Firstly , in terms of burn-up rate of the fuel , for VHTR , it is possible to burn up to 65% of its initial fuel as compared to SCWR which is capable of only burn up to 45% of the initial fuel  .
Secondly , due to the high operating temperature of VHTR , the large amount of heat produced can be used for many purposes , ranging from providing domestic energy supplies and refining crude oil , to providing energy for hydrogen production .
This is unlike SCWR which can only produce electricity .
Hydrogen production , whereby the process is energy-intensive is important as hydrogen holds enormous promise as a power source for the future generation .
This is also one point that makes VHTR a more economical plant than SCWR .
Lastly , VHTR uses graphite as the moderator , which according to nuclear experts , is an excellent moderator as compared to water which is used in SCWR  .
VHTR also uses helium gas as the coolant which is an inert gas .
Hence , the plant can be operated at high temperature without having to worry about corrosion of the plant pipes .
This is different from SCWR which uses water as the coolant and hence there is a possibility of pipe's corrosion by water .
Lastly , proponents of SCWR claimed that the construction cost of VHTR plant is much higher than SCWR due to its high operating temperature .
This would not be a valid claim if we consider the fact that VHTR is built to operate at a long life span of 60 years  which is much longer than that of VHTR .
Hence , this makes it justifiable to spend more money to build VHTR plant .
In conclusion , I would like to reiterate my stand that VHTR is a better reactor design than SCWR in terms of safety , performance and costs , and hence funding should be given to support the research and development of VHTR .

Development of Safety Analysis Codes And Experimental Validation For A Very High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor 16 Oct 2009 {w .inl .gov/technicalpublications/Documents/3311061 .pdf}
Nuclear technology has experienced several revolutions in the past fifty years .
The nuclear reactors currently in operation are Generation II and III reactors .
Generation II reactors were first developed in the 1950s , and were widely adopted in the following 40 years .
Generation III reactors , invented in the 1990s , are the most advanced in use nowadays  .
However , after the concept of Generation IV reactors were raised by GIF in 2001  , whether governments should solely focus on current nuclear reactors or split the funding for the new generation has become a controversy .
In my opinion , governments should fund the Gen IV reactors , as they possess remarkable advantages in terms of safety , performance and costs relative to the old designs .
Some people claim that Gen II and Gen III reactors are safe enough for operation .
Despite the accident in Chernobly , Ukraine , which was mainly caused by man-made operating errors  , no major accident occurred in the past two decades .
Compared with funding the Gen IV reactors , they think that governments should rather use the money to reinforce the safety of currently operating reactors .
However , malfunctions that had the risk of being disastrous happened from time to time .
For instance , in 2006 , part of the Forsmark-1 reactor in Sweden failed to start , almost resulting in a catastrophic meltdown .
A Belgian reactor experienced a similar problem in the preceding year  .
Such incidents imply that the potential risks of the Gen II and Gen III reactors cannot be ignored .
The Gen IV reactors can significantly change this risky situation .
Take the VHTR reactor as an example .
In this new design , the fuel pellets used in nuclear reaction are fused in graphite pebbles and coated with ceramic layers which effectively prevent the radioactive materials from leaking .
In other words , no radioactive damage will occur even if there is a meltdown  .
Therefore , the Gen IV reactors are more reliable than the previous generations .
In order to achieve safer operating environment , government should fund the development of the Gen IV .
Though the Generation II and III reactors have been maturely adopted in electricity generation , the drawbacks in their designs largely confine the potential power of nuclear energy .
In order to optimize its power to meet the increasing demand of electricity as well as to maintain long term sustainability , governments should fund the Generation IV reactors instead of the old generations .
In the 21st century , one of mankind's most pressing problems is the energy crisis .
Fossil fuels , being non-renewable , are being exhausted at a rate faster than it can be replenished .
Hence , in order to solve the energy crisis we need to look for other sources of energy .
Nuclear power is one such example of an energy source .
It is deemed to be much cleaner , greener and more effective than traditional fossil fuels .
This essay will address some issues concerning nuclear generators and other opposing viewpoints .
The main focus will be on a particular Generation-IV reactor , namely the Very-High-Temperature Reactor  .
Nuclear power is an important source of energy for the future , hence more funding should be provided for research and development of nuclear reactors .
The third factor that is of concern is costs .
It has been a known fact that nuclear power plants require high-start up costs .
Funds have to be inserted so as to support the high technology machinery and also create a safe environment with proper safety guidelines protecting the reactors .
In addition , operating licenses have to be bought from the government , so as to ensure safe operation of the nuclear power plants .
Furthermore , in order to fully support our energy needs , a lot more nuclear reactors have to be built around the world  .
However , once the basis infrastructure has been laid down , nuclear power turns in to a readily accessible and cheaply recoverable source of energy  .
Hence , it would be able to last us a much longer time compared to fossil fuels .
Furthermore , with 4 of the 6 Generators-IV reactors being able to use reprocessed radioactive waste  , it would be no surprise if nuclear power is able to last much longer than we expected .
Hence , it would be logical to support the research and development of nuclear power plants .
Finally , the last issue would be on the performance of the nuclear reactors .
It is widely known fact that nuclear power is able to produce much more energy compared to traditional fossil fuels .
This is simply due to the nature of nuclear fuel being to produce much more energy .
Hence , it would be unfair to compare the nuclear generators with traditional power plants .
In this case , comparison should be done between nuclear power plants and those of other renewable sources .
Similarly , nuclear power plants are superior as we can produce nuclear energy constantly whereas other sources are less predictable .
Furthermore , comparing the Generation-IV reactors with older nuclear reactors , the new reactors are much more efficient , some of them like the VHTR produce hydrogen at the same time  .
Therefore , support should be given to develop nuclear power .
The most awaited Tata's Nana car was finally unveiled at the Auto Expo 2008 .
It was a very proud moment for Tata as it was the cheapest car compared to all other cars found around the world  .
The target of Tata was to make a car which most of the citizens in India can afford but it came out to be a big talk among car dealers too .
They were very much surprised by the unique design and were amazed by the stunning price .
It just costs about one lakh  which is US2500 dollars  .
Although it was a surprising package , both positive and negative arguments about the car were found at the Auto Expo 2008 .
The main issue discussed was concerning safety .
There were mixed reviews concerning the safety of TaTa's Nano among car dealers .
The big question raised was whether Tata's Nano was safe to drive in normal roads or not .
So , my stand as a reviewer is that Tata's Nano lacks safety .
There are three important reasons for my stand .
To conclude , Tata's Nano needs modification .
It would be better if tougher materials could be used , more safety features are added and some required changes are done to the current design .
These will really improve the safety aspect of the car .
Tata may argue that these will increase the price of the car .
But I strongly feel that those who want to purchase the car will not mind to pay a little more if it is going to provide a safer ride in the roads .
First of all , opponents argue that helium , which is used as a coolant in the VHTR , could explode because of the high operating temperature and pressure of the reactor .
This argument may arise because of the lack of knowledge about the helium .
Helium is , in fact , an inert gas .
Therefore , helium will not react with any material due to its stability  .
This is also why helium is widely used to fill blimps .
In addition , helium will not become radioactive as other coolants do when they are exposed to radioactive radiation .
Thus , helium is safe to use as a coolant in VHTR .
Thirdly , critics argue that the nuclear reactors are producing radioactive waste and this waste can harm the environment around the reactors .
It is true that the waste that contains high radioactive material , such as , plutonium , can affect the environment severely .
However , the waste of the VHTR is less radioactive than the other reactors .
The VHTR has high thermal efficiency and high fuel burn up .
This is why the concentration of the heavy metal radioactive matter in the VHTR waste is relatively low .
The waste of the VHTR will then go to a repository after being reprocessed and meeting the certain acceptance criteria  .
In addition , the operation of the VHTR does not depend on the plutonium reprocessing , which is a controversial issue  .
Thus , the VHTR waste is much safer than the existing nuclear reactors .
Lastly , opponents claim that the cost of building a nuclear reactor is very high .
They say that the money that government spends on building the reactor can be used for other purchases .
This is indeed true; however , the cost of building a VHTR is in fact not as costly as the other generation IV reactors .
The total cost of building a VHTR is about US$670 M . It is much lower than the cost of building a Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor , the next more expensive reactor , which is about US$ 870 M . Moreover , due to its high operating temperature  , the VHTR can operate with a high efficiency to produce electricity .
Data show that the percent efficiency of the VHTR is more than 50 percent while other generation IV reactors range from 30 to 50 percent  .
This means that the government will spend less money on fuel in the VHTR compared to the other generation IV reactors .
In addition , the hydrogen that is produced by the VHTR can be used in fuel cells .
Thus , by using this hydrogen , the government can reduce the cost of importing oil .
Therefore , in the long run , it is profitable to build the VHTR because it can produce both electricity and hydrogen with a very efficient process .
To conclude , in spite of claims that nuclear reactors are dangerous and costly , the VHTR with its improved design can overcome these issues .
The VHTR can produce electricity and hydrogen efficiently in a much safer way without producing hazardous waste .
Hence , the development of the VHTR should be supported .
Mention nuclear power and the general consensus are fear and rejection , and Chernobyl comes to their mind .
Dirty power , they will say , and it is not worth the risk , despite ironically being much cleaner and powerful than the current fossil fuel-guzzling power plants .
However with the formation of the Generation IV International Forum  and its six new reactor designs , it is hoped that nuclear power can be tapped upon with full consent of the public .
These reactors , still in the designing and testing phase , excel in areas of sustainability , safety , economics and proliferation resistance  , all which is specially intended to address all issues and challenges that nuclear power faces in a world combating the production of greenhouse gases but in the safest possible way .
The system core temperatures of LFR can attain up to 500  , almost 50% lower than that of VHTR and present significant differences in the operations of the plants .
Even though thermal efficiency of LFR is lower , 43% compared to up to 50% for VHTR  , it is offset by offering a higher likelihood of reassurance to the public .
The use of low temperature means LFR can actually be built using the current technology , though some improvements may be needed .
Molten lead , compared to helium , is a superior and cheaper heat transfer medium and hence increasing the portability of the power plant by reducing the need for a large intermediate heat exchanger .
One of the reasons why Very High Temperature Reactor is better for funding is because of its safety factor .
Safety factor is heavily considered because if accident occurs at nuclear reactor sites , it can result in massive releases of radioactivity .
Therefore in this context , safety design in VHTR has been introduced to take care of all the uncertainties and accidents which might occur with the ultimate goal of protecting the environment and people from being exposed to radiological hazards of potential release from the nuclear power plants .
And it , by means , includes the development of passive heat removal systems , low power density and easily cool-able geometry .
Helium is used in the heat removal system as a coolant because it is an inert gas and it will not react chemically with any other material .
VHTR will also be equipped with graphite-moderated core with specific design optimizations .
The graphite has tiny pellets of uranium fuel encased in it and they will absorb heat without failing and releasing radioactivity .
As VHTR would be expected to operate at a very high temperature , all these are essential to prevent the reactor from being over-heated .

However , some experts have pointed out that if such high temperature is stimulated within a reactor , new hardy alloy may be necessary to protect the inside layer of the reactor .
To get those alloys it would already cost millions .
How about the construction cost of the entire power plant which is still unknown yet ?
Furthermore , it is easier and cheaper to build other generation four nuclear reactors compared to VHTR .
For instance , for supercritical water-cooled reactor , it is relatively cheaper to build because it uses water as coolant instead of helium in VHTR .
So , the process of handling the phase change of helium to another state is not needed and this kind of simplification can largely reduce the cost .
When the cost is reduced , cheaper electricity can be provided to public .
But in term of performance , VHTR is a more efficient concept compared to others in generation four nuclear reactor concepts .
Even though it might proved costly at the beginning but it pays off well as it produces both electricity and hydrogen fuel instead of electricity only .
High temperature processed in the reactor can be used as a condition to yield hydrogen from sulphur-iodine cycle , which is a series of thermo-chemical processes that will fail without sufficient source of heat .
Hydrogen fuel produced can be used in vehicle as its onboard fuel .
Also , as it is operating at higher temperature , it produces more electricity compared to the rest .
In conclusion , VHTR is a very promising energy system to provide us electricity and hydrogen cogeneration .
Current stage for VHTR development is just at the very beginning point .
There are enormous items left to do in order for this concept to success in future .
Therefore , more research and development should be carried out so that in future this concept can become the energy supply for everyone in this earth .

Nuclear Power's New Dawn .
Nature , Vol-429 , page 238-240 .
The Chernobyl nuclear accident , which occurred on 26 April 1986 , had resulted in massive radioactive fallout into the atmosphere that affected millions of people .
Because of the catastrophic effects of a nuclear accident , no nuclear reactor has been built since then .
However , as global warming is becoming a more pressing issue , we have now turned to nuclear reactor to provide us clean energy .
Here comes the question on which generation IV nuclear reactor we should choose .
Although some have chosen lead-cooled fast reactor  over very-high-temperature reactor  because of the various benefits LFR has over VHTR , there is some evidence that VHTR is much better than LFR .
Supporters of LFR claim that LFR is much safer than VHTR .
One of the main reasons on LFR being safer is LFR , which operates at around 550 degree Celsius , has a lower outlet temperature than VHTR , which operates at around 1000 degree Celsius  .
It is believed that the higher the temperature , the greater the risk of a nuclear meltdown .
However , VHTR is designed to work at such a high temperature .
In VHTR , its graphitic core structure , helium coolant , and coated fuel particles allow VHTR to withstand high temperatures  .
Thus , it is able to attain thermal stability .
In short , operating at 1000 degree Celsius is not much of a safety issue since VHTR is safe and reliable at high temperature .

In addition , in terms of the coolant used by the two reactors , VHTR is safer than LFR .
LFR uses lead as its coolant .
Lead is corrosive and may form polonium , which is a radioactive substance , when exposed to radioactivity  .
With the presence of the radioactive polonium and the corrosiveness of lead , it is not safe to use lead as a coolant .
On the other hand , VHTR uses helium , which is a chemically inert .
Thus , it reduces the safety hazards which can arise due to the corrosion and the irradiation of the coolant .
Supporters of LFR also maintain that LFR is much cheaper than VHTR .
In terms of cost to build the reactor , LFR cost around US$700 million  while VHTR cost around US$1 .1 billion  .
In addition , in term of the cost of coolant , lead cost around US$0 .24 per 100 grams  while helium cost around US$5 .20 per 100 grams .
In terms of these two factors , LFR is much cheaper than VHTR .
However , there are other factors that will also affect the cost of operating the reactor , such as maintenance cost .
For instance , since VHTR is specially designed to operate under a very high temperature , it will produce hydrogen , which is a source of clean fuel .
With the economic production of hydrogen  by thermochemical cycles , it can reduce the maintenance cost for operating the VHTR .
The final argument advanced by the supporters of LFR is LFR perform much better than VHTR .
Unlike VHTR , LFR will reprocess its nuclear waste .
Thus , LFR can use the nuclear reactant to its maximum before disposing it .
However , recycling of nuclear waste will result in the production of plutonium , which can be used as nuclear weapon  .
In fact , United State has refrained from reprocessing of nuclear waste .
Hence , recycling of nuclear waste is not safe in term of security .
In addition , VHTR is more efficient than LFR .
It is because the higher the outlet temperature , the greater is the efficiency of electrical generation .
As VHTR is operating at a higher temperature , there is an efficient conversion of energy from heat to electricity .
From data , for the same amount of fuel , VHTR could squeeze 50% more electricity compared to conventional plants  .
Furthermore , VHTR produces hydrogen fuel that can be used to produce electrical energy .
VHTR generates electrical energy in two ways , from nuclear reactant directly and from hydrogen fuel .
In conclusion , VHTR is safe because it is designed to attained thermal stability and it uses inert coolant , which is helium .
In addition , it is cost effective because of its economic production of hydrogen .
Furthermore , it is also efficient because it is operating at a very high temperature .
Hence , it should be evident that VHTR works better than LFR in term of security , cost and performance .
Since VHTR is one of the better options among the generation IV nuclear reactors and it is feasible , we should invest and support in further research and development on VHTR .

Energy has always been considered as the national strategy by most countries .
No one can stand on its own without the support of some kind of energy .
Nowadays , we use fossil fuel in most cases , because it is convenience and has low cost of production .
But as the environment issues becomes a high-profile problems and under the situation that this kind of non-renewable resource will be ran out in the near future , people begin to seek some other methods that can support the world as before .
Nuclear energy is one of the most promising energies which can take the place of fossil fuel .
Nuclear is now widely used in many countries and plays a more and more important role in the 21th century .
Recently , according to survey nuclear power produces around 11% of the world's energy needs and could take more proportion in the future .
Another piece of inspirational news is that the Generation VI nuclear reactors will be used in practice in about 10 to 20 years .
This new reactors operating at high temperatures will do improve the efficiency and safety .
That's why US , France and China have already planed to build the plant in order to occupy the dominating position in this new area .
However , among the six types of new reactors the Very High Temperature Reactor is the most appropriate for us to realize actually .
It may become the next major energy .
The VHTR , just as it name implies , the temperature needed is as high as 1000 C . This reactor is a graphite-moderated , helium-cooled reactor with a once-through uranium fuel cycle .
VHTR can provide some outstanding features while the rests cannot , or VHTR is an extremely high efficiency reactor with a good security guarantee .
The VHTR system is highly ranked in efficiency not just because of its high nuclear production but also the large hydrogen production , and such kind of by product can also be used in many other industries .
The basic reason is that under such a high temperature , water can be electrolyzed smoothly , turning into hydrogen and oxygen .
For VHTR , water will be electrolyzed more fully compared with the other ones , so the hydrogen production is the largest .
Actually , according the report from DISCOVERY: VHTR plants could even produce hydrogen for fuel using high-temperature steam electrolysis , which breaks apart the bonds of water molecules; this process is 50 percent more energy-efficient than existing hydrogen production methods .
In 2005 the Department of Energy authorized INL to build a VHTR plant .
The prototype should be completed sometime between 2018 and 2021 .
In addition , hydrogen is not the only by product , heat and electricity will also be generated during the nuclear processing .
The heat will be transferred to relevant nuclear reactions .
The electricity , of course , will be used as electric power , supplying to the society .
Base on the information form DISCOVER: The VHTR should produce electricity about 40 percent more efficiently than do most reactors in the United States .
Then we can conclude that actually the production of electricity is also very large indeed .
In term of safety , firstly , the design takes advantage of the inherent safety characteristics of a helium-cooled .
Helium should be very stable and inert even under high temperature condition , so this kind of inert gas can protect the system during the refrigeration processing .
Secondly , the graphite-moderated core with specific design optimizations can reduce the risk of using VHTR .
Numerous tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible for the this kind of graphite become unstable , self-sustained combustion or incurring ignition will not happen during the process .
Thirdly , the VHTR has a safety characteristic of low decay heat .
That means low system pressure and low thermal energy will store in the core with low power density and easily cool geometry , then decay heat will be dissipated passively by conduction and radiation even under the most severe accident conditions .
So the damage of the decay heat will less serious .
The security of VHTR can be guaranteed , because of these three features that protect the system form collapsing .
For more than 20 years of evolution , medical robots are one of the great inventions in this modern technology driven world .
In the past , medical robots help the surgeons to diagnose the patients' internal organs and perform minor surgeries .
But in recent years , due to the technology advancement on the medical robots , prototypes of these robots surgery systems are now able to perform more precise , accurate and complicated surgery , such as reaching for untouchable tissue , on the patients with the surgeons controlling them remotely .
Moreover , the surgeons are able to reduce their stress levels while performing surgery and the robotic surgery systems are able to maintain the stability of their arms for long hours of surgery .
However , there are many issues revolving about the use of the robotics surgery system with compare to traditional human operated surgery in the public .
The first issue is that the public is concern about paying robotic surgery at high price .
This is the first thought that appears in their mind when they heard of such surgery for the first time .
However , this is true when it comes to medical fees especially surgery and it is even more expensive when compare with traditional one .
Though this may be the only disadvantage that the patients are going to have but there are lots of advantages for them if they are willing to use medical robots to perform surgery .
"Patients experience less trauma , blood loss , risk of infection , scarring and pain .
Hospital stays are also generally shorter ."
This is quote from one article by Debra S . from Reuters .
Another article from News week reported by Jennifer B . mentioned , "Forbes was walking within hours of his surgery and was discharged the next day .
By midweek he was walking three miles daily .
In 10 days he was back at work .
After three weeks he was playing golf again ."
From these quotes , the advantages are definitely benefit the patients in many ways especially when the patients are able to go back to their normal daily life in shorter recovery time .
Another issue is that the public concerns about the safety and reliability of the robotic surgery system , for example , the system breakdown in the process of surgery .
The doubt is unclear to the public and they are worried if this would have happen to them while performing surgery .
However , the public can rest assure for this matter because the hospitals have always been doing maintenance for the robotic systems .
In the matter of fact , this is the biggest downside for having a robotic system for the hospitals .
There is an article by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists mentioned "The system costs hospitals about $1 .6 million and requires an annual $100 ,000 maintenance contract , according to Dr .
Advincula ."
"Da Vinci system costs $ 1 .4 million and annual maintenance costs of $ 100 ,000 with a lifespan of five years ."
Another article added .
This shows that the hospitals always have engineers around to maintain the robotic systems regularly to prevent any failure from happening .
The last issue for the public is concern that the surgeons are not well trained with controlling the robotic surgery systems .
This is agreeable to concern with whereas the patients are putting their lives on the hands of the surgeons .
However , the public , especially the patients , do not required to worry for this issue , as there is robotic surgery training center available in Singapore to train the surgeons .
The surgeons are responsible for proper training and follow training standards for using the equipments .
The surgeons are encouraged to have more practices before attempt on the patients .
"The more you do , the better you're going to get , said Dr Kevin Zorn" quote from Reuters article by Debra S .
In brief , with the advancement of medical technologies , the robotic surgery systems are definitely benefit both the patients and the surgeons .
While the patients are able to recover quickly and back to their normal lifestyle , the surgeons are able to perform more surgery as they spend lesser time on each patient and required fewer manpower in the operating theater .
In my opinion , in these modern technologies in medical equipments , for example , robotic surgery system , help to extend the lifespan of one human being .
Therefore , the public should not fear of the robotic surgery and should give confident and trust to the surgeons and the technologies they are using .
The industry of the nuclear power is reviving in the 21st century .
In 2001 , the Generation IV International Forum  came up with six new concepts for generation IV reactors .
Among these , a concept called "Very-high-temperature reactors"  was widely accepted and respected .
However , the accidents of reactor meltdown and explosion that happened in the past makes the public worried about the safe operation of the nuclear reactors .
Chernobyl disaster is a classic example which happened in 1986 at Chernobyl in Ukraine .
The nuclear reactor core exploded and killed more than 30 people immediately and also spoiled the environment from then on  .
Whether it is necessary for the further research and development funding for VHTR therefore becomes a big issue that is being widely discussed .
A number of oppositions are aroused to stop the funding for the six generation IV reactor concepts because of not only the security risk but the inefficiency and the great cost as well .
Despite such concerns and queries , however , the new concept of VHTR does reach the public's requirement in terms of safety , efficiency and cost , and the further research and development funding for it is definitely needed for resolving the energy crisis and also developing new materials and techniques .
Some opposing views suggest that VHTR cannot ensure safety .
They probably assume that all nuclear reactors must have great possibility to cause disasters .
However , this is not the fact .
The VHTR concept makes use of a helium-cooled , graphite-moderated core with specific design optimizations  .
As it is well-known , the helium , which is used for cooling , has inherent safety characteristics to enhance the security of the whole reactor system .
Thus , it largely reduces the possibility to cause explosion or other accidents .
The VHTR system , if successful , will prevent most accidents to occur .
Finally , many people are worried about the high cost of establishing such kinds of the VHTR systems .
This may be true , but the value the VHTR system can raise and the benefit it will obtain cannot be ignored .
Firstly , the VHTR system can largely contribute to easing the energy crisis that is widely spread all over the world , which could save a large amount of financial budgets .
As Butler  mentioned , the very high temperature reactors can be used to split hydrogen from water thermochemically , which can meet the need for hydrogen fuel of the future .
As the energy crisis becomes worse , the energy demand will cause US nation's oil imports by 78% without a proper method to convert water into hydrogen .
Therefore , the VHTR system has the positive potential of reducing the rising rate of the oil fuel and resolving the problem of the energy shortage .
In addition , the VHTR system has a perfect design for the waste recycling .
The fuel used in the VHTR system is uranium dioxide or uranium carbide pellets called TRISO fuel .
It is difficult to remove the product because the pellets are durable , and this design discourages weapon proliferation , which makes the waste easy to concentrate and recycle .
According to the figure given in Butler's journal , the VHTR system produces no waste because it goes directly to repository .
Hence , such a design for the waste recycling can reduce the cost for the waste processing .
Furthermore , a number of researches are needed to develop the VHTR system , including new materials such as heat resistance , and new techniques such as temperature control .
Once these researches have been done , it is not only the VHTR system will benefit , but also many other industries .
Therefore , the great value and benefit from developing the concept of VHTR is far more than the high cost it requires .
It is necessary for the further research and development funding for VHTR .
The first generation of nuclear reactors has been built in 1950 .
Since then , continuous researches have been done to produce a better generation of nuclear reactors .
There are 436 active nuclear power plants in the world and 53 nuclear power plants are under construction .
Nuclear power plants represent more than 70 percent of our non-carbon generated electricity and consist of 17% of our world total energies consumption .
The benefits and usages of nuclear power plants are undeniable .
Not to mention , nuclear power plants have been widely deployed in many leading countries in the world such as United States , Japan , and China which use the nuclear power plants as one of their main power sources to propel energy industry .
The usages of the nuclear power plants are widely recognized and they are being integrated as part of those countries' promising energy sources .
Nuclear energy is the most concentrated source in terms of energy generation .
One kilogram uranium can release the same amount of energy as that released by 2400 tons of standard coal .
Its good alternative as an energy source not only reduce green house effects , but also helps in solving the problems of limited supplies of coal and oil .
For countries with limited natural resources , nuclear power plants serve as a dependable energy source .
According to the report from GIF  , tripling the number of nuclear power plants worldwide to 1000 plants could avoid the production of 1 billion tons of carbon emission per year by 2055 .
Nuclear power source has been deemed to be a promising energy source in the future .
However , the nuclear leak incidents happened in the past few decades in countries such as Three Miles Island , Pennsylvania , Chernobyl in Ukraine , and Bhopal in India have posted doubts on the reliability of the nuclear reactors .
"It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option .
However , before an expansion of nuclear power can be considered , key issues must be addressed including: security of nuclear fuel and waste , waste storage , and proliferation ."
Obama said in his energy plan that addressing certain key issues are needed before deciding to build more nuclear plants .
In response to this , the creation of the Generation IV International Forum  came into being .
It is an organization formed by 9 leading countries in the world which consists of Canada , China , Euratom  , France , Japan , Republic of Korea , South Africa , Switzerland , and United States .
The organization tries to resolve security issues posted by the current nuclear reactors .
100 international experts from GIF and other world leading nuclear power plant research centers have gathered themselves to find the most promising nuclear systems .
This led to the proposals of the six Generation IV Systems which offer the most promising performance , in terms of sustainability , proliferation resistance and physical protection , safety and reliability , and cost .
The six Generation IV Systems are being designed to counter the problems faced by the current nuclear reactors .
These state-of-the-art nuclear reactors will be able to minimize nuclear wastes and reduce the long-term stewardship burden posted by traditional nuclear reactors .
They have integrated safety design and back-up system to prevent accidents due to human errors and carelessness , therefore reducing the likelihood and degree of vector core damage .
Besides that , the new designs will have a much better life-cycle cost advantage over other energy sources .
The most important thing is that , they will not be an attractive route for diversion or theft of weapon-usable materials .
The physical protection of the new nuclear reactors will also prevent the act of terrorism .
The six Generation IV Reactor are revolutionary designs of nuclear reactors .
Out of the six proposals posted in the Generation IV Reactor , Very- High-Temperature Reactors  stands out for its potential capability to achieve an excellent thermal performance .
This is the only reactor that is researched by all the partner countries in GIF .
It is technically realizable and technologically well established by vendors and national laboratories .
The great breakthrough in the researches also suggests that the VHTR does not require intermediate refueling , therefore eliminates the likelihood of accidents .
The reactor operates by using a high temperature exchanger and electrical heater to avoid efficiency penalty and to enable the generation of electricity and hydrogen at the same time .
It was also known that the ultra-long life VHTR systems can be developed with the use of minor actinides  .
The Generation IV Reactor will be established after 2030 .
With today's high demand of energy sources , one can say that nuclear energy is an inevitable energy source in the future to come .

Many people mistakenly equate nuclear power to nuclear weapons although , in fact , they are in basically different categories .
Nuclear power , for a long time , has been one of the most useful inventions that serve the people .
Going along with the world's development , the Generation IV International Forum , which has the attendances of the ten nations mastering in nuclear power , has introduced the six new reactor concepts  .
One of them , the Molten Salt Reactor has a prospective application though there are several objections with respect to safety , cost and performance .
The first opinion that opposes the building of nuclear plants is the people's fear of danger .
Some think that nuclear plants emit radioactive waste into the environment , which may cause both pollution and genetic mutation; others are afraid of the safety system , meaning the plants are easy to explode .
These thoughts are due to the history of some nuclear accidents , for example , the meltdown of a nuclear plant at Three Miles Island in Pennsylvania .
However , nuclear power as well as the new Molten Salt Reactor system , in fact , is more safety and useful .
According to Declan Butler  , the Molten Salt Reactor system mainly uses fluoride salts , which also belong to heat-and corrosion-resistant materials , as coolant , which can operate for a very long time and also be safe and reliable .
The salts can keep the reactor's temperature at around 700 oC , which is acceptable in comparison with the others .
One advanced benefit from this system is its low pressure so that the reactor wall can handle good protection .
Another advantage from nuclear power is its green emission .
Current nuclear plants  and also future ones emit only hot steam while other electricity producers like coal plants pollute the environment with CO2 and SO2 .
In short , the Molten Salt Reactor system is safe to operate and friendly to the environment .
Some people relate nuclear plants to buildings for research rather than for producing electricity , and the cost for producing is high .
In fact , among other Generation IV Reactors as well as electricity generators , the Molten Salt Reactor seems to be the cheapest way to produce electricity power .
This is because the coolant  is cheap and recyclable .
Molten salts can be easily found in nature , and the purification technology used for them is simple and less costly than , for instance , lead-bismuth , sodium and helium .
Osman Kemal Kadiroglu  noted that the cost for the same amount of power produced by nuclear plants is cheaper than any other power generation technologies .
He compared them in term of the availability to build , cost to produce power and area of land occupied .
For example , the cost  for fuel used per Megawatt-hour energy is $5 for nuclear and $11 for coal plants  .
A nuclear plant can be built on any place , which does not require natural resources .
Other sources of energy need natural resources to operate: swift water flow for dams , strong blast for wind turbines , sun beam for solar panels .
Hence , their availability to build up is limited .
Besides , land used for a nuclear plant is less than other alternatives .
Solar or wind power need a lot of land to produce a same amount of energy .
In conclusion , nuclear power is safety , clean and effective , which most of people seem to forget .
With the cheap , safety , recyclable , low pressure , having-additional-produce and high performance properties of the Molten Salt Reactor system , it is one of the most potential electricity generators for the future .

One of the Achilles' heels of nuclear power plants is the dangers of radioactive radiation leakage to the environment .
Areas around such power plants become environmentally hostile to human and wildlife health .
Unfortunately for nuclear power plants , the Chernobyl nuclear incident has convinced the public to not support nuclear plants .
However , the government is pushing for a new generation IV technology that is safer and ensures that the Chernobyl event does not happen again .
Generation IV nuclear reactor plants promises higher redundancy , higher efficiency , better safety features than its predecessors .
The main objective in this new technological research is to search for cost effective and sustainable solutions to nuclear power  .
In this essay , we shall discuss the advantage of Lead cooled Fast Reactor  over Sodium cooled Fast Reactor  on the aspects of safety , cost and performance .
The LFR has better safety features compared to SFR .
The element sodium has a low boiling point of 1156 Kelvins , compared to lead's higher 2023 Kelvins , which is dangerous it becomes overheated and starts to boils .
In the event of an unprotected total loss of power , the LFR's core is able to passively quickly cool down , due to its low pressure drop and simple coolant design  .
Compared to the SFR , it has a high pressure drop and thus its temperature would increase dangerously beyond its boiling point .
Additional safety devices have to be implemented  .
On another note , the low reactivity and inertia of lead allows safe removal of fuel if the fuel rod pins fail during installation .
On the other hand , lead can become radioactive and therefore harmful to life during refueling when the lead is exposed .
While research is being done to control the lead's radioactivity , it is assuring that refueling is done every 8 years in large plants and every 15 years in smaller plants .
The risk of radioactive leakage is therefore minimal over its span of usage .
Cost has become a very important criterion in the world today; in this case , the LFR fits the bill very well .
Considering the economics of scale , the cost of building materials such as steel and concrete will increase significantly , hence the size of nuclear plant has become a consideration .
The LFR's smaller core and lesser required cooling systems , such as the omission of an intermediate cooling link , saves significant building costs as compared to SFR .
In fact , the lead/bismuth-cooled SVBR-75/100 is the cheapest to build amongst other types of fast reactors .
Furthermore , it costs less per kWh of electricity compared to SFR .
Another strong advantage is the scalability of LFR that allows it to be used in developing and hard to reach places , for instance , Africa . 
On the other hand , SFR does have some good points .
Sodium is four times more effective as a cooling agent than LFR , because of its better thermal hydraulic properties .
.
Furthermore , SFR has better net efficiency than LFR , 46 .2% versus 34 .6% for the latter .
SFR has been the mainstream for nuclear power plants in the past years and therefore more familiar and accepted .
However research is needed to prove the capability of sodium in high temperatures , as it has a low boiling point , which will result in a complex design .
All in all , the overwhelming advantages of LFR as a future implementation of the new generation IV nuclear plant , proves that it is better than the SFR in all of the above aspects .
Therefore , we should push for development of LFR nuclear power plants .
Environmentalists claim that green energy such as solar , wind and hydro energy are the trusted technologies which we should focus our research and funds on in meeting the increasing energy needs .
While it is understandable that such technologies are everlasting , cheap and clean to adopt as resources used are free and renewable and the processes do not emit any harmful materials into the environment , we notice that these technologies cannot be readily implemented throughout the world .
This is because they rely heavily on weather conditions which vary drastically according to location and time or may be even unpredictable at times .
On the other hand , with its simple design and high efficiency , it is fairly cheap to build and operate the VHTR .
The VHTR can be built anywhere on an empty plot of land .
The fact that uranium is also widely available in ample supply is in contrast with the trend of the rapidly depleting coal and natural gases reserves .
Henceforth , nuclear power has limitless potentials for us to look into and the cost of its usage is fairly cheap .
To conclude , nuclear energy is relatively cheap , environmentally and socially responsible and safe to use .
Most of the participating nations and organizations of the Generation IV International Forum are supportive of this new technology and they have pooled US$500 million over the next 5 years to fund its further research and development  .
It is imperative for us to accept and embrace this new form of technology in order to meet the world's increasing energy demand .
An accident is often an unintended action which results in vast effects .
One example will be the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 during a non-routine operation .
There was a sequence of events that caused the explosion of reactor number 4 that led to the release of radioactive fission products to atmosphere .
This resulted in many deaths , including those that died from the accident , those firefighters and majority from those attributed to radiation .
There were a number of reports published that summarized this accident , concluding that the sequence of events was due to human error and design faults .
There are arguments that the lack of knowledge of the operators and the technical failure of equipments could not be solved with the application of psychology .
However , it seems otherwise since psychology is a study of human mental or behavior .
This incident occurred during a non-routine operation to test ability of turbine , in times of power failure , to produce sufficient power .
For that , all backup systems were switched off to avoid disturbance .
One main factor that resulted in the explosion was the activating of the emergency button by operators .
The operators were inadequately trained .
They did not know that with the activation of the button , there will be a sudden surge of power before dropping reactivity .
It is thus argued that psychology may not be helpful in this case as the behavior of the operators is beyond the control of the design engineers .
However , considering the mentality of the operators , it was logical for them to do so since it was meant as an emergency action .
This shifted the responsibility to the design engineers .
A successful designed process is one that is foolproof .
The behavior of operators should be anticipated and thus engineers could have reduced the complexity of task by providing short and efficient procedure guidelines .
The failure to do so showed that the engineers have overestimated operators' knowledge of the process .
In other words , it is unfair to blame the operators as unskilled or inexperience when accidents happened .
Furthermore , the testing of limits of the reactor was not a routine operations , thus the lack of knowledge to react is considerable and should be anticipated and counteracted .
Even so , many still think that psychology may not come in handy to prevent accidents from happening , especially when it is technical faults .
In the Chernobyl case , the positive coefficient of the reactor is one major technical fault .
This characteristic will cause reactors to be unstable at low power level .
It was due to the instability of the reactor that there was this rapid power increment resulting in explosions .
Despite this dangerous feature , engineers still chose this type of reactor as they deemed it as the best choice .
Another fatal technical fault is the chosen design of the control rods .
These control rods will cause a sudden surge in power before reducing reactivity .
It was thus argued that psychology is not useful as engineers were aware of the consequences but there was no better solution .
While it may be true that there was no better choice with the level of technology then , the engineers could have improved the designs .
According to Wolfgang Botsch , a similar error with the positive coefficient of the reactor had already occurred in Lithuania in 1983 .
However , sadly , this experience was not passed down to the design crew of Chernobyl .
Therefore , it is not right to say that the reactor was the best choice to be used in the plant .
If they had adopted the use of psychology , they might have review safety records of that type of reactor in the industry before deciding on it .
Furthermore , the typical approach by the engineers to find solutions often starts with a fixed plan with the application of their knowledge .
However , in this process , there may be partial failures in the system which the engineers failed to identify and thus unable to improve safety of the system .
Therefore , a systematic thinking is recommended , where engineers constantly analyze one's own approach and decisions so as to make corrective actions to improve the safety of whole system .
By doing so , we are adopting the path of feedforward control of safety .
Such is preferred than making corrections only after accident occurred .
It will be too late .
This evaluation is also part of psychology application , where the mistakes from the engineers are reduced as much as possible to safeguard the complex high hazard system . 
It should be evident that psychology plays a huge role in the design process in order to ensure the safety of the system .
A serious disaster is usually caused by a series of events such as the case with Chernobyl .
After the incident , corrective actions are done but these are feedback controls of safety .
The path of feed forward control of safety should be adopted instead .
This emphasizes much on the use of psychology in the design process .
Engineers should anticipate the end users' behavior , reducing the complexity of the system while implementing safety measures .
With that , the disaster could have been prevented .
Men have always wanted to fly freely since the realization of aeroplane , therefore , being able to travel great distances with freedom of route and comfort has since been the aim of the transportation industry .
Back in 1940 , Henry Ford , chairman of Ford Motor Company , said , "Mark my words , a combination airplane and motor is coming .
You may smile , but it will come ."
In year 2008 , the prototype of Skycar , priced at over US$3million , was invented and put on sale via the auction site , eBay .
Its developer , Moller International regarded the invention as the future of transport .
Being able to take-off and land vertically with very little noise , it soon attracted the attention of not just the US Army but also rich businessmen who can rely on it to travel to different places at ease .
Some consumers commented that the structure and shape of the Skycar should be modified as it looks weird and seems to be out of logic .
However , do these people know that the structure of the Skycar is designed to provide the best aerodynamic stability ?
Although the designers modified the airfoil at the expense of rising it's cost , if the vehicle were to be less stable , will the consumer still be interested in the product ?
From various examples and historical facts , we can safely say that most consumers will not purchase a product that does not have safety features that are up to standard .
Therefore , where design safety is concerned , it is of the utmost importance .
The Skycar has since passed it flight test and awaiting its approved from the Federal Aviation Administration to be recognised as commercial vehicle .
As the market of such vehicle grows , mass production is likely to take place which will in turn lower its cost price .
In near future , we should be able to purchase one at the price of a regular car .
The rapid development of countries and expansion of population have created a world of increasing unable to meet the demand of energy .Additionally , fossil fuel is criticized as the main contributing factor for green house gas effect .
As such , there is a pressing need to search for alternative renewable forms and energy which is comparative more eco-friendly and highly effective .
In such context , nuclear energy created by using the Generation IV  reactor is able to replace for fossil fuel that is believed to be the main cause for global warming .
One such reactor is the Very High Temperature Reactor  which can "supply electricity and process heat to a broad spectrum of high-temperature and energy-intensive processes"  .
Some may argue , with skepticism , that the safety issues of this reactor is still imminent and hence , nuclear power should not be supported .
However , in my opinion , on the whole , the benefits gained from VHTR will far exceed the problems created .
Some opponent raise the doubt of the performance of VHTR .
However , VHTR has proven itself as a high-efficiency system .
First , VHTR is performed under very high temperature , therefore allowing for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity .
For example , Butler  reported that it "could squeeze 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with other conventional plants" .
Besides , VHTR can also be used to split hydrogen from water thermo-chemically .
Nowadays , there is an increasing demand for energy due to fast economic development , thus we need a power generator method that would be sustainable in the long term .
Actually , fossil fuel is also possible but with the spike of in energy consumption in the past few decades , fossil fuel is predicted to deplete by 2040 .
Moreover , the fossil fuel's emission of carbon dioxide which contributes to soaring green house gas would not happen with nuclear power .
In short , I believe that with further research , the efficiency of the nuclear power can be increased , making it potential as our energy resource in the future .
Some skeptics feel that the building of VHTR is a risky investment , complaining that VHTR is expensive source of energy , hence infeasible .
Yet , although the fixed cost of building is high , it is myopic to merely look at the short run cost while neglecting the long run benefit .
Due to low maintenance , the fixed cost would be lower in a near future time .
Zheng L . reported that China is planning to install nuclear power capacity of 86 gigawatts by 2020 , up nearly 10 fold from the capactity it had by the end of 2008 .
The fact that China , one the world largest consumers of energy , is willing to spend high proportion of money for this project show the foresee long run benefit that nuclear power can bring about , especially since Chinese government has been always very pragmatic .
The final argument advanced by the opponent is that while high temperature makes electricity and hydrogen production easier , it also poses a threat of explosion .
For example , two incidents-an accident in 1979 in which the reactor core lost coolant and partially melted , and the 1986 catastrophe in which a reactor exploded and released radioactivity into the atmosphere greatly increased concerns about the safety of nuclear power .
Yet , VHTR is actually still safe and reliable to operate with improved accident management and mitigation and reduced off-side response with little human intervention .
Last but not least , some will question why helium with low thermal conductivity is chosen as coolant , given that some other coolant , for instance molten salt , allows better electric conversion efficiency than a helium-cooled VHTR operating at similar conditions .
However , the selection of coolant based on many factors .
First , "helium gas provides a nonreacting cooling medium with a low nuclear cross section that can either directly drive a turbine for power production , or can be directed to process"  .
Second , VHTR uses helium as a coolant for safety purposes .
Helium is an inert gas , so it will not chemically react with any material , and exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive , unlike most other possible coolants .
Balancing all these factors , Helium is still the overall best coolant .
Hence , this selection proves the safeness of VHTR .
Thomas Malthus , a famous demographer , published a theory that population growth will eventually outstrip resources .
Hence , the research for alternative energy is necessary .
Although there is certain undenied limitation of VHTR , I am strongly convicted that with the current technology advances , the limitation will be solved .
With more fund channeled into research this area , the potential of VHTR could be maximized .
The most common method of power generation for close to 150 years requires the burning of fossil fuels such as oil or coal .
However , the byproducts from the burning of fossil fuels , greenhouse and acidic gases , have caused much devastation to our planet .
Perhaps a solution to save our planet will be to use a cleaner energy source  nuclear power which does not emit any harmful gases .
The Very High Temperature Reactor  is a Gen IV reactor that shows great promise and potential .
However , detractors of nuclear power cited the risk of another catastrophic accident , the proliferation of nuclear arms , the lower thermal efficiency of nuclear plants and the high cost of building a plant .
This article will attempt to justify the merits of funding further research on VHTR through refuting the detractors' claims in terms of safety , performance and cost .
Thesis Statement
The world is concerned with the safety of nuclear power plants and the possibility of nuclear arms proliferation .TS Past incidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island  had left many in doubt of the technology .
In recent news , both North Korea and Iran have been told to step back on their plans of a nuclear power plant in fear that the same radioactive materials used for energy generation will be used in nuclear weapons .
The VHTR design does not include the controversial method of waste recycling , whereby plutonium is extracted in a pure form  .
Hence , this design reduces the probability of nuclear arms proliferation .
Within the VHTR reactor , the nuclear fuel is enclosed within pebbles of silicon carbide and pyro-carbon  which are able to contain the radiation .
The coolant used is helium gas instead of water .
Helium gas is superior because it will not get irradiated and does not undergo volume expansion phase change .
Even if the reactor body is breached , there will be no explosive dispersion of radioactive materials .
Therefore , the VHTR design is safer than current nuclear reactors and less susceptible to nuclear arms proliferation  .
Moreover , detractors have argued that the high temperature generated in nuclear reactors is not fully utilized and conventional non-nuclear energy generation methods have better performance in terms of thermal efficiency .TS Existing nuclear plants have thermal efficiency of approximately 33%  compared to 70% and above for non-nuclear power plants .
Firstly , the VHTR operates at close to 1000 C compared to 300-400  C in current nuclear reactors .
This higher temperature translates to the extraction of 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel  .
Improved engineering and design will further increase the thermal efficiency of the power plant in the future .
Secondly , although the thermal efficiency of nuclear plants is lower , the actual amount of power generated per unit mass of fuel is actually much higher than that of fossil fuels .
Hence the method of using thermal efficiency for comparison is not practical .
Lastly , because of the higher temperature , it is possible to produce hydrogen gas from water thermochemically  .
There is a demand for hydrogen gas which may become a fuel for cars in the future .
Therefore , the VHTR design is superior as it produces more energy and hydrogen gas
Another objection is raised by the taxpayers; they are not convinced with the heavy investment of building a nuclear plant .TS A nuclear plant costs on average , a billion dollars and is designed with a lifespan of sixty years  .
Although the price is high , the nuclear plant will not produce any greenhouse or acidic gases .
Acid rain had caused deforestation and affected fisheries , the damages amounts to millions per year .
Global warming has been linked to the more frequent occurrence of natural disasters .
These disasters created uncountable losses in terms of damage to infrastructure , economy and lives .
In rebuttal to the "limited lifespan" of the nuclear plant , in sixty years , this nuclear plant will have produced much cheaper electricity and caused less harm to the environment .
These two advantages are definitely significant .
On March 27 , 1977 , the world's worst aviation accident happened in Tenerife , a Spanish island .
Due to the previous terrorism attack at another airport , excessive planes were diverted to the Tenerife airport .
The collision involved two Boeing 747s , KLM and Pan Am; KLM took off while Pan Am was still on the runway .
Many factors such as foggy weather contributed to the accident; however , the most significant causes are considered to be the ambiguous phraseology in the comment "We are uh taking off" or "We are at takeoff" from KLM and the single channel radio which made the crucial readback for clearance lost in radio squelch  .
The accident happened mainly due to the KLM pilot's taking off without clearance  .
Proponents may argue that with the input of psychology , the designers of the airport should have anticipated such possible dangers and stricter laws to insist on proper phraseology and check for clearance should have been put into use .
Granted , emphasis on proper phraseology might have improved the situation .
However , since the staff were working in a stressful environment , it is highly likely that they would have used improper phraseology subconsciously .
According to Karl Weick , professor of psychology at the University of Michigan , people tend to depend on what they are first taught and use most frequently under pressure .
Applied to Tenerife , the captain was a training pilot who was most familiar with the ambiguous word "takeoff" and the controller was Spanish who spoke with a strong accent  .
Hence miscommunication could still happen , having the tense situation of Tenerife in mind .
Moreover , even with the relatively stricter rules implemented after the accident , miscommunication still causes accidents such as the Garuda A300 Airbus crash in Sumatra  .
For takeoff regulation , it is the first officer's responsibility to obtain ATC clearance and oversee the captain .
However , the first officer on KLM misunderstood the controller .
What is worse , the KLM captain wanted to take off without ATC clearance , and then took off before readback was completed after the suspension of his decision by the first officer to ask for clearance .
In addition , when the flight engineer doubted the clearance of the Pan Am on the taxiway , both the captain and the first officer ignored his query  , n .d .) .
With such poor cooperation between the aviators , the use of psychology might still have failed .
Other than human errors , the Tenerife accident is also a combination of various accidental factors .
Firstly , the terrorism attack was difficult to predict .
For the technical part , the centerline lights were out of operation which disabled the two planes from seeing each other; the single channel radio made the response inaudible and there was no ground radar  .
Besides , the thick fog formed worsened the situation .
The adoption of psychology in design might have taken a few of the factors into consideration , but it was unlikely to have anticipated al and hence there would still be potential hazards .
Furthermore , the terrorism attack would reduce the effectiveness of improvements in equipment .
The airport was so crowded that the normal routines were blocked  .
With the combination of the fact that the controllers were bad at English and unfamiliar with handling Boeing 747s  , there was a high chance that accident would happen even with contingency plans .
In fact , the Pan Am was told to turn at exit C-3 which was impossible for a 747 so the captain decided to turn at C-4 and collided with KLM between C-3 and C-4 exits  .
Human beings have come across severe energy problems in the 21 century .
Scientists have put in a lot effort to the development in nuclear energy which is one of the major modern energy resources nowadays .
Nuclear energy is the kind of energy released by the splitting or merging together of the nuclei of atoms .
It is one of the clean and renewable energy which can help us solve the emergent problems of energy shortage .
However , some accidents during the decades of the use of nuclear energy resulted in many people worrying about their safety with nuclear energy around them .
For example , on April 26th 1986 , the leak and explosion in the nuclear power plants of Chernobyl  .
There are still many problems remaining .
But from my point of view , I believe nuclear energy can make much more benefits than the lost .
Hence we should pay great attention to and make rational use of nuclear energy .
The first reason some people are afraid of nuclear energy is because they cannot get rid of the influence of accidents like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island  .
But , something they may not be clear about is in the half century of Nuclear Age , only about one or two deaths per year are attributed by nuclear energy accidents .
Compared with that , the number of coal mine accidents deaths is much largerit reaches 7530 per year .
Besides that , nuclear power plants are safer than coal mines due to the reason that designers and engineers use the high-tech in building nuclear power plant and there are strict rules of operation .
So it is easier to guarantee the safety of nuclear power plants because if workers follow the regulations , no accidents will be caused .
Comparatively speaking , many illegal coal mines with simple and crude facilities are still running underground .
It is the real hazard trouble .
And consider with one of the six generation IV reactor  , lead-cooled fast reactors; scientists are trying to use lead-bismuth as new coolant .
It can keep nuclear reactor operating under lower temperature and pressure .
Thus it will make the nuclear core even safer .
From the above reasons , we can see that nuclear energy is not as dangerous as people expect , contrarily , it is one of the safest energy humans being can use in modern society .
Secondly , as I mentioned above , the scientists are trying to develop the lead-cooled fast reactor , however , the enormous size of investment have prevented most countries from this kind of research .
And many countries are still wondering whether to build nuclear power plants because they cost a lot of money and citizens are not willing to pay their tax for that .
But the government should foresee the great benefits by building nuclear power plants .
Nowadays 442 nuclear power plants are working all over world , contributing about 19 percent of the world's electricity supply .
Another case in point is American , "They produce much of the electricity that fuels our economic growth .
They power new industrial technologies that boost our Gross National Product and improve our global competitiveness"  .
And with modern technologies , nuclear power plants can produce electricity more efficiently .
Statistics shows that , in 1996 , nuclear power produced 674 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity , which was more than the total electricity consumed in the early 1950s  .
Thus to sum up , nuclear power plants can produce electricity with higher efficiency and larger amount compared to fuel or coal burning electric generating plant .
It can bring great economic benefit .
In conclusion , nuclear energy is not dangerous to human being so that we should make full use of nuclear energy to benefit the whole of mankind .
It is said that the world's population will expand from the current 6 billion to around 10 billion by the year 2050  , which will push us into an even more serious energy shortage position unless we successfully find new kinds of energy as soon as possible .
In fact , human beings have been seeking for the solution to energy issues for a long time .
So far we have already developed solar energy , wind energy , nuclear energy and many others .
However , none of these can be the ideal energy to us now due to the technological problems , economic concern , or potential dangers .
Among all these new kinds of energy , nuclear energy is regarded as the most controversial one which has been the hotspot since its appearance .
Whether to develop and promote the use of nuclear energy has triggered firm discussion among both experts and common people .
In my opinion , we should give more support to nuclear development because of its high efficiency , none-greenhouse-gas emission and its valuable by-products during the reaction .
Some opponents may argue that other kinds of energy can also be environmentally friendly , such as solar energy and wind force .
There is no need spending so much on nuclear energy development .
However , in terms of efficiency and economic value , nuclear energy takes great advantages over both solar energy and wind force .
The Generation reactors are expected to increase the efficiency of electricity production to as high as 50% while the efficiency of solar energy is no more than 40% in the lab  which means its actual efficiency of industrial application will be even lower .
Besides this , in the process of nuclear reaction , large amount of hydrogen can be generated for the use of petroleum refinement and also as new advanced fuel in transportation  .
It is said that for America the energy demand of transport alone will cause increase of oil imports by 78% by the end of 2025 if it does not switch the dependence on oil to hydrogen  .
So the Very-High-Temperature-Reactor  is believed to play an important role in America's energy crisis , because it can help to reduce the dependence on oil for its over 2 million normal cubic meters hydrogen production per day .
Though solar energy and wind force can also contribute to environment protection , nuclear energy indeed has its unique advantages which they cannot rival with .
Apart from this , opponents may be worried that the nuclear reactors would become the target of terrorists because of disastrous consequences after its ruin .
However , the new advanced feature of VHTR can effectively protect itself from the damage of terrorists .
Normally , the terrorists attempt to make an accident by shutting off the coolant or power supply of the system .
But they will not expect that the meltdown proof in VHTR can cool them down when accidents happen and minimize the interaction with human beings  .
So nuclear reactor would not be a desirable target for terrorists any more .
Besides these two points , there is a common concern among both experts and common people .
It is the health damage triggered by radioactivity .
First , we need to know the fact that most radioactive mass called plutonium waste is mainly produced during the reprocessing step .
However , in the VHTR system , the waste will go to repository directly instead of undergoing the waste recycling .
This can reduce the radioactivity of plutonium to a certain extent .
Furthermore , nowadays most nuclear reactors are built quite far from cities , so people do not need to worry too much about the effect of radioactivity .
To sum up , the Generation reactors have made great improvements compared to the older generations in terms of both technology and safety features .
On one hand , nuclear energy has the advantage of high efficiency , none-greenhouse-gas emission and the by-product hydrogen which is supposed to be another ideal energy .
On the other hand , the fact that nuclear power plants contribute about 16% electricity to the world , which is the largest share among all the new developed energy sources  , indicates that nuclear power has become more and more essential to human beings .
Given both the advantages of nuclear energy and the current situation , it is practical and urgent for us to put concerted efforts to the development of nuclear energy .
There are claims and myths that the Lithium ion rechargeable batteries that power the EV will explode and cause massive damage to the vehicle and the driver .
To ensure safety , carmakers are rigorously testing their batteries .
Nissan and Mitsubishi , for instance , expose the batteries to extreme temperatures , continuously charge and discharge the batteries , and smash them to experiment real road accidents  .
Besides that , carmakers also improve the materials of the battery to minimize the risk of overheating .
Anti-impact cage is added to shield the battery from being crushed .
In order to prevent over charging and discharging , advanced microchips will be used to monitor the batteries capacity .
With these improvements , Osamu Masuko , president of the Mithubishi Motors says that gasoline is relatively far more dangerous than batteries .
Electric vehicle carries large and heavy battery packs to increase the mileage per charge .
These heavy batteries results in an EV being much heavier compared to an identical gasoline vehicle .
However , if the weight of the batteries in the vehicles is arranged correctly , the EV should be able to achieve higher stability .
Other than that , in a crash test , the occupants of a lighter vehicle will suffer from higher damage compared to a heavy vehicle  .
In comparison , an accident involved a 1400 Kg vehicle will cause about 50 percent fewer injuries than a 900 Kg vehicle .
Therefore , the weight from the batteries brings safety benefits .
The heart is the most vital organ for every human being .
This brings no surprise to cardiovascular diseases being one of the leading causes of death in the world today1 .
Patients with cardiovascular disease usually suffer from heart failure , where the heart ceases to work leading to a sudden heart attack .
Heart transplant was the only option to save these patients initially .
This process requires finding a suitable donor with a compatible heart at a short period of time .
Proving to be very difficult , the mortality rate of cardiovascular disease remains high .
As medical technology advanced , heavy amounts of research and development have been put to finding a better alternative for saving cardiovascular disease patients .
The research and development efforts gave rise to the creation of Heartmate II .
Like how a heart pumps blood to the rest of the body , Heartmate is attached to a patient's heart to take over the role of the original organ .
Being readily available and sustainable , it is often used as a short-term replacement for patients waiting for a suitable heart donor to arrive .
Battery life is one of the main concerns that need to be addressed for the Heartmate II .
Currently , the external battery pack of two AA sized batteries supports the Heartmate II for a good five hours3 .
Though extra batteries can be brought to sustain the appliance , this may be insufficient and can be an area where human error occurs to cause fatalities due to power shortages .
As such , I propose an improvement in battery life by having a better power source , one that would last for more than half a day so as to keep the changing of the battery as minimal as possible .
This would lessen the possibilities for power shortage accidents to occur .
However , an improved battery life could lead to a compromise in the size of Heartmate II .
The bulkiness of the device could reduce the mobility of a patient and in turn increase the possibility for bleeding issues internally .
Essentially , what needs to be achieved is a compact and less bulky battery with longer life span .
Another factor to increase the safety of Heartmate II would be the alteration of the materials used to manufacture the appliance .
Firstly , it has been reflected that users are facing problems with regard to issues surrounding water resistivity externally3 .
Being caught in a rain would prove to be fatal to a Heartmate II user .
Upgrading the material's water resistivity would make Heartmate II safer .
Furthermore , users could even enable the user to take a proper bath , instead of being restricted to just wiping themselves clean with a wet cloth .
In addition , the materials of the wall of the internal artificial ventricles and pump have to be made to have none or negligible resistance so as to ensure smoother blood flow rate .
Lastly , a lighter material should be preferable for the Heartmate II to reduce any strain whilst being attached to its users internally and externally .
All these elements are crucial to the performance and safety of the Heartmate II .
There exist many more avenues that can be explored to improve the Heartmate II and the invention of an artificial heart is still in early stages of its development .
Amidst this discussion , I feel that the cost should not be a determining factor in the construction and application for such health devices that could determines ones life and death .
Issues of security and performance hold the highest priority for medical prototype designs like the Heartmate II .
I strongly feel that the strife for more development and research should be done for the sake of creating a more durable and lightweight Heartmate III .
Over the decades , mankind has improved tremendously in terms of technologies .
People are now living in a world filled with technologies in every edge of the world powered by electricity .
This shows the significance of electricity as compared to the past .
However , the days when people use more electricity than they produce are approaching .
According to Butler , the global demand for energy is expected to double by 2050  .
This forces people to resort into producing energy through nuclear reactors which have higher outputs .
One of the nuclear reactors of Generation-IV nuclear reactor concepts which are highly discussed is the molten salt reactor .
Fundings should be allocated for further research of MSR as MSR is able to address the issues of safety ,cost and performance which are the main public's concerns .
Secondly , it has always been a general perception from the public that the cost incurred to build a nuclear reactor is always huge .
This causes not many efforts are being taken to initiate a nuclear reactor project as they believe the project is not feasible .
Another related concern is the amount of cost incurred from the maintainence of the reactor .
However , MSR is known to be among the cheapest nuclear reactor .
From the table shown by R .W .Moir) the cost incurred by MSR is 31 .3$ for every megawatt of energy generated per hour which is the least compared to the current technologies used .
Also , MSR will be using thorium as fuel where thorium is so abundant in the world as compare to current technologies which mostly use coals as fuel where coals are expected to last just for another 146years according to Energy Information Administration  .
These show that MSR are economical and should have cleared any doubts regarding further research on MSR as it is a feasible project in the long run as it makes use of resources which are abundant .
Lastly , the public has doubts about the performance of MSR .
Among the issues highlighted were whether it has higher output than other reactors and the technologies required to fully utilize MSR .
As the power required to overcome heat-exchanger pressure drops in a molten-salt system is typically about one-twentieth of a helium system , MSR has higher efficiency than most reactors .
Also , the size of a molten-salt heat-transport loop is only a small fraction of those using helium and is small relative to those for other coolant which leads to usage of a smaller area .
If fundings are provided for researches on MSR , there is no doubt that MSR can be fully utilize .
Although MSR generally generate less energy as compared to other nuclear reactors , the lesser space it requires can make up for it .
Thus , the efficiency rate is still very comparable to other reactors of high efficiency rate .
In conclusion , it is evident that MSR is worth the fundings for the research given the attributes it possess .
If further researches are being done , there is no doubt that MSR will be able to improve its weakness in having higher output as well as further refine on its strong points which is economical and safe to use .
Nuclear technology has been around in the world for many decades .
Due to its huge energy production and no emission of carbon dioxides , many nuclear power plants have been built .
However , the controversy on the construction has been an issue since then .
People have been disputing about the safety problems and the cost brought by these plants for a long time .
Despite the controversy  , the nuclear power plants still find their ways back onto the table .
During Generation IV International Forum , the concept of Very-high-temperature reactor is raised which is more efficient than the previous ones .
.
From my perspective , it is very meaningful to research on this , through which we can build more efficient and safer reactors so that the energy problem can be solved to a great extent .
In conclusion , energy is the key to keeping our society and economy development sustainable .
So far , the nuclear reactor especially VHTR maybe the best choice to supply the energy .
Undeniably , nuclear power is always dangerous .
However , we must realize that the probability is very low and many measures have been taken to guarantee the security .
Thus , it is essential to do research on VHTR and it will deserve the effort and the funds we spend in the future .
The world is much concerned about the CO2 emission because of global warming .
So people are trying to find cheaper cleaner and more sustainable fuels for the energy supply to replace the traditional oil and fuel which are the main source of carbon dioxide emission .
Besides , the demands for the energy is soaring , a more efficient way should be used to generate energy .
Thus , nuclear power is a proper choice .
However , given the accidents of nuclear meltdown , people are worried about the safety issue of using new clear power .
While , experts have found a new generation of new clear reactors are safer and more effective than the old generation .
Among these , the very high temperature reactor , which is "a graphite-moderated , helium-cooled with a once through uranium fuel cycle" , is the most promising one  .
It has high-efficiency electricity production and hydrogen generation , safety and comparable economics .
The very high temperature reactor , belonging to the new generation , has a high efficiency of energy conversion and the applications can be extend to hydrogen generation .
Firstly , it uses graphite as a moderator , a substance which neutrons collide with , so that the efficiency is improved .
During the process , the moderator is one of the important ingredients .
A good moderator is the one that should not absorb too much energy when the neutrons bounce off nor absorb the neutrons before they split .
Graphite is a good one compared with the ordinary moderator which is water since graphite is heat resistant .
So using graphite increases the efficiency of the usage of uranium and reduce the lost of energy .
Secondly , operating at very high temperatures , a much higher proportion of the energy from the core can be turned into electricity and a much higher proportion of the U235 can be split .
Besides , due to the high temperature , hydrogen , which can be used in transportation and other industry is also produced from water splitting  .
Apart from safety issue , in order to implement the very high temperature reactor , people also concern about the economic factor .
Without arguing , it is more expensive to build a new clear plant , while , after the start-up , the operating cost is cheaper because of high-efficiency , lower-cost high-temperature reactor for electricity and hydrogen production .
Reported by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , the overall operating costs for nuclear power plants is roughly the same as the recent coal-fired plants and below the costs of operating most gas-fired generation units  .
Besides , a technoeconomic optimization method has developed and can be applied to the power conversion system of a very high temperature reactor , taking both investment costs and operating costs into account  Concerning over the energy resource availability , climate change , air quality , and energy security issue , nuclear power may take an important role in future .
The very high temperature reactor , being one of the possible systems of new generation power , which is aim to achieve improvements in economic competitiveness , nuclear safety , is promising to be implemented in the future .
With not much fossil fuel left on earth , it is impossible to meet the increasing energy demand which is predicted to double by 2050 in the following years if the energy system keeps its current energy structure .
.
Under these circumstance , scientists have come up with the ideathe very high temperature reactor  to make use of nuclear in a safer and more efficient way .
However , its feature , very high temperature , leads to a lot of concerns from the public .
People wonder the existence of suitable material to build this reactor .
They concern about the probability of radioactivity leaking .
And they think it is not a good business in terms of the cost to make this reactor run properly and safely .
Although some of the technological problems have not been conquered , the current research and data can tell us that we are not far from those aims .
Through more research , we can make this proposal come true .
Firstly , people wonder whether scientists can find a suitable material that can withstand such high temperature , more than 1000 , comparing to that of the current nuclear reactor which is less 330 .  .
It is true that there is a huge jump between these two levels , but that does not necessarily mean impossible .
In 2004 , Japan did a test on a nuclear plant in which the temperature reached 950 .
Besides the encouraging practice experience , scientists also found some amazing ways to reach much higher temperature theoretically .
Scientists can use a certain way to significantly increase the thermal property .
They can even get a kind of materialZrCwhich has a melting point of 3540 .  .
It is estimated that the first VHTR can be built around 2020 .
If the research in the material is financially supported well , this material obstacle will be overcome by that time .
Secondly , some people concern about leaking of radioactivity after a period of running although the reactor maybe good enough to hold all radioactivity inside at the beginning .
Scientifically speaking , this problem belongs to the life of material area .
As mentioned in the last paragraph , the material that will be used to build the reactor can withstand the high temperature .
Consequently , the only aspect left is the corrosion factor .
The most serious corrosion factor is due to the radiation .
That is why engineers have set the timeline to replace some certain parts of the reactor that maybe not safe after some years .
For instance , the graphite should be replaced every 4 to 10 years .
.
The other common aspect that may have some influence in the safety area is the reaction between coolant and the crust of the reactor which may directly results in radioactivity leaking and even explosion .
However , it is not a big problem for VHTR because the coolant of this reactor is helium , which is an inert gas .
It does not react with the crust even though it is under the high temperature .
That is to say , the possibility of radiation leaking closes to zero in the VHTR .
Thirdly , some people do not think that we can get enough benefit if we build this reactor at such high expense .
It is indeed quite expensive to build such a reactor but we cannot look down upon the benefit that we will get after the reactor works .
According to the design , VHTR could squeeze 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel comparing to the traditional reactors and it also can produce hydrogen at the same time which is considered as an ideal energy .
.
VHTR is worth building .
In conclusion , the VHTR is a safe and efficient nuclear plant .
It is no doubt that scientists can overcome the obstacles to find a suitable material and make sure the reactor will never leak any radiation .
And the cost of building VHTR is likely to decrease since the technology and knowledge is improved .
Now the most important thing we should do is to support the research in this topic and make sure the schedule goes smoothly .
Most of the present research into the nuclear reactor designs is being directed into perfecting the series of reactors called the GENERATION IV REACTORS .
All these reactors are still in the design stage and do not have operational status .They are aimed at providing energy in a more safe and efficient way .There are 6 types of reactors amongst the Generation 4 reactors each with its own advantages and disadadvantages .However  , the type of reactor called the Very High Temperature Reactor  seems really promising and has much greater potential than the other models .
The fuel which is used in VHTR is uranium carbide pellets which are extremely heat resistant .
One of the major reasons for accidents in a nuclear power plant is the meltdown within a nuclear reactor .
With the fuel being so thermally inactive that it doesn't break down even in the event of a meltdown clearly poses as a major safety advantage .Another advantage is that the VHTR does not require frequent refuelling which extracts a heavy toll on the human labour  .
This takes care of a potential risk , human error .
Infact the refuelling in this type of reactor can be achieved when it is still running .It is so highly efficient that a single pebble can last upto three years . 
One of the major problems related to generating energy from nuclear fuel is the disposal of the spent fuel which is highly radioactive .
In the case of the VHTR the spent fuel is literally infissionable .
The energy generation is so efficient that there is almost a negligible amount of fissionable substance left .
China , Canada , France  , Japan , Euratom and the USA have already signed on the System Agreement for the VHTR under the Framework Agreement  .The total budget for the research and development of the Generation 4 reactors is estimated to be 6 Billion USD according to a GreenPeace report of 2005  .
Arguments to support further research and development funding for Very High Temperature Reactor .
Critics of nuclear power maintain that the production of nuclear power is dangerous as there is a dangerous possibility of a radioactive leakage .
However , due to technological advancements in the VHTR , this is no longer an area of concern .
The coolant used in VHTR is helium , an inert gas that does not react chemically with any material .
Exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive .
As such , a leakage would not be radioactive .
The VHTR is a safe reactor which has a 'pebble bed core' .
Spherical fuel elements are termed as 'pebble' .
Each pebble , containing thousands of micro fuel particles , is essentially a mini nuclear reactor made of graphite .
These pebbles are coated with multiple layers of hard ceramic layer which results in the pebbles being extremely heat resistant .
If a meltdown were to occur , the pebbles will not crack easily or release harmful radiation or fission products .
As such , a leakage is unlikely to be radioactive in nature .
Some also argue that the production of nuclear power might give rise to more terror attacks .
Terrorists can extract plutonium from the nuclear waste for weapon production or simply use them as 'dirty bombs' for terror attacks .
But improvements made to the containment structure and a new reactor technology will prevent the terrorist from succeeding .
The 5 feet thick containment vessel will protect the contents from inside and outside .
The layers of ceramic coated on the pebbles are also very hard and durable .
Hence it would be very difficult for anyone to extract the fissionable materials within the reactor core .
In addition , the spent fuel from VHTR contains an insignificant amount of fissionable materials , thus it would pose less of a threat if it were to end up in the hands of terrorists .
Another argument from the opponents of nuclear power is that nuclear waste is non-biodegradable and that radiation from the waste is deadly for those who are constantly exposed to it .
However , the amount of nuclear waste and its negative effects will be greatly reduced with the use of VHTR .
The VHTR has the ability of using existing nuclear waste to produce electricity .
This will considerably reduce the amount of nuclear waste produced .
The half-lives of these nuclear wastes will be shortened to just a few decades instead of the few millenniums with the existing technology .
With future technological breakthroughs in the future , nuclear waste disposal problem will no longer be a concern .
Lastly , the public is concerned about the high prices related to the production of nuclear energy .
The energy produced by the VHTR can be kept low due to the substantial amount of nuclear energy being produced compared to other energy sources such as coal , oil and wind .
According to statistics , the cost of producing per kilowatt-hour of nuclear power is only slightly above 2 cents in recent years , the lowest as compared to gas , coal and oil which are the three main energy sources in the world .
The implicit cost of pollution that we have to pay is also essentially zero .
This is because the only emission to the environment is steam , which does not pollute the environment in any manner .
Thus , cost should not be an area of concern for the general public .
It is therefore evident that safety and security issues have been well addressed by the 'new pebble bed core' of VHTR .
The problem on disposal of nuclear waste is also solved by the ability of VHTR to consume existing nuclear waste and producing nuclear waste with shorter half-lives .
Finally , high cost of nuclear energy is not a valid argument as its cost has always been one of the lowest in terms of implicit and explicit cost .
Hence , I conclude that there must be further research and funding for the Generation IV reactors .
Ever since the first robot was created in the 1950s , mankind has been trying to incorporate them into our lives .
From sending them to space in search of new habitats to deploying them deep in sea for research purposes , these new humanoids are being utilized to explore places which were previously inaccessible to humans .
However , it is only in the 1980s when robots were actually being developed to save lives  .
They come in the form of robotic doctors .
With the traditional mindsets the general public has , it is no wonder that the mentioning of robotic surgeons operating on a patient is strongly opposed .
Yet most researchers and experts beg to differ .
They believe that there are more benefits that can be obtained from robotic surgery as compared to conventional surgery , such as the reduction of recovery time .
Having said that , it may be too early to conclude that robotic surgery will replace conventional surgery , but based on current advancements to the system , it is foreseeable in the near future that people will turn to robots for all kinds of abscission .
The most defining issue regarding robots is the safety aspect .
It is not uncommon for people to experience a machine breakdown halfway through an important process , which can be frustrating and may sometimes lead to significant losses .
The breakdown may be a result of a mechanical part failure or a lack of power supply .
In the case of robotic surgery , a breakdown in the middle of the operation can be disastrous .
The sudden discontinuation of the robot may hamper the proceedings of the operation , increasing the chances of infection and possibility of death .
To counter these problems , robotic systems like the Da Vinci System have in place a self-check mechanism that allows proper shutting down of the system in the event of a failure in either the self-check or the power source  .
This allows the surgeon in charge to be able to continue on with the surgery conventionally .
In this way , there would not be a huge time period where the patient is left with an open incision , thereby keeping any possible chances of infection to a minimum .
Another cause of concern has to do with the lack of expertise in this field of technology .
As robotic surgery is still considered new , not many doctors have the required savoir faire to make use of the device optimally and efficiently .
Together with the viewpoint of people considering robotic surgery the cutting edge technology now , hospitals are increasingly likely to obtain one even without a skilled doctor under its wings .
After spending a huge amount acquiring it , hospitals will be pressurized to make full use of it .
This spells danger as operating with inexperienced doctors is more pernicious than operating without the robot .
This is exemplified in a true story where a patient died because of complications after a robot-aided operation by an inexperienced surgeon  .
In order to rectify this problem , hospitals with the robotic systems have designed training packages for doctors and assistants  .
With these preparations , the surgeons can have a better understanding and hands-on experience of the system , making it less likely for mistakes to happen .
Although there may be many doubts on robotic surgery , the benefits of it should not be overlooked .
As robotic surgery is also known as minimally invasive surgery , it does exactly what its name suggests .
The incision required for this operation is much smaller than traditional methods .
This signifies a massive improvement in recovery time and lesser pain endured by patients  .
Also , as machines can be sterilized more effectively than humans , there is a lower chance of them being contaminated by external factors , which means lesser chance of the patient being infected .
Robot for surgery is still in a developing stage .
It is vital that the safety aspects of the system be ameliorated before they can be implemented on a wider scale .
With the constant upgrading of the robots and surgeons , the time is nigh for humans to embrace robots as the new generation of surgeons .
Nowadays , people's hearts are dragged by the price of petroleum .
As the consequence of the decreasing source of oil , people turned to find other powers to replace the petroleum .
Nuclear power became one of their choices , since it is clean and efficient .
Nuclear energy is defined as the energy comes from the nucleus of atoms due to the "nuclear fission , nuclear fusion , or radioactive decay" CITATION The05 \l 2052  .
People change the energy release from bonds between atoms to electricity .
However , some accidents like the reactor core exploded and 31 people die in the 1986 scared many people  .
Nevertheless , the new generation of reactor would make the process more efficient by using higher temperature , and there will be no waste go to the outside world .
I think that Very-high-temperature-reactors  will become the most popular in the future , since there are lots of advantages .
In this essay I will talk about VHTR concept through three aspects: safety , economic problem , and technology requirement to support my stance .
First of all , people who do not support the development of nuclear power are worried about the safety during the nuclear power's processing .
Chernobyl accident gives people a big shock .
However , I think that people should not judge the thing by their own view .
For example , even though the accident rate of train is much higher than that of airplane , many people are still afraid of travelling by air .
There are two major safety problems of building nuclear plants .
First , the radioactivity released from the reactor core will harm public health .
Comparing to the other five generation concept , the waste in VHTR will go directly to repository so that we would not worry about the radiation .
Second , the big accident during the reactor processing will destroy "capital assets" , and people will lose confidence in nuclear power research CITATION The03 \l 2052  .
It seems that VHTR might be very dangerous since it needs high temperature and high pressure .
However , the "inherent safety features of the fuel and reactor" make VHTR become more reliable CITATION SMM03 \l 2052  .
In short , VHTR has good safety control
In conclusion , VHTR has a high-efficiency system that can produce electricity and hydrogen , and it has high rank of safety .
With the effort that the scientists and the engineers put into development of nuclear power , I believe that nuclear power will supplant the fossil-fuel and become a major power in our daily life .
Advocates and committees formed around the world to reduce global warming have been very active in the recent years .
Looking into every single opportunity to decrease the greenhouse gases emitting into the atmosphere , energy sources may be one of the emphatic points to be revised .
Many of the energy producing sources produce inadmissible air pollutants and greenhouse gases which are very baneful to the environment .
Nuclear power is one of the alternate energy sources that are being considered to arbitrate these problems due to its efficiencies and environmental friendly processes .
With the new generation IV reactor concepts , Lead-cooled fast reactor is the paramount choice for producing nuclear power as it surpasses the other reactors in terms of different aspects  .
With further research and development , Lead cooled fast reactors will be the future energy source which make security , cost and performance problems precedent .
Nuclear reactors haven been mistook for a time bomb waiting to be exploded anytime because of the tremendous pressure contained inside .
It is also believed to cause a catastrophic accident that is very disastrous with any slight technical or human error .
Rebutting , it is actually not true as a power plant is too big to convert a part of its U-235 or plutonium into fission fragments and generate enough heat to fly apart .
On the contrary , a bomb is a compact object so the neutrons need not travel far to hit another fissionable atom which made it so powerful .
This is a fact based on the fundamental of physics on how fast fission neutron travels .
Lead-cooled fast reactors are also built with superior materials to resist strong knockings and vibrations to prevent any leakages of radioactive substances into the atmosphere .
Involving large amount of radioactivity had been a strain to convince the public to allow nuclear reactors existence in the past few decades .
Accidents that had happened with casualties and affected people are evidence of the dangers involving nuclear reactors .
However , accidents involving nuclear reactors have been relatively small , compared to cave-ins in coal mines which often kill hundreds .
Nothing is perfectly safe but nuclear energy is definitely safe enough to be relied upon as an energy source .
Furthermore , lead-cooled fast reactor will be much safer compared to the conventional plants with a better and more comprehensive safety features .
It also operates at lower pressure compared to other contenders .
On top of that , according to Donald W .M .
, not only does low to moderate doses of ionizing radiation are not harmful , it stimulates the immune system and check oxidation of DNA through a process known as "radiation hormesis" , preventing cancer too .
The costs of the nuclear power may be astronomical as it involves the construction cost , operating cost and cost of waste disposal from the plant .
Canny people may expect design flaws in the plants and calculated the maintenance to incur more costs in a long run .
Nevertheless , nuclear power now is substantially cheaper and they are expected to be even lower in the near future through further research and development .
It has been substantially proven from the improvement of the 2nd generation to the 3rd generation reactors by reducing the cost to produce per kilowatt of power from USD $1400 to below USD $1000 . 
Other favoured energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines are strongly encouraged by some .
They are claimed to be "safer" energy sources as the probability of being prone to accidents are deemed to be lower .
Altercating , they are much less efficient and less reliable compared to nuclear power produced by Lead-cooled fast reactors .
Having the need of finding the strategic locations and only producing energy only at certain time of the year , they are not preferred in reality .
For instance , comparing to the 19 percent of the toal energy the nuclear reactors in US produced , solar panels and wind turbines contributed only 0 .1 percent .
Recognising the efficiency , India also planned to raise the amount of power it generates from nuclear energy by a hundred times in a 3 stage strategy by 2050 . 
In "Nuclear power not ruled out"  , Singapore's Prime Minister , Mr Lee Hsien Loong said technology may evolve to resolve challenges faced by nuclear power .
From the popularity and possibilities , it is evident that nuclear power is a suitable energy source for the future .
Therefore , further research and development funding is very important to refine the safety , efficiency and costs of the lead-cooled fast reactors .
Engineers deserve more respect due to their outstanding contributions to the design and construction of the world .
However , with great power comes great responsibility .
Engineers do face a tremendous pressure every time when an engineering accident occurs .
As it is reported on Nuclear Science and Engineering  , the primary causes of the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor Plant Explosion are recorded as follows:
1Depletion of project integrity
2Improper management and control
3Lack of communication
4Lack of experience
Obviously , the human factors occupy a large proportion .
In fact , according to a recent study conducted at the Swiss federal Institute of technology in Zurich analyzed 800 cases of structural failure , the human factors still constitute the largest proportion .
Therefore , it is natural for ordinary people who witnessed those tragedies to put all the blame on the engineers and even scold some faulty engineers .
Though engineers have been compelled to be the target of public criticism for a long time , few psychologists really decide to conduct a comprehensive study on human factors to reveal the truth .
Actually , the way of preventing engineering accidents should be innovated by taking psychology into consideration instead of expecting engineers to be perfect .
Normally , the public criticize engineers for their carelessness and strongly suggest raising engineers' level of responsibility .
In my own opinion , it is absolutely right to be responsible and alert when controlling and handling .
However , in many cases , engineers' carelessness results from their overworking .
For example , in Chernobyl's case , on the day when the accident happened , most operators and machinists had been working for as long as 24 hours .
It is conceivable that any mistake could be made at that moment .
Actually , nowadays the rapid-developing technology and resultant economic effect over-focus on the improvement of the equipment and machines , which strictly requires human's adaptation to them .
From psychologists' point of view , the engineers have to take on more pressure which finally causes all sorts of negative impact on them and certainly do nothing effective to their daily work .
Third , the public criticism upon engineers needs to be more objective when referring to the theory of possibility .
Just like what B .Wilpert have illustrated in Psychology and design processes , engineers are human and it is possible for human to make mistakes , in other words , engineers need more understanding from the society in a sense .
In theoretical speaking , everything must eventually fail to perform its given function .
The possibility is there .
That is why accidents are called "accidents" and that is why human are called "human" not "god" .
Very-high Temperature Reactor  is one of the six generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV nuclear reactor systems selected by the Generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV International Forum for further development in 2002  .
The VHTR uses graphite as the core material and helium as coolant of the reactor to generate nuclear heat with core-outlet temperature of 1000 degrees centigrade .
This system can be applied to hydrogen production , petrochemistry , electricity generation and so on  .
Although the VHTR is promising , critics argue that it is not worth further research due to lack of suitable materials , potential safety hazard and high cost of construction .
However , these problems can be solved and the VHTR will benefit the society a lot .
Secondly , skeptics argue that there is potential safety hazard .
It is reasonable that people concern a lot about the safety since the Chernobyl accident and Three Mile Island accident happened .
Nuclear accidents are deadly disasters , causing economic losses as well as huge damage to the environment and people's health .
According to McCarthy  , the VHTR is quite safe due to its special design which is different from reactors of the Chernobyl type .
Having a negative temperature coefficient , the VHTR can automatically slow down the nuclear reaction inside the core when the temperature rises .
This feature ensures that the temperature in a VHTR core can never be high enough to trigger a meltdown .
With this special design , the VHTR can shut down itself once anything abnormal happens .
Therefore , safety can be ensured for the VHTR .
Accidents like the Chernobyl accident will never happen to the VHTR .
In conclusion , obstacles like lack of materials , safety problems and high construction cost all can be overcome .
The VHTR is a safe and profitable nuclear reactor with excellent prospect .
Thus , the VHTR is worth further research .
Hopefully , it will be widely used within a decade .
For decades surgery is operated by human force only , which is limited to the size of surgery tools and causes complicated procedures .
In 1985 , the emergence of a prototype "PUMA 560" pointed out a new way to do surgery , and that is robotic surgery .
It is a newly developed technology to help enhance the quality of surgery .
Today's robotic surgery machines are usually equipped with 3D camera recording body image more clearly , and enable more precise operation .
However , controversies over robotic surgery also arise concerning the safety , high cost and performance .
The concerns are reasonable but there is evidence to show robotic surgery is worth trusting and developing .
The future of robotic surgery is prospecting .
Continuous advances in technology on one had will bring down the possibility of error occurring , on the other hand allow the machine to shut down safely if any emergency happens .
In Canada , with vast land and remote rural countries , government has been investing in remote robotic surgery to improve its healthcare level  .
This is also a new orientation for robotic surgery development .
In summary , the opposing viewpoints are not valid .
On the contrary , many people have really benefited from robotic surgery .
It does not mean that robotic surgery will one day fully replace the conventional human surgery but it provides an alternative and attractive way of doing surgery .
The combination of the two will also make modern surgery up to a new level .
According to surgeons , patients' feedback on robotic surgery has been very positive  .
Therefore , in my opinion , robotic surgery is worth developing and trusting .
On March 28 , 1979 , a partial meltdown happened at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant .
The safe disposal of nuclear waste cost $1 billion and takes more than 10 years to complete .
Since several other nuclear accidents happened and the threat of nuclear weapons grew , the nuclear industry has come to a standstill mostly due to the public opposition for three decades .
However , the upcoming Generation IV reactors have revived enthusiasm for nuclear power recently .
There are obvious problems for nuclear: accidents , nuclear waste , high expenditure of research and building , and the threat of nuclear weapons , but Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactors  raise people's hopes for the new process of the nuclear industry and the public should be justified in extension activities for the research into Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactors  because of its efficiency , cleanness and developed technology . 
Opponents of nuclear power claim that the funding for designing and operating a nuclear plant is huge and yet it is undeniably a fact , but they lose the sight of the crucial point of the highly efficient electricity generating system in a nuclear plant .
For example , according to WASHINGTON , over the first 14 days of August in 2007 , the average daily capacity factor of the nuclear power industry , 104 nuclear power plants in the U .S was 98 .3 percent .
More important , compared with 33% efficiency for current Light water reactors , the high thermal efficiency  and considerable plant simplification makes SCWRs as promising advanced nuclear systems .
Cheaper and more efficient , the features of SCWRs are superior to others of Generation IV .
Another significant opposition to nuclear power is the potential nuclear leakage issue .
People have been confused with fears of reactor accidents , while the probabilities of reactor accidents have been determined and they are very small indeed .
Loss of life expectancy  due to various risks in U .S . shows that compared with cancer 980 LLE  and heart disease with 2300 LLE  , nuclear is much safer and ranks the last with 0 .04 LLE  .
A generally acknowledged fact of clean energy is another important advantage for nuclear energy .
No carbon dioxide emission and no contribution to acid rain or global warming , makes nuclear energy fully deserve energetic support .
The last argument raised by opponents is about the prepotency of other sources , such as solar and wind .
Since wind and sunlight is free with zero-waste , it seems better to focus on the development of these green sources .
Nevertheless we cannot neglect the current technology of wind or solar power is not available to meet our needs for abundant energy .
Moreover , the facilities of wind and solar power are so expensive that they are even less competitive than coal and gas .
These renewable energies like solar heavily depend on the activity of the weather .
As for nuclear power , there will be power once uranium is supplied , which makes the anxiousness about interruptions to the electricity generation pale into insignificance .
Furthermore , SCWRs is the only one of Generation IV whose coolant will be water , which means that it will be more practical than others owing to the wide distribution of water .
In brief , the energy generation of SCWRs is the most operative mode .
Contrary to the opposition to nuclear power which is not convincing , nuclear power has advantages in many areas .
The form of the energy generation is the most efficient .
Nuclear power is also friendly to the environment .
Independence with the weather and more proven technique , the promising Generation IV reactor , SCWRs enable nuclear power as the most promising energy source .
Nuclear power generation emits relatively low amount of carbon dioxide and its contribution to global warming is therefore relatively less .
Moreover , the technology is readily available  and new theories and technologies are being researched and developed .
Thus , nuclear power generation is definitely one of the solutions to the energy challenge that we mankind are facing now .
According to European Nuclear Society  , at the end of September , 2009 there are 436 nuclear reactors in operation in 31 countries all over the world to provide a net output of 370 ,221 MW , supplying an important part of the world's total energy consumption .
The U .S . alone relies 20 percent of its energy on nuclear power .By now we have come up with 6 concepts for the Generation-IV reactors , which mean to produce more reliable energy at lower cost and risk .
Among the 6 concepts , the Very-high-temperature reactor  is more secure , reliable and efficient and should receive more funding .
Many people doubt the safety of nuclear plants and thus oppose the construction of new nuclear plants .
However , the VHTR has resolved many of the safety concerns and proved to be much safer .The VHTR can be a pebble-bed reactor like HTR-10 in China .
The fuel is in the form of small pebbles with uranium dioxide  inside and a graphite coat .
Each pebble can perform as a "mini" reactor independently .
"The pebble-bed reactor has high safety and reliability grades due to the inherent safety features of the fuel and reactor .
It also gets good ratings for proliferation resistance and physical protection " .
Furthermore , it has been proved that with all the supporting machinery failing , the reactor will not crack , melt or explode .
"It simply goes up to a designed "idle" temperature and stays there .
In that state , the reactor vessel radiates heat , but the vessel and fuel spheres remain intact and undamaged" .
.
"Even after decommissioning , the VHTR can still discharge surplus heat and do not need additional safety systems like other types of reactors do" .
"The HTR-10 was subject to a test of its intrinsic safety in September 2004 when it was shut down with no cooling .
Fuel temperature reached less than 1600  C but there was still no failure"  .
Efficiency is another problem that challenges many nuclear reactors .
But this is no problem because of the nature of the VHTR .Running at very high temperatures of about 700-900 C , the VHTR can supple energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen , providing hydrogen for the nation's industry .
According to Hylko  , the VHTR has relatively higher efficiency for heat transfer and hydrogen production .
"It can squeeze 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel"  .
Moreover , bearing the property of running at such high temperatures , the VHTR can also realise "deep-burn" , during which up to 65% of the initial fuel is burnt .
This shows great advantage over the conventional reactors who possess burn-up levels of around 5% .
"Moreover , instead of 95% of the uranium going into nuclear waste , this kind of reactor would only turn 35% of it into waste"  , which will help with the growing storage problem of hazardous radioactive wastes .
It is understandable that many people doubt if there is anyone willing to inject money into this new reactor since is costs great amounts of money and time .
However , as is mentioned , the VHTR adopts the design of pebble-bed , making it possible to realize the concept of "modular reactors" .
Modular reactors are reactors that can be deployed part by part and each part can work independently .
Therefore , the initial invest to build the reactor can be controlled at an acceptable level , so is the construction period .
All these will make the VHTR more competitive in the fierce competition of today's energy market  .
To sum up , the VHTR is highly safe and reliable .
It can perform high efficiency with an acceptable initial invest and construction period .
As a result , the VHTR is more favourable among the 6 Generation-IV concepts and further research and development funding should go for it .
Although the public is very concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors , the technological breakthrough and theory innovation shows that Very-High-Temperature Reactor  will be built in the future .
Remember that in 1979 , the partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania; in 1986 , the tragedy occurred at Chernobyl , Ukraine , in this case , the core of the reactor exploded , 31 people were killed on the spot and radioactive debris were spouted and spread over Europe  , opponents of nuclear reactors being built claim that it is very dangerous for nuclear reactors' operation .
According to Philippe B & Dominique B  , some specific studies have been launched in CEA in order to make sure that the operation of VHTR is safe .
These studies including dynamic behavior when working normally as well as accident happened the moment when machines and certain components are functioning .
Through these engineers can predict the impact of a possible defeated in current and faraway situation; study about the Leak Before Break  technology; making model for Vessel Cooling System ; analyses of the moment when accident happened; safety aspects of the way how to combine the reactor to the hydrogen production plant .
Hopefully , through the realization of these studies , the dangerous of nuclear reactors' operation will be reduced .
Opponents may insist that it is very expensive to build and operate nuclear reactors .
However , the new generation of nuclear reactor , VHTR , has improved the efficiency , which means reduce the cost of operation .
The study  shows that using the Gas Plant Analyzer and System Simulator/Hydrogencode , the requests of the hear at the interface between a High Temperature Steam Electrolysis  plant combined to the Very High Temperature Reactor  have been investigated .
Thus , through the input deck , interconnections among components are supplied to the code .
Through this cycling process , the advanced design VHTR could produce 50% more electricity than conventional plants  .
Moreover , compare to the price rising continuously fossil fuel , it is reasonable to using nuclear energy .
So we can say that it is economically feasible for VHTR's operation .
Opponents may also say that such nuclear reactor's performance is doubtful .
Nevertheless , according to Idaho National Laboratory's study  , the VHTR system should be high-efficiency .
During different processes , the heat can be used circulatory .
As to make the system performs better , electricity generating equipment may be added in .
The system can also adopt cycles for uranium/plutonium and minimize the waste .
Therefore , the VHTR provides a number of processes to use the heat and produce electricity in high-efficiency .
Simultaneously it retains the safety properties provided by high-temperature gas-cooled reactors .
In short , the performance of VHTR is excellent through using so many advanced technologies .
Besides , considering the energy crisis we are facing nowadays , using nuclear energy is really a useful as well as practical method to handle the energy crisis .
Furthermore , compare to other energy resources like gasoline and nature gas , which produce greenhouse gases , nuclear energy is much more environmental friendly .
Last but not least , the theories and technologies of Very-High-Temperature Reactor are quite mature already; it is feasible to make it come true .
So we should have faith that VHTR will be built in the future .
Chernobyl accident happened on April 26 , 1986 .
It is known as the most famous nuclear power accident .
The accident causes total 56 fatalities as of 2004 , and some seven million Chernobyl victims suffering from the impact of Chernobyl accident  .
Profession Wilpert from Technical University of Berlin proposes that using psychology in the design process could prevent disasters like Chernobyl accident , while some people argue that psychology will not be useful in preventing accidents .
This essay proposes that the use of psychology in the design process is helpful to prevent the Chernobyl accident .
In The Engineering Design Process , Ertas and Jones  notes that engineering design is the process of devising a component , system or process to meet desired needs , and it is a decision making process .
Design is a human activity , and human may make mistakes .
Therefore , designers may make mistakes in the design process .
Psychology is the scientific investigation of humans' mental process and behavior .
Using psychology to analyze how the designers think can point out the flaws in their thinking process .
In this way , psychology could help designers to minimize their mistakes in the design process  .
Thus , possible accidents may be prevented .
In The Truth about Chernobyl , the author , Medvedev  , notes that one of the reasons which cause Chernobyl accident is the inadequate operators with insufficient knowledge operated the reactor inappropriately .
It is true that the operation not happened in the design process .
However , the use of psychology in the design process could prevent inappropriate operations from happening .
In the design process , designers should consider the user of devices , components or systems under development , which includes people who maintain and repair the product as well as who operate it  .
However , the high technical knowledge of the designers may make them overestimate competence of the users .
Therefore , they give insufficient instructions to the users to equip them with equivalent competence  .
Obviously , in the case of Chernobyl accident , the operator did not have a well-designed instruction manual and was not adequately trained .
If psychology was used in the design process , it would point out this flaw and advise designers to provide an adequate instruction manual including the operations in emergencies so that operators would know how to operate the reactor when facing emergencies .
In this way , Chernobyl accident may be prevented .
Medvedev  mentions in his book that the RBMK reactor in Chernobyl had a dangerously large positive void coefficient and a defect in the design of the reactor protection and control system .
The designers was aware of the defects of the reactors , however , they did not make efforts to correct them .
Some people argue that these defects caused the Chernobyl accident , psychology cannot solve them .
Technically , psychology could not solve the technical problem for engineers .
But , psychology could point out the potential danger and consequence of the problem so that engineers would search for better options .
If the designers know the severe consequence of the accident , they would try their best to prevent it .
Psychologists could also indicate the flaws in the design process and advise designers to lower the positive void coefficient and enhance the protection and control system in this case .
Thus , the disaster may be prevented .
In conclusion , Chernobyl is a result of flawed design of reactor and inappropriate operation by inadequate operators .
However , the use o f psychology in the design process would be helpful to prevent the Chernobyl disaster .
The errors in the design process and the operation process may be prevented with the help of psychology .
Nowadays , developed countries and developing countries have invested huge fund to develop nuclear power as nuclear energy is deemed to be potential energy source for the future  .
However , the large amount of R&D funding needed for Generation IV nuclear reactors has made the development of nuclear power a controversial issue .
From a long term perspective , there should be R&D funding for the development of Generation IV reactors since Generation IV reactors are safer , cheaper and cleaner .
First of all , nuclear power is a sustainable energy source in the long term when developed properly .
Generation IV reactors are much cleaner than previous generations .
It will help reduce carbon dioxide and subsequently reduce the effect of global warming  .
Jacques and Ralph claimed in Generation IV Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems: "According to Princeton University's Carbon Mitigation Initiative , increasing the number of nuclear power plants to 1000 worldwide-more than double what it is today could avoid one billion tons of carbon emissions per year by 2055 ."
The statistics has shown that the success of development of Generation IV reactors will bring a great improvement of living environment for human beings in the future .
In the long term , fund should be given to support the development of Generation IV reactors at current stage .
Some may argue that until now , the scientists and researchers are still researching new materials to reduce radioactive leak and wastage  .
The success seems to be too far for the public to feel .
However , this is the reason why more funds must be given to support further research for Generation IV reactors .
Scientists and researchers should be given financial support to overcome difficulties they face during researches rather than give up half way .
Therefore , the development of Generation IV reactors deserves R&D funding .
Secondly , from the economic perspective , Generation IV nuclear energy systems have lower cost than other energy sources .
Nuclei , as the source of nuclear reactants , are small and abundant in nature .
Thus once developed properly , the cost of nuclear power will be very low .
Thus , member countries of Generation IV International Forum actively invest in Generation IV reactors , hoping to get cheap energy and meanwhile , to remain energy independent  .
Thirdly , Generation IV nuclear energy systems operations will make further improvement in safety and reliability  .
Safety issue is one of the most priorities by Generation IV International Forum  .
The revolution in fuel utilization in Generation IV reactors will reduce the radio toxicity by a large extent  .
The public may not trust the ability of scientists and researchers to ensure their safety since they still remember the nuclear power accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and at Chernobyl in Ukraine which caused many people to die  .
However , Generation IV reactors are designed to be safer than the previous generations .
Safety issue will be handled with extreme care by all GIF member counties .
Researchers from different countries are doing collaborative research to achieve this common goal  .
Thus , the public should look forward to Generation IV reactors' performance rather than oppose it .
To sum up , the nuclear reactor is a necessary evil .
I feel that the Supercritical water reactor should be further researched and developed and help the whole world in the near future .
People have always concerned about the development of nuclear energy .
Today , 104 reactors produce about 20 percent of the United States 'electricity  .
However , it is still a big question whether Generation IV Reactor projects should be funded .
In this case , I'm confident that Generation IV reactors in general and the VHTR concept in particular deserve to be funded around the world .
For a very long time , many people have been worried about the safety of nuclear energy .
Accidents such as Chernobyl have destroyed the Chernobyl-4 reactor and killed 30 people , including 28 from radiation exposure .
However , if we look on the whole , there has not been a serious accident in the nearly 30 years since the Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania experienced a partial core meltdown .
VHTR is the safest concept among other nuclear reactors , due to low decay heat and non-combustible nuclear-grade graphite , which is virtually impossible to be burnt .
Therefore , the use of VHTR is safe and we can believe in the further development of such GenIV nuclear reactor concept .
Secondly , global warming is what we concerned about .
It demands a profound transformation in the ways we generate and consume energy .
Our current sources of power like coal and gas are producing Carbon Dioxide , which make the global warming problem worse .
In addition , these sources of power are being used up and we should find the alternative sources of power .
Scientific research concludes that the world must reduce global warming emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 to avoid the most dangerous effects of global warming  .
Nuclear power could play a huge role in reducing global warming emissions because nuclear reactors emit almost no carbon while they operate and have low life-cycle emissions .
New generation of reactors such as VHTR will produce relatively cheap electricity while solving the threat posed by global climate change .
U .S power producers have proposed building more than 30 new nuclear reactors and some proponents have called for building as many as 300 plants by mid- century  .
Therefore , using GenIV nuclear reactors is a very efficient way to reduce the effects of global warming .
The third concern is whether nuclear power concepts such as VHTR can be widely applied to the whole world .
There are some barriers that may prevent nuclear energy from developing: it is expensive to build a plant , there may be human errors and it still produces radio-active wastes .
However , there are lots of positive features that we can count on such concept .
VHTR produces a high-efficiency electricity production with a broad range of process heat applications , while retaining the safety characteristics in both normal and off-normal events .
VHTR is performed under very high temperature  , therefore allowing for more efficient conversion of heat to electricity .
A single power plant can produce a large amount of energy compared to the amount produced by wind so in total , the nuclear energy is a cheap kind of energy .
After all , the energy power concept like VHTR helps prevent the effects of global warming .
It is safe and efficient , so therefore can produce a lot of energy and be able to replace traditional sources of energy .
It is clear governments should fund the VHTR nuclear projects to develop it further , and nuclear energy will definitely be the energy of the future .
Some people think that nuclear reactors are not safe .
Nuclear radiation can cause mutation in human cells , cancer , and other diseases .
Nuclear reactors are also expensive to build and maintain .
Hence , only a few countries have built nuclear reactor to produce electricity .
But now , scientists have developed six new type of nuclear reactor called Nuclear Reactor Generation IV which are said to be safer than previous generations .
One of these reactors is the gas-cooled fast reactor  which has more benefits in terms of cost , safety , and performance than the other five reactor concepts , particularly the very-high temperature reactor  .
Another group of people say that the performance of this reactor is still under VHTR .
Different from VHTR which can work on 1000 degrees Celsius , GFR can work only on 850 degrees Celsius .
They say it makes the energy GFR produces less than VHTR .
In reality , there is no need for reactors to work on 1000 degree Celsius , because the chain reaction of the fuel  can be done perfectly only within 850 degrees  .
This means that the amount of energy GFR and VHTR produce is almost the same , although there is 150 degrees difference in their temperature .
This proves that GFR works more efficiently than others such as VHTR .
One more important information that there is no need for GFR to be manually moderated because GFR has already used Thorium which can absorb fast neutrons and decay into Uranium-233  .
This makes GFR is cheaper to maintain and safer than VHTR which is needed to be checked every time in order to make it operate safely .

Nuclear Power's New Dawn , Nature  ,  .
"Gas-cooled Fast Reactor" ,  .
Nuclear power can be defined as any nuclear technology that is designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions .
In 1951 , the world's first experimental nuclear reactor station that produced usable amount of electricity from nuclear energy , Experimental Breeder Reactor I  , was built  .
Since then , Nuclear power was often seen as the best alternative energy source as it has no carbon emission and can theoretically produce unlimited amounts of energy since nuclear fuel is inexpensive and abundant on earth .
Currently , 15% of the world's electricity supply comes from nuclear power reactors  .
With the advancement in nuclear technology , the upcoming generation IV reactors , such as the Sodium-cooled fast reactors , will be even safer and more efficient , making nuclear power the best option in providing mankind with enough electricity for now and the future .
However , after major nuclear incidents such as the Chernobyl disaster , the general public have became skeptical about the safety of nuclear power .
Furthermore , nuclear power is often associated with terms like radiations , weapons of mass destruction , high maintenance cost , and targets for terrorism .
This stigma against nuclear power has led to people such as the general public and environmentalists to favor other alternative energies namely wind energy and solar energy , as they are deemed as better choices .
As such , even though mankind are in need of much more energy , the rate of further development and research on the generation IV nuclear reactor , such as the Sodium-cooled fast reactor , still depends heavily on factors such as cost efficiency , safety issues , and environmental friendliness .
The cost efficiency of a power plant is one of the major considerations in deciding whether a power plant should be built .
It is a common fact that nuclear reactors have high set up and maintenance cost .
The decommissioning cost of a nuclear reactor can sometimes be higher .
For example , the Chernobyl reactor requires lots of maintenance even though it is unable to produce any electricity as there are still lots of nuclear fuel left in the reactors .
Lots of money is also required for the clean up process during the decommissioning of a nuclear reactor  .
Many people would thus argue that this money would be better spent on other alternative energy sources such as wind farms and solar panels as these power plants would incur less economical cost .
However , many of these arguments are based on the short run expenditure that one would face when building a nuclear power plant .
In the long run , after considering the higher capital cost , financing costs and operating costs of a nuclear reactor , a nuclear reactor would still produce much cheaper electricity when compared with other alternative energy source such as wind energy .
This is because a typical nuclear power plant would produce around 3 to 10 billion kWh per year  .
This amount of electricity produced is more than the total quantity of electricity produced by a collective of few thousands of wind turbines , since a typical wind turbine produces 0 .5 to 3 million kWh per year  .
Furthermore , with the new generation IV nuclear power plants , more energy will be produced , increasing the cost efficiency of nuclear power .
In addition , nuclear power plants do not require specific areas for construction , unlike other alternative energies such as wind farms , which will require areas that have sufficient wind speeds , or hydroelectric plants , which will require a large river for the dam .
Having little restrictions on the construction site , the cost of building a nuclear plant is lowered , making it more competitive economically .
It is thus inevitable that nuclear power is much more cost efficient as we look towards the future .
Besides the cost of electricity , it is important for us to excogitate the safety issues regarding the nuclear power plant .
After the Chernobyl accident , one would commonly assume that nuclear reactors are extremely hazardous .
This is because the Chernobyl accident caused many direct fatalities in the explosion and future fatalities due to the effects of nuclear radiations .
The nuclear radiation caused genetic defects , leading to cancer , leukaemia and other body defects for current and future generations  .
Besides reactor accidents , nuclear reactors may also be easy targets for terrorism as many nuclear reactors appear to be vulnerable to any forms of terrorist attacks .
In addition , nuclear wastes are dangerous as well as they contains high levels of radiation and can be used for weapons of mass destruction as tons of plutonium nuclear waste are produced by nuclear reactors each year and are often recycled to make nuclear weapons .
Furthermore , lots of secrets about nuclear power plants are often kept away from the public due to economic interest of government bodies and private companies , leading to people choosing other alternative energy as they are seemingly much safer .
On the other hand , since the Chernobyl accident that happened 23 years ago , there has not been any other major nuclear power plants accident .
In fact , the numbers of deaths caused by nuclear power plants accidents are much less compared to coal , hydro or natural gas power plants each year  .
Moreover , Generation IV nuclear reactions , such as the sodium-cooled fast reactors , excels in many safety aspects such as having the ability to withstand up to a magnitude of 8 .2 on the Richter scale and to shut down safely if any accidents were to happen  .
These new reactors are also more reliable and resistant against proliferation , and are able to use its fuel more efficiently , thus producing less plutonium waste  .
With the technological advancement in nuclear power in mind , nuclear accidents and disasters would be a thing in the past as nuclear power plants will become safer in its operations .
In conclusion , more research and development of Generation IV nuclear power plant should be done as the many benefits of nuclear power have clearly outweigh the disadvantages in many important factors such as cost efficiency , safety issues and environmental friendliness .
The Generation IV sodium-cooled fast reactor will most likely be able to provide mankind with abundant and affordable clean and green energy with minimum risks , and thus removing the stigma on nuclear power .
Generation IV nuclear reactor will allow mankind to fully realize the potential of nuclear power , thus encourage further development on nuclear technology .
With the sharp increase demand for fuel by emerging economies in the world , it was predicted by some analysts that the world will reach peak oil , the point where half of the world's supply of oil is left , by 2012-2016  .
As a result of fewer fossil fuel supplies left to be extracted , oil companies will either search for smaller oil fields that will inevitably increase the cost of production of oil or look for unconventional sources of oil such as tar sands that will increase the level of carbon dioxide emission and pollution  .The increasing demand for oil and the raising level of carbon dioxide emission , which contributes to global warming , has prompted the energy market to search for alternatives energy sources .
Nuclear power seems to be one of the promising solutions to the above problems .
The use of nuclear power also faces opposition from the public .
The public is very concern about the safety of nuclear power plants , the storage of radioactive waste and the cost they have to pay for nuclear power .
In contrast to the public opinion on the adverse effect on building a nuclear power plant , the latest generation IV reactor , Very-High-temperature reactor  , is designed to overcome these problems faced by the public .
The public is very concern about the safety of nuclear power plants and fears that any factors that trigger the explosion of a nuclear reactor will have devastating impact on the people living in the region .
Ever since the partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 and the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 , the public feared that any similar incidents will have grave consequences to the people living around the nuclear power plant .
Pertaining to these concerns , the 'Defense-in-Depth' approach adopted by VHTR consists of prevention and control of abnormal operation and failures , detection of failures , protection against accident progression and mitigation of the effects of severe accidents and substantial amount of released radioactive materials .
Through the implementation of 'Defense-in-Depth' approach , not just safety barriers are protected , but also predicted types of accidents are prevented and mitigated  .
In addition , the production of hydrogen during the process does pose hazards to the nuclear plant .
This is because the explosion of hydrogen could damage the nuclear reactor .
Consequently , safety measures such as implementing a maximum of 100kg storage of hydrogen near the nuclear reactor and transporting hydrogen gas in double-walled pipes away from the reactor to storage plant at a safe distance  .
All these measures are implemented to meet the safety expectation of the operation of nuclear power plant .
Furthermore after 9/11 , nuclear power plants have become the target of terrorists .
Any successful terror attacks on these nuclear plants will have disastrous health and psychological impact on the surviving victims .
Regarding the threat of terrorism on nuclear power plants , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  has stepped up measures to tighten security around nuclear power plants .
These measures comprise regular 'force-on-force' exercises to test the plant's ability to react to attacks made on the plant , vehicles inspection at greater safety distance away from the plant , improve communication among different government organizations and stricter control to access of restricted sites  .
Other measures includes bullet-proof barriers in important areas , intruding detecting devices , detection zones that are illuminated , well equipped and trained security personals on duty daily and protection against intrusion of network by outsiders  , July 2009) .
The purpose of these stepped up security measures are to deter any potential terrorist attacks on the nuclear power plants and to have contingency plan in the event of any attacks .
Another reason that the public and environmentalist oppose to the building of nuclear power plants is that the radioactive waste produced by nuclear power plants will remain radioactive for hundred over years .
When the radioactive waste is not properly stored in location that are of safe distance away from people , the people may be exposed to harmful radiation resulting in serious health effects .
Without proper storage facilities , there are chances of leakage of radiation that will pollute the land and damage the ecosystem .
The public does not need to worry about the large amount of radioactive waste produced by the VHTR because the VTHR spent fuel is contained in repository that is very resistant to leaching of radioactive materials .
Also the recycling of used fuel also minimizes the production of radioactive waste .
Thus , the process in VHTR produced only electricity and hydrogen and radioactive waste is not disposed and buried underground  .
The public is worried that nuclear power tend to have higher operating and maintenance costs which will result in them paying a higher price than that of coal and gas power plant .
Such worry is unfounded .
According to World Nuclear Association , the price of nuclear power is actually competitive with other types of power plants .
For instance in 2007 , the cost of electricity generated by nuclear plant is about 2 .87cents per kilo-watt hour in comparison with 17 .8cents per kilo-watt hour in the case of oil power plant in the United States .
The cost of nuclear fuel is as low as 0 .5 cents per kilo-watt hour which is one quarter of that of gas power plant .
As compared to conventional nuclear power plant , there is greater efficiency in generating electricity because VHTR can produce fifty percent more electricity output using the same amount of fuel  .
The process heat can be provided by VHTR to support other industrial activities such as refining , manufacturing of fertilizers and plastics .
Therefore , the high operation cost of VTHR can be offset by extra revenue earn from these services  .
Moreover , VTHR does not require the disposal of radioactive waste and the cost required for radioactive waste disposal can be minimized .
As the future of oil prices continue to rise due to the scarcity of supply and increase in demand by emerging economies , this will inevitably led to a more competitive price of nuclear power .
Indeed , there are many concerns from the public regarding the safety of nuclear power plants , the disposal of radioactive waste and the cost of electricity consumers will have to pay .
However with the designing of generation IV reactors such as VHTR , the problems of radioactive waste disposal and the high cost of electricity generated by nuclear power plant will be solved .
Moreover , there are many safety measures implemented to minimized potential dangers of operating VHTR .
The prospect of nuclear power will remain optimistic and in the future more countries may consider substituting gas and coal power plants for nuclear power plants to generate electricity .
Nuclear energy is produced by splitting the nuclei of uranium atoms which in turn produce large amount of energy that is used to drive turbines which produce electricity .
This procedure is extremely efficient so much so that one pound of uranium produces 20 ,000 times more energy compared to a one pound coal .
However , according World energy council there are only 442 nuclear reactors to date and currently they provide only 11% to 18%  of the world electricity requirements .
This is mainly due to the fear and anticipation of possible accidents in nuclear power plants .
After the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and three miles accident in 1979  many people fear the word "nuclear energy" , but if we consider the number of accidents since the commencement of operations of the world's first nuclear power plant in the year 1954 , it's only a handful .
Also , the technology used in production of nuclear energy has significantly improved in past few decades and safety factors are analyzed thoroughly when a nuclear plant is designed following the three miles island and Chernobyl accidents .
We should also not forget that accidents do happen in other energy related industries for example statistics show that there is one accident taking place in a coal mines somewhere around the world every week  .
In contrast to other such accidents difference is that accidents related to nuclear accidents are given more media coverage sparking public disapproval .
In addition to safety many people are concerned with managing nuclear waste and avoiding probable proliferation of nuclear waste .
Nuclear waste is highly radioactive .
However , it can be reprocessed to a substance known as plutonium .
Although plutonium is about 96%  less harmful , many countries including United States do not carry out nuclear waste decomposition to avoid Plutonium proliferation .
Since plutonium is a key raw material for production of advanced nuclear weapons , these nuclear power plants could in turn be probable terrorist targets .
In conclusion all earlier mentioned objectives cannot be achieved without necessary funding .
In an era , where global warming is a burning issue , when the effects of extreme climate change are already evident , nuclear energy may be the ultimate solution to greener energy alternative , thus it is indeed time for us to move forward challenge our fears and support funding for research based on nuclear reactors .
Firstly , Molten-Salt-Reactors  are used to produce electricity .
In addition , MSR uses liquid fuel as compared to the other reactors that use solid fuel .
MSRs are high temperature reactors , depending on the choice of salt , it could range from 320 to 500 degrees Celsius .
As the temperature rises , the heat transfer properties of the reactor rapidly improve .
In addition , the close helium or nitrogen Brayton power cycles were adopted thus allowing the high temperature generated by the MSR to be efficiently used .
As a result , there is an improvement of 15 percent in electrical power output without increasing the temperature of the fuel salt .
Secondly , with nuclear power being a dangerous source when explosions happen , safety has always been a concern throughout the world .
The MSR handles the situation by having excellent safety measures to handle emergencies .
When the situation calls for , there is a drainage system to cool the critical safe dump tanks using the liquid fuel .
On top of that , the system can be initiated upon overheating of the coolant with the use of freeze valves and other techniques .
Workers are protected as well , thanks to the intelligent fuel system .
The refueling can be done online , therefore minimizing the danger of the workers .
However , if nuclear plants are to replace conventional thermal stations and be the world's source of power , there are much more to be taken into consideration .
Firstly , despite the safety of Generation IV nuclear reactor , MSR , one can never forget the devastating Chernobyl incident in April 1986 .
According to World-Nuclear  , the explosion happened during a test on how long the turbines would spin and supply power with the main power supply cut off .
Approximately 200 ,000 people were involved in the clean up from the accident and these people were exposed to the high radiation .
More people were then evacuated from their homes as the radiation spreads widely and rapidly .
The effects of a nuclear plant accident are devastating .
Currently there are people around the world that are still suffering from the after effects of the accident , living in pain where some develop cancer from the exposure to radiation .
Even with the new safety pre-cautions which promise excellent safety measures and technology , no one can guarantee that such accidents would not cause more people to suffer .
For example , the Titanic , she was the largest ship built then , and was equipped with the most advanced technology and safety measures then .
However a collision with an iceberg during her virgin voyage sends the enormous ship deep down onto the sea bed .
Secondly , nuclear plants are said to be environmentally friendly , due to the fact that they do not produce Carbon Dioxide .
As a result it reduces greenhouse effect .
On the other hand , the wastes produced by the nuclear plants are highly radioactive and cannot be easily disposed .
These wastes have to be transported to a storage pond filled with boric acid to absorb the radiation , or to a disposal site , for example the Yucca Mountains , where the wastes are buried underground .
During transportation , there might be leakage from the containers , and the effects of burying the waste underground is yet to be confirmed till years to come .
In addition , these wastes disposal process might become an open target to terrorists who are constantly keen on destruction .
In conclusion , Generation IV MSR does provide the energy hungry cities with the amount of electricity needed and it reduces greenhouse effect due to the zero carbon dioxide emission , and lastly it is much safer than the previous Generation plants with the enhanced meltdown technology .
On the other hand , the danger of nuclear radiation , fear of terrorism and the high initial and running cost of a Generation IV nuclear plant , makes us consider if there are any other alternatives .
Nuclear power is not a new concept to the world .
Human beings have been using it for decades to generate electricity and currently 17% of the world's electricity is from this form of energy .
However , unlike the widely used coal and oil , the development of nuclear power is strictly restricted .
This is due to nuclear power's close relation with nuclear weapon and the public's concerns on the safety of nuclear reactors .
Frankly speaking , nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons share a same basic theoretic foundation-the chain reaction of uranium .
What nuclear reactors do is to slow down the chain reaction to a controllable level and convert nuclear power to electricity .
Since nuclear power does not generate carbon dioxide , it was once regarded as the best replacement of fossil fuels .
But after the terrible partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl , the nuclear power gradually goes out of the public's sight .
The serious global warming and the booming energy demand give nuclear power a chance back to the stage .
The new generation reactors , namely generation IV reactors , have tremendous innovations in improving reactors' efficiency and safety .
Among different kinds of new designs of generation IV reactors , the Very-High-Temperature Reactors are the most promising ones .
Although VHTR still has a few technical problems to be solved , its inspiring advantages have indicated the revival of the nuclear power .
The design of VHTR has an abundance of advantages .
First of all , VHTR is designed to operate at 1000 which results in the more efficient conversion of heat to electricity .
From the same amount of uranium fuels , VHTR can squeeze 50% more electricity than conventional plants .
The same reason of high operating temperature gives birth to VHTR's second advantage which is the produce of hydrogen .
At temperatures of about 700-900 , hydrogen can be split from water thermochemically .
This by-product of nuclear power is also a kind of clean energy in place of oil the third advantage VHTR has is the practical experience .
A similar test reactor of VHTR has already been operated in Japan and proven to be a success since it reached its operating goal of 950 .
Last but not least , VHTR does not have the problem of reprocessing of plutonium waste .
Many politicians are afraid that the reprocessing of plutonium waste , which is used in other generation IV reactors , may cause plutonium wars since plutonium is a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons .
VHTR will not cause such concern .
In spite of so many advantages VHTR has got , it still faces some technical challenges .
One of most essential ones is the high cost of a reactor , which will deeply affect the development of the whole nuclear industry .
Based on a report from U .S . Department of Energy , even a prototype , which is just a sample run of the practical reactor , will require $1 .25 billion to build .
Meanwhile , the price of uranium is fast increasing , a 30% increase in a single year from 2007's $50 per pound to 2008's $65 per pound .
These two factors result in a high cost of nuclear-generated electricity which disables nuclear power from competing with other clean energy technologies like solar energy and wind energy .
A second major challenge is to find suitable building materials .
Since VHTR is operated at a very high temperature and pressure condition , the materials must be able to resist continued high temperature , pressure , corrosive reagents and intense bombardment by neutrons .
Scientists still cannot give a proper solution to this problem .
The last challenge is what the public concerns most-the safety issues .
The high temperature and pressure , which gives birth to the advantage of producing hydrogen , on the other hand , means a high risk of accident .
Also VHTR has no waste recycling systems so that radioactive waste goes nowhere but directly to repository .
This potential danger of waste leak will affect generations .
However , challenges are just challenges , not impossibilities .
With the efforts of countless scientists and engineers , these challenges are expected to be solved in a few years .
In terms of high cost of a reactor , significant cost deduction can be achieved by design improvement , standardisation , better construction methods , reduced construction time and improving project management in building a reactor .
Meanwhile the high efficiency of fuel utilization in VHTR makes reactors use less fuels which in turn lower the cost of fuels .
For finding suitable materials , although the perfect solution has not been found yet , engineers do have some suggested materials that have promising potential to develop , such as silicon carbide , specific grades of graphite and high chromium steels .
Lastly , the design of VHTR enhances safety features and excludes sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators so as to minimise the human intervention .
In addition , VHTR's ability of burning up 65% of uranium fuel will vastly reduce the amount of nuclear waste to a tolerable level .
To sum up , VHTR has many advantages that other generation IV reactors do not have .
It can do very well in converting nuclear power to electricity efficiently .
And it is relatively easier to build and it will not cause political concern on reprocessing of plutonium waste .
Also it produces useful hydrogen as a by-product .
After solving challenges in reactor cost , building materials and safety issues , VHTR will become a best choice for cheaper , cleaner and safer energy .
This promising design reveals the revival of nuclear power .
Rising sea level , increasing in natural disasters , proliferating pandemic , which are the by-products of the industry development , along with the depletion of fossil fuel are demanding a new source of energy .
In the endeavor to meet this demand , the GIF  introduced new types of nuclear reactor in 2002 .
However , nuclear power always conjures up images of catastrophes , tremendous capital investment and wars .
To me , these thoughts on safety - daily danger , accidents and waste , cost and security can be completely expunged from our minds with the new reactor technology , specifically the lead-cooled fast reactor .
First , there are myriad benefits of nuclear power that the critics often overlook .
In terms of environment , nuclear plant operation by no means entails greenhouse gas emission .
Economically , the price of electricity generated from radioactive fuel would be much lower than that generated from fossil fuel due to the enormous energy churning out from fission reaction .
In addition , as the new nuclear reactor works at high temperature , scientists can utilize it to produce hydrogen from thermochemical reaction of water , which is the material for other industry .
About the negative effects , the first argument of the opponents concerns the impact of radiation on humans due to the routine operation of nuclear plant .
However , according to the Journal of the American Medical Association published by the National Cancer Institute , a major survey showed that there was no rising cancer rate in 107 US counties near 62 nuclear plants .
In fact , the amount of radiation that people living in the neighborhood of a nuclear plant expose to is really miniscule in comparison with that from natural sources .
Furthermore , burning coal in industries also emits radioactive elements .
According to the Atomic Energy Commission , the power plants using coal produced ash that contained 5 .2 tons of uranium and 12 .8 tons of thorium per year .
Regarding the nuclear accidents , it is the modern reactor generation that is invulnerable to the meltdown incident .
Granted , we cannot deny the impact of them , such as Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents , the new technology can eliminate the possibility of these accidents .
In Three Mile Island , indeed , there were still two defense lines along with the thick steel vessel containing radioactive fuel .
These safety criteria are improving in the lead-cooled fast reactor .
It has double-walled contained and a lot of core-cooling emergency systems .
Moreover , since the accidents are mainly brought about by the leaking of cooling tube , lead is chosen to reduce this possibility .
Lead vapor has low pressure .
Lead is a good heat conductor .
Lead is an inert substance preventing the corrosion .
What is more , lead has high shielding capability for gamma ray  .
Besides , the effects of accidents in coal and oil industries are noticeable , such as oil spills , mining accidents , let alone the environmental effects by the toxic fumes they produce .
As far as the radioactive waste is concerned , lead-cooled fast reactor is designed best to cut back on the amount of high level waste .
It has a closed cycle and high operating temperature in order to increase the efficiency and lowering the radioactive waste .
Furthermore , the high level waste is turned into rock-like form before embedded into the deep rock layer whose lifetime is about one billion years .
On the other hand , the emissions of coal and oil industries are still lingering in our atmosphere , which deteriorates the rate of respiratory disease .
Therefore , in terms of safety , the new lead-cooled fast reactor can really outweigh its counterparts , coal and oil plants .
Last but not least , the skeptics are worried about security .
They believe that the development of nuclear states might create opportunities to produce nuclear weapons from the plutonium reprocessing and uranium enriching .
Terrorists can also have the chance to magnify the destruction by attack the nuclear plant and the freighters that convey radioactive substance .
However , the new lead-cooled fast reactor , as I have mentioned , has many emergency systems that make the reactor "meltdown proof" even in case of human interference .
The closed cycle will reduce the waste as well as the necessity of plutonium reprocessing .
The efficiency of the nuclear reactor also means the reduction of refueling , so it minimizes the frequency of radioactive substance transfer .
In addition , the development of nuclear power also improves the energy security of a country .
In other words , it reduces the amount of foreign energy import , so it can soothes the simmer atmosphere in disputes over energy , especially oil .
In conclusion , the new generation IV nuclear reactor , in particular the lead-cooled fast reactor , is an optimal choice for future energy in three fronts: safety , cost and security though there are still many challenges lying ahead .
Thus , the government should invest more in the nuclear power development to make these reactors construction a feasible feat .
For the past few decades , the engineering field has developed drastically to a new degree of level .
At the same time , the peril and hazard of the engineering installations and systems rise with respond to complexity .
However , these designs seem to be too complex and complicated for engineers to work with .
The result was a series of engineering accidentsThree Mile Island , Chernobyl , the Challenger accidents and more .
Interestingly , the analysis reports of those accidents invariably described human factors as the major cause of those accidents .
Thus , people start to argue the importance of psychology in engineering design process .
Supporters claim that psychology can help to reduce the probability of accidents and they emphasize on the value of human lives .
Opponents , mainly formed by engineers and operators , take more consideration about costs and somehow ignore the safety measure as it is reasonable for suppliers to produce at minimum cost .
Although engineers and operators tend to oppose the using of psychology in engineering design process , research results have shown the importance of psychology in preventing accidents by using their professional knowledge .
In brief , while engineering has become a much sophisticated field , safety measure has become more and more important at the same time .
People have incurred much loss in terms of money and lives in various engineering accidents and they will not want to experience any disaster anymore .
While research has shown that most of the causes are due to human error , people are able to solve this problem by using psychology .
Human errors are unavoidable , but psychology is meant to reduce the effect caused by human errors to the minimum point .
Although some engineers and operators still oppose the use of psychology , for human safety , it is worthwhile to include psychology in an engineering design process .
The Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor  system is a system which uses lead as the coolant and the radioactive fuel used is the uranium .
It operate at 400~500 during its operation .
We measure performance by what is the output that the system can produce and the amount of power it can generate .
Since lead-cooled fast reactor is not a large scale reactor , its output is not as much if we compare to reactors like Very High Temperature Reactor  .
The VHTR is a helium cooled , graphite-moderated , thermal neutron spectrum reactor with a coolant outlet temperature of 1000  C or above .
VHTR outperforms the other reactors because of its potential to produce hydrogen .
It is possible to produce over 2 million cubic meters of hydrogen per day and this is the energy which is equal to over 16 ,000 gallons of gasoline per day  .
From this , we can see that VHTR greatly outperform LFR .
Safety is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to nuclear powered reactors , because the result is grievous and devastating if a nuclear reactor accident were to happen .
In 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine , there was a nuclear reactor accident which resulted in the deaths of many due to radiation poisoning .
To prevent such accidents from happening again , much emphasis has been put into the safety aspect when nuclear reactors are being designed .
For the generation IV nuclear reactor systems , the cost of the individual reactors varies and some is far greater costly than the other .
The estimated cost of building a 100MWE prototype of Lead cooled fast reactor in the U .S . is between $400-$700 million .
As compared with this , the cost building a VHTR reactor is much higher , which has an estimated cost of about $1 .1 billion .
.
This is partially due to the reason that VHTR's coolant , helium gas is much most costly than LFRs' coolant , and because of the strong structure that VHTR consists , it cost more to build .
However , most importantly , the extra cost of the system must be valid and used in an effective way .
In the case of VHTR , though more costly than LFRs , its performance and safety systems exceed those of LFRs , which justifies the extra cost incurred in building VHTRs .
In conclusion , both Very high temperature and Lead cooled fast reactors have good performance and excellent safety system , but VHTRs is on a higher end as compared to LFRs due to the greater system performance and system safety it provides .
Hence VHTRs are , to an extent , better than LFRs .
In the last century , most of the energy we consumed came from fossil fuels .
Usually we burned coal to generate vapor , then made the vapor drive the turbine to produce electricity .
This kind of energy producing method did make a big contribution to the industrialization of the world , but it also did a lot of harm to the natural environment .
Nowadays , people are suffering from many types of environmental problems , such as global warming , acid rain , air pollution , etc .
When talking about an energy generating method , efficiency will never be ignored .
Some people hold the view that SWCR has a higher efficiency .
Yes , they are right , but they are just comparing SWCR with the generation III reactors , not GFR reactor .
According to the statistics data given by Idaho National Laboratory , the thermal efficiency of SWCR is 43 .8% , which is lower than that of GFR , 48% .
You may think that the difference is not that much , but as shown in a report by Kevan D . Weaver and Hussein S . Khalil , a typical GFR plant has a power level of 600 MWth .
In this case , after doing a simple calculation , we will find that the difference is quite considerable .
What is more , GFR also get Hydrogen production .
The only production of combusting hydrogen is water and burning same amount of hydrogen or other fuels , we get much more energy from hydrogen .
Due to all the reasons mentioned above , I think that GFR has a higher efficiency than SWCR .
In a conclusion , Gas-cooled Fast Reactor is better than Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor , respectively in the field of efficiency , expend and security .
I believe that GFR is one of the most promising generation IV nuclear reactors , and its large scaled application is just around the corner .
Chernobyl , Ukraine is the location of the most fatal nuclear accident that happened on April 26 , 1986 .
The accident caused many deaths and resulted in severe health impacts due to the radiation exposed by the population  .
There is a debate on whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the Chernobyl tragedy .
The critics argue that the calamity took place due to human factors which were beyond the control of the engineers .
The use of psychology would be irrelevant .
On the other hand , the supporters claim that through the use of psychology , the engineers might have anticipated different scenarios that could happen and designed a safer and more stable plant .
In other words , the Chernobyl accident might be prevented and with those better safety measures in place , the effects of the accident would be minimized .
According to Wilpert  , human actions usually play a significant role in provoking accidents .
In the Chernobyl accident , the operators lacked the expertise of operating the nuclear power plant and were inadequately trained .
They also violated several operating and safety regulations  .
These led to the explosion of the power plant .
The engineers did not factor in the possibility of the operators switching off the security systems as its probability was close to zero  .
The use of psychology would be ineffective as the carelessness of the operators was beyond the control of the engineers .
However , psychology has a vital role in all human ventures  .
The problem of psychopathology of design is a mismatch of the engineers' and the operators' theoretical model which happened in this case .
The use of the occupational psychology might aid the engineers in understanding that the operators might not be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to operate the plant .
They might have implemented precautions such that unauthorized personnel could not shut down the emergency safety systems  .
Therefore , there is a possibility that the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
Otherwise , it would have at least weakened the severity of the consequences .
In addition to the operators' actions and the flawed reactor design , there are external factors that made the explosion possible .
The operators were working under pressure overnight  .
A study shows that irregular hours of work can decrease work performance and may result in errors or accidents  .
Furthermore , when some reactor components failed to work correctly , the operators faced more stress  .
They might not be able to think properly and make the right decisions .
Such external conditions were not part of the design process and hence the use of psychology would not be helpful .
However , occupational threats and individual work place misfortunes were the focus of psychology as they were influenced by the individual's motivation , attitude and decision-making  .
The use of work and organisational psychology might aid the engineers in understanding how the environment could affect the operators' performance .
The engineers might have implemented more safety measures to counter the failure of each component or the effects of the blunders made by the operators .
Therefore , there is a possibility that the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
Otherwise , it would have at least weakened the severity of the consequences .
In conclusion , the main factors that resulted in the Chernobyl disaster are the negligence of the operators , the flawed reactor designed and other external factors such as the pressure faced by the operators .
On the surface , psychology appears to be irrelevant during the design process of the nuclear plant .
On the contrary , psychology might help the engineers foreseen possible problems during the operation and more safety precautions might be incorporated .
The use of psychology might have prevented the Chernobyl accident and the effects of the accident would be minimized .
Nuclear power is a method to change matter into energy according to Einstein's most famous equation E=mc2 .
That means with 1 kilogram decrease of mass , 9 , 000 , 000 billion kilojoules of energy will be produced .
Nuclear power , when harnessed , can support a 100w electric incandescent lampoon for 2 , 853 , 881 , 279 years .
Moreover , nuclear energy is environmental friendly because it has very low emission of green house gases .
However , only "16% of the world's electricity is produced from nuclear energy" CITATION Nuc091 \l 2052  .
This is because opponents of nuclear power claim that it is not safe .
One accident of nuclear is the Chernobyl accident in 1986 .
A total of 54 people die in this accident CITATION Che091 \l 2052  .
Therefore , in recent years , scientists and engineers have developed six Generation VI reactors that are cost effective , safer , and minimize waste CITATION Joz09 \l 2052  .
This essay will focus on sodium-cooled fast reactors  in comparison with supercritical-water-cooled reactors  as in three aspects: performance , cost , and safety , and show that the SFR is a better concept than the SWCR .
In terms of cost , proponents of SWCR claim that SWCR has longer history of development while SFR is a newer concept that is just brought up recent years .
The research and development of SFR is very expensive .
People who are against nuclear reactors even claim that the existing method of generate electricity is good enough and new method is not necessary .
However , these shortsighted people fail to realize that shortage of resource is already very serious among global .
Moreover , the thermal efficiency of thermal power generation is just about 30% .
Hence , the invention of generation IV reactors can both generate electricity in a more efficient way and more fuel saving way .
For SFR , it saves costs in two main methods: the reactor vessel and fuel .
The usage of advanced materials , the loop type cooling system and innovative design options are all adopted to save the plant capital costs .
Secondly , it recovers and recycles 99 .9% of the actinides , which can both save the fuel and decrease the money spent on dealing with nuclear waste .
For SWCR , it does not recycle the waste; the nuclear wastes management is also one concern of SWCR in terms of both cost and safety .
The third point to emphasis is that SFR has the earliest delivery year , 10 years earlier than SWCR .
This means the time and money required to do the research for SFR is much less than that of SWCR .
We can conclude that SFR is also cost saving .
Generation four nuclear reactor plants went into development in hope of creating a new nuclear reactor plant that can replace the current old generation three reactor plants .
The new nuclear reactor maybe high in cost for research but it has better performance , safety and security factors than the old generator plants .
In this new development , experts have look into 6 new nuclear reactor plant concepts like molten salt reactor  and Very High Temperature Reactor  .
MSR researchers did intensify research to ensure that it has superior safety standard and fuel cycle qualities than VHTR .
Therefore , the research in MSR cost about $1000 million as compared to VHTR's research which will cost at $670 million as quoted from the report on "a technology roadmap for generation IV Nuclear Energy system" .
The latter cost only 20% lesser than the former and the difference in money spend is used to build a generation 4 reactor's standards .
From the report , Researchers for MSR distributed a lot of funds in areas like safety , reactor system and fuel cycle as compared to fund distribution in these areas of research in VHTR .
The areas of safety and reactor systems will be covered later in this essay .
Fuel cycle in MSR needs to have more attention as compared to VHTR is because there is a need to ensure that molten salt which is mixed with the nuclear material will still be functional after many rounds of usage in the system .
The idea of MSR is that it will produce less waste and able to recycle it .
Therefore , the effort put into this area of research is to make MSR a cleaner nuclear reactor plant that does reduce , reuse and recycle its waste .
MSR works better than VHTR in various ways .
It has a 24/7 circulating molten salt fuel mixture in the whole system to generate energy for the masses .
The molten fluoride salts used in the system helps to lower the vapor pressure , thus , reduce stresses on vessel and piping .
As compared to VHTR , it uses helium cooling to transfer heat to electric energy .
This system generates high temperature of up to 1000 degree Celsius .
Therefore , when there is high temperature the pressure in the system will also increase .
A highly pressurized system is dangerous and need to consistently monitoring to ensure safe operation as stresses acting on the pipes and vessel can cause the system to explode .
When MSR is operating at high temperature of ranging eight hundred degree and above , it can produce another good energy source .
This energy source is hydrogen .
Hydrogen can be use to generate power for machines like hydrogen powered car which is clean for the environment .
In VHTR , in order to produce hydrogen for similar usage , it requires another indirect cycle that consists of a heat exchanger .
This will further complicate the VHTR system and additional cost is incurred .
The Fuel used in MSR can be recycled as mentioned earlier .
However , in the case of VHTR , the fuel used is a one through fuel cycle and therefore , it requires proper disposal .
Researchers have been looking into this area , to recycle VHTR fuel waste , so that it will be a clean nuclear reactor plant .
One of the reasons for development in Generation 4 nuclear reactor plants is due to security reason .
The waste products produced by the current old nuclear plants cannot be recycle and need to be disposed at wasteland .
These wastes are highly radioactive and suitable for making weapons of mass destruction .
If these wastes landed on the wrong hands like terrorists , the world will be in chaos as we live in fear of nuclear attacks by unknown enemies .
Wastes generated by these nuclear plants also bring problems to our future generations .
As these wastes take very long to degrade , the land that holds them will become a wasteland which is not suitable for agriculture , residential and commercial usages .
Therefore , the Generation 4 nuclear reactor plants like MSR , it recycle its waste products and does not need to dispose them .
However , in VHTR , as mentioned earlier , it produces wastes and researchers are trying to find solution to it .
In conclusion , even though MSR cost more to research than VHTR , its benefits outshine VHTR .
Its performance in low pressure quality can help to reduce stresses on equipment and lesser chances of industrial accident than a high pressure system which induce high stress to the equipments .
It is safer than VHTR as it has better safety standard .
Lastly , in the area of security , MSR will not create chances of producing waste that will land on the wrong hands like the terrorist as compared to VHTR which have to deal with secured and proper waste disposal .
There were always concerns about the safe operations of nuclear reactors by the public , opponents of the supporters of nuclear reactors claimed that public's irrational fears towards radiation .
I have chosen the Supercritical water-cooled reactor to support the argument for further research and development funding for the generation IV reactors .
We understand that there are many influential factors to support further research and development funding such as security , cost and performance in the newer generation of nuclear reactors , also known as "Generation IV" reactors .
One of the most important factors to support further research development funding is security .
The public often have doubts when it leads to security and safety issues on nuclear reactors .
However , the Supercritical water-cooled reactor is one of the safest reactors comparing to current generation II and III reactors .
The SCWR has safety measures such as physical resistance against terrorist attacks .
For example , possibilities of an air attack by terrorist do occur .
However , the penetration of the containment for nuclear elements is not possible .
If any events that lead to the occurrence of such possibilities , it would probably not reach the nuclear vessel  .
Ever since the Three Miles Island incident , many new safety regulations had been implemented and also in SCWR , emergency plans had been set up to prevent such things from happening again .
For instance , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  has set up a 10-mile Emergency Planning Zone  to maintain warning zones and also set up sirens and conducted emergency evacuation exercises  .
Such plans are to assist in protecting people within the 10- mile radius .
In addition , cost is a major factor for all sectors including the private sector , the government and the community .
The economics for overall nuclear reactors are hard to estimate .
Normally , the economics of nuclear reactors are basic construction costs , operating cost , the life-time of the plant and the rate of return on capital  .
Critics often said that the overall cost for using nuclear energy had increased over the years and was relatively high  .
In contrast , with the new SCWR , it is possible to decrease its cost since the SCWR is cheaper to build than existing nuclear reactors in the United States which consists of the Pressurized Water Reactors and Boiled Water Reactors .
For example , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded that the operating costs are lower for Light Water Reactors  compared to coal-fired operating plants and also considerably below the operating costs for gas-fired plants  .
Thirdly , the performance of the nuclear reactors also contributes to further support and development funding of nuclear reactors .
Performance is measured through the efficiency electricity produced , the production and recycle of waste disposal , the method and characteristics of the nuclear reactor .
Critics often said that nuclear reactors are unsafe , unpractical and low in performance .
However , this argument is not true .
The Generation- IV International Forum  has been formed in order to improve the current generation reactors , also improving the performance of the Generation IV reactors .
Since SCWR is under the category of Generation IV reactors , it is also true that in terms of performance , it would be better than current Generation III reactors .
As for the characteristics of the SCWR , it operates above the thermodynamic critical point of water with high temperature and high pressure .
Statistics showed that the thermal efficiency has been increased by 45 percent compared to previous generation reactors  .
It should be evident that the arguments against to support further research and development funding for Generation IV reactors is not valid .
On the contrary , recent research also found that 74 percent of the U .S population favors nuclear energy  .
Safety measures such as physical resistance and emergency plans have been implemented to improve the security of the SCWR .
Furthermore , the cost of the SCWR is lower compared to existing LWR reactors also plays an important role in further research on Generation IV reactors .
Nonetheless , the formation of the GIF and the performance increase which has proven with SCWR is also another reason for further research and development of the nuclear reactor .
Therefore , the development of the Generation IV reactors will surely benefit mankind and cope with energy demands of the future .
When it comes to the patients' safety , some questions such as the reliability of surgical robots are raised by the public .
Patients feel uneasy having robots operating on them without the presence of humans .
They feel that robots are not able to feel their 'pain' and thus unable to detect any error during the operation .
According to New York Health Times  , surgical robots have successfully helped a patient with a kidney transplant .
This is one of the many successful operations using surgical robots that are happening around the world .
A patient's safety is the responsibility of a surgeon .
The surgeon will ensure that the robots are in good working conditions before having them in operation theatres .
Besides having the robot in the operating room , there will be at least one surgeon in the room to control the robot remotely .
Every movement of the robot arms is controlled by the surgeon  .
There are official training centres available to train surgeons such as the H pitaux Universitaires de Gen ve .
The final issue is the cost of the surgery and system .
According to an article  , the cost of each surgery ranges from a few hundreds to a few thousands depending on what surgery is performed .
The cost of the system is estimated at $120 000 with a yearly maintenance of $100 000  .
Although the cost is high , it is definitely worth the money given the quality that the system can provide .
The extra cost from the elimination of surgeons can also be used for the maintenance fee of the robots .
The government will also subsidize for the cost of the system and also for people who is in need of financial help .
In conclusion , surgical robots play a very important role in hospitals .
The number of surgeons in each operating theatre is reduced .
Actual precision such as keyhole techniques can be achieved which produces less scarring and less blood loss .
Robots can also help to reduce hand stress of the surgeons from long hours of surgery .
Surgeons are well-trained before they can operate the robots .
This will enhance safety for patients .
Although the cost of the surgery is high , given the high quality provided from the robots such as shorter hospital stays , faster recovery and safe operation , surgical robots is therefore encouraged worldwide .
Energy is one of the biggest problems around the world .
What we are facing for the next few hundreds , or even tens of years is the negative side effect of using fossil fuel global warming , and its running out .
Yet , regarding the topic of finding substitute energy , one of the solutions is to rely on nuclear energy .
Nuclear fuel can last longer than fossil fuel in power production and can provide much more energy .
Also , it is cleaner regarding the global warming problem .
On the contrary , there are still some concerns on using nuclear energy: The most important one is about the safety of nuclear power plant its potential radioactive pollution .
Another problem is the performance of nuclear power plant with respect to its cost .
Since it is much more expensive than usually used firepower plant , whether nuclear power plant can provide electricity efficiently with a reasonable cost became a rather essential problem .
Considering the above three concerns: Safety , Cost and Performance , the Generation IV International Forum , formed by ten countries , puts forward six outstanding protocols into Research and Development .
In this essay , I will only compare two of the six reacting systems Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor  and Very- High-Temperature Reactor  from aspects of safety , cost and performance to illustrate SFR is more superior to the other .
Another issue is about the performance , or economic evaluation of these two reactors .
Exactly , because of the temperature factor , the power supplier SFR cannot be as efficient as VHTR , which can achieve efficiency higher than 50%  .
Yet , SFR is still quite efficient and economic-friendly in terms of its recycle of nuclear fuel and flexibility in the plant structure .
Accompany with its effective recovery and recycle of actinides , SFR can achieve converting 99% of natural uranium energy into electricity .
Besides , in the six protocols , SFR is one of the only two systems that have flexible options of building different sizes of power plant .
More specifically , its power supply can range from a few hundred MW for Mid-Size plant to 1500- 1700 MW for Large Monolithic plant  .
However , VHTR only can be built as Large Monolithic plant .
That means SFR is able to meet requirement of economic factors in different situations better than other reactors .
Hence , the SFR still can meet the performance and economist requirement in the future .
Thirdly , about cost , it is quite clear that SFR is among those low-cost Generation IV nuclear reactors no matter from Research and Development or from plant aspect .
Especially , with only 610M$ , the cost of Research and Development of SFR is exactly the lowest one comparing to the other five protocols  .
In addition , the effectiveness of its utilization of nuclear fuel also contributes to its low cost if it is launched into production .
Therefore , SFR benefits more with its lower cost than VHTR .
In conclusion , Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor has a more consummate security system than Very-High-Temperature Reactor to insure its safety .
And , the difference between the performance of SFR and VHTR is minimized .
In addition , the low cost of SFR exactly benefits a lot for its economic requirement and fetches up the difference of its performance .
Considering above aspects , SFR can meet the future requirement better .
Nuclear energy is a new kind of energy generated from nuclear power plants .
Huge amount of nuclear energy will come out during atomic reactions .
Because of its high efficiency and enormous quantity , nuclear power energy has gained its rapid development in these years .
However , many negative aspects of nuclear energy , such as radiation pollution , waste heat , greenhouse gas emission etc , also cause people pay lots of attention to its reliability .
Nowadays people argue about the safety issues and economic cost of nuclear power generation and they doubt about its ability to go against climate change as well , which is asserted by some scientists .
According to the scientific observations for nuclear power generation and the positive effect of nuclear energy , there is no doubt that nuclear power is one of the best ways for energy generation , although there are some negative influences .
One of the most controversial issues is the safety problem of nuclear power plants .
As a common knowledge , everyone knows that nuclear reaction produces a lot of radiation waste which will harm human health .
In the past years , accidents did have happened .
One catastrophic example is the Chernobyl accident happened in 1986 in Russia which caused 28 deaths within 4 months and up to 56 fatalities by 2004 just because of the steam explosion and a slight waste release of the radiation of the reactors core  .
Whereas , scientists found that nuclear power risks are actually tiny and it can also be further reduced through using the updated technological reactors .
Successful facts achieved in western world also indicated that the record of the operational safety for nuclear plants is much better than any other types of power plants  .
Hence , compared with other energy , nuclear energy actually is much safer !
The notion of addressing the world's power needs has never been more pressing as developing countries become more developed , population increases tremendously and demands for power supply escalate exponentially .
It is in time like this that drives mankind to innovate and churn out alternate solutions , hoping that coupled with existing ones , he can solve or at the very least tackle the problem effectively; and in this case , an experimented , practical solution would be the further development of nuclear energy .
Due to the numerous advantages that nuclear energy brings about , it is very likely to be one of the most feasible solutions to the world's energy crisis .
While there are public concern on the cost , security and safety issues involved , the new generation IV reactors are proposed to address these areas of concern .
One particularly advanced concept is the Very High Temperature Reactor  , which makes use of helium coolant , which is inert and not reactive , and produces electricity and hydrogen , which is in turn used for the formation of hydrogen cell .
These advantages , along with other safety precautions in place , will definitely serve to tackle the energy problem of the world .

The next key agenda on the minds of public is nonetheless the safety considerations and implications that these nuclear reactors can have .
While we can gladly say that nuclear leakages are not rampant over the past few years , we can never forget the reactor meltdown back in 1979 at Three Mile Island , where lives were taken away  .
This not only serve as a reminder for generations but also for scientist to reflect upon and further enhance their research .
In fact , it is because of these very reasons that the Generation IV reactors were proposed; to further improve on the safety aspect of existing reactors .
Indeed , nuclear power development carries with them a social stigma; being dangerous and harmful to the society even in the modern world as mankind are skeptical about its use and benefits , and instead are more wary on the few incidents whereby lives were lost .
However , this societal stigma can be eradicated with the help of time , together with education on nuclear energy .
Nuclear energy does not produce greenhouse gases or acid rain , and thus government abiding by the Kyoto Protocol will definitely be looking at this to cut down on its greenhouse emission .
I definitely believe that it is too early to simply brush aside the whole concept and classify it as being unsafe .
While we might have our reservations , given the test of time , nuclear energy will be able to prove its worth in our society .

The devastating damage and long-term , "chronic" consequences of the two nuclear disasters at Hiroshima and Nagasaki are still reminding us about how dangerous this type of weapons is .
Greenpeace and a lot of volunteer groups , organizations around the world are trying their best to ensure that those calamities will never occur again .
Though , the scenario of no fuel resources left and increasing extreme weather caused by global warming nowadays have pushed us to reconsider nuclear power .
Government and scientists support the wide use and development of nuclear power .
Obviously , to lessen the world's thirst of energy in the long term , and to reduce the growing number of disasters , I am in favor of using nuclear power as a main resource of energy in the future .
First of all , we have to ease the public worry .
Consequences of nuclear disasters are still among the most fearful images of the human race .
With approval to widely use nuclear power , authorities have to be responsible for the safety of the entire process .
Mistakes are impermissible because it would kill several people and totally destroy a huge area .
There are also a lot of nerve-racking matters , particularly the chronic disease cases many years after the disaster .
Security is the second issue when operating nuclear power plants .
Discriminations are widespread around the world such as terrorism , racism and religious belief system .
Some nations even publicize their support for these idealisms .
Because of that , any source of nuclear fuel , nuclear waste must be kept away from those bellicose ones .
Otherwise , the degree of destruction would be more fatal than those mistakes in operating nuclear power plants .
However , the shift from fossil fuels to nuclear power is inevitable .
Global warming and worldwide shortage of energy are main problems .
Typhoon Ketsana , hurricane Katrina , and tsunamis striking the South- and South-East Asia are some apparent consequences of global warming .
In addition , more difficult problems soon arise if we keep using fossil fuels .
Acidification , famines , and disappearance of permafrost , coastal areas and agricultural lands will threat our future offspring .
The reserves for fossil fuels are running out .
Thus , nuclear energy is a prominent alternative .
Further research brought us the promising generation IV concept , the very-high-temperature reactor  .
It not only generate 50% more electricity more than conventional plants from the same amount of fuel , but can also split hydrogen from water , which is another fuel for the future .
Then , we can use energy that is safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and yet proliferation resistant  .
First of all , it is possible to generate a large amount of electricity with just a plant .
The VHTR has the highest potential among the six generation IV reactor designs .
Many plants operating at the same time will give us more than enough electricity for industrial and city needs .
It's a remarkable benefit of nuclear energy compared to other developing kinds of energy like solar energy and wind power .
Those types just meet the requirements of residential , office and hose needs .
Using nuclear power is a long-term solution to human need of energy .
That is why nuclear energy is said to be abundant .
Secondly , this technology has a long time of development while solar energy and wind power has just been developed recently .
Human don't need to invest too much on it comparing to other kinds of energy .
Thus , a large amount of money can be saved .
Thirdly , nuclear energy frees us from fossil fuels dependence .
That means no monopoly of some oil-rich nations like present .
It will prevent some countries to abuse fuels as a way of achieving political and economic purposes on the forming new world order .
In contrast with fossil fuels , uranium is evenly deposited around the world .
Thus there will be enough fuel for all nations , all regions .
With this fuel , nuclear power plants are no longer vulnerable to some unexpected scenarios , such as wars , natural disasters or economic disorders .
This is the reliability of nuclear energy .
Last of all , more procedures will help decrease the potential danger of nuclear energy .
Nuclear waste can also be recycled and reprocessed .
Thanks to the rapid pace of technology development nowadays , new materials for reactor construction , ways of observing and controlling process , we can be assured that past accident like Chernobyl will never happen again .
On the other hand , without nuclear disasters , no people died due to working inside nuclear power plants .
However , each year , many people all over the world die from respiratory diseases because of the burning of coal , gas , oil , etc .
In conclusion , the advantages of nuclear energy outweigh the disadvantages .
Regulatory systems will create more strict safety measures .
As global energy demands predicted to soar and soar relentlessly , nuclear energy is a prominent resource .
It will not only mitigate the consequences of global warming , but also help lessen the world's thirst of fuel in a long period .
We , human beings have to adapt to a new age of nuclear power , have to fully exploit it rather than being uneasy and in doubt of this controversial type of energy .
With increasing concerns over the impacts of global warming and oil prices , fossil fuels alone will not be able to meet the increasing world's energy demand in the future to come .
While oil will remain indispensible for transport for a long time , nuclear energy , with its large and cheap output of energy , has the potential to play a big role in supplying the rest of the world's energy demands .
Nuclear energy is currently supplying 17% of the world's energy demand and however this number is projected to drop as old plants close more frequently than new ones open .
Unless a new source of sustainable energy is discover , continual research and development of nuclear energy should be given in order to sustain the economies of the world .
The Very High Temperature Reactor  is one of the nuclear generation IV reactor concepts that should be given priority in its research and development .
Its uses helium , an unreactive gas as a coolant and operates at high temperature to achieve high efficiency .
It has the one of the earliest delivery date among the other generation IV reactors .
Many projects incurred high costs due to extended periods of research and development , thus it is economically more sensible to give priority to a project that has the earlier delivery date .
Moreover , the VHTR does not require the reprocessing of nuclear waste , thus avoiding the separation of plutonium , a key ingredient in making advanced nuclear weapons .
The difference between the cost of nuclear and conventional power plants is perhaps the most important factor in the research and development of nuclear power plants .
The costs mainly comprised of twp components: the investment and generation cost .
Typically , the investment cost of a nuclear power plant is much higher due to its design .
However , based on generation cost , nuclear power plants have a significant economic advantage over conventional power plants .
The high investment cost is offset by the generation cost , making nuclear energy a much cheaper form of energy .
The main reason of public opposition to nuclear energy could be the lack of confidence in the safe operation of nuclear power plants is also one of the .
The Chernobyl  and Three Mile Island  accident are frightening examples of how devastating a nuclear accident can be .
Even till today , people are still dying of the effects from the radiations of the accidents .
During World War II , the world also witnessed the large scale effects of radiation on both environment and humans when an atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
It is to note that the nuclear power industry is still a relatively new one and the confidence in the safe running of the nuclear reactors comes only with experience over time .
Despite this , the nuclear industry has already an established safety system and stringent checks , and over time , the industry would be able to prove its safety records .
There has been a concern over the growth of nuclear power will contribute to nuclear proliferation .
The world now already has enough nuclear weapons to blow up the whole planet .
In addition , majority of the nations with nuclear plants own nuclear weapons as well and the nations with the most number of nuclear plants own most of the nuclear weapons worldwide .
Nuclear was first developed under a project codenamed "The Manhattan Project" and it was fueled by the competition with the Nazis todevelop the world's first atomic bomb during the War World II .
The technology was later used to generate energy , thus it is inevitable the most countries own both nuclear weapons and plants .
With the introduction of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  , majority of the nations have adhered to it and has since concluded that it is also in their security interest to remain without nuclear weapons .
In summary , nuclear energy will continue to play an important role in meeting the world's energy demand .
However with increasing public opposition to nuclear technology due to the harmful effects of the radiation produced , in recent years more plants shut down than new ones open .
The cause is due to concerns over the cost of nuclear plants and most importantly , the safe operation of nuclear plants and the issue of nuclear proliferation .
The concerns are uncalled for as continual research and development will bring about cheaper and safer operation of nuclear plants .
Measures are also in place to keep nuclear proliferation in check .
As new reactor concepts develops  , it is no surprise that nuclear energy is the "next big thing" .
Have you heard about the nuclear leak in Bhopal which led to more than 2000 deaths ?
Such disastrous events also happened in Pennsylvania and Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union .
The serious consequences caused by nuclear leaks make the experts consider over and over again before ordering new nuclear plants .
Nowadays , because of the desperate need of human societies for long term energy sources , the experts are forced to explore a safer and more economic reactor to generate nuclear power .
.Under this scenario , Molten salt reactors  are the best options for three reasons .
In the first place , Molten salt reactors are much safer due to the properties of the chosen salt mixture and the low pressure .
Moreover , it is more economic to develop MSRs .
Finally , most of the technology challenge can be overcome .
Moreover , Molten salt reactor costs less than other reactors under development which is indicated in the table .
Why fluorides are favored to be used as coolant is because fluorine does not need expensive isotope separation as chlorine does  .
What is more , in the core of reactor , the pressure is relatively low .
Thus there is no need for the quite expensive high-pressure steam vessel .
Instead , the low pressure pipes built of thin sheets of metal are used .
Since the metal pipes are thick , it costs less to construct and weld .
In addition , the efficiency is raised effectively due to the high temperature , which accordingly reduces the use of fuel and the cost of complementary equipment by 50% or more .
{} These properties imply that MSRs can work in small sizes , which reduces the cost of land and construction .
In conclusion , it is worthwhile to further develop the Molten salt reactor in order to fulfill the booming energy demands .
First is because MSRs are relatively safe among the other reactors under development .
Besides , MSRs provide the countries a much more economic way to develop nuclear plant .
Last but not least , the two main challenges of MSRs are solved by the new technology called carbon-carbon heat exchanger .
Thus , under current circumstance , the new dawn of Molten salt reactor will come soon .
There are a group of people who might strongly feel that if proper research had been done , the engineers would have come up with a better design such that any faulty in the wheels would have detected and hence preventing the train from moving .
With high technology research on this aspect of design would have been possible and hence would have prevented the accident .
However , the study of psychology focusing on the Human Computer Interaction helps one to use the rapidly advancing telecommunication and research facilities to their advantage .
As mentioned , "modern information and communication technologies drastically change the nature of the design process"  .
Therefore , the study of HCI would better enable the engineers to analysis the information they gather and would hence e able to come with innovative designs which looks into the safety of the design .
Therefore the use of the psychology would have helped to prevent the accident .
The world's population is predicted to expand from about 6 billion people to 10 billion people by the year 2050 CITATION ATe02 \l 1033  .
And global energy demand is expected to double at that time CITATION Nuc04 \l 1033  .
Today's energy use has caused adverse environmental problems so the energy supply will be far from sufficient for future demand .
Now the whole world has the same goals of sustainable development .
Then should we concern over environmental pollution , climate change , and energy availability so the use of energy supplies which clean , safe and economically effective is necessary .
Currently , a general recognition suggests that nuclear power is a good sustainable energy .
However , the public is very concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors , economic costs , technical risks , waste disposal of the nuclear energy systems .
To solve these problems , six generation IV reactor concepts are planned .
Compared with the other five concepts , the Molten Salt Reactor  advances in safety , reliability , performance and economics .
In my point of view , people should support the farther research on MSR technology to fulfill human's energy consumption in the future .
Today the principal challenges are using green resources and energy to get a radical reduction of CO2 emissions to deal with climate change and to pursue sustainable development .
The MSR can produce nuclear energy with high safety and efficiency .
Even though lots of problems still need to be solved , the benefits are far greater than disadvantages .
So further research on the MSR should be supported .
In recent years , oil has become very important to many people by providing fuels for cars and most importantly , generates electricity .
We are using more tools that require electricity with technological advancements .
This means that we need more oil to meet our rising energy demands , causing the oil price to increase due to depleting oil reserves .
At the same time , burning oil to generate electricity also releases large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
This has caused many environmental problems like global warming .
Thus , there is a need for us to find other ways of generating electricity .
One alternative we have is nuclear power .
However , there are many who oppose to this idea because they feel that this choice is expensive , unsafe and cannot perform as well as others like renewable energy .
Thus , scientists have come out with the idea of Generation IV Reactors , which will be safer , cheaper and better in terms of performance .
The Very High Temperature Reactor  is one of these reactors .
Since it is the Generation IV Reactor expected to have one of the earliest deliveries with the highest power output  , the research on it should be supported and continued .
Firstly , many people opposed the use of nuclear power as a form of energy because it is expensive to research and build a nuclear reactor .
However , they did not realise that nuclear power is expensive only at the early stage .
In the long run , nuclear power still a cheaper alternative fuel as VHTR can generate fifty percent more electricity from the same amount of fuel in the current coal-powered power plants  .
Besides that , the rising price of oil will eventually become much more expensive than the radioactive materials used .
In the long run , the cost of setting up the plant and researching can be offset .
Thus , nuclear power is not expensive compared to other sources .
Secondly , people may argue that nuclear power is not safe to human because of the radiation that radioactive materials give out .
The Three Mile Island accident and Chernobyl accident are evidences of their claims .
In the Chernobyl accident alone , there are a total of fifty-six deaths  .
Hence , they feel that nuclear power is dangerous .
Yet , according to the World Nuclear Association  , the most serious case of nuclear reactor accident is the Chernobyl accident with fifty-six deaths while a recent coal mine methane explosion in China has caused seventy-eight deaths .
Thus , nuclear power is not as dangerous as we thought .
Furthermore , in the new concept of VHTR , it will be "meltdown proof" so it will be still be safe if accidents happen  .
Thus , nuclear power is not as dangerous compared to other sources of energy and the VHTR can be made safer with modern technologies .
Lastly , people claimed that nuclear power cannot perform as well as other sources of energy since it is not sustainable  .
The radioactive materials will run out one day like oil and coal , bringing us the problems that coal and oil are giving us today .
Thus , they feel that we should use renewable resources like solar and wind for power .
However , nuclear power is actually a better choice over other sources of energy because it has the best output for its cost and land area occupied .
Many renewable resources like solar and wind require a lot more land mass to generate sufficient energy  .
Thus , the amount of electricity generated per land area is not as much as nuclear power .
So , if we use renewable resources , we will have to clear more land , which is harmful to the environment .
Furthermore , nuclear power is one of the cheapest powers to generate now  .
Thus , even though nuclear power cannot perform for a long time like other renewable powers , but it is the best performing power that we can rely on now for its efficiency per land area and cost .
In conclusion , coal and oil are no longer sources of energy that we should rely on because of their rising costs and environmental impacts .
Thus , there is a need for other sources of power .
Currently , generating power using nuclear reactor , VHTR , will be our best choice since it has zero emission , cheap , safe and efficient .
Thus , the research on VHTR should be continued and funded to get ourselves ready before the demand for energy increase by one fold in year 2050 as predicted  .
Fund the development of Generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV Nuclear Reactors
As noted in "Nuclear power's new dawn" , Butler said that the public is concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Public opposition was one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries .
However , nuclear energy is more efficient and gives a new future for future energy consumption , especially after the use of generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV nuclear reactors  .
In my perspective , it is a good choice to support and fund the development of generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV nuclear reactors for future energy consumption .
For a single country , they can also benefit a lot from nuclear energy .
Not because it is a kind of future energy but also it can enhance the speed of economic development  .
People always say the economic development will depend on the comprehensive national strength , or the national power , not the nuclear energy , however , they may not see the importance of nuclear energy in improving it .
According to a report made by OPEC , in 2009 , China consumed oil 8 .27 million barrels a day , which is 0 .29 million barrels more per day than 2008 .
And China will rely almost 50% of its whole energy consumption on oil .
The money for oil import is a huge number and that money can do many other infrastructure constructions .
As mentioned before , the material for nuclear energy can produce much more energy per kilogram .
Hence , China will reduce a lot of its oil import if nuclear energy is widely used and accepted by the public .
The generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors will perform very satisfying in this aspect .
If we can support and fund the nuclear energy for future development , it will enhance the speed of economy development .
As we advance into the age of technology , we witness many breakthroughs .
It is significant that nuclear power has marked a new era of science and technology .
However , some people have lost their confidences to nuclear power development after the occurring of nuclear disasters in Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
But the generation IV reactors that are currently under research and development have been greatly improved and hence they are much safer than conventional plants .
The six generation IV reactors , of which the Very High Temperature Reactor  has the most potential to be selected for further R&D funding .
Specifically , compared with Molten Salt Reactor  , the VHTR is safer , incurs low operation and maintenance costs and modular construction costs .
Some people might have wrong assumption that the MSR have higher performance than the VHTR since it is a fast reactor that relies on fast neutrons while the later one is a thermal reactor that relies on moderators to slow neutrons first .
However , this is not true because the reactors' performances are also depends on the temperature and pressure .
In fact , the overall plant efficiency of the VHTR is more than 50% whereas compared to MSR around 44 -50% .
This is because the VHTR is operating at a higher temperature , thus its thermal power output is up to 600 MW .
In addition , the VHTR is operating in a midsized plant as compared to the MSR which is a large in size .
Thus , it is true that the VHTR has higher performance .
Research shows that the MSR is safe to operate and maintain as the molten fluoride salts used are mechanically and chemically stable at sea-level pressures  .
However , the MSR is operating with closed fuel cycle while the VHTR is operating with an open fuel cycle system .
Thus , the VHTR is neutral in sustainability and this means that VHTR spent fuel that could be disposed of in a geological repository or conditioned for optimum waste disposal .
Therefore , the VHTR is definitely safe to be used because the encapsulation for the spent fuel fission products has been further improved so it is extremely resistant to leaching in a final repository  .
Furthermore , the MSR discard larger amount of waste compare to the VHTR .
Even though the waste from the MSR is then undergoing recycling , but this process is unsecure as this bypasses the stage where plutonium , an active ingredient for nuclear weapons , is produced .
Hence , the plants might become the targets for terrorist .
In addition , the cost of recycling is very expensive and a lot of fuels still end up as waste .
On the other hand , the VHTR enhance minimization through fuel recycling .
From analysis , the VHTR will spend fuel in a symbiotic fuel cycle that can achieve significant reductions in waste quantity and radio toxicity because of its ability to accommodate a wide variety mixture of fissile and fertile materials without significantly modification of the core design  .
Thus , in term of safety and security , the VHTR is actually much safer than the MSR .
In conclusion , the VHTR provide an economically competitive nuclear heat source and hydrogen production capability  .
Therefore , unremitting efforts and funding should be put into its research and development so it would give a fresh impetus to enhance the development of nuclear power .
Should funding be given to the Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor over the other Generation IV reactors ?
There has been much debate on whether to develop Generation IV reactors , or to continue using Generation III reactors , which are much safer  .
However , with the rising need for energy , going ahead to develop the Generation IV concepts is a logical choice .
Among the six chosen concepts for Generation IV reactors , the Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor  is one of the more popular choices  .
The SCWR has a much simpler design compared to the other chosen reactors , and would be cheaper to build and operate  .
This will fulfill the nuclear reactors main purpose of generating affordable and reliable electricity  .
In addition , the SCWR is developed from existing technologies that work , which will result in a reduction in the cost of building it and also an increase in its reliability  .
Therefore , the SCWR is the most feasible choice among all the other generation IV reactors .
The main reason for choosing the SCWR over the other reactors is the low cost of development  .
The SCWR requires the least to develop , compared with the other reactors .
This is due to the SCWR being developed from existing technologies , and some of its core components can be recycled .
In addition , the coolant , water , used by the SCWR is the cheapest among the chosen Generation IV reactors .
The SCWR also creates hydrogen , which can be sold to the hydrogen economy , resulting in the reduction of operating costs  .
Opponents of the SCWR would argue that water is a precious resource , and the amount of clean water available is decreasing .
This problem can be solved by using other methods to generate the water needed for the coolant .
One of the methods available to date is the distillation of sea water .
As the Earth is made up of mostly water , there will be enough water to be used for the coolant of the SCWR .
Therefore , with the low cost needed to develop and run the SCWR , it will be an apt choice for more funding and development .
People who favor other reactors may argue that the SCWR's performance may not match with other reactors .
However , in terms of performance , the SCWR can match the thermal efficiency of the other reactors  .
The thermal efficiency of the SCWR is 45% , an improvement from the 33% of the light water reactors  , which the SCWR is developed from .
This thermal efficiency can match up to that of the Very-High-Temperature Reactor  , which has an estimated thermal efficiency of 50% .
The VHTR has the highest thermal efficiency among the generation IV concepts  .
The VHTR runs at a temperature of 1000 degree Celsius , which is twice the temperature of the SCWR , which meant higher risks of a reactor meltdown  .
Therefore , with lower risks and a thermal efficiency that can match the other reactors , the SCWR is clearly a more superior choice , compared with the other Generation IV reactors .
Research and development has to be done before any of the Generation IV reactors can be implemented  .
In terms of the research needed , the SCWR has the least amount of research needed .
The only areas that require more research are mainly security and safety  , which mainly require new materials that can withstand high temperature and also radiation at the same time .
Materials that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures are also required  .
To date , several suitable materials have been identified .
Materials such as ferritic-martensitic steels and lowswelling austenitic steels for parts exposed to high neutron doses , high-strength austenitic steels and nickel-based alloys parts exposed to low neutron doses were some of the materials indentified .
These materials are currently being tested for their suitability  .
As for security , all reactors have to address the same problem of preventing terrorist attacks and sabotages .
Therefore , without any other major problems , the SCWR is the more logical choice to place more emphasis on .
The SCWR is clearly the reactor to receive more funding , as it requires the least cost and research to be developed .
In addition , the SCWR is one of the two reactors that does not reprocess plutonium waste  .
This further supports the case of more funding for the SCWR .
In conclusion , the SCWR should receive more funding , as it is the most promising concept out of the six chosen concepts .
Generation IV nuclear reactor Very high Temperature Reactor versus Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor
The rapid decrease in the amount of fossil fuels is leading to development of alternative energy sources .
Nuclear power is one of the frontier alternative power technologies that people have huge interest in .
However , converting nuclear power into usable energy is not a simple process .
Unfortunately , the development is not aided by nuclear disasters , such as Chernobyl disaster in 1986 , Three Mile Island disaster in 1979 , which are two of the most serious accidents happened in nuclear power plants .

The current nuclear power plants use generation II reactor , for example , Pressurized Water Reactors , boiling water reactors .
However , the efficiency , security , economic and sustainability of generation II nuclear reactor are not up to the mark .
New nuclear technology definitely needed to be developed to achieve a broader application in power industry .
As a result , generation IV international forum  , initiated in 2000 , is currently developing six new nuclear technologies for deployment between 2020 and 2030 .
We will discuss two out of the six new nuclear technologies-Very High Temperature Reactor  and Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor  .
Then we will decide which one will better meet the energy demand of the future .
VHPR is a good reactor for utilization in the future .
It offers the potential for the cogeneration of electricity and hydrogen , alongside process heat .
Moreover , VHPR is expected to achieve an even higher efficiency than SFR due to its higher operating temperature .
However , after considering sustainability and practicality factors , SFR is better .
It is proven scientifically that hydrogen could be generated in the VHPR system .
However , it is not important , as no research have proven that the method of generating hydrogen can achieve a higher efficiency compared with generating electricity .
Besides , from a practical point of view , electricity is more widely used than hydrogen .
Most of the devices and appliances we are using today use electricity as a source of energy .
There is a rather mature and secure electricity transit and selling system in the world , while hydrogen transit is still a problem waiting to be solved .
Nuclear power is a good substitution of fossil fuel .
The utilization of nuclear power is going to change the world and people's way of living much in the future .
At present , it is necessary for people to decide out of the six new nuclear technologies which one is of the highest value to our power needs .
It is reasonable to choose Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor instead of Very High Temperature Reactor since SFR has a narrower technology gap , safer and more environmentally friendly , can achieve a high efficiency rate and has the potential to be developed to reach a higher efficiency level beyond the hypothesis .

The first nuclear reactor was invented by Dr Fermi in 1934  .It produced plutonium for the world's first atomic bomb  .
The bomb , dropped in Japan during the World War II , killed more than 200 ,000 people .
In 1986 , the worst nuclear accident in history broke out in Chernobyl .
The meltdown of the nuclear plant caused 30 immediate deaths along with 100 ,000 cases of fatal cancers in the years that follow  .
Seventy years into the nuclear age , we are being constantly reminded of its power and danger .
However , the world today has come to a crossroad where we might have to reconsider the role of nuclear power .
In many instances , nuclear power could be a solution to problems we are facing now .
For example , fossil fuel combustion which emits greenhouse gases can be substituted with nuclear power to produce electricity .
Nevertheless , with the high cost and the inadequately safe nuclear technology that we are having now , convincing people to embrace nuclear power will not be possible without safer and cheaper technology .
Out of the various fourth generation nuclear reactors currently in research , the Very High Temperature Reactor , also known as the VHTR is one of the most promising ones .
Conventional nuclear reactors utilize heat produced from nuclear fission to boil water .
This water becomes steam and drives a turbine which produces electricity .
The VHTR on the other hand , utilizes the heat to boil helium , an inert gas , which drive the turbine directly .
This brings up the efficiency of the reactor by as much as 50 percent  .
Besides efficiency , VHTR also shows its potential in two other aspects .
The first aspect is in its inherent safety design .
In conventional nuclear reactors , the radioactive fission products remain in the reactor core .
In the event of an explosion , these products will dissipate into the surrounding .
The VHTR however , is designed such that the fission products are trapped inside the fuel particles .
These fuel particles , coated with layers of uranium oxycarbide , have the ability to absorb the radioactivity and withstand a temperature of 2000c , way above the working temperature of 1600c  .
People may be concerned that the high temperature of VHTR can trigger an explosion .
However , the worry is unnecessary because the VHTR is able to shut down itself in a situation of abnormal high temperature .
When above normal working temperature is reached , the VHTR reactor is able to catch the highly accelerated neutrons and stop the chain fission reactions completely , thereby shutting down the whole system .
This is evidenced by the test carried out on one of the VHTR prototype , HTR-10 in 2004 .
The helium coolant was cut off from the system and the reactor was able to shut down automatically without leakage of any radioactive particles  .
The second aspect lies in its economics .
Most people are aware that building a nuclear plant is expensive .
According to a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  on cost of nuclear power , the overnight cost  of building a nuclear plant is US$4000 / kwh  .
A coal-fuelled plant of the same scale only cost US$1300/ kwh .
While its initial cost is high , VHTR makes up for its efficiency and versatility .
Besides electricity , VHTR also produces heat and hydrogen which can be harnessed for other industrial applications .
For example , heat can be used for petrochemical reprocessing while hydrogen can be used as fuel in fuel cell plant to produce even more electricity .
Hence VHTR is actually more profitable to operate as electricity , heat and hydrogen can be obtained altogether .
Besides , the non monetary economics should be considered at the same time .
Traditional coal-fuelled power plants produce 20% of the world's emissions of greenhouse gases  while VHTR does not produce any of such gases .
The environmental damage done , though not measurable in dollars and cents , should also be taken into account as the cost .
In this context , VHTR is much cheaper than coal-fuelled plants .
To conclude , VHTR is not only safe , but it is also more efficient than existing reactors .
With further research , it is possible that the cost of VHTR can be lowered further and will appeal as a better alternative to existing nuclear systems .
Nobody expected it .
In less than a minute , a six-storey building was reduced to a pile of rubbles .
This was one of the deadliest Singapore's civil accidents , known as the Hotel New World collapse which happened on 15 March 1986 and according to the Singapore Civil Defence Force  , this misfortune took away the lives of 33 .
An article on Hotel New World collapse , Tan  claimed that investigations showed the collapse was due to under design made by the engineers , shoddy workmanship and cost cutting made by the contractors  .
In this example of Hotel New World collapse , National Geographic  also showed that warning signs of structure integrity failure surfaced 16 hours well before the collapse  .
There are some special scenarios where no amount of logical preventive measures could prevent accidents from happening , but as far as this study is concern , the devastating loss of human life and the collapse of Hotel New World could have all been avoided with the use of psychology during the design process , eliminating the errors done by humans in the design and maintenance phase .
Nuclear energy was once regarded as a major future energy source which would provide cheap and clean energy .
Even though it gained popularity in the 1970s , the partial meltdown of the nuclear power plant's core on Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl explosion in 1986 had a serious taint on the popularity of the use of Nuclear energy as an energy source .
Chernobyl explosion caused less than 60 radiation-related death and required resettlement of over 336 ,000 people .
Although more serious incident is yet to occur , people are increasingly concerned about the potential hazardous threat posed by the nuclear plants .
Nuclear reactors produce harmful or even deadly radiation while radioactive nuclear wastes are extremely difficult to handle and may even explode with no warning .
Nuclear reactors also produce plutonium as a by-product which can be used in the nuclear weapons .
It raises a global concern that terrorists or aggressive countries may have easier access to the nuclear weapons and may threaten the world peace .
Also , nuclear reactors are operational only for around fifty years , requiring regular costly replacements

An innovative concept of a sodium-cooled reactor to pursue high economic competitiveness .
cat .inist .fr/ ?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13964683
However , with increasing demands for energy due to industrialization and the rising price of oil and fossil fuels , nuclear energy remains as an important source of energy despite all the controversies .
Currently , there are mainly six different types of reactors .
Among them , very-high- temperature reactor  and sodium-cooled fast reactor  are considered the two most advanced and reliable systems .
The VHTR has an open fuel cycle and can supply electricity , hydrogen and heat at a highly efficient level .
The core reactor is connected to an intermediate heat exchanger to process heat and is able to output the temperature up to 1000 degree Celsius with more than 50% efficiency  .
On the other hand , the SFR has a closed loop fuel cycle and is designed to reduce wastes .
It demands less space of repositories as it recovers and recycles 99 .9% of the actinides and has the thermal efficiency of about 40%  .
With regards to safety , the VHTR has certain desirable safety measures under both normal and extreme conditions .
However , the need to operate the VHTR above 1000 degree Celsius puts the limitations on the effectiveness of the safety measurement .
For the SFR system , safety measures consist of a long thermal response time , a huge margin to coolant boiling and a main mechanism that works near atmospheric pressure .
However , sodium reacts chemically with air or water and is a major safety drawback .
Nevertheless , with some innovations , a buffer can be introduced to prevent water vapor from reaching the radioactive sodium in the primary system .
Also , the SFR offers other safety measures such as automatic shutdown function and cooling function in case of accidents  .
The cost of a reactor varies with various factors .
For the VHTR , the cost is mainly associated with the heat exchanger size and the installation expenses which usually total to about US$781 .5 millions .
For the SFR , the cost can be reduced considerably by using some innovative methods to make a modular design or to remove a primary loop or to integrate the pump and the heat exchanger .
Although the cost of building a nuclear reactor is great and there are concerns about safety , there are several advantages of using nuclear energy as an energy source .
The small size of the nuclear power plants allows them to be integrated in the already developed regions and makes the long- distance power transfer unnecessary .
Also , the nuclear energy does not produce pollution directly into the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases .
Moreover , a large amount of energy can be produced in the nuclear power plants within a relatively short period of time .
The use of nuclear energy is also advantageous in a sense that it will never run out while oils reserves and fossil fuels are likely to be used up at some time .
With more research and investments in the nuclear technology , the SFR can become a viable energy source in the future .
The safety measures can be improved and the hazardous by-products can be reduced with the advancement of technology .
With the rising demand for energy and the increasingly visible harmful effects of the use of oil and fossil fuels to the environment , the nuclear energy offers an alternative and is regaining some of its popularity and early successes of 1970s .

On 20 April 2004 , the contractors and workers were having their usual tea break when they heard a loud thud from the structure that they were working on for the past few months .
The retaining wall of the tunnel for the Mass Rapid Transit  Circle Line at Nicoll Highway had collapsed  .
Four men were immediately killed .
.The Nicoll Highway that links Kallang to Central Business District has collapsed . . Now , it was damaged as a result of the collapse of the tunnel construction for the circle line .
The collapse of the Nicoll Highway was a controversial issue where everyone has his or her own views .
Could the use of psychology have prevented the accident ?
There were views from engineers as well as the parties involved , saying that the collapse was not due to mistake in design as they followed the code of practice in their design and the safest bottom- up construction method were used .
There were no occupational hazard influenced by the decisiveness and attitude of the project managers .
The parties involved take pride in their work .
In my opinion , I felt that the collapse was due to mistake in the design , the lack of integrity as portrayed by the parties involved and the management team was not decisive about the situation .
Indecisiveness and negligence of the management team , design mistake and lacking in integrity are three factors of psychology which I felt were lacking in the design process which had resulted in the engineering accident .
The Land Transport Authority were decisive throughout the whole project as they shored up the surrounding ground to prevent further collapse of the repair work .
If they were indecisive , they would not be able to decide what were the steps to be taken to prevent further collapse .
However , there were evidence showing that the management teams had neglected their roles .
The management teams failed to provide adequate instrumentation and monitoring works , lack of competenet personnel to carry out specified works , failed to identify adverse trends and implement corrective work  .
The management team did not make the right decision about the situation .
There were signs of structure failing but they were ignored .
.
The above evidence showed that there were human errors such as the negligence of the responsibilities from the management team which had resulted in the collapse of Nicoll Highway .
The parties involved in the construction of the Nicoll Highway were carefully selected and one of them was the Land Transport Authority  .
Since it is under severe guidance by the government , there should not be any problems involving integrity or dishonesty .
However , there was evidence showing that there was dishonesty and lacking in integrity in the party involved .
From the book on Nicoll Highway Collapse , extracted from New Civil Engineer  , Nishimatsu-Lum Chang  being the party involved in the project , was negligent , reckless and dishonest during design and construction of the retaining wall .
He cut costs by using scrap material as a replacement of stiffener plates as stated by Shanmugan  .
If the parties involved had integrity and knew that by cutting costs would result in many casualties , the engineering accident would have been prevented .
It was due to the parties lacking in integrity , which was one of the psychological factor that they failed to portray , had resulted in the collapse .
In conclusion , the use of psychology could have prevented the accident if they were careful about the design and make sure that it was not under-designed as in the case of the Nicoll Highway .
It was due to the carelessness and negligence of the management team that have caused the accident .
If there were no cutting of costs in this case , the structure wouldn't have collapsed .
In many cases , structures failed due to the dishonesty of the parties involved in the construction process , not just Nicoll Highway but also the collapse of the Hotel New World .
Therefore , I felt that the use of psychology could have prevented the accident .
Using nuclear energy can decrease the emission of natural gas , generate large amount of energy to meet future need and has more potential advantages in the future .
The disadvantages of nuclear power energy can be further reduced by research and development in nuclear technology .
In addition , we should prepare for helium-3 isotopes by developing better nuclear technology .
Since developing higher technology can reduce its disadvantages and increase its benefit , we should develop nuclear energy; hence we should support further research and development in nuclear energy .
The Britain's Road to 2010 strategy states that nuclear power , which generates low carbon electricity , is affordable , dependable and safe  .
Like Britain , many countries have considered nuclear power to be the best solution to foster electricity as well as the energy industry .
However , after two significant accidents , Three Mile Island and Chernobyl , most people are worried about the safety factor of nuclear reactor plans .
Therefore , Generation IV reactors are researched based on technological goals , especially nuclear safety .
Among these reactor designs , Supercritical-water-cooled reactor  is the most suitable concept for funding and developing due to its usage of advanced material , safety and economical design and high security .
People who oppose nuclear power plant think that SCWR is not safe enough because it has potentially hazardous requirements .
The SCWR operates at high temperature  and very high pressure .
As a result , it needs technological characteristics to prevent physical phenomena such as corrosion and stress  .
However , recent studies about materials show a lot of success in finding out a lot of materials that satisfy these requirements .
For example , INCOLOY alloy MA956 that "combines excellent strength fabric ability with outstanding resistance to prolonged exposure up to 1300 Celsius degree"  is one of the candidate materials .
Other promising material , 9Cr-1Mo-1V , can be used under corresponding maximum service temperature at 650 Celsius degree and has several characteristics for resistance to radiation .
Since the materials are guaranteed to rigorous safety standards , SCWR should be supported further research and development funding .
One point in favour of SCWR is that scientists plan to manufacture it with simple and economical design .
Some people still doubt the safety of SCWR's design; in their opinion , a simple design may lack specifications that cause unexpected accidents .
In fact , on the contrary , the balance of SCWR plant design utilizes a relatively simple direct cycle power conversion system , which also allows for the incorporation of passive safety features .
Moreover , compared to the Light-water reactor  , it provides a simplified , reduced volume system with higher thermal efficiency .
SCWR's efficiency is achieved about 45% while this one in advanced LWRs is 33%  , 2007) .
Another advantage of SCWR is very cost-effective because it involves only one cycle .
In addition , because of similarities in primary system design between the SCWR and LWRs , it is expected that some of the current LWRs technology will be applied in this area .
So the overall simple design of the SCWR will also cut down the construction cost .
Finally , while it's true to say that reprocessing nuclear waste is still controversial , the general characteristics of the SCWR make it an attractive candidate for addressing Generation IV safety goals against terrorism .
The attack on September 11 in 2001 has provided a wake-up call for facing the threat of nuclear terrorism .
Freely circulating plutonium in the global market is really a huge threat to countries around the world , especially the US .
According to Li  , the Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator in Cabot House , the United States Congress has decided to use 555 billion USD in formation of an "international fuel nuclear bank"  to prepare for the safe reprocessing .
Furthermore , improved technology used in the SCWR "allows plant operators to shut down the reaction completely at the slightest sign of trouble"  , said Li .
That means human intervention will be reduced to minimum to prevent potential terrorist attacks on nuclear reactors .
On the other hand , in his research , Butler  also reported that scientists of the SCWR would add more steps to lengthen the stored time of long-lived waste , especially plutonium , the "key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons"  .
Taking everything into account , because of its achievement in research in advanced materials , effective design and security , the SCWR should be so highly appreciated to pursue the GEN-IV goals that it can be continuously developed and funded .
Jacopo  argues that electricity generated by SCWR may cost 2 .9 cents per Kilowatt hour , much lower than the recent electricity rate .
So if successfully improved and deployed , the SCWR reactor would effectively generate low-cost electricity .
Our natural resources are rapidly consumed to supply energy for the society .
This exploitation of natural resources will result in a shortage of energy in the next few decades .
Therefore , the search for a quick and powerful new source of energy is urgent and vital .
One of the most promising technologies available today is nuclear energy .
Although the construction of new nuclear power plants is strictly restricted , a new concept for the next generation of nuclear power plants have been announced .
This concept , known as Very-High-Temperature-Reactor  , is capable of improving our energy supply , clearing all doubts about the efficiency and safety of nuclear power .
Firstly , although the efficiency of nuclear power has been proven by older models , the new VHTR promises an even more effective production .
Despite critics about its safety , over the past decades , while still undergoing many restrictions , a small number of nuclear plants alone located in North America and Europe provide 15% of global total power .
Some countries such as France rely solely on nuclear power for 80% of its nation's energy supply  .
This shows how powerful nuclear energy was in the past .
Today , with the upcoming VHTR technology , the amount of electricity produced will be increased by 50%  .
With the prediction about the US's shortage of fuel by 2025 and VHTR expected delivery by 2020  , if this new generation of reactors receive enough funding , it would be available at the right time to ease the lack-of-fuel crisis .
The second advantage of VHTR is that it does not only produce electricity but at the same time create hydrogen fuel as well  .
The concept of hydrogen fuel is not new and its efficiency is of course nothing to be doubted .
Being the lightest element of all , Hydrogen is capable of producing the highest ratio of energy-to-mass ratio  .
The public may argue that the conversion from petroleum- fuelled to hydrogen-fuelled would be very complicated and costly .
However , the investment in hydrogen fuel will bring us more pros than cons .
The design for hydrogen vehicles is not similar to that of petroleum vehicles .
Car runs on hydrogen does not need heavy materials and much space for its fuel tank .
