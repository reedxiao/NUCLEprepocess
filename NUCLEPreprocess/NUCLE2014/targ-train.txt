Topic 1: "The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
publicorganizationsextentThe competitive e a main topic in public discussion .
Thus , due to the risk of misuse of surveillaadvancementsogy , I fully concur that the use of surveillance technology should be banned .
discontinuedofFirst and foremost , surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification  has been used as a tool for hackers and identity thieves to commit " 'contactless' "crime against victims municated to others' "  . , 1999) .
Hence , everyone has the right to protect their privacy .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it has been misused by people for illegal activities .
The misuse of surveillance technology not only invades user's privacy but also increases the risk of personal and national security .
There are many types of genetic testing , such as late-onset disorders and nepanies are not panies .

Applicants will be at a disadvantadiseases , which ng for insurance .
For example , if genetic results are revealed , the cost of the insurance will be expensive such that it may not be worth it .
Critics of this position claim that insurer will also be at a disadvantage if such results are not revealed to them .
.
I must admit that the insurer will be at a disadvantage if the situation is switched .
However , the cost of insurance should be on the current medical status of the applicant and should not be on the results of the genetic testing .

Use of Surveillance Technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
With rapid technological advancement , myriad forms of surveillance technology have surfaced and people are using it both intensively and extensively .
From forms as high level as satellite surveillance to the common Radio Frequency Identification Device  , surveillance technology has served us e more of detrimental than beneficial .
Inexploitation of privacy and upsetting the various balances isociety are concerns people are increasingly fort peoplupsetting oferiencing e relatively transparent .
On the intangible aspects , information of individuals can be easily retrieved es increasingly popular promised .
The tags are usually not "killed" and this allows consumers' movement to be tracked and habits to be observed .
This thorough understanding of consumers has certainly gone overboard .
Last but not least , biometric surveillance has given checkpoints the capability to monitor people down to the skin .
Evolved surveillance here is so revealing that people appear literally naked on screens .
Furthermore , surveillance technology has created many deviants and upsets in the balance of our society .
Society will see the rise of discriminations since the entire background of an individual can be easily traced .
Dates cancelled , different standards in pricing of insurance premiums and harassment of political dissidents are just a few to mention .
Next , surveillance technology also widens the gap between the rich and the poor .
The rich can afford to encrypt and protect their data while engaging in better sflagrantnce over the less well off .
Moreover , by selling iMoreover ,ation  , the rich will get richer .
With regards to RFID , usage mention earlier on will reduce the variety of products available in stores because retailers will only consider the better selling items .
Society will witness a smorgasbord of changes in the various balances and the birth of more deviants such as stalkers .
Therefore , with all the worrisome disadvantages of surveillance technology will bring , we ought to ban it .
It makes privacy lose its meaning and is unhealthy to our society .
Consequences will be disastrous if we do not put an end to it .

Thus , there is no fear of revealing the genetic results .
Inversely , individuals are responsible to inform employers about their genetic geneticsons so that a better and safer es up with fruitful conclusion .
The rapid development of medical technology has made it possible to diagnose disease inheritance or determine genetic disorders by using genetic testing .
Unfortunately , there is pro and con among the public about the disclosure of the result of genetic testing , e prise information about hereditary disease .

The past two decades have brought about huge technological advances in the areas of nano-engineering and information systems .
With the help of  modern technology , humans are able to create increasingly efficient devices which are able to store relevant personal information or to trace one's location .
The use of sophisticated personnel tracking devices has long been an ethical quagmire , with people holding polarizing views debating if  surveillance technology can be  allowed to track people .
; and to Proponents for the use of tracking devices on humans assert that patients can be easily identified in cases of emergency with their medical profiles easily accessible , since information is stored in a database that can be accessed via the internet  .
Administrative procedures are greatly reduced , and the patient's vital records , for example drug allergies areallergiesretrievable .
Patients will be able to receive immediate and proper medical attention , which in certain cases can be a matter of life and death .
Moreover , tracking devices are able to assist law enforcement personnel to monitor suspects closely  .
Unknowing crime suspects can be monitored closely by the police over a period of time .
This allows discovery of new evidences through observation of the suspects , to prove if one is innocent or guilty .
Some arguments brought forward by opponents states that tagged identities could be easily duplicated by identity thefts  .
This argument is flawed , as there is no concrete evidence showing existence of the existencees .
The argument also blatantly ignored the fact that there are additional measures being taken into preventitouch crimes .
Opponents also claim that government withe government to use such devices to monitor , instil fear , and ultimately control the users  .
This assertion is a fallacy , as it is based solely on foresight , and is cynical and biased .
In conclusion , tracking devices should be allowed in tracking people , as it is able to change human lives for the better , and it may even prevent or reduce crime rates .
Should the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people be banned ?
Nowadays , advances in technology have made tracking people no longer an uphill task .
Due to this , many surveillance technologies have been created in order to make the tracking job efficient .
A controversy on the benefits of the surveillance technology and the effects of the surveillance technology has been aroused .
Nonetheless , the use of it has brought along significant benefits and therefore it should not be banned .
There are two main benefits that the use of surveillance technology has brought  .
Firstly , it helps to tag "high-risk" patients  .
A microchip is implanted into the arm of patients who had heart diseases , diabetics or Alzheimer's disease .
For the Alzheimer's patients , it helps to track them in order to ensure their safety .
By using this technology , the location of the patient can be easily detect by a reader and immediate action can be taken if the patient is in risk .
This system really benefits the Alzheimer's patient who often lost due to are often lostading memories .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
It benefits not only the individual but the whole world .
Surveillance technology is being promise of one's privacy  .
Similarly , the United States has been criticized for promoting the use of human tracking technologies after the 9/11 event  , as it indicates the beginning of an Orwellian era as claimed by many privacy advocates  .
However , the unfounded argument is not adequate to outlaw the use of human tracking technology .
Jacques Ellul noted that "To be sure of apprehending criminals , it is necessary that everyone be supervised"  .
Safety of mankind is not worth being sacrificed just for the sake of their privacy .
A balance should be reached between the two extremes - the banning of human tracking technology and privacy being stripped away from innocent citizens .
, and the runthe tracking of criminalsthe lossIn conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned as it helps preventing terrorism and crimes .
Consequently , a verdict shouldplansreached between privacy advocates and law enforcement agenhaves as innbecause of izens have the rights to live in secured environment without facing erosion oto preventman rigcatastrophes , acy .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in panies or healthcare professionals to an individual's genetic information may cause invasion of privacy and discrimination .
Although medical personnel are entrusted mercialization and easy access to certain genetic testing may lead to compromising situations for members of the public  .
For instance , genetic information that falls into the hands of insurers and employers e , education , mental well-being , housing status , health , and medical treatment .
Racial discrimination still exists today in various parts of the world despite government efforts to eradicate it .
Who can say what will happen if a patient's genetic information falls into the wrong hands ?
Besides that , disclosure of genetic information to close relatives without informed consent may also cause internal family problems .
Often , prediction based on genetic information is uncertain , especially by those who are not well informed about the nature of a disease .
This misunderstanding not only creates unnecessary psychological , economic as well as social burdens on the carrier of a known genetic risk , family ties will also be affected .
A couple with a positively tested disease has to sacrifice their dream of having children as they do not wish to pass on their defective genes to their offspring .
As such , the couple suffers in silence , having to face social stigma and having their dreams of building their family shattered .
Moreover , the in-laws , usually the more traditional type , may be dissatisfied with the daughter-in-law not being able to produce a 'perfect' offspring , or produce any offspring at all , to sustain the future generation of a family .
In conclusion , the patient of genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Until proper steps such as enactment and reinforcement of laws are taken by the governments , genetic information of individuals should be kept private and confidential to avoid exploitation by unscrupulous parties and also to avoid disintegration of family relations .
The release of genetic information of a patient has wide and lifelong implications on his or her life , and thereforethe consent of individualsital decision should be made after careful thought .

"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
In modern times , there is an increase in the types of threat that can affect a nation's security .

Hopared to its downside .
The main critic of usdoes surveillan .eStechnology is the invasion of privacy , this is unavoidable as to safe guard a place , people or nation there are some sacrifices that need to be made .
As seen in the argument the three different areas namely national , disaster and personal security , surveillance technology should not be banned but rather to always to be improvised and improved upon .
Motion: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in e more available to the public .
An individual can request and afford to undergo genetic testing to find out panies for fear of discrimination from them  .
However , by doing so , he is actually putting his family at risk as they will not know whether they too carry the defective gene which would put them at a higher risk of developing the disease associated with the gene  .
Furthermore , the physician would not be able to determine if the defective gene is hereditary and whether the other family members have that gene or not .
Secondly , for his own reasons , such as family disputes , the individual may choose not to act responsibly and withhold the results from family members .
In such cases , the physician would have the right to reveal the results to tare family of the individual , especially if the test results indicate that the defective gene is present , there is the possibility that others in the family has the gene as well .
Also , with regards to the problem of discrimination , which is the underlying factor for the individual not wanting to reveal the results , there are laws in place in many countries that states that it is against the law to discriminate against people who have tested positive for a particular defective gene .
The physicians also have their medical code of conduct that states information about the patient is confidential unless it poses threat to others  .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say as to whether the results should be revealed or not as the benefits of revealing the results is substantial to the individual and his family , and it cannot be assumed that the individual will be able to act responsibly to his family in the face of his own interests .

Using RFID to track people raises many issues .
Firstly , the abuse of RFID invades privacy .
It is hard to guarantee that every tracking is innocent and conducted in proper ways and .
For example , overzealous employers and criminally intent people could take advantage of the RFID readers to track employees and victims' movement  .
In this case , victims may lose their privacy even without awareness .
Secondly , because a RFID embedded card is easily tcan easily m and cloned , to some extent , it is a loophole for identity theft .
Using the cby using card , anyone could pass into a restricted area through the secure and locked entrance  .
Hence , using RFID equipped card to ta RFID and control entrance is not secure and effective at all .
Thirdly , implantable RFID chips have connections with health issues .
Research showed that "implanted RFID chips caused cancer in mice and rats and may cause cancer in cats , dogs , and humans"  .
Additionally , "although an RFID chip in particular may not cause cancer , the inflammation caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object can increase the instance of tumor development"  .
According to these , there is no way to sacrifsacrificing the health of people when conducting tracking is therefore unacceptable
However , RFID advocators may argue for the purpose of alleviating the fear of privacy invasion .
For instance , the reader needs to be within about ten feet of the chip in order to extract data , so it may not handle long-range tracking  .
However , it is still highly undetectable if the reader is installed inside doors or walls .
Furthermore , within such distance , RFID readers could still function  .
Hence , people are still under the risk of being tracked and losing privacy without knowledge .
To conclude , since using RFID to track people raises the possibilities of privacy invasion and identity theft and causes health problems , the use of it should be banned .
Genetic testing is a test pany more money than the company had bargained for  Moreover , employers pany's productivity , such as , costing the company more money on the employees' frequent sick leaves and medical reimbursements  .
In addition , the person munity due to the community lacking the knoes to prehensive protection to all people at risk forshouldtic discrimination .
Tera Eerkes , founder of personal genetic testing companyhas thetes that 'this measure does not prevent genetic discrimination against people panies will be forced to hike up the cost of their premiums and might result in healthy individuals being quoted the same rate as the genetic risk group  .
Thirdly , the individual should not be denied of his rights in the decision on whether the result should consented or not , or else , problems might occur .
The European Convention on Human Rights states that "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and fhis homorrespondence ."
.
If an individual is denied of his right to decide on the disclosure of his test result , probably no one will dare to go for testing since they know that they do not possess the right to decide whether the result stays secret .
This will result in2005; there will not be proper family planning since genetic disorder is not taken into consideration , which might results in continued breeding of undesirable genetic traits off-springs .
In conclusion , the person who went for genetic testing should have the final say on whether to reveal the genetic testing result so that he will not be discriminated against or even denied of his basic human rights and causes problems
Arguments put forth to ban RFID are faulty .
For instance , it has been argued that the excessive use of RFID tags result in deterioration of personal privacy .
.
However , for the group of people who requires constant attention , safety outweighs privacy issues .
Furthermore , RFID tags can be snapped in half to prevent the transmission of data when it is no longer in use .
Thus , this will not threaten individual's privacy .
Finally , there has been greater concern about RFID not only tracking the data of the patient , but also the patient's actual whereabouts .
.
On the contrary , this is a minor issue as only those with access to hospital's database can interprin forthe information .
Otherwise , this information is purposeless .
tracking theIn conclusion , RFID should not be banned as it not only saves time and effort but also ensures one's protection from harm under close surveillance .
thantrackordecreasingandterrorists ,Advances in technology have made mass surveillance possible , even to track humans .
Hopletely vulnerable .
It is against the lamit crimes more easily than ever with technology that is so readily available and surprisingly inexpensive .
Another argument to oppose the use of RFID to track people is the possibility of contracting cancer with the implantation of the chips .
"Research in the 1990s showed that implanted RFID chips caused cancer in rats and may cause cancer in humans"  .
Though rats are more likelprevent itvelop tumors regardless of the type of injection , "inflammation caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object still does increase the insanother personsf tumor development"  .
Therefore , for the sole purpose of tracking , this sacrifice is not needed .
In conclusion , the banning of the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people would be essential to protect vulnerable civilians from security and health threats .

With the advance of technology , surveillance technology has become prevalent in the society .
Radio Frequency Identification  as one type of surveillance technology is used as a tool to track people .
Although concerns on privacy issues are raised , RFID benefits the society by ensuring safety among people .
Hence , since RFID brings about positive benefits , it should not be banned .
One area which benefits greatly from RFID technology is the health sector .
Firstly , due to RFID , the safety and security of the patients are ensured .
RFID is used to track patients' locations in order to make sure they are safe .
This is especially true for elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease .
Patients suffering from Alzheimer's have the tendency to wander .
Hence , RFID will be able to lookout for these patients and ensure they do not go missing , making them safe  .
Also , RFID technology can prevent newborns from being kidnapped .
With RFID , the locations of newborns can be monitored .
Thus , if there are to be unauthorized movements , immediate action can be taken  .
With the newborns' safety being ensured , their parents will not have to worry constantly when they are not able to take care of their infants around the clock .
Thus , RFID technology is able to protect the patients and ensure a safe and secure environment in hospitals .
Proponents for banning of surveillance technology in particular RFID argue that the privacy of people is invaded as people's specific locations can be identified  .
If there are standard laws put in place , so that information from RFID tags can only be obtained by authorized people , then , there should not be privacy concerns due to RFID  .
The user can choose whether or not to give out his or her information , as an RFID tag can be broken into two so that information will not be transferred  .
Since , privacy concerns are not much of an issue , RFID should not be banned .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology particularly RFID should not be banned as it results in a safe environment and the privacy concerns regarding it are not much an issue .
The completion of Human Genome Project has contributed significantly to the rapid development of genetic tests , a valuable tool that aids in diagnosis and prevention of genetic diseases .
Hopelled to peting obligations met by physicians , the genetic care and counselling organisations have devised guidelines which accept disclosure to relatives without the consent of those tested when there is going to be a high degree and immediacy of risk faced by them  .
facedIt has been argued that genetic discrimination will ariseto makeontext of insurance and employment if the decision is not made by those who are tested .
However , there has been limited evidence of genetic discrimination in both areas of insurance and woconfidentiality of results research .
Moreover , a policy statement by Insurance and Financial Services Association  in Australia have made it mandatory thatnetic testinwill not be considered a requirement for policy risk assessment .
The statement also claims that the insurance industry will not utilise the genetic information of ont oConsideringmr  .
In conclusion , individuals requesting for genetic testing should not be given the full authority to make the final decisions in results disclosure as it coerces doctors from fulfilling their duties in promoting the wellbeing of the society .
Modern advances in genetic research have helped scientists and doctors learn more about genes and homend several other alternatives if the patient is insistent on withholding the test results . 
need ,resultIn conclusion , the medical professionals are able to appropriately handle the delicate issues of genetic testing .
Hence , they should have the right in whether or not to reveal the results of genetic testing .

Surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification  makes use of technical means to track individuals .
This has brought about many controversial issues on theregardingrivacy and health concerns surrounding the use of RFID .
While some argue that the adoption of RFID is a violation of human'humancy , it is indd helps to protect the safety of familyfamiliesu ,the publicdentito identifynts .
Hence , the use of RFID should not be banned due to the uses it brings about .
Human genetics has made tremendous leaps over the past years , and consequently made a significant impact on many people's lives .
As such , the growth of genetic testing technology has initiated considerable debate over the privacy and confidentiality of genetic information .
In any case , it can be advocated that the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing or not .
This is due to the legislation polices that have been implemented for genetic testing 
Firstly , genetic information is not like any other medical information .
Basically , it is far more confidential as it may contain more  individual personal health issues  such as determining whether one carries any defective genes .
Hence , it is rightful to say that genetic information should be kept confidential and should only be revealed by the individual .
In accordance with federal law inthe United States  ,  medical information should be kept confidential and genetic professionals or doctors do not have the right to disclose any information without seeking the consent of the patient .
Though , they may assist  patients by informing them of the likelihood of their relatives contracting the same diseases , the final decision ultimately still depends on the individual .
On the other hand , critics may argue that genetic professionals can interpret the genetic testing results more accurately than  patients .
Thus , they can explain the implications of the results more precisely to  family members .
However , only  patients will understand their family members' different behavioural patterns .
This means that they are more suited to revealing the results by using a more desirable method .
As a result , they may help reduce the psychological stress on family members .
In conclusion , the decision of whether revealing the results of genetic testing should lie only with the individual and not other third parties involved .
Any disclosure of results by third parties will be considered a breach of the genetic privacy and confidentiality law and may cause unnecessary moral implications .
The advancement of Science and Technology has lead to many possibilities , one of which is the ability to predict one's risk of contracting certain diseases , mostly hereditary , via the study of one's genes .
Called genetics testing , the test results , though not definitive , are highly accurate .
Hence this predictive power leads to one of the many controversies- should an individual have the final say in whether to reveal his/her results ?
Because the results could potentially be used to save lives , yet at the same time be misused , the individual requesting the test should not have the final say .
In fact , this authority should go to  medical professionals; basically physicians undertaking the proceedings of the test and  interacting with the patients firsthand .
Genetic testing is an issue that mankind has placed great emphasis on .
After test results are analyzed by physicians , there is a dilema about whether the information should be made knopanies  .
Hopaor whether itshould be have the rights to request genetic information from their employees or clients ectly , or indirectly from medical professionals who has a better intrpretation of the genetic test resulsurface
resultsasIn conclusion , although on the surface there seems to be disturbing issues in sharing genetic information , but when observed in depth , the information when sharedrefused more of an advantage to the individual as well as those around him .
Eventually , the stand that test results should be made known to others by the medical professionals should hold .
The use of the technology such as radio frequency identification  in tracking people has been heatedly discussed recently due to privacy and security concerns .
Nevertheless , these concerns are outmitting crimes again .
Thirdly , RFID helps to identify patients .
A RFtheete medical hthe public can be implanted to enable treatments by doctors according to their conditions .
Furthermore , RFID tags help to prevent paring to other munications and broadcasting .
Moreover , World Health Organization's research also shows that under certain limits , electromagnetic magnetic field from RFID will not incur any negative health effects  .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFIDIn the case of used to track people due to its advantages in ensuring the safety of loved ones , public and also identification of patients .

That there should be a limit on public spending on the aged so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development  is a suggestion that should be implemented in order to combat the rising cost of healthcare for the elderly .

Children should be taught the importance of filial piety since young to ensure that they do not abandon all of their responsibility of taking care of their parents pel children to support theneedsarents if the children are capable and the parents are in need .
An example would be the Maintenance of Pareexplainin Singapore , where parents could lawfully demand support from their child in court .
suffer fromondecidea biggerIn conclusion , there are many reasons on why and how public spending on elderly healthcare should be limited to allow government to channel the money to other areas of development .
While healthcare for the elderly is still important , however governments must ensure that other important areas will not get neglected as well .
Ageing population is a serious problem faced by many developed states .
It is mainly caused by the increased number of elderly and the drop in birth rate .
The ageing population is creating many social problems such as healthcare problems , high government expenses and high income taxes , e e do notcausing stress foreal care account e ineffective in easing the ageing process .
Many states have introduced housing policies , which allow the young couples to live near their parents  and introducingg priority the elderlyhasing house to those people who have married .
This allows the couples to take care each other especially when they are old , or to take care their parents when they are limitationsg .
However , the states fail to realize that people's value towards family is changing today .
The famlimitationsg in mostproblemsn society is very weak and the young generation does not really have a sense of filial piety in their head .
Also , the stressful working market created by capitalism today is taking away too much time and effort from people so that they cannot spend them with their family , or even cannot think of having a family .
It creates modern value that allows people of opposite sex to live together without having a family .
So , what if people do not get married ?
What if the idea of family is vanished ?
What if the young no longer care about their parents ?
If all these assumptions occurred , the housing policy therefore will not be relevant at all .
Hence , besides housing policies , the governments should also raise the awareness of having strong family bonding .

Therefore , government and policy makers have to put more effort to ease the aging process as the elderly are still experiencing inadequate protection .
One of the major concerns of Singapore is its increasing aging population .
Today the median age in Singapore is 36 years .
By the year 2050 , our median age e for the elderly .This is done e from the agehas65 for life .CPF is a mandatory saving scheme and therefore it ensures that the elderly pared to just increasing the official retirement age .
By encouraging re- employment , the government is assisting the elderly to lead an active and productive life .
Life-long employability also helps the elderly to accumulate more pared to the elderly .
To tackle this issue the government have introduced the Workfare Income Supplement e tax and it is ing years , the government have introduced the 3M that es severely disabled , they can get a monthly cash payout .
To ensure that every elderly gets medical attention , the government have built nemodate more patients .

Ageing is an inevitable part of life and it is often not easy at all to deal ing more accommodating for the elderly .
Indeed , developments like companies becoming moreitsldemographicse older panies hiring more numbers of older ing dated .
In Singapore , seventy-five percent of unionized companies have committed to rehiring older panies already have in place formal re-hiring procedures in addition to ad-hoc arrangements that are commonly made .
.
More unionized firms to re-hire older e is noe serious enough to be highlighted in Singapore's National Day Rally .
These two policies are some of the ways that governments are looking into to help the elderly have a better and easier life during their twilight years .

The issues of age challenge the e up petition , Singaporeans nopanying l ,f- time commitment of raising a child .
Therefore , du) , clearly reflectingi- faceted challenges to the whole of society .
The government should first understand and address the changing mindset and values of today's society towards problems created by the fast aging population before implementing the policies .
Merely depending on legislation will not help to improve the attitudes of the society towards the elderly significantly .
Instead , this willdevelopment further resentment and result in a strain of relationship between the young and the old .
In all , moving beyond law to enhance the perceptions of elderly is a more practical way to increase the ability and willingness of the society to coordinate with the government in tackling the "grey tsunami" .
governmentWith the gropromises the economic development of the country .
Suppose a country prise of over 130% of Gross Domestic Product  ever since mid 1980s .
The main products being export out of Singapore are integrated circuits , computer parts and accessories .
Since export plays a significant role in contributing to the GDP of Singapore , a vast amount of finance should be diverted to R&D .
Therefore , by providing education and investment into R&D help generate capital for the country .
Economic growth leads to an increase in standard of living which benefits the whole society including the aged .
A budget should be set for the public spending on the aged .
In fact , the governments should adopt and develop appropriate systems and programs customized with respect to their cultural , economic and social context .
Furthermore , it is beneficial for governments to exchange pointers and assist one another in coping with the effects of greying population .
This help to ensure that majority will age with security .
Keeping the aged in mind , we must never neglect the future generations since they will be the ones who will support the nation .
Therefore , we should first cater the needs of the younger ones .
Public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas that are of equal , or even greater , importance .
A substantial amount is spent on the elderly annually , and this sum of money can be put to other uses .
Maintaining and sustaining a country is not just about looking after the aged , but also about developing gropared to younger workers .
Therefore , there should be some government intervention with regards to employment of the e this will assist them in securing a place in the workforce .
Not only does it benefits the government as spending on the aged can be reduced , it also benefits them both economically and socially .
Longer working years will allow the elderly to accumulate more wealth for future use in times of need .
With this accumulated wealth , they will then be able to meet their basic needs and be less dependent on the government when they retire from the workforce .
Furthermore , working can help to decrease boredom in retirement , as time will then be spent engaging in productive activities at work , and not whiled away doing nothing .
These benefits of longer working lifespan can be made possible if employers are willing to hire the aged , who can then be self-sufficient with minimum , or no , help from the government .
The benefits of limiting public spending on the elderly is seen when , one amount of money can be channeled to other areas of our country's development .
One such area is defense , which is exceptionally important to an island country like ours .
We have to be prepared against terrorishave broughtxternal attacks by ,other countries , at all times .
Apart from defense , the government needs to invest in out country's development as well , and this includes improvements in our education system .
This will then ensure that our future generations will learn more and benefit from it , and it is of great importance as they are the future pillars of our society , who will lead our country to greater heights in order to be a successful and progressive nation .
not bebenefitThere are clearly many areas that the government has to spend on annually , and the graying population is one of it .
However , other areas should not be neglected , as our nation's growth and development is of vital importance as well .
Many ways are , indeed , present to help limit public spending on the age .
It will be made possible if these are strongly enforced , and high cooperation among citizens of our society will help to deal with this issue too .
so thataanIt is e a burden to their families as an example .
In that case , if the fiscal costs on the aged are cut doe to their hands .
Living in poverty , the younger generations groe old .
And sadly , the circle of poverty goes on .

One of these considerations for couples is the need to strike a balance betpared to an elderly as they can contribute to the company for a longer period of time .
Some might disagree that even though they cannot compete with the younger generation for problems , the government does organize job fairs to help elderly seek jobs .
However , although these job fairs providlongrking opportunities for the elderly , the success of such job fairs is largely dependent on the receptiveness of the elderly's expectations to the new job scope .
Furthermore , there should be a maximuofcap to the increment on retirement age as we also need to consider the physical capabilities of the elderly .
All these obstacles show that raising retirement age does not address well to the concerns of an elderly .

No matter how well a social policy is constructed , there is still loopholes that are often neglected by policy-makers .
This shows that much more can be done to improve the different kinds of policies .
Furthermore , it is important to note that social policies should be flexible so that they can make suitable changes to meet the demands of the society at have been points of time .

Due to poor fertility rates and late marriages , the government is noe .
Although forking out a lump sum of money for medical fees is inevitable , the government should not neglect the economic gropelled by lae earned while they are active in the work force .
.
Minor monthly contributions made during their working years will definitely acmulate to a substantial pool of wealth for their retirement days .
Diverting funds to other more vital areas of improvements has its benefits too .
Firstly , there will be economic growth and country prosperity .
Singaportakess strived hard to aspendse the status as a tourism hub , and the revenue that could be generated from it alone should never be overlooked .
Therefore , if more funds are diverted to it instead of the elderly , there is no doubt that the country will experience tremendous economic growth and be prosperous .
Secondly , the future workforce of the country will be very productive .
A productive workforce is often defined as one which possesses the best qualifications , and education emphasis is the only way to go about it .
Thus , expanding the current budget on education will surely result in a larger and more affluent generation in the future .
Paterson ,P . ,2001whoSpending on the elderly is necessarit could be done on a ration basis .
We've discussed the far-reaching effects of diverting to other more vital areas of improvement and it outweighs any existing issues .
There are also other available alternatives which couldemented to deal with the medical needs of the elderly , such as the stressing of filial obligations and the introduction of retirement schemes .

As Singapore has been faced with an aging population  since 1990s , there has been a shortage of skilled workersve ina declining birth rateful .
This can be achieved by managing resources efficiently in areas such as investing in foreign talents and education plished researchers petitive edge in the globalizing petitive in a globalizing world .
At the same time , there should also be certain amount of public spending on the aged as the senior citizens are still part of the society and they should be taken care of as so that a country can progress and prosper .
Singapore has one of the placent thinking that they have already saved enough for their medical bills in the future .
But if one is to be diagnosed panies and help Singaporeans to purchase a basic insurance e due to the 'post war baby boomer aging' effect .
Although Singapore's education system is one of the most efficient in the world , there are still many people not able to get a proper education due to financial limitations .
This might result in a multiplier effect of people with less education earning less and being less healthy in a way .
Also , this group of peoplght not be able to earn givengh to sustain their own medical fees when they grow old thus the burden will again be borne by the government .
Therefore , by paying more attention to education and making sure that all if not most Singaporeans can get a proper education , it ensures that most people will be literate enough to get a proper paying job and thus increasing the working adult is to elderly ratio .
With the increase in the ratio , it will without doubt , relievwhere/ in whiche government in financing for the aged healthcare .
On top of it , a case basis might be a more plausible way of giving healthcare subsidy rather than just applying healthcare subsidy to the general elderly as a whole .
This will really improve the allocations of funds to those who really need it from people who still can afford the healthcare in Singapore .
Even though healthcare expenditure is initable in any country , money does not solve all the problems and it is still very important to educate the people on the importance of retirement planning .
Therefore , instead of encouraging people to rely on the government with subsidized healthcare services , the money should be put into better use like education or other aspect of the nation's development .

Also , in this increasingly globalised society , it is even more imperative that one keeps one updated , so as not to be outdated , or they e too many immigrants such that the nation's culture and identity plain and the society will see a more productive workforce and more birth rates , hence helping to reduce the problem of excessive ageing in a society .

This would give even a larger burden to the working adults and taxes will definitely increase .
However , as we all know , the elderly only constitutes a smaller part on the society , and the younger ones in the social group must be taken care of the same way or more so than the elderly since they are the determinants of the country's future .
More money should not be invested on the healthcare of the elderly who are unwell and not fit for work since they do not have any other means to spend on with that much money given by the government , except for their medical fees .
Instead investing more money in education will increase the likeability of the younger people to secure better jobs , and enabling them to provide their elderly parents financial support , no matter in what condition their parents are in .
Based on the statistics obtained from a government statistical websian even larger Te level of education attainment among resident non-students aged 25-39 , despite increasing rapidly in the past few years , is still low at 70 percent in 2008   .This means that the government must set aside more money in instilling awareness of the importance of education towards the young .
This can be done by organizing campaigns , and through media such as advertisements and short documentaries .
The Global Campaign for Education for example , has campaigned in many countries in order to instill awareness towards the importance of education .
Therefore , by succeeding in education and secured better jobs , the working adults will ease the burden of the government from having to invest a lot of money to the welfare of the elderly .
Healthcare for the elderly is important inconstitutenable them to lead better lives .
However , the well-being of the citizens in general is much more important .
As discussed earlier , the younger citizens are determinersf the country that determines its future .
The country needs healthy and abled citizens to ensure the country's progress .
Therefore , more of the government's investments should go to the younger citizens .
Moreover , these younger citizens are the ones who wilInstead ,sponsible for their elderly parents' health and well-being , therefore thier health and well-being should be prioritized .Based on a study by the .
Commonwealth Fund which is released on Wednesday , in the Healthday News/Detroit Free Press reports , which includes 4 ,052 U .S . adults ages 19 or older betweenthe ptember 2003 and January 2004 , about 16 million U .S . residents care for sick or disabled family members , and approximately nine million of those caregivers have medical problems , according to the study .
Three out of five caregivers said they had trouble paying their medical bills  .
This shows that in the course of taking care of their parents , the working adults do not take care of their own health , and what makes it worse is that they are financially in need , as evidenced by their incapability to settle their own healthcare bills .
Therefore as evidenced by these kinds of scenarios , the government shsecuringt aside more money on healthcare  ,especially for working adults who are taking care for their elderly parentsonsince caregivers of the ill and unhealthy should be healthy in the first place .
wasremove full-stoptheirIn conclusion , the government has shown much concern to the elderly by investing a lot of money in their cause .
However , the amount of money invested way exceeds the amount they need .
Therefore , the amount of money that the government has obtained should be invested on the other important arablef development , such as education and healthcare .
A country needs to progress , and this would never be achieved by solving one part of the problem only , but all the parts that lead to the problem .
In developed countries such as the United States , Japan and Singapore , the aging population has been an important issue .
The Singapore government has implemented policies pulsory primary school education and subsidies for students from poor families .
Furthermore , in the 2009 Key Budget Initiatives , the government is enhancing school education by "providing better facilities for an all-round education in every school , enhancing both the size and quality of the teaching force and bringing in allied educators into schools to collaborate pany" .
On the other hand , there is also a setback such that there e pulsory insurance scheme can be introduced to ensure more savings .
The government is also "committing to a substantial expansion of the healthcare sector by investing $4 billion to restructure the heath care system to handle the aging population such as the development of community hospitals" .
Patients can then recuperate at these community hospitals which generate savings and increase efficiency on treatment of more acute cases .
the education the Ministry of Manpowerpreferred to work part timeIn evaluating the government policies , I do agree that these are workable solutions to a large extent .
However , more research has to be done in order to keep elder dependency low and provide cost effective and affordable healthcare .
In 1950 , there e up pared to a plain .
No matter hopared to the past .
What if they do not have enough money to see the doctor ?
Do we let them die on the streets ?
As the standard of living increases , a minor operation will cost at least a whoppingof people aged 6010 000 .
The medicine and the appointments to see the doctors are normally for a lifetime , which would mean moincludes costs .
Some of the agederly may not be eligible for the government policies because they do not fulfil certain requirements .
There are people who believed that the aged should fend for themselves .
However , if we take a closer look , we will see a vicious cycle where the problem will eventually fall back on the children and back to the economy since they will have a keep a portion of their salary for the medical bills .
spendIn conclusion , the government must plan properly to allocate sufficient resources for the aged , yet not forgetting other aspects of the country .
As policies makers decide on how much resources to allocate , they must remember that these policies will be subjected to changes as everything else changes .
Hence , we must be flexible and focused to know which direction our country is heading towards and plan adequate resources properly .
ondraftedthough ,With the continued decline in fertility and the improvement in health in Singaporeans , Singapore faces a greying population  .
In addition , the ageing phenomena are becoming more complex e more modernised , the level of the family social support to the old plex changes in the environment , there are theories on successful aging munities throughout their life time .
With regards to social exchange theory suggests that the degree of interaction of elderly is determined by their ability to engage in social exchange .
We munity .
Companies in Singapore tend to prefer employing younger employees , and pany is undergoing restliving ing , the older panies to continue employing the elderly , companies still hesitate to keep them because of possible health problems .
Forcing them to accept lessespected jobto whichalso mean loe , to earn for a living as retirement age has increased .
This creates undue stress and negative psychological impact on the aged , at the same time a social stigma on them and also inadequate income .
A survey from MCYS  shoe usually inaof them credit it to loe .
Unlike Japan , the companies tend to treasure the experience of older pany , allopetent .
The aged in Japan are very much respected as compared to those in Singapore , hence , aging with more dignity .
Taking a closer look , the success of the policy on employing the elderly is still inconclusive , as it takes years to senior workersrspective of a society .
At the very least , the elderly is still able to be part of the workforce .
To a large extent , most of the existing policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The HDB housing policy which encourages families to stay closer to their parents allows elderly to continue their role in helping their children or even an additional role as a grandparent .
The HDB provides additional grants through CPF for families to purchase flats within a certain radius of their parents .
With the close proximity , family members can travel to and fro with ease , helping them in terms of household matters and even taking care of young children .
This allows bonding to increase between them and also increasing the self-worth of the elderly .
In terms of improving the ability of the elderly in engaging social exchange , mobility and places are the important aspect .
The government is creating a more disabled and elderly friendly environment by making improvements in housing estates and public areas .
For example , the transport authority aims to have lift facilities in every mass rapid and light rail transit stations .
In order to encourage active aging , the government is bringing activities closer to housing estates like the RC or CC .
These activities include not only physical activities , and also voluntary activities .
The government also set up the Council for Third Age to further promote active aging  .
Presently , though social policies are still solely draft out by the government .
However , Singaporeans can be involved in improving these policies by providing feedbacks througthe elderlynment portals like Reach .
With such initiatives , policies are now more focused in terms of improving the lives of Singaporean as a whole .

Introduction
It is ales to allocation of the budget pie fothe allocationtry's development .
Whether is it for educational , economicit isocietal or military advancement , it is of paramount importance that policy makers make suitable decisions in the best interests of the country and its people .
In my opinion , channeling too much government funds to taking care of the aged can have detrimental effects on the country's development .
Therefore , I am for the statement that public spending on the aged should be limited .
the developmentfailedeven committing petty crimesmisbehaviours , suchUncontrolled government spending on healthcare or infrastructure for the aged could result in other groups of needy people not getting their share of the government's financial aid .
These include the handicapped , juvenile delinquents and loe families .
These less privileged groups of people are also members of the society e families struggling to make ends meet may be desperate and might resort to robbery and burglary to ease their financial burden .
Teenagers munity .
These are complex social problems that might significantly impact other members of the society , and hence , development of the country , if not handled appropdefiedely .
In a pragmatic view , channeling large amounts of funds to the singular of the country such as research and development and education would in the long run benefit the country's economic growth .
However , it would be morally wrong to leave the elderly who are part of the society alone .
The elderly did contribute much to the country in their younger age and the society should be obliged to look after them when they are older and not cast them aside .
Furthermore , public spending is made for everyone in the society to enjoy and seek help from and we cannot limit the funds for the elderly just because they are not able to produce any returns after enjoying the funds .
Therefore we should not limit public spending to a large extent .
With changing values in the developed countries , people are giving birth to fewer children .
This change in mindset changes the percentage of young against the old .
As a result , the percentage of old is certainly rising rapidly .
With increasing amount of people turning into old age , the portion of the public spending on the aged should not be decreasing instead .
Nonetheless , the focus of a country is to grow and prosper and development in other areas are seemingly more important .
Therefore , the society has to maintain a high standard of living as a developed world and since the elderly form the bulk of the society; we should spend more to help improve their lives so as not to lower our overall standard of living .
Hence we should spend on other developments but not at the expense of forgoing that for the elderly .
The aging process is an inevitable part of life .
It brings about physical , emotional and social changes that affect individuals significantly .
Follopared to one in tmendable contribution to the society parison and is present in different cluster of people .

Hence , it munity .
singularthe country'sprosperousthe agedseem to be of Allocation of the state's budget has to be justifiable .
With competing interests that necessitate public spending , public spending on the aged e first .
A pragmatic government e . Consequently , a larger tax base should then sufficiently provide a larger porseveral areasof public finances for the aged .
financehave beenHistory reminds us of the contributions by our forefathers .
It is thus the responsibility of the society to look after them .
In countries such as United Kingdom , promise financial resources allocated for the general population .
In fact , investment should be on nurturing of our people as they are contrthe tourism to the economy .
Through the twoining , re-training and investing on quality education , it nurtures the people .
Educational institutions provide quality teaching e obsolete .
More public finance on aged promise the investments on human capital .
In addition , it only satisfies the social and moral obligations to the aged .
Being pragmatic , munication , our transport netparison to public funds on aged , government only serves the social responsibility of looking after the aged .
isthe handicapsthe agednurtureIn conclusion , aged people cannot rely on government to take full responsibility for their needs since there are other priorities in country's devthe United Kingdomnts peting interessystems financial reschemess , public finance on aged is least of a concern .
it will definitely put a strain on the economic budget and reaps for the agedomic returns if public spending on aged has no limits .
In this ever competitive e obsolete , exhausted and unproductive .
Hoe a long es to choosing their desired education route and es more significant , spending is unavoidable .
In fact , the resources allocated do not have to be solely for the old as other sectors could also seek betterment from it .
For instance , the Lift Upgrading Programme  benefits the old as prehensive child care system that resulted in many expatriates moving their family over to munity for they had garnered experiences which are of practical use to the young .
Ths State share a part in supporting the elderly for these are the people who had have a hand in nation building and mcanng the society which we lived in now .
Spending on the old does not denoare an economic dead end .
To the contrary , the old has the potential to open new doors and bring about more opportunities both within and into the country .
Taking care of the aged is nopromising public spending on other areas of the country's development for the aged is unavoidable .
It is true that by doing so , a country's development and productivity e feeble and require assistance , e families from education .
Therefore , there is a need to organize strong branches of organizations , like Community Development Councils  , to decide e ranking  It is also important to implemens that require people to rely on oneself rather than government .
solutionsOn the whole , a country's public spending requires very delicate planning .
Since the aging population is one big issue now , necessary spending on the aged cannot be stingilfundamentals .
Not only is it due to moral obligation , ignoring the aging population would also result in other social problems that might be even more difficult to solve .
As the government wants to maintain a country's development , public spending on the aged should be limited but not to the minimal .
It should be at the maximum limit where the government can still withstand so as to help as many elderly as possible .
A nation's success does not solely depend on economic growth but the welfare aspect too .
Therefore with careful planning of expenditure , solving aging problem generously would benefit the country in long run .
The aging process is not a pleasant process for humans to go through .
Hoe up fortable one .
This is especially important , considering that Singapore had got one of the fastest aging populations in Asia , according to reports by the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  .

livingResearchOne and a half decades ago , many countries had to support the aging population through plish more tasks in a given period e group elderly are unable to enjoy such medicines and healthcare treatments because such treatments tend to be long term care which can bpassed expensive for them to afford .
In addition , Operations/ drugs have side effects which thee able to recover from due to their failing health .
As a result , they might end up having more illnesses that can cause health to deteriorate .
Medical cost will be much higher than before .
In conclusion , the current research and development/policies has not quite fulfilled its aim of helping the elderly cope with their aging process .
The government is helping the general population of the elderly in terms of providing subsidies on research and development such as emphasizing on the importance of filial obligation , finding cures for illnesses that plague the elderly , and encouraging greater productivity .
All these ideas are good but in today's world , it is actually not feasible in helping the elderly to cope with aging process .
Very often , the elderly would be left feeling sad , weak and even outcast even with these current research and development .
The new research and development/policies in the future should be well thought so that they will provide aids for the elderly instead of hindrances for them to go through the last phase of their life .

Hence , it is dependent on the individuals' filial piety values that determine the success of the HDB policy .
Evidently , the policies aimed at easing the aging process of a country have various aspects to fulfill in order for it to be effective .
Governments have to look into the economical and societal impacts an aging population brings along .
Apart from that , they have to satisfy the three different needs; i .e .
the financial , social and emotional needs of the elderly .

Thus , the opportunity cost to invest in the education is lower than to invest on a wiseelderly .
Besides , moral value especially to make the children beholden to their parents can be inculcated by introducing the government'smodules in their education .
This will help the elderly indirectly as the children are trained to embrace the Eastern value to respect and takinbeheir parents .
Investment in education will also lead to development in the country as education serves as a platform for further development divertother sectors such as R&D and Health .
Thus , such investment will definitely pay off in the future economic growth .
In view of providing mutual advantage to both elderly and economic development , it is best for the government to revise on its budget allocation so that the right proportion of budget is divided wisely among the ministries in the country .
Elderly should not be granted a lump sum but instead divert the fund to other areas which will lead to future economic growth .
This is because administrating the budget to the elderly is only one-way benefit but if the budget is allocated to other areas such as Education and R&D , everyone including the elderly can enjoy the advantage .
What arearerefore needed are a wise policy planning and a closer look at how the allocation will influence our future and society as a whole .

?Aging populations are compelling governments to create or revise policies and development that may affect the life of its citizens At the same time , this sustainable shift in aging population poses challenges to policy makers .
Policy makers are faced with the challenges such as hopanies in the country .

At such , a win- win situation can be achieved as we not only ease the aged population but also assist in country expansion .
Next , advancement in technological tools is required to ensure the sustainability of the health care system .
These technological tools are developed to make life of e agecountry'sreconomyressful and even healthier for them to continue live independently .
For example , monitoring systems are currently researched to allow the aged to remain in their homes longer even they are being treated with chronic diseases , rather than moving them into a nursing home which may incurred more costs .

The SingaporeanOn the contrary , the increasing in public spending on the aged by the government will increase the fiscal budget .
This will inevitably intowardsease the government's load .
Therefore , the spending in other essential areas such as infrasyoungerure , financial , and education will have to cut down .
The cut downs of spending in these essential areas might hinder the growth of a country .
Considering these important factors , many people will eventually support that public spending on the aged should be limited .
However , in my opinion , every choice we made definitely has an opportunity cost which means something has to be given up in order to attain the objective we want .
So , I think with proper planning on the spending by the government , we should be able to meet the balance between public spending on the aged and other essential spending .

Spending on education will help to nurture the peoparents have a good education from young and make Singapore a good place to seek education .

The challenge is to encourage healthy and productive life of the aging population and find ways for them to contribute more to the society so that theyenforcesy a valuable role for the country .
The govpersont should not use aging population as a reason to limit public spending as they always encoan employerive and healthy living for the elderly people .
They are still very important to the country and the government must play a part to take care of them .

They also have a referral centre to help jobseekers .
This allopetitiveness in the pete internationally .
For that reason , student exchange programs in schools are increasing .
Similarly , the government should have subsidies to encourage the underprivileged students to sign up and allopetitiveness of the workforce by having and encouraging people to upgrade their skills .
The other way is to have students receiving quality education since young .
In conclusion , the government should have wise policy planning .
A significant amount of money should benot beiverted to other areasEconomics eation and research for the country's development and a smaller amount for subsidies in medical and healthcare .
Public policies that encourathe workforcecilitate education , basic research , and the application of promising technologies can enhance the well-being of current and future generations of older people  .
This is true as when public funds are directed into research , education and technology , it initiates economic growth .
With economic growth , it means increasing revenue for the country .
Subsequently , with the increased public funds due to a good economy , the government will have a larger budget for the aged .
Every year , governments seriously consider  the allocation of their limited public spending .
In Singapore's Financial Year 2009 , the expenditures allocated had been revised and redistributed .
They are social development  , security and external relations  , economic development  and government administration   .
One of the reasons panies are not willing to offer a higher salary rate even if they manage to secure a job .
Hence , it is vital that government does its part by diverting moan aging its spending to help the aged .
Although thesehave argueds can be address by not limiting the public spending , there are still other ways to resolve them by diverting the money to another area - improvement in the education system .
Education prepares the younger generations for the future workforce , making them more affluent and teaching them to achieve success .
In addition , it emphasizes the importance of filial piety which encourages children to have the full responsibilities to take care of their aged parents when they grow up .
The provision of a higher standard of education also encourages the children to be more independent for their own survival in the future .
It also creates a "work more and save more" mindset so as tothe elderlyrnment dependency .
Most importantly , improving the education system helps in developing the country socially and economically , so diverting the money to this area is a more effective and effthe Government to help the aged indirectly .
Secondly , creating more job opportunities is another area whereby money should be diverted to .
In order to reduce the needs of the aged to fully depend on the government , the government should encourage the aged to support themselves instead .
It is impossible to support them in the long- run as there are many other areas of concerns which the government needs to look into as well .
Hence , with the creation of more jobs , the government can assist the aged to secure a job and allow them to support themselves , with the condition that they are still in healthy conditions .
It also allows the younger generations to easily secure a job and support their aged parents independently .
All these promote social and economic developments of a country too .
Looking ahead , jobs creation is a more resourceful way in developing a country with its public spending .
With regards to all the points mentioned , it is concluded that nding on the aged should be limited .
The ideaneediforting the spending on the aged and diverting the money to the improving of education system and creating of more job opportunities is to prevent the over-reliance of the aged on the government , eliminating the wrong perception of "I will still survive with this 'free' money from the government" .
Therefore , since the improvement of education system and creation of more jobs bring aboutone long-term benefits than having annlimited public spending on the aged , money should be diverted to these areas as part of the country's developments which eventually , will impact the aged positively .
* "To a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process ."
Do you agree ?
Discuss this statement in relation to your particular field of study or interest  .
Thirdly , the shrinking ratio of younger gservicens in the future indicates the importance of elderly to remain productive to the economy .
Generally , it is assumed that the young should support the elderly .
The younger generation should remain in the workforce while the elderly tend to retire at a stipulated age .
However , this scenario may change in tfuture due to the lack of human resource in the job market .
To prevent the disruption of labour market , elderly are likely to remain in the work force in the near future .
Thus , an elderly friendly environment is essential to enhance the efficiency of the work force .
As the country ultimately benefitsom the productivity of the aged , it is rational for the government to utilise public spending on the aged .
Therefore , the public spending on the aged is as crucial as other areas of country's development .
resourceslightensIn conclusion , the assumption that public spending should be used in other areas of country's development due to the lack of productivity of the aged is flawed .
Increasing awareness on hresourcese has allowed the elderly to remain productive in the workforce which in turn benefits the country as a whole .
Therefore , public spending is essential due to the high healthcare services fees , the lack of resources to support the growing numbers of aged and the labour input of the aged in the society .
In essence , public spending on aged is rationalized and valid as the aged remain to be a valuablewhicht in the country .

The aging process has indeed become a phenomenon in Singapore .

The government has responded to this issue by establishing policies and programs to manage the aging process .

This may include the impact of the rise in living expenses and the influences of the western culture .
Without considering these social changes , the aging process may increase government expenditure and the burden of the future workforce generation .

While public spending on the aged is vital , it should not comprise  other aspects of a country's groe , they may face difficulties and restrictions in seeking appropriate medical treatment due to financial problems .
It is therefore crucial for governments to extend assistance to the elderly in the form of medical subsidies , allomon saying goes , "Children are the future pillar of the nation" .
They should be given every right to receive education under any circumstances .

Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Being a firm believer of 'Prevention is better than cure' , I agree to a certain extent .
In year 2000 , seven percent of Singapore's total population is over the age of sixty-five , homodation .
By three methods that tackles the problem in a long run .
In conclusion , it is noted that capping ofmakec spending to the aged will provide more cash flow to other sectors , which will in turn reduce and tackle the problems faced now .
All three areas of education , heducate and social policy are equally important whereby unnecessary funding to other sectors , like to the military , can well be avoided or reduced .

This is to help them to deal with changes in areas such as wage restructuring and the cost to re-train the older workers .
As such , with these initiatives , the public should be rest assured that the minimum of initiatives will be carried out to guarantee that the elderly can extend their working lives with least problems .
In this way , they can then work to occupy themselves and age with ease that they can at least contribute to the economy .

Public spending is the government's expenditure on various sectors , munity-based programmes and residential care for the aged .
This includes elderly homes and activity centres .
Hopulsory pension scheme in 2006 pulsory superannuation system also prepares the people for their old age .
These saving schemes in different countries would help ensure that the people have a minimum amount of savings after they have retired .
Hence they would most likely be more self-sufficient and public spending on the aged should be limited .
Public spending on the aged is the expenditure by the government covering  health , infrastructure and projects aimed at improving the lives of the elderly .
A large amount of the expenditure used is contributed by government taxation on the es from the pocket of the e in the form of subsidised training schemes .
Such courses should be put in peconomyencourage the e more knopromised and must be put in place by the government in order for the aged to stay healthy and not be a burden to the society .
Instead of spending money on treating the iother aspects of the country's development ney should be allocated to promote healthy lifestyle in the elderly .
For example , lessons in gymnasia and fitness centres can be conducted specially for the aged to encourage them to exercise and keep a healthy lifestyle .
In Singapore , petent , and that hospitals and polyclinics have the best available facilities .
In addition , the costs for medical care should be subsidised as some treatments can really be expensive and most of the people promised because they are necessary to maintain a healthy ageing population .
Therefore it is important to strike a balance on the allocation of public spending in order for the country to develop favourably .

The group of 60 years or over is expected almost to triple , increasing from 673 million in 2005 and 2 billion by 2050 and the share of the elderly is also predicted to rise from 64 percent to nearly 80 percent in 2050 especially in developing countries  .

In conclusion , public spending should not be limited and divert to other areas of the country's development in order to make On the other hand golden age .
inAging population topic for a lot of discussion .
"As early as 1979 , the Institute for Research on Public Policy issued a report monly assumed as "a burden to society" .
This essay also e an actual crisis of the society , and government has taken action on attempt to decrease their social welfare expenditures during period of fiscal constraint .
According to "do aying world"  , there are basic strategies , which policy makers and government can consider implementing to lessen the burdensome of older generations to the younger .
These strategies prove that instead of spending much money on supporting the aged , government can seek for another alternatives to reduce tmost ofurden .
The mosindependentrthat stressing filial obligation and increasing thhaveillingness of tomorrow's gn children to suppexpensesir own elderly parents through informal and family channels .
Originated from Asian cultures , family obligation is the most precious thing , which characterizes the parent relationship .
Parents have broughexpendituredren up , and in return the children will have the responsibilities to take care of parents when they get old .
It continues for the next generation , who are their little kids .
It is the culture of family-oriented and gratitude for their parents' giving birth and a settled position to them .
Filial responsibilities might be understood in many ways , such as obligation to help elderly parents , or to keep in close contact with them , or to live near them , etc .
Societies in which the extended family is weak and high long-term care costs such as the United States should learn from Asian countries , where most elderly people still live with their adult children .
Diverting money to other areas of the country's development does not mean government will take less responsibigovernmentsis social problem .
In contrast , it shouldburdenst as one way to help reduce the burden of aging population .
By investing to other areas such as technology , economics , sethe governmentlth care , etc .
society can developed dramatically , which is in return , contributing back to lessen the burdensome of the country's development .
Hence , elder dependency could be reduced when the elder can support themselves for their own daily expense .
For no full-stopstance , in Singapore , yofull-stop after the parenthesisgOriginating eople who are dynamic , active , creative can take a role as main contributors to the country's budget , while the elder can work in food court or any service jobs .
That is a good classification of working labors in the society that take good advantage of the scarce labor force .
Moreover , by doing so , the elder can earn for their living , have a savings for future need on health care , and have less dependency on their younger generation .
elderlylabourIn conclusion , this essay shows a favorable view of social spending on the aged should be limited , and money can be diverted to other areas of the development of the country .
Although it is a controversial issue to talk about aging population and its burden to the society , this essay indicates alternatives government can do besides spending too much on the aged to adapt to the challenge for the future , which is "to ensure that people everywhere will be enabled to age with security and dignity and continue to participate in their societies as citizens with full rights" . 
Countries petitions are conducted , aiming to motivating the elderly to reacquire nemittees have been established in schools , communities , corporate , and government .
The various advisory committhe good stand out as a platform for the elderly to share their rich experience , which sometimes is quite prectaken actionoung generation .
To sum up , the working barrier of the elderly has been lower and they have found different ways to enrich their lives and contribute to society .

With this subsidy , the more elderrelieveed to before .
Furthermore , plicated surgeries have also become simplified as a result .
Nevertheless , these measures are only methods which make it more affordable and easier to seek treatment but it does not solve the problem .
The elderly have to be convinced to adopting of a healthy and balanced lifestyle .
Therefore , besides pprogramsg subsidies , they have to be more proactive in reaching out to the elderly who are not likely to seek out information on staying healthy .
elderlyby entrustingWith the overly successful "Stop at Tpanies can contribute by employing them .
Nothe 1960'sless , many elders lack skills .
Yet , they are more expensive to employ .
However , it must not be overlooked that these elders are experienced and could contribute in a different way .
Employers could also offer other kinds of employment , not necessarily to bewashe same job or pay as of their previous employment .
The government has also several programs to retrain older workers and upgrade theirto bekills , ultimately , increasing their employability .
With jobs , the elders could then be self reliant .
Hence , spending on the aged populsuch an could then be limited .
cannotEspeciallyAn ageing population is an issue that many developed countries are facing .
While it may seem daunting to the economy , all it takes is a lot of planning ahead and the unity of the entire nation .
As our Prime Minister said , by preparing well and early , the present genera highn of Singaporeans will be able to enjoy healthy and fulfilling lives into their sunset years , without putting a heavy burden on their chiltheir parentsd grandchildren .
The aging population is becoming a problem that many people e very costly to the mon illnesses like diabetes , eye cataracts , bone and joint problems , and heart problems .
These problems need continuous attention and therefore incur repetitive and expensive expenditures .
There is also a need to build elderly friendly environment like railings , lifts that goes to every floor of the buildings , and slopes .
In addition , there e a huge burden to the e to the country .
People e more affluent to spend and stimulate the economic groe a snowballing effect causing further improvements in the economy .
Spending to develop the country can generate extra revenue to the country , creating a more affluent society .
This will be beneficial for the elderly and also the working elder friendlyhe more affluent society will be able to pay for the healthcare expenses of the elderly .
For the benefit of the whole society , public spending the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
and having an Active Aging Festivalelderis planning on makingYes , I agree that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .
In Singapore , the government and society have come up muters; Older HDB flats being upgraded to lifts that stops at each level and car parking area noes e out e a problem to the society bwith just a natural process in Singapore .
An aging population is one of the issues that faces Singapore today . .
The Singapore Department of Statistics  mentioned statespulation Trend 2008 report that senior citizens aged 65 years and above make up of 8 .5% ofhe population and it e uand that ,r pressure .
Having an aging population meant that there es from taxing the e . This action e to support them .
Thus , in order to meet their needs , the government has came up e base on their CPF contributions made during their e and could be for hospitalization expenses .
As the senior citizens are more prone to health sickness , having this Medisave account would greatly benefit them .
Thus , public spending on the aged could and should be limited as the government had came up with several approaches to help deal with the aging process .
would thisAging population should not be the only issue that is given most attention to as there are other areas of the country's development that would require the public money .
For instance , the government should spend part of the national budget in trying to increase the fertility rate .
Singstat mentioned that despite the slight increase in fertility rate , the meanslity rate is still considered low .
Having a low fertility rate would impact Singapore in the long run .
ThveFurtherent could probably use the national budget to provide incentives to encourage Singaporeans to do their part in increasing the fertility rate .
Thus , pIn additionending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas of the development that would would meanre the national budget .
used forIn conclusion , though there should be publijustifiesnding on the aged , it should nevertheless be limited .
This is because of the consequences related to doing the otherwise such as pressurizing the national budget as well as the workforce itself .
In addition , the government had already done his part in preparing its citizens for old through the CPF Life and Medisave Account .
Furthermore , there are other areas of development that would require the national budget .
I agree to a large extent that current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
The aging process means that as time passes ,  people mon because the elderly tends to have a slomonly and most of the people around the panies have to compits peoplepoorer and responsiveness might be slopanies take this opportunity to penetrate the market panies have actually offer phone models panies panies are attentive to issues regarding the aging population and have done action to help ease the aging process .
Being one of the fastest aging populations in the Asian region , Singapore faces many challenges in trying to overcome this aging problem .
For the last 30 years , the young population in Singapore has shrunk tremendously .
Accounting for less than 4% of the total population back in the 1960s , today the elderly , aged 65 and above  constitute 7 .3% of the total population based on the Singapore Census of Population 2000 .
This projects a significant gromodate to this current changover theture , on-going developmt of government policies , covering areas like economics , social and architecture , have been carried out aggressivesociologyough architectural design

For parents having their third child , the amount contributed will be doubled .
Purpose of this financial scheme is to assist parents in the payment of the development and education of their children .
Through these idoesemented policies , it will help facilitate the growth of the fertility rate , while at the same time solve the issue of aging process .
.To further tackle the rising trend , government also implemented different housing schemescauses for a growingallow the families to look after their aged parents rather than putting them in old folks' homes or leaving them to look after themselves .
Examples of housing schemes include the Joint Selection scheme , which helps the parents and their children in is resulting in aication for separate flats but in the same block or housing estate .
Multi-Tier Family Housing scheme is another scheme which allows preferential treatment in flat application , lower-down payment and also maximum loans for those who opt for it .
The applicants can request for flats that are larger in size with enough space for two independent households .
Through this policy , it helps to create responsibility awareness of the younger generation to look after their aged parents .
Furthermore , it also enables the aged to continue living in the environment that they are familiar with .
Supporting services and subsidies are provided to families with aged dependents so as to assist them and at the same time , help the aged to remain physically and socially active .
SupportCatering to the upward trend of the the Governmentnhas implemented programs such as free health check for the elderly are implemented to encourage these elderly to constantly conduct full body checkup to ensure that they are in good health condition and also advise them on the dos and don'ts in their everyday life so as to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Besides that , incentives are also catered for the elderly to further motivate them in conducting health checks .
With these , it will help to ensure that the elderly are physically and mentally healthy and thus more productive in their old age .
providedalso beingAs we can see , the aging process is not slowing down .
All the policies implemented were to facilitate the process smoothly so as to reduce the ithe elderlyg towards the society .
I could say that these implemented policies do help a lotg the aginto adviceess .
Perhaps what we can hope for is the constant innovation and improvement so as to serve the aging process better .

For economic policies , having CPF and raising the retirement age will alneedsadditional wealth accumulation .
Thus , the development of these policies has helped to ease aging process to a large extent .
Ageing has alpared to decades ago .
It is norm that ageing is often associated with illnesses such as Parkinson's and  ,and as a result , it is a concern of many .
Thus , medical breakthroughs by the University of Nottingham in  research regarding to the slowing down and preventing of Parkinson's and dementia  has definitely relieved many .
Although , some may argue that breakthroughs in  research do not severe the root of the problem as those who are ill  the diseases are still not cured .
However , one must realized that  breakthroughs can help the aged to be better prepared or even prevent contracting with  diseases .
Additionally , since there is a breakthrough , the possibility of a cure cannot be ruled out as well .
Besides , if more are able to slow down or even prevent themselves from getting the disease , the aged can lessen their medical costs which will lead to a reduced cost of living .
Therefore , medical research greatly enhances the confidence of the aged to face the eventual ageing process .
Clearly , the current research and policies have helped to ease the ageing process tremendously .
Breakthroughs in the medical research field , not only provide a cushion for the aged with regards to old age illnesses but also help to reduce their future medical expenditure .
Similarly , the CPF policy , put into operation by the government lessens the worries of ageing as medical and life expenses  are already well planned for .
Finally the HDB grant policy decreases the worries of the aged living with their children .
It is relatively hard to deny how much ageing has been made much easier .
Aging is a continuous , complex , and dynamic process .
Aging  as defined by Wikipedia is the process of physical , psychological , and social change .
Physical change means that one's health puter .
In addition , there e up e for ageselderly in their retirement .
Under this scheme , they can get around $360 to $440 per month upon reaching the age of 62 .
As a result , elderly indiattitudean enjoy their retirement e into their Medisave account to meet their future personal medical expenses .
Therefore , they do not have toadvancementsmedical expenses when they are old .
Besides that , the government also provides financial assistance to needy elderly individuals who do not have the means to pay their medical expenses .

In The Graying World  , Peterson argues that a lack of limit in public spending would "impoverish future generation" .
However , the withdrawal of governmental support in the health care for the aged would shift the responsibility to the families of these aged and burden the development of the country in the long run .
As argued by Friedland and Summer in Doomsday Predications about Population Aging Are Exaggerated  , the costs incurred by the families would "end up getting shifted back to the public sector through less direct and often more expensive means" .
How would this assist in driving the country's development ?
In addition , discontentment could be stirred up as people may question the lack of governmental efforts in the taking care of its citizens .

As people are educated , they were able to contribute to the workforce in the near future .
As fertility rates remain stagnant , many countries are experiencing aging populations .
Governments have thought of many measures  to help improve the aging population situation .
They have invested time and money to research on policies that can help solve the aging population crisis .
Since such a trend is  likely to happen in the short run , much has been done to buffer its negative impact on society .
Therefore , I agree to a large extent , that current research developmentand policies have helped to ease the aging process .

There are many areas where public spending should be used for a country's development .
In developed countries like Singapore andthe Singaporeere ageing population is an issue , the importance of public spending on the aged can outweigh that of other aspects .
On the other hand , developing countries may invest most of their public spending on infrastructure instead of on the aged because economic development is l to be their primary objective .
It would be unwise to limit healthcare spending on the aged since different countries have different needs .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should not be limitadoptse to its significance in view of the ageing population .
Instead , the government should allow its public spending on the aged to hang around a certain percentage .
I strongly agree pel people to save money for later use .
For instance , China has developed a complete system e and e under great pressure .
All in all encouraging people to set aside some money for themselves is the most wisdom method .
Throughout the years , the issue of aging has become a tremendous challenge for the developed countries .
Due to an increase in the standard of living , better medical treatment is available and this has caused the life expectancy of the people to increase .
People are marrying later in life and this has caused a fall in the fertility rate .
Young people are nopanies e obsolete and there's not much value they can bring to a country anymore .
However , is it really true that the elderly is irrelevant to a country's development ?
This is not the case .
When the government provides sufficient money to look after the elderly , what is developed is the intangible moral value of gratitude and piety .
When a nation looks after their elderly without reservations , the lesson conveyed to its populace is that one should always look after the pea smallwho have contributed to ourof whichlopment .
As a rsult , what we learntoes to be grateful to the people who have ansded us .
Such values are the essential element of the society .
It helpthe g create strong lasting bonds between citizens and the result will be a more cohesive nation .
What about education and reintoevelopment ?
A strong education system and a strong research and development sectorforwhen situated in a country that is not unified and chaotic will not be able to reap the benefits that they are supposed to generate .
Thus , public spending on the elderly does provide important benefits to the country and should not be limited thus .
Lastly , a country that does not take caforf its elderto haveufficiently runs the risk of having it younger population abandoning it and migrating to other countries .
No one would like to stay in a country with insufficient care for them in the future .
Majo and ity of them would think that their hard work does not pay off .
They work so hard to contribute to this economy but the result turn out that the governmenthe not provide sufficient care for them when they are old .
Hence , no more future leaders will be staying back to help the country to boost up the economy and run every sector .
This will turn the country into a gray society .
Therefore , public spending on the elderly should still be invested in term of financial policies and benefits .
In conclusion , we should not see elderly as a burden but an asset .
Even thought other sectors such as education and research and development are important to us , we should not forget ours greatly contributors .
There are the ones who build up a nation from the basic to what we have now .
Therefore , we must be grateful to those who aided us and create a sense of belonging to everyone .
In this way , younger generation will then work harder for the nations in the future .

In recent time , terrorists have accessed to sophisticated technologies that could create greater destruction to the surrounding and to instil fear in the people .
Hence , organisations and agencies related to national defence ought to receive adequate financial assistance for research and development .
In this bination of effective policies that would allow the nations to grow and flourish .
elderlyAging population is a e up munities can be solved and other essential policies can be sustained .
By limiting public spending on the aged , some spending can be used to sustain economic groes and thus can accumulate more panies to urge them to employ older munities and support necessary policies for the country .
Different countries will need to have different solutions specially tailored to fit their own countries and public spending should be split evenly so that there is a balance in each area .
Presently , existing policies have helped Singapore extensively in providing ease to the foreseen aging crisis .
To achieve successful ageing , the government has implemented various policies to be panies agreed that retirement of older munity .
For instance , accessible infrastructure provides a safe and comfortable environment for the elderly to recuperate their old age .
Indirectly , it also helps to maintain social netmunity .
Last but not least , to ensure that basic healthcare is affordable to all Singaporeans , Singapore has prepared her people with MediShield , MediSave and MediFund .
This is done by putting safety nets to ensure that healthcare remains affordable .
Besides , the government has decided to build more hospitals to cope with higher demands in the future .
Hence , with the multi-dimensional approach taken by the government , Singaporeans are able to have not seemed to have appealedy healthcare services .
In conclusion , the government has done well to prepare the country for ageing population in the aspects of economy , social and population growth .
However , to allow ageing policies to be truly successful for the future generation , it should be reviewed and remodelled when necessary .
The society should also maintain a positive and mature attitude towards ageing population .
Most importantly , individuals should be responsible and self-reliant to take up ownership of the ageing issue .
Public spending has been increasing in many countries over the years .
With the petitive .
Many countries , such as Denmark and Singapore , have started to retrain their petitive in the industry .
The three reasons provided explained why public funds on elderly should be limited and divert to other areas of development .
These areas will affect how much a nation can support its problemsopulation .
Although the elderly are an important asset , but they are not the only asset a nation has .
In conclusion , the nation needs to sacrifice the elderly temporarily for the benefit of everyone .
By diverting the resources to develop on other areas , the elderly will benefit more in the future .
The nation must not be short sighted and seeko solve problems improvinggeing population only .
Policymakers should think of how the nation can solve the ageing population in the process of developing plans that will benefit the other areas .
To achieve this , we need to remember this; assisting the elderly is important but building a nation is more important .
isscausedIn the developed countries , many countries are facing the problems of fast ageing population .
There panies that are affected by the current economy dopanies to encourage the balance among mitted for their work  .
Government may evelopment where it can attract foreign talents to the country to solve the problems of manpower shortage .
In order to ensure that there are sufficient funds for these areas of development , the government will have to limit the amount of spending on the aged .
It will tend to create awareness on the serious problems due to the ageing population if public spending is limited .
This is to ensure that the elderly and the working people will not over rely on the government for aids .
In addition , it is the responsibilities of the elderly as well as the working people to plan financially for their future  .
During their contribution to the working world , the aged should be able to plan ahead in advance for their future on the likely cost incurred for health care services .
If public spending is nottomited , the agorking peThe Governmentake the aids provided by the government for granted thus they may not work hard during their contribution to the working world .
However , some may think that if the public spending is limited , it will result in pressure on the aged as well as on the working people as they will have to provide for rising health care costs in the future .
Also , the numbers of working people supporting the aged have reduced thus putting strain on them .
In order to solve this problem , the government have implemented certain policies to aids the aged , some of the policies are the introduction of the Central Provident Funds , tax reliefs and the Public Housing scheme .
Central Provident Fund is a saving plan that has provided Singaporean with a sense of security in their old age .
For example , the MediShield are used to better prepare them for the future medical costs  .The implementation of these policies will hence reduce the burden on the aged and thus reduce the public spending required on them .
forisS .aidhasT .costsIn conclusion , the government should provide certain subsidies to the aged but to a limit .
If not , the amount of the spending given to the aged will be a bottomless pit .
More policies can be implemented to encourage individual responsibility in responsibilityhe aged so as to reduce the burden on the government .
Therefore public spending shoua large extent .
Investments in education and infrastructures are important for the country to develop too .
Education allows the younger generation to be empowered with knowledge and helps to cultivate talents which can lead the country and businesses .
Public funds are needed to build educational institutions and schools .
Infrastructures such as public roads and tran need to be established too .
With good and convenient infrastructures , the lifestyle of the citizens will improve .
The country will then be able to develop in all areas .
In conclusion , for the country to develop , it is crucial to ensure all areas are taken care of .
Overlook in one area can lead to serious consequences .
Without economic stability , the country will not have enough funds to run the country smoothly .
A weak military force will cause the country to be easily destroyed .
Without education and good infrastructures , the citizens will not be able to improve and maintain their standard of living .
Even though it is significant and essential to help the aged , public spending on the aged needs to be limited .
Excessive spending on the aged will help them in the short run but will also impede the development of the country .
A better way is to evaluate critically on the level of importance of the different areas and balance the public funds according to priority .
is"Our baby boomers ing more evident andof the increaed pressure on public spending for the aged has left Singapore pondering on hopetent or physically-competent aged promandsed .
the agedgive preferenceWhilst we spend resources resolving the issue pertaining to the aging population , implications such as the increase in societal costs could arise if welfare programs are curtailed , cut and restricted .
Every day , a considerable sum of our money is spent on miscellaneous fees such as transportation fees , education fees , and utility bills , housing maintenance or even healthcare bills .
If these burdens are lightened , people will have more flexibility in spending power , which could in turn help churn the economy .
Consequently , there should be a threshold of public spending for the aged and the welfare programs should be a better attempt to aid everyone in Singapore equally .
Taking into account the issues of not having enough money to pay for expenses , we should all the more fund areas which can in turn generate more revenue for the country .
Through economic growth , funds can be used collectively and more profits and benefits can be allocated to the aged .
This is a cycle .
The only way to deal with this unique matter is to divert money into more productive areas , rather than assigning in all for the aged which have little or no returns at all .
Pen ultimately , by limiting our public spending on the aged , it will not exacerbate the effects of aging population .
But by putting other areas as a focus for economic growth , we can actually ameliorate the whole picture all together .
Singapore's constant upgrading of facilities such as having lifts that serve every floor of a building and replacing stairs promised as it contributes to the groing the future leaders of the country .
For example , in Singapore , seminars , munication skills and decision-making .
Furthermore , when they enter the workforce , they will able to fully utilize these skills and contribute effectively to the economy .
Hence , by preparing and nurturing the leaders of tomorrow from young , they will be able to lead the country to a whole new level .
In conclusion , it is necessary to look at the big picture and pay attention to areas such as tourism , housing and the education system to help in the development of the country .
In other words , there should always be a limitation to the amount of funds spent on the aged as they constantly need support and there will never be sufficient funds .
Limiting public spending on the aged should be done to favour  other areas of the country's development .
Besides taking care for the aged , there are several other areas the government should put the same amount of emphasis on e fortable usage .
too willIn conclusion , there are so many other issues of the society the government has to consider other than the aging population .
These issues have similar , if not higher importance , as compared to the aged .
The government should always measure the economic and social benefits and costs before implementing any policies , and implement those with the highest benefits .
But the question is: Will thewithrnment be firm enough to make the harsh decision ?
As we grofortable environment to enjoy theirdeterioratees .
Some examples of government's spending on the aged in Singapore include healthcare benefits like the ElderShield and lift upgrading programme in HDB to provide an environment mon misconception that the elderly can rely on the government to support them during old age .
As seen from past experience from other countries , over-dependence on the government prehensive social security savings plans that has provided many e earned by the e . Only then we can increase our capability and independence to support the aged and thus it is wise to limit pthe country'snding .
In conclusion , we should limit public sfieldsng on the aged in order to ensure that we can be more efficient and ensure that there is better allocation of resources by developing areas that can benefit the entire population .
Also , the government can implement more policies to allow the population to be more independent and increase the awareness of preparing for old age .
Most importantly , the government should divide public spending equally according to the different needs of the various areas of country's development .
Public spending othe country'sd should be limited to maintain the standard of living of the aged and to reach out to those who are in neebynancial aid .
"In Singapore , factors such as a relatively lopared to the younger generations .
Some of the reasons for an aging population are caused by loe .
By setting a budgaged , the government can develop in areas such as building infrastructures , attracting foreign investors , improving education system , and expanding the research and development of defence technology .
Last but not least , the government can use the money to expand on the research and development of the defence technology .
With better defence technology , the government need not spend money on buying defence weapons from other countries and instead , earn they can earn revenue by selling their own weapons .
By limiting the public spendingdependentaged and using it on defence technology research , Singapore will be better equipped in safeguarding itself as well as earning additional revenue for the country .
At the same time , an expansion in the research and development of the defence technology will demand more manpower .
As a result , more jobs opportunities will be available for not just the future generations , but as well as the elderly .
Limiting the public spending on the aged opens up other areas for development such as infrastructure , education and defence .
These developments will improve the lives of the current and future generation and in the long run , dependency of the future generations when they are old will be minimal as they will most likely have sufficient money for retirement .
Therefore , public spending for the aged should be limited and focused on developing other areas .
Global aging is a critical topic that the monly seen in Singapore plement panies are still discriminating against employing older panies' unwilling rationale  in employing older workers .
Hong Kong has also adopted such practices through its 4 yours CADENZA Community Project which seeks to create an "Elder-Friendly Employment Practice" such as job design , flexible working hours and friendly physical environment  .
This strategy of longer employment seems to be a highly feasible and accepted solution in tackling global aging .
isSpread of Financial Burden
Policymakers have also step up efforts in reducing the financial burden of an aging population by providing financial aids and encouraging people to save in advance for their retirement .
Medisave , Medishield and Medifund Sliver are some examples of medical schemes introduced in Singapore to lighten the medical cost burden of its senior citizens .
In addition , the state enforces its main retirement saving scheme , the Central Provident Fund Saving  whereby individuals are oblige to contribute a fix percentage of their monthly salary to their CPF account when they are employed .
In this way , the people are indirectly saving for their old age .
the elderlytwointroducedagethe elderlyUnity is the Best Strategy
Aging population is a global phenomenon that affects everyone .
With the development of various policies and strategies , leaders must understand that the best strategy is one where everyone unites together in conquering the long term battle of global aging .
They need to recognize that the effectiveness of any strategies will depend on every individual involvement .
Nevertheless , leaders should continue to revise current policies and develop new strategies so as to better prepare and tackle harsher challenges ahead .
It is inevitable that public spending mitted suicide in 2007 fortable living we have today .
After all our education , can we really call ourselves a civilized nation if we close our eyes to the suffering of the elderly living with us ?
Therefore , government's expenditure on the elderly should be allocated such that it is sufficient to help those elderly who are in need .
However , the government should take care of the country as a whole and not just focus on providing for the elderly .
The government should not neglect the need for funding the other development areas such as education and tourism that can boost the country's economy .
With more resources allocated to the country due to its economic growth , the government can also spend some of these resources on the elderly .
Nevertheless , an efficient and well-organized government should have planned the national budget carefully and have allocated desirable amount of funds into the various aspects of spending areas in the country .
This is especially so for richer countries because they have the financial ability to finance sufficient resources into the different areas of development .
Hence there is no need to restrict public spending on the elderly just to have more resources to be diverted to other areas .
Singapore , like many countries in the petitiveness of the economy and increases the strain and burden of the pulsory to all mitments like house installment , e group , theovernment gives different rates of subsidies to the different classes of wards in hospitals .
Forthat has increasedss C wards receive the most in subsidies .
On top of this , the government also strongly encourages her senior citizeno adopt a healthy lifestyle .
For example , regular physical exercises and a well-balanced diet are encouraged .
Public spending is the expenditure by the government e earned pulsory savings scheme in Singapore so that they can use this savings to support themselves in their old age .
This is to ensure that people will not face financial problem when they retire .
S .isthe Integratedto attractthe tourismIn conclusion , the governmd set boundaries on public spending on the aged so that people will learn how to plan financially for their own old age at the early stage .
Public spending can be also used in other areas of the country's development to boost Singapore's tourism industry .
Ththe Integratedo attract more visitors to the country and create benefits to the economy of the country .
Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to others areas of the country's development
In these recent years , the entire panies from almost every sector of the economy .
The governments are strongly expected to efficiently affectey from the national budget to maintain a sufficient economic gropletely disagree .
I personthreatenort the latter .
One more factor that should be taken into account is the moral or ethical aspect .
The elderly used to work and devote their talents and efforts to the development of the country .
Therefore , their dedication and sacrifice should be respected and rather relevantly rewarded by younger generations .
Moreover , policy makers and authorities should set good examples for the young .
A stable society in which all generations live in harmony requires a good moral foundation .
Once traditional values are reflected in the law , the law will be more practical and those traditional values will be more deeply ingrained in the society .
Furthermore , when the younger generation witnesses how their seniors are being whole-heartedly cared , they will have motivation to work harder and contribute to the country .
However , in some cases , the government probably should prioritize other areas of the country's development .
Let's take Zimbabwe as an illustration .
In a country where inflation rate reached an unbelievable figure of 11 .2 million percent , where almost every family had to struggle to put food on the table , where the only desire of the children is to go to school , a well-rounded health care system for the aged seems to be so luxurious .
The government here needs a drastic reform to restructure the entire political and administrative system before policies toward the old people could be brought to the conference table .
In brief , the policies toward the aged in each country seem to be widely different due to their very own and distinctive economic and social status .
Nevertheless , based on those different situations , each country should conduct more in-depth research and take necessary steps with the view to promulgating both short-term and long-term policies to ensure that the senior citizens  get what they deserve .
With the current trend of ageing population , many countries have come out e one of the most important things for economic will helpty , education and innovation throughout the panionship and social activity .
Hopanionship is most important to them as they age , e increasingly lonely and require more attention .
The love and concern provided from the family that can ease the ageing process from the family cannot be replaced by technology .
Hence , technology can be used as a tool to increase functionalities of the ageing adult but not able to pr .eiTnal support and care .
In today's context , the graying population has become a rising rising problem in many societies .
While it results in a delay to the country's economic progress , the problem also imposes a burden to the children as mended .
According to the Housing And Development Board  policy  , Lift Upgrading Programme  pared to the past , the elderly had much difficulty managing the stairs .
Thus , this implementation helps to accommodate tthe economynvenience of the elderly .
Therefore , establishment of accessible infrastructure helps the elderly to adjust more easily .
Financial subsidies mand the same income as before is almost impossible .
Hence , they mended to help cope pensates the loe that the elderly have relatively .
On the other hand , this reduces the children's burden to support the parents .
Therefore , the dependency on the shoulder of the children to take care of their elderly would be lightened .
On the contrary , implementating subsidy system requires heavy tax foundation which  be a burden on the working society .
A massive subsidy system is needed to sustain the hefty expenses of supporting an increasingly graying population .
This would be a substantial load on the working people , who would then be responsible for contributing to the welfare system of the elderly .
Consequently , this solution would not be effective in the long run due to the money-consuming factor in the problem .
As a result ,assistanceld be a classification of the degree of need , in order to create an efficient subsidy system .
In conclusion , the negative impact of the aging process is inevitable .
Therefore , feasible solutions are in need of implementation to ease the aging process .
However , due to cultural differences , the requirements of our elderly population will alter gradually .
Thus , research and policies need to be revised to deal with the aging process effectively .
Public spending on the aged has been increasing in recent years due to the ageing population , e inequality may be resulted .
In addition , the increasing demand on the country's healthcare system e consistently more costly , this e inequality is less than desirable  .
Hoe .
Furthermore , they have been providing voluntary services by actively involving themselves in community organisations  .
However , aged who have the ability to contribute to the country will only form the minority .
The increasicostsost will outweigh their contributions .
Thus , more funds have to be set aside to lessen the strains on the people caused by the increasing costs of basic necessities .
Finally , as the population gets older , there is an increase in demand on the country's healthcare system , where spending on it should be limited .
The United States predicted that the demand for medical care will significantly outweigh the supply of healthcare professionals by year 2020  .
The Gulf Cooperation Council  is also facing demand for health care where it is likely to increase by 240 percent over the next couple of decades  .
These will mean that the countries will be diverting plentyfocusing resources on the supply of health care and neglecting the potential of the other areas which may help to generate wealth for the country .
Hence , countries should limit their spending on health care to invest in other potential opportunities .
costsagedIn conclusion , the fact that people now live longer poses many challenges to a country .
The governmentvast amount of resources to support the aged , hindering the overall development of the country .
To lessen the impact of the aged on the country , the aged can learn to keep fit and healthy to reduce healthcare dependency .
In order for a country to grow and prosper , significant contributions are needed to support its funding and hence , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Based on the report of the United States Census Bureau , there are 506 million people hitting 65 years old and above as of mid 2008 .
This figure petition to provide health care .
There are many insurance companies hiring lots of agents to sell their products and each of the insurance company has its oprises six Ministries: Ministry of Education  , Ministry of Health  , Ministry of National Development  , Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  , Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources  and Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts  .
A total budget of S$ 8 ,701 million has been planned to be invested in education , accounting for nearly half of the expenditure budgeted for social development .
The government maintains that the expenditure on education sector would never be cut back even in the economic downturn .
The government heavily subsidise the education fees in schools and tertiary institutions every year to prepare studdirectsor the future .
In this way , public spending on the elderly should be balanced with other sectors .
In addition , with the limitation on the elderly , people would be encouraged to work harder to accumulate more wealth before they retire .
It would tremendously relief the government's burden as they could support themselves in their old age .
However , some may argue that the government should provide more public spending on health services instead of encouraging the elderly to later retirement .
It may seem true in some way as the elderly have less ability to perform as well as younger work force .
More funds should be invested in health services instead of paying salaries to the working elderly .
However , there are increasing pressures on social benefits including health services fund especially during economic crisis .
The limited fund could only be used in those more deserving areas such as public health services; therefore , the elderly should be encouraged to work harder to reduce the fiscal dependency .
In conclusion , there must be some limitation on the public spending in order to divert the money to other areas contributed in country's development .
The elderly should be encouraged to work harder to support themselves in their old age .
With many countries successfully practising cost-containment measures on health care , a lot of perspectives can be learned to spend the public funding within the limitation .
Besides , considerable efforts should also be made to educate the public to lead a more healthful life .
agedThe problem of an aging population is increasingly affecting more countries .
In the developed countries , due to reasons like better healthcare and pany downsizing or the likes of it can take the opportunity to improve on their skills and move up the corporate ladder .
Thus , this not only benefitincreasee , it also benefits the general public as a whole .
cutforIn conclusion , although spending money on the elderly can help ease the problem effectively in the short run , it is not a feasible solution , as one must consider the effects in the long run .
By endlessly investing in assisting the elderly , areas of country developments will be overlooked , resulting in more serious social problems like unemployment .
Thus , spending on the aged should be limited so te financial resources c butsed to fund other areas of development , which in the long run , can actually help to ease the problem of an aging population .

In addition , HDB is also building more studio apartments which are suitable for elderly as it is customized with elderly-friendly fskillses and fittings .

Current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process .
Today , the aging problem has begun to drapany .
Therefore , certain enforcements have to be introduced .
For example like employers should be fined heftily if they are found out they refuse to employ people e healthier .
Nowadays , there are many types of supplements available in the market .
For example like pill vitamin , iron , calcium , etc .
The introduction of these supplements is due to people's hectic lifestyle .
Many people have no time to take a balanced diet , so these supplements can help them to get certain nutrition where they did not get from their diet .
However , such supplements have also found to have side effects .
Due to some findings , overtaking supplements can lead to kidney failure or diabetes .
It is because the sodium level in some supplements are too high , then it might lead to kidney failure .
Therefore , it is better for us to gain certain nutrition from natural food like fresh fruits and vegetables .

With an exploding population , a quickly aging people is becoming a major issue in many countries .
With more career minded youngsters , marriage and having children are being postponed to the later stages of their lives .
The increase in the number of aged people has seriously sloe to build up their retiremea country since day one of employment .
Governments have enacted lae in their CPF accounts .1 The money cannot be pared to the youngsters .
Aged people are not able to work as porters , construction workers , and plumbers .
The elderly can opt to work as lecturers and teachers to put their experience to good use .
Mentoring the potential employees enables them to gain experience which would have taken them decades .
They can learn at a faster pace , thanks to the guidance provided .
Department head should be of the elder ones so that they can impart their experience to the young worker .
The payoff of this investment is a highly efficient and the productive workforce .
governmentsNot only that , better working environments should be provided for the elder workers .
Injuries that occur to the aged may permanently disable them .
By installing railings in the bathroom , stairs and creating ramps at entryways , the risk of falls are greatly diminished .
Although this may incur substantial cost , a few thousand dollars in modifications could save tens of thousands of dollars in welfare aid .
These costs are on an average of $34 ,000 per year .4 Working from home is another option that can be considered .
Moreover , ging people can avoid the emotional stress of crowds and traffic congestions when leaving home for work everyday .
an older personAs a conclusion , the policies that have been implemented by governments have countered the issue of aging workforces .
This solution can be further enhanced by employees .
Saving money on the onset of employment should be practiced in preparation for retirement .
Governments should play a part in making investments that provide returns .
The dividends of investments can be credited directly into employees' pension fund accounts .
With the cooperation of government agencies and the private sector , this issue can easily be resolved .
Leaving this issue unchecked means risking the welfare of the elderly , who have given years of their working life to the country .

All of those troubles that the appliance of this policy bringing about may outparison betpanies to hire old people , namely: tax reduction , subsidy for each elder employed , etc .
Moreover , old people may not strong enough to panies try to earn as much as they can .
For all the above reasons , this policy seems to be impractical .
In conclusion , it seems that we are still not ready for an increasing old age population yet .
Despite the government's attempt to ease the aging process , there are still many issues that need further careful consideration .
Having such advanced technology in the current e range munity with sufficient technological/teclonger and healthydge to remain productive and efficient in the labor force despite of their disadvantages .
In conclusion , with the aid of the current technologies and governmental policies , countries can ease its aging process by increasing the fertility rates , encouraging fill obligations and active aging  , reducing elder dependency on government , and lastly , improving the productivity and efficiency of elderly workers .
With these in place , the impact of aging population on the social and economic aspects will be greatly reduced .

The problem of an aging population has been one of the top agendas in national policies and budgets for many politicians all over the world , especially for Singapore .
In the Budget 2007 , three billion has been earmarked for healthcare spending to deal with the issue .
However , Singapore should limit public spending on the aged because it does not provide a long-term solution for the nation and thus it should be spent on other developments that can indirectly but significantly relieve the economic burden of the aging population .
The other developments include medical science , science and technology and lastly , education .
Proponents claim that the government should implement better policies to alleviate the aging population with increasing public spending on mainly medical benefits because illnesses catch up with them as they grow older and the expensive treatments could possibly wipe out their savings accounts .
Compared to other countries such as the USA Singapore does not have as much monetary reserves , therefore it is not feasible .
Singapore has already implemented adequate schemes such as Medishield and Medisave for citizens to pay medical fees which are also heavily subsidised .
Unlimited public spending on the aged would only pose  a long-term problem for the nation .
Instead , it should be diverted to other developments that can aid Singapore's future developments .
Public spending on the aged can be diverted to medical science development .
It can be utilized in more in-depth research that develops new and inexpensive medicinal drugs for the public .
With the occurrence and wide spread of mutant viruses and disease , medical research serves a greater purpose for survival of the infected patients and drugs can be manufactured in large quantities and be easily available for them .
New treatments can also be developed to cure the illnesses encountered by the aged .
Therefore , public spending on medical science not only benefits the aged but also the people  who are diagnosed with virus's or diseases .
In addition , public spending on the aged can be diverted to advancing science and technology .
As Singapore does not have its own natural resource , we can develop new ways to gain these resources in order to be self sufficient .
For example , water has to be purchased from foreign countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia .
If Singapore fails to maintain good relationships with these countries , our lives will be in jeopardy without water .
Fortunately , in the recent development of Newater , water can be 'renewed' .
The government should emphasize on developing new land for high technological agriculture .
Thus public spending in science and technology can alleviate the rising cost of food which deals with the problem of the increasing population .
Lastly , public spending on the aged can be diverted to educate the younger generation on financial planning so that they can save enough for their retirement .
Most of the younger generation do not have the habit of saving because they have not been told or taught on how to deal with future obstacles they may face in the later years .
Therefore , it is necessary to improve their knowledge of planning for the future through financial planning so that they can cope with aging .
In this way , they will be less dependent on the government in the future .
In conclusion , the government should limit public spending on the aged and focus more on the major future developments which can help Singapore tackle the main problems that the majority of the local population faces , and also the root of the aging population .
Therefore , the aging population would be less of a burden to many politicians on how to allocate the national budget every year to cope with the problem .

Public spending , in terms of taxes , refers to the sum of money charged by the government for specific facilities or services , levied upon incomes , property , sales , and more .
Some of the taxes include Income Tax , Property Tax , as e such an indispensable part of our lives that to the majority of people , it appears to be a norm to complete the panies .
As changes occur every day , moderthe budgeton occurs , nee and is therefore vital for them to develop in this area .
For example , Maldiveand theelles only earn the opportunity for employment in the tourism service industries .
It includes hospitality services , such as hotels and resorts , transportation services , such as airlines , cruise ships and taxis , as well as entertainment venues , such as shopping malls , amusement parks and casinos .
Thus , government initiatives for the tourism industry are important , to enhance growth throughout the country by promoting the development of the industry and also to increase employment opportunities by creating more jobs available for them .
hasof tenHowever , on the other hand , though should be limited , adequate percentage of public spending for the aged should be allocated fairly .
The reason being , mansectorsrly are being neglected by their own children , and thus uninsured .
They might not have enough money to get their regular medical checkups done .
So , does this means that they are to die ?
This problem would continue to get worst every year if there is an inadequate of ourention paid .
Though it is important to solve the problem of the graying society , we should limit our public spending in this sector so that we can allow more budget on the other aspects of a country's development , such as the transportation infrastructure .
A significant level of road traffic can be created due to the high density of an urban environment .
This can have a great impact on businesses and environmental factors .
Therefore , careful planning and development of the transportation system are crucial .
More money should be used to develop this infrastructure in order to support the moving of goods from one place to another efficiently and effectively .
Parking space is another concern .
For example , in Singapore where land scarcity poses a big issue , multi-storey carparks are built to allow more vehicles to be parked given the same land area used .
In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited to the certain percentage that is adequate for the welfare of the aged .
On top of that , public spending should also be diverted across different aspect of social concerns that lead to the development of Singapore .
By putting a limit for the spending on the aged , we can create more budgets to spend on the education , research and development , tourism industry and transportation system as they are equally important to our nation .

Most of the elderly still rthe youngervulnerable to the aging process and improvements can be made to create a less painful process .
For instance , government can lighten the aged burden of medical expenses by subsidizing one of the visits to the polyclinic for an amount up to a hundred dollar every six months .
In any case , for any policies to be effective , government have to continuously revise them by analyzing the current situation and making adjustments to the policies accordingly .
Government must not forget to consider whether they are putting too heavy a burden on the current generation .
To summarize , a balance must strike between responsibility of individual , government and their family members .
Populations in many developed nations are facing a demographic time bomb in the form of an ageing population , and Singapore is no exception .
This is largely due to the fact that Singapore encountered a baby boom betmunal and recreational facilities for the aged .

A declining  population and a longer life expectancy results in an aging population , causing a high dependency ratio in some countries .
This creates further problems such as a less efficient economy and a rise in public expenditure to meet the increasing needs of the elderly .
Hence , solutions have been suggested to reduce the heavier burden of the young in future , and one of the solutions proposed is to limit public spending on the aged .
The idea that public spending on the aged should be limited so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development is feasible as these developments may actually help to gain greater benefits for the aged .

breakthroughsThe trend of an aging population is becoming more common noe increasingly significant in proportion in the society of many developed countries today .
The problems pertaining to the process of aging are also becoming more prominent .
Today , ing more common and readily available to the aged .
The American Society of Plastic Surgeons  has reported that more than 6 .3 million e more affordable to the majority of the aging population .
Thus , current developments in aesthetic medicine can greatly help to ease the physical process of aging .

As the population age , it is more difficult for them to plement one another so as to ensure the entire aging population receives a form of financial support when they are in need .
As such , it is possibly true to say that the current social policies can indeed help to ease the aging process to a large degree .
In conclusion , the aging process is indeed one that is difficult to cope with but with the current medical technologies and a wide range of social policies and reforms the elderly are more protected .
The policies intends to cater to benefit as many aged as possible and thupasses is possibly true to say that the technologies and the policies have helped the majority of aging population to cope with their problems more effectively today .

One of the difficulties is the increase in life expectancy , the result of considerable improvement to life's quality , ferentiations , lomitment from and lack of apared to other Asian countries to attain high workability from this programme and hopefully , it can reach the higher level of living condition when the health care and employability policies are implemented .
In this modern es more petition as can be seen by multi national companies moving to lopetition is bound to reach more advanced levels .
In order to do so , education plays an important role .
Hence , there is a need for public spending on it in terms of better training for teachers , better school facilities such as advanced technological equipments and schemes for an all rounded curriculum .

Furthermore , community activities are modate should not beinterests .
However , if any spending were to be done regarding this aspect , it could be spent on promoting the establishment of more non-profit organizations volunteering and holding charity events to help ease the elderly problems .
In conclusion I would like to reiterate the point that we do admit that the elderly are assets to the society .
Should any spending be done , it would be to hold campaigns to promote elderly importance so as to reduce abandonment , or promoting an increase in volunteering organizations , and improving foster homes and hospices should the facilities be inadequate .
Ultimately , we have to be realistic in this global context and focus more of our spending on advancements in factors affecting the more preeconomicssue of economic stability and inter-country relations .
planThe impact of globalization on our society has been repared to those in past generations .
Due to the rapid economic gromonly supported by substantial insurance policies and personal savings .
On average , the e , the burden will fall back on the working population through less direct and more expensive means; which is liable for higher taxes .
Instead , the society will face a wider range of issues related to education , housing and even transportation which creates a negative pressure on the economy of the nation .
partlatterIssue in regards to the graying population requires a balance effort from both the government and its citizens .
Educating the mass on the essential of financial stability in the far future is one of the solutions for cultivating a habit of saving among the mass .
Not only that , the majority of the population will understand the importance of saving and built up responsibility for oneself as well as their love ones .
There should be a substantial boundary in the financial and welfare support for the aging population .
The transitions and consequences will be easier if we are better prepared .

Hence , public spending on the aged should be limited in order for funds to be sub-divided among the education , tourism and the R&D sectors which are the main sources of revenue .
In tur the National University of Singapore (NUS) , and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are leading local universitiesa whole .
Setting limits on  spending on the aged would raise indignation among the elderly , especially among people without  savings , poor single women , and the illiterate .
Some may say it is inhumane to limit  spending on the aged .
However , policy makers should always look at the interests of the whole country rather than just focusing on one particular area .
Additionally , the government can conduct specific tests such as the means- test for those who really require financial support .
In conclusion ,  .
Money saved from reduced spending on the aged can then be invested in other areas for instance education .
When  education is enhanced , graduates  have a higher chance of getting a job and hence contributing to the economic development of the country .
In addition , together with the development of economy , the young adults would be capable of supporting their parents .
Furthermore , they could enjoy high living standards and security in life .
Generally , the government would have enough budget to empower the stable development of the country , and to maintain the welfare and pension system at an acceptable level .
To illustrate that these are only some  of the many benefits which  can be achieved from reducing spending on the aged .
To conclude , it is vital for the government to limit  spending on the aged to a reasonable level , so money can be invested in different aspects of the country's development .
In the short run , the country may face difficulties , but in the long run it will be beneficial to  society .

In viee to their account , a Update- What Physicians ans' the Public Need Tocitizens who are currently employed at work
Population aging is progressing rapidly in many countries and in the near future , this may push up the public spending on social security and healthcare costs .
In view of  the aging population problem , some people argued that we should not limit  public and financial assistanceto the elderly because of  the increasing number of elderly in an aging population .
However , the increase in public spending means that working people may need to pay higher taxes , as public spending is supported mainly by taxation .
Minford and Wang  stated that researches have shown that the increase in tax to GDP had reduced GDP growth and lowered the output per worker .
In an aging population , having increasing tax contribution from the shrinking workforce can be a burden to the working people .

Thus , current researchd development in these areas are required to further ease the problems .

Some might think that rather than having to research for and develop better economic policies , the government should  allocate  public funds tothe   .
Hopact , portable blood sure monitor .
Thus , all these research  , but insteadl has aided the aging process tremendously .
One of the biggest issues the e too reliable on the government .
They may not take the initiative to sis their money for future uses .
This could create serious problems for the government as it pared to people of the same age in the past .
The life today is very much different from the past .
The advances in research and development have made it possible to cure illnesses that are otherwise deadly .
For instance , according to the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports  in Singapore , the percentage of residents aged 55 years and above who are physically independent are as high as 92 .2% in year 2005 .
This means that they are capable of finding a job to support themselves and not depending on others .
This is also proven by the fact that the Ministry of Manpower  increased the retirement age in Singapore from 55 to 62 and the age is still expected to increase to 65 by year 2012 .
More elderly are now able to participate in the workforce actively .
Minimum help should be required from the government and so public spending on the aged should be limited .
formAnother reason why public spending should be limited is because a country does not only conegative impact aged .
There are other sectors that needed the government's help .
If the government spending on the aged is not limited , the other sectors will be neglected .
The education sector will be an example .
The education sector is very important to a country as it nurtures the young and turns them into useful adults .
The government helps them by issuing bursaries scholarships to encourage students to study hard and help those who are poor but are eager to go to school .
Without setting a limit on the government funds spent on the aged , all these will not be possible .
There will be lesser amount of skilful adults in the workforce and this may in turn slow down the economy .
Without economic growth , the government may face a deficit .
Taxes may have to increase and takes a bigger toil on the people .
Hence , it is imporhave filedto limit the public spending on the aged so as to divert it to iser areas in the country's development .
without having to dependIn conclusion , it is important to limit the spending on the aged so that people will not be too reliable on the government .
They sho and so are capable of supporting themselves .
A country does not only consist of the aged and spending too much government funds on the aged will cause a negative impact on the economy and is unnecessary .
worriesenjoy their livestwilighttheirgivesThe Cmplementation of Tax Relief Scheme such as Aged Parent Relief is also an important step to improve the retirement security as they encourage children to take are of their parents , thereby easing the a) .ing process .
At this point , one may take advantage of this scheme to claim the tax reliefs for own use as it is nearly impossible for the governmo keep track of where the money is spend on .
Thus the elderly parents may not be at the receiving end .
While this may indeed happen , the government ofs taken a further step to discourage this from happening .
For instance , the government has passed the Maintenancefinancially independentow elderly parents to file lawsuit against their childran an who have fain ,  ed to carry out filial obligations .
Hence , this ar ,t has helped to deter the children from making use of the tax relief scheme inappropriately and has also sustained the main objective of the scheme promote filial piety .
the Chus , with the potential "loophole" being dealt with , the tax rell be able tothemselvesp in lessening the financial burden the Chat the children have to take on from looking after their parents .
All these h to encourage children to look after their pelderly pthe Crents will be at the receiving end .
Hence , these approaches have increased the seniors' confidence and security towards their sunset years .
Many countries are facing the problems brought about byan aging population  .
For instance , the workforce gets smaller as elder workers retire and the working class has to pay more taxes because of  a slower economic growth and the need to provide more healthcare services for the aged .
Even though the world is facing an aging population , public spending should not be spent only on the aged as there are many other areas that need to be taken care of in a country's  development .
The aging population is already a problem in many countries such as Japan and Singapore .
Therefore , public spending had been reviewed to address this problem and  to reduce the negative impact of the aging problems  .
However , due to  practical reasons , a country has its limitations in supporting the aged .
Hence , countries should assess the other important areas that public spending should be focused on as well .
On the other hand , if public spending on the aged were reduced , many social problems would arise in the country .
As the aged are used to receiving allowances and subsidies , the lack of government aids might affect their lives .
They would be unable to support themselves , especially with the increasing  healthcare costs .
According to the Singapore Department of Statistics , the Consumer Price Index for healthcare had  increased  3 .6% from February 2008 to February 2009 .
This would mean higher costs of living for the aged .
Therefore , in this case , moral issues need to be considered as well .
Children of the aged they should do their part in taking care of their parents after their retirement .
In conservative countries such as Singapore , children are expected to taking care of their parents by providing them with allowances to meet their daily needs .
Children should remember how their parents have taken care of them when they were young and hence , should do their part in demonstrating  filial piety and take care of their aged parents , instead of relying on the country to help .
In order to ensure that the aged are properly taken care of by their children , government could introduce policies and enforce them  .
This would help to enforce  moral values and also directly reduce public spendingthat could be diverted to other areas of development .
Other areas of development include addressing social issues such as the decrease in the birthrate and the increase in child abuse cases .
In Singapore , the Marriage and Parenthood package with the extension of the Baby Bonus attained only marginal success in increasing the birthrate of Singaporeans .
The median age of citizen mothers at first birth had increased over the years from 28 .6 in 1998 to 29 .4 in 2008 , thus causing the fertility rate for the prime childbearing age group of 20 to 34 to decline .
Hence , public spending could be used to introduce more programs and subsidies to encourage people having larger families instead .
With increased birthrate , Singapore would be able to resolve the problem of aging population in the near future .
Besides aging population , other social issues such as child abuse are also crucial problems that need to be addressed .
According to the Social Statistics 2009 conducted by the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , the number of child abuse cases investigated in Singapore had increased from 154 in 2007 to 176 in 2008 .
This significant increase indicates that attention should be diverted to address this problem .
Public spending could be used to ensure that there are ways to reach out to the abused victims in the society .
In addition , it is essential to increase public awareness through campaigns and seminars to givethe public a better understanding on child abuse .
With this , the society could play a part in creating a safer environment for children and hence , enhancing the social development in Singapore .
Even though many countries are facing aging population , there is a still a limit on what can be done .
Thus , countries should not be overwhelmed by the problems of aging population and overlook other potential problems .
In conclusion , public spending should be used on the aged but also not neglecting other problems  which hinder the country's development .
Too much of the nation's budget is being spent on aiding the elderly and the government should limit and channel these funds to other more important areas for the country's development .
For most countries , part of their national budget pulsory CPF and Medisave savings both require citizens to set aside part of their salary to meet their future retired needs .
Even if the elderly can support themselves , some may argue that they pay taxes and should be allopetitive ibenefitsnomy and achieve sustained economic growth .
Public spending refers to the expenditure incurred the government , which may include expenses on  military , health , education , infrastructure , development projects , and the cost of servicing  overseas borroes , as measured by lifeloancy .
But problems ,are likely to cause Se to ensure fairness in the financing of social insurance systesteadycluding the nee a society , the prevention aapopulation health initiatives , and the higher aing wave of retiring Baby Boomers may wash away projected budget surpluses , erode existing spending priorities .
For example in American , it is already estimated that over half of federal domestic spending outside of interest goes to people 65 and older .
Other harm is that the burden of the government will increase as the richer old people will take hold of healthcare policies , offing money to the old that do not truly needs help .
For example , in the Korea , there is pressure for increased outlays on pensions , healthcare .
Thus it requires additional tax revenue .
As a conclusion , the public spending on the aged should be limited , so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Many countries , including Singapore , are facing the issue of  aging population .
There are many implications for this issue and one of them is that the spending by the government on the aged has increased in order to deal petitive with other countries in the future .
Therefore , in t long run , spending on education will generate ect , nomic benefits for the country .
On the other hand , if this same amount of money is to be spent on the aged , there will be no economic benefits geso thatrated by them for the country .
Hence , if the government does not limit the spending on the aged , smaller budget will be left for developing education .
This may affects the country in long run .
workedTo limittobenefitsdevelopinglessenedFrom this essay , I conclude that there is a need to limit public spending on the aged as a largerare other areas that require mdevelopment for the couvelopment .
After all , the aged is not the onthe economy that we should lookcountry'shen deciding othe governmentcation of public spending .
There is a need for government to take a wider perspective of the different areas that need money as much as theaged when deciding owealth money to spend in each area .
Throughout the entire world ,  leaders of developed countries are concerned with the problems of an aging  population .
A country's budget would be spent in a few key areas such as defense , healthcare , environment , transport , research and development and education .
Public spending on the aged is necessary but should be limited in order for the money to be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
If majority of the spending is focused on the aged , it would limit the growth of the country  , which  would consequently lower the standard of living for all .

Although spending on the elderly is inevitable in the face of aging population , careful ss'ding is necessary in diluting the effect of fiscal consequences .
The government has a duty to take care of the aging population .
However , they should limit  public spending on the aged .
The responsibility to look after the aged should be shouldered by the children as well .
In addition , the aged could prepare themselves for their old age  , and thus reduce the burden of others .
Limiting  public spending on the aged reduces their dependency on the government .
Also , more money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
Ageing population is a pervasive phenomenon affecting countries worldwide .
Governments have been working on strategies to deal with this problem .
One of the strategies is to increase the birth rate of the country .
For example , Singapore has implemented the baby bonus scheme to lighten the financial costs of raising children .
However , the government not only has to deal with reducing ageing population ,  but also to attend to the needs of the aged  .
There is a need to subsidize the aged for their healthcare , transport , facilities  .
More public spending has to be channeled to cater to the needs of the aged .
One may argue that public spending on the aged could be used on the country's development .
The development of the country is important but public spending on the aged should never be limited under all circumstances .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited .
The aged  deserves to receive the best welfare given by the country .
It is known that they had contributed to the country  during the prime  of their lives .
Their contributions should be recognized .
A practical way of recognizing their contribution is to provide them with subsidies and growth packages .
By limiting public spending on the aged , it may signify that the government perceives  the country's development to be as more important than the welfare of the people .
Some  people would resent the government for seeing development more important than its people .
In  extreme cases , some of them would hold protests to vent their anger towards the government .
There could be a social backlash if the government were to limit the public spending on the aged .
The people may view  the government as not wanting to take care of the aged , and see them as a burden .
This could cause the people to be skeptical about their welfare  in  future .
The morale of the local workforce could be affected .
Some people may seek to migrate to countries that will look after the welfare of the aged .
And the migration of the workforce would lead to a shortage of workers in the country .
Shortage of labour would impede the growth of the country .
Therefore , this would affect economic development of the country  .
On the other hand , limiting the amount of public spending  on the aged could help the country to develop more effectively during a crisis .
If the country faced an economic downturn , its revenue would be reduced .
This calls for a need for the government to spend on areas which could boost the economy .
Money should be spent more wisely in helping the country to get out of an economic downturn .
With  reduced revenue , the government should be more flexible in limiting the public spending on the aged .
By limiting  spending on the aged ,  the government will have more funds available to get the country out of an economic downturn .
More public funds could be allocated to education , and upgrading the skills for workers and building projects .
In the economic downturn , the government could use  their reserve funds instead .
This could be a morale booster for the people because the spending on the aged  is not reduced despite the economic downturn .
Limiting public spending on the aged is important because it indirectly controls the funds mit on the ageing population as different levels pared to America and their level of investmdifficultyrin decidingearch and develfundss lopetitive gloto helpingnomy .
With lpopulationds being pumped into areas such as technology and infrastructures , investments may flow out when other nations offer better incentives .
This would then lead to an overall fall in the revenue of a country whicamountp in the public spending on the aged  .
Thus , it can be seenamountnegative results are being achieved with neither the aging population nor the country's economy benefitting from it .
d ,intodevelopmentsHowever , it may be argued ta low countriesch as Britain arefortill progressing well in the global economy despite a high level of spending on the aged population showing that a low limitation on public spending s not eqspending for the ageda halt in the progress of a country .
Iitsition , the low level of limitation would mean itsquality healthcare are being catered to the elderly as sufficient money are being invested in them , this may lead a healthier ageing population which may then contain the spread of elderly illnesses  .
This containment could possibly lead , though ita fall in money being diverted to the aged population as they are healthier nofundsence increasing the funds being diverted to other areas of a country's developfrom being

theFor a country to do e more pressing in recent years .
True enough , Singapore has been successful in avoiding any direct conflicts with other countries .
However , nation security will always be one of the most important aspects to a country .
The consequence of a weak military has the potential to destroy an entire nation especially one which is as small as ours .
This dire effect is something we cannot afford , thus , investing in military good will definitely be one of the top priorities of the government .

Governments nowadays are  also doing more for the elderly population in their society .
here are various financial concerns about these methods .
In the case of government pensions , the heavy spending of public fund on the old aged may take a toll on other areas of the nation's development .
Thus a method that works in a society may not work in another and sometimes , multiple approaches have to be taken .
However , better healthcare and protection from government result in rising age expeccy , which is a double-edged sword because on one hand , people live longer as shown in report  and on the other hand , the proportion of aging population increases if the younger generation are not rd this is exactly the trepeople today in developed nations .
In the fast-paced society nowadays , there are several factors , such as high living cost and late marriage , discouraging people from reproducing "If fertility rates do not rise again , the problem will worsen as the median age in many first-world countries will reach 51 by 2050 ," as claimed by Peterson .
As the number of elderly increases , with a great potion due to the baby boom , tre might not be enough young people in the workforce to support the economy and generate enough money for healthcare subsidies and government pension as mentioned previously .
While there are temporary measures to alleviate this problem , such as rising the retirement age and importing foreign workers , the key is still to increase the fertility rate .
onefundsThe aging process has been eased with the modernization of our society as better healthcare technology and government welfare are available to serve the elderly .
However , this revolution has generated a rising aging population which would be a problem to all levels of the society .
Governments in developed countries should look beyond temporary solutions to rising aging pand focus on getting people to reproduce .
While there are initiatives like maternity welfare and baby bonus to encourage reproduction , I believecan be done and hope for the better .

As government , it is their responsibility to take care and ensure that their citizens are not suffering and to ease their plight , especially in times of recession .
The elderly had played their part in their younger days by payelderly havees and it is only reasonable for the government to repay them .
With the inflating cost of health care in Singapore , it is inevitable for the government to implement necessary schemes suit can be arguededisave and Medishield .
However , Singapore should not be dependent on the government for fiscal aid .
In the context of the elderly , the reason why government has to spend a lot of money on them is due to the fact that children nowadays are abandoning their parents either in hospitals or old folk homes .
Why are children doing so ?
Burress  argues that we should care for our parents and shower thave resorted to abandoningand attention beIt is the responsibility of the government to take care ofr golden years .
However , unpleasant and traumatic experiences from childhood may be the reasons that push children to desehave playedarents .
The children now hold a grudge against the parents and refuse to provide for them now that they are grown up .
However , not all parents are like that .
Children the government cannot avoid implementingents .
They have cared for us when we were young .
If we look back and consider the living conditions in the past , their sacrifices made then are no match for anything we would ever do in the present .
The value of filial piety has no significant meaning in Singapore's "individualistic world view ," as mentioned by Assistant Professor Joonmo Son from National University of Singapore  .
However , the children have to realise that by not assuming their responsibilities to care for their parents , it would affect the whole society .
Tax prices may need to be increased to meet the needs of providing financial aid for the aged .
In conclusion , public spending on the elactively and with dignityer to a certain extent .
We could not rely on the government as they too have other areas of development to look out for .
Furthermore , not every parent is lucky enough to have children who could love them and fulfil their wants and needs .

In the middle Ages , most people were lucky if they lived to be 40 years old .
By the end of the 20th century , the average life expectancy had reached the early 70s .
For most of us living today , it is not unusual for us to grow up knowing our grand parents and great-grand parents .
Some people even remember their great-great grand parents .
To a large extent , current research and development have helped to ease the aging process .
There are several reasons for this increased aging situation such as this increase in life expectancy .
Through the use of these specific reasons and examples , this essay will demonstrate why especially in the field of medicine .
Secondly , people today are more aware of the effect of healthy living on their life expectancy .
For example , even as late at the 1950s , many people were not aware that eating too many large portions of steak and potatoes and other foods rich in carbohydrates and cholesterol could significantly increase their likelihood of a heart attack .
Also , people were not aware of the links between habits such as alcoholism and cigarette smoking and diseases such as liver disease and cancer .
Today , medical research , both traditional and holistic , stresses the importance of healthy eating and exercise in increasing one's life expectancy .
Thus , our increased life expectancy is largely due to advances in medical research .
However , it is also due to people's willingness to accept the results of such research and to apply them by eating better and exercising more .
Many scientists predict that our average life expectancy will slowly continue to increase as medicine finds more cures for diseases that are still terminal today .
This long term solution oflook at this problem fromthe governmentthe aging populationthe aging populationthe current high cost of living .Studies have shown that Britain's National Health Service , (Jonathan Eyal , 20 August 2009) .lessSwedengenerally havecitizenstaxesOver the years , public spending such as in the form of healthcare benefits and subsidies for the aged has increased .

The government this problem in an economic perspective in the long run .
The country'st allocation should place greater emphasis on education for the younger generation .
If the younger generation is munity petitive edge , and thus munity in the long run .
Lastly , educating the younger generation is essential to a nation's economithoserowth .
To conclude , the importance in the development of other areas clearly surpasses that of spending on the elderly .

Aging population is higher levelsajor issues we face in the future .
If the problem is not dealt with properly , this may eve (Friedland and Summer , 2005) .evelopment .
Therefore , I feel that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
In recent years , many countries have begun to face the  issue of ageing demographics and undeniably , Singapore is one of the fastest ageing populations in Asia .
Population ageing petitors and to improve a society's performance .
For example , Research and Development in pharmaceutical is particularly important as the creation of nees to the topic of dividing the public funding .
No doubt that it is essential to take care of the elderly who have contributed much to the society during their younger days , but the government must still ensure that there is enough funding on other areas of the country's development .
Economic growth must never be sacrifice as the society as a whole must progress and achieve further advancement .
Since Neil Armstrong left the first human footprint on the moon , it has ale the third strongest country in terms of the space technology , only after the America and Russia .
But hoe first , thyears ofelopment of space technology is a basic need of economic boost .
China is undergoing a rapid development in economy .

citizens ,humansIn Singapore , innovation is one of the key economic drivers .
An innovation is an idea , practice or object that is perceived as nemencement of processes is already hindered .
In short , this problem
Malaysia is generally a failure in terms of innovations .
According to E .M . Rogers in "The Generation of Innovations" , the six main stages in the innovation-decision process are the needs/problems , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption , and last but not least the consequences .
Hoing out ?
Try to find solutions for all the problems ?
No e a famous country for its people's innovation and creativity in the future .
- healthresources areEarth'sThe , is essential to help reduce the amount of pollutants in our air atmosphere .
The problem has to be clearly defined so that researchers and engineers alike have the same concept about the human need to recognize this need for a nemunicate and sell an idea is an critical skill in engineering design .
Last but not least , the solution is implemented and a patent , mon sense comes into play when certain steps do not play a part in the engineering design process .
Last but not least , alternative fuels do not rely on oil from Middle Eastern , owing to the advanced technology used to make renewable fuels opens up an entire dimension of ethicality .
The technology can build country energy independence , and thus regional geo-political stability .
It is an indispensable asset that many countries strongly support and endeavor to adopt .
After analysing the topic , I understand the main issue is about the problems and obstacles e up e independent .
It was on that very day tina , the "huge dragon" was added the wings .
Furthermore , the aviation industry of China got developed rapidly land China is able to produce many kinds of aircraft with high-tech now .
However , things were not always going well .
In the first place , it was quite a challenge for China to set up its manufactories to produce planes in a rather big scale because of the lack of resources and equipments; then the situation of unstable state of government emerged and dragged back the total industry dramatically .
Quite early in the 1910s , the government of China started to prepare for setting up aircraft manufactories .
The engineers tried so hard that they were able to design the first aircraft in 1923 .
However , till 1949 , there were only over a dozen of small manufactories with shabby devices and few planes were produced .
Worse , the necessary raw materials , processed tools and accessory and advanced equipments were all depending on import from other countries , let alone setting up an independent aircraft manufacturing system .
The problem really stunned the aviation industry for a while .
After China got independent , under the cheerful care and proper guidance of Chairman Mao and some other leaders of China , the aviation industry started to enjoy a pleasant time .
The government spent a lot of money sending engineers to study advanced technologies and importing expects from abroad; the other various industries of China all give a great support to the aviation industry , especially by providing resources and funds .
In a few years time , China's aviation industry grew from small to rather large and became able to produce aircrafts of many kinds .
The munications technology .
Wireless communication is the transmission of data or information using electromagnetic munication technology .
Besides these , other examples of devices that use this technology are devices that use the Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , Wi-Max , munications  .
Due to this decision many "unlicensed" munication purposes munication products which help to fill consumers' needs , which in turn helps to generate jobs in manufacturing of these products , logistic costs for transportation of these products to various countries around the globe and finally sales of these products to the end consumers .
andEngineers rarely identify a "need" but rather let the society discover it .
"Need" here refers to a desire or shortage of a commodity , and sometimes this "need" can be considered as a neccessity or a form of luxury .
For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi , an engineer from Toshiba Corporation , saputers and came up es from the burning of gasoline in internal-combustion engines of cars recentlycks .
As the struggle beting yehave gained
"Eureka !"
exclaimed Archimedes , A Greek mathematician and physicist , mon similarity; the technology is ultimately used to tackle the problems of Man .
In the past before the discovery of the space pen , astronauts had difficulty in writing their discoveries with the normal pens as they resulted in leaks in zero gravity space .
Pencils were also strongly avoided as the lead posed a danger in space .
American industrialist and pen manufacturer Paul C .  saw that this was a problem and started working on producing a pen that would allow astronauts to be able to write their discoveries in extreme environments and temperatures .
After years of gruelling research and analysis , the space pen was finally produced .
The same goes for Teflon , which was discovered by chemist Roy Plunkett .
As Teflon is considered to be one of the most slippery substances , it is widely used as a lubricant in the manufacturing industry and as a coating for production tubes in the pharmaceutical industry .
The technology is also used as a repellent against spills and dirt for fabrics , and under the brand name Tefal , the product is used in cooking wares , non-stick pots and pans .
However , despite their similarity in resolving problems of Man , the two technologies also share one differehe process :n which it was discovered .
This would define a research technology from a serendipitous one .
As mentioned above , the invention of the space pen occurred because Fisher realised that astronauts were not able to pen their findings with a typical pen or a pencil .
He saw a need to assist Man in this area , and worked towards producing the ultimate pen .
We cannot say the same for Teflon .
Plunkett's initial aim was to produce a refrigerant that has better thermodynamic properties and safety measures .
He had a different goal .
He was not looking at producing a slippery lubricant and saw another set of problems that had nothing to do with Teflon .
To put it simply , he had no aim to discover Teflon .
Plunkett's accidental finding only occurred when he was testing the chemical reactions of gaseous tetrafluoroethylene   .
In conclusion , both research and serendipitous technologies share differences in their definitions and the pro:ess in which they are discovered .
However , regardless of that fact , both technologies serve an ultimate purpose to provide a much better , easier , and safer environment for Man to work in .

Throughout history , e a key ingredient in our life .
Electricity is a form of energy that is generated mainly from burning fossil fuels .
Homonly found alternate energy sources .
;Solar energy e in many sizes which gives flexibility in positioning them .
Solar pnels do nhavecontain moving parts , unlike the turbines in the windmills or hydroelectric dams .
Hence solar energy is the best choice as the equipments are easier to maintain and safer to use .
The most effective method to harness solar power in Singapore will be to install solar panels on the roofs of all HDB flats .
The majority of housing in Singapore are HDB flats , these flatstestingoorm a considerable amount of land area .
As all HDB flats are under the jurisdiction of a government board , there is no need to seek approval from individual owners to implement this plan .
In conclusion , the most feasible sustainable energy source for Singapore will be solar energy .
This scheme is highly probably because the government has control over a large number of HDB flats , which constitutes to a large land area .
We will need to put this into motion as soon as possible .
Sindesign acentury , the environment has been polluted because of the fast development of industries and economics .
Nopare one solution with another , ranking according to the attributes for the solution is necessary for us to see with one the best , in our case , environmentally-friendly should be the major criteria .
Then , analyze each solution against the criteria we have , and rate each solution , in our case .
At last , choose the most scored one for the next process .

Technologies created from research undeniably have lots of background research .
This is proven just by looking at the amount of research needed before measures taken a bettereloped a safer automobile as well as better design of highways .
The research span can be years ,decades or even longer before the technology can be successfully developed .
However , this is different for technologies originated from serendipitous discovery .
There are no background research for these technologies , as they are created out of pure coincidence .
With reference to Post-it pads , they are created without any background research .
The researchers simply found a way to utilize the bonding agent years later which led to the product Post- it pads .
Hence , there it can be said that there is background research for technologies originated from research while there might not be any background research for technologies created from serendipitous discovery .

However , when Wilson Greatbatch , inven-he implantable pacemaker , inserted a wrong resistor and discovered a different reaction , it led to the invention of the first implantable pacemaker .
Therefore , it is obvious that the cause which led to the invention is very different where in the case of the laptop which , it was already intended since before its creation whereas in the case of the implantable pacemaker , its creation was never intended .

Today , the change in climate is being labeled as one of the main threats that are affecting the existence of humankind .
For example , global e out e out ed by the public .
Even if one of the tests fails , we could apply the engineering design process to solve the problems that developed in the process of the testing .
In conclusion , the engineering design process would be able to help problemslop an environmentally friendly product to help preserve the environment .
Therefore , it proves to be a good method to solve most of our needs .

Transportation is a necessity that humans cannot live e up plete market survecarsn the reasons parison on the latest hybrid cars suchdoess electric cars , hydrogen fuel cell cars and solar powered cars to see which one is more efficient and suitable .
Willingness to take risks and experiment with new alternative fuels are also important so that more creative ideas can be generated .
Then , we proceed to the next stage of analyzing the various solutions and selecting the best one .
As highlighted by Khandani , there are some factors that may need to be considered in the analysis such as the product safety , functional analysis , market analysis and mechanical analysis .
The hybrid cars should be tested for its safety and functionality .
For instance , solar powered hybrid cars need to be ensured that it has enough energy to function well in the night .
Hydrogen fuel cell cars must have a practical way of emitting water as its waste .
We also need to analyze the safety of the designs .
If it is below par , we can add adequate safety features or a thoroestablishesuction manual to it .
Lastly , after going through rigorous analyzing and selecting the final design , we need to make a prototype of the hybrid car and test its overall function in real world situations .
Thsuch fuels will reveal the weaknesses in the designbetweenhence the engineers can improve on it .
We also need to test and check various criteria so that the hybrid car meets the needs of the consumers .
Documentation and patent on the overall design should be done at thisstage .
Then , we need to execute extensive marketing and awareness campaign to get consumers to buy the hybrid car .
To conclude , engineering a new design of environmentally friendly hybrid car helps to reduce pollution by using green fuels such as electric and solar power .
Creative engineering design can produce a paradigm shift for people to start using environmentally friendly cars due to all its positive advantages .
Noputerized transports .
By replacing drivers puterizations , manpoing increasingly costly .
One such example would be the price of petrol .
Therefore , through discovery of new form of convenient and renewable energy , the price of energy could be more stable .
With a more stable price , it reduces the chance of a big change that could lead to economy problems .
Given the current shaky economy , another big upset would have an adverse effect on our lives .
Therefore , a stable economy is essential for us to progress in technology and having a more reliable source of energy is the key to it .
To sum up , a stable and better economy is the current human need that should be given priority to engineer designs .
Engineers could design or discover better transports , electrical appliances and energy to ensure a better and more stable economy .
With a better economy , more energy could be invested into the research sector to discover more inventions to improve our lives .
Inventions that could save , lengthen lives or make life more enjoyable .

In the USA , the nuclear pomissioning cost is $300 million .
In fact , these costs are all affordable compared e , we can get a suitable replacement for fossil resources .
Not only does design entail a magnificent facade or the strangery in our country , and the studying in other learning centers takes up almost all time of students , they tends metpcurricular activities in school .
Howevery since "people have a natural tendency to aforack the current solution to a problem rather than the problem itself"  .

Innovation engineering has been a commonly recurrent phrase in the industries in the recent years .
Hoe in the form of time , petition they face from the others .
Hence , engineers panies to allocate resources for innovation , and at the same time , keep the company's competitive edge in the market .
Due to this problem , fresh ideas would not even have a chance to be developed , least to say , move towards the implementation of the idea .

According to the nee an innovation .
Most engineers or designers are reluctant to even try inventing or making innovative products as they knofort zone will greatly affect the very first stage of the engineering design process , "Identifying a need" .
It will be very hard for Singapore to discover what it still needs when its people are content with what they already had .
On the other hand , Singapore's small economic market is affecting the second and third building stages in the engineering design processes , "Defining the problem and Conducting research" .
A small economic market is preventing engineers and designers from defining problems and conducting research as they fear it will most likely be non-profitable or at a loss .
In conclusion , the two main factors contributing to the hampering of enrankedering design processes for innovations in Singapore are caused by Singapore's small economic market and its population holding a resistant to change .
The process ofa high GDPng and innovations are crucial to all of us .

Nevertheless , there are some problems which significantly hamper engineera country'sn processes fsocietyhoCurrentlyryalaysia and se the impacts on certain stages of the process of engineering design .
Other than financial problem , we are also facing the problem of lack of professionals in certain engineering fields such as mechanical engineering , chemical engineering and electrical engineering .
Much of the research  engineering design  carried out in  modern countries  been done successfully .
This is because there are many professionals in their countries .
In fact , the lack of professionals in engineering fields has resulted in the failure of some research .
For instance , some of the automobile research   due to the lack of  professionals .
The stage of analysis of design solution has been constrained because of  limited knowledge and lack of professionals .
Hence , some forums on engineering design should be held between our country and other modern countries  .
For instance , the forum on how to manufacture an eco-car can be held in order to help us exchange our opinions with the professionals from modern countries .
In a nutshell , financial problem and lack of professionals in my home country should be solved as soon as possible to improve our engineering design processes  .
Hence , the private sector , the government and also citizens should work hand in hand in order to encourage more investment in engineering design research and produce more professionals in the field of engineering design in the future .

human exploitationdepletedhave beensubstitute forAccording to Khandani's statement "What distinguishes engineers from painters , poets , or sculptors is that engineers apply their creative energies to producing products or systems that meet human needs" , all engineering designs aim to meet human demands  .

Engineers are indispensable .
Their achievements are influencing the developments of every industry .
As the application of engineering spreads , femon: to meet people's needs .
People's need is so various that one prime need must be given priority to avoid distractions .
In today's monly recognized that fresh water will be the scarcest resource in the follow century .
Some people even assume that the next world war will be fought for the limited fresh water on the earth .
In order to ensure human's survival and the peace of world , engineers should respect the human's need for water most when designing products .
One aspect engineer should work on to meet peoplinfluenceer is to reduce he pollution in engineering process .
Pollution is one main reason for water scarcity .
To be exact , there is never a lack of water on the earth , but pollution damaged most of the available waneedssarerces , such as rivers and lacks .
Pollution in water is often caused by waste emission generated in industry processes .
To solve this foroblem , the best way is to emphasis environmental friendliness when engineers design machines or develop new procedures for industry use .
This can stop pollution to water more thoroughly than government's fine on water pollution .
humans'world peacehumans'because offollowingIt isIn addition , engineers can design devihumansat can save water .
People are using water everywheregulationoand industryn in industry .
Therefore , if device can avoid wasting water in daily life of each person , it will surely save considerably large amount of water .
Small device like taps , water coolers , washing machines , can all be the targets of engineers .
Engineers should attach importance to water-efficiency together with other efficiencies regardigAing device , so that enough water can be conse ,vwd tomeet people's need .
inlakesTo sum up , engineersing should give priority to people's need for water first , aater is necessthe engineeringan's survival .
In order to highlight this need , engineers should emphasis on environmental friendliness anater saving in designing .

Next , this is another product which works alike as the previous product .
But other than the features that the "MEMSwear" has , this product has additional functions ) .
One of the functioan array that upon receiving an alert when the user has a serious fall , it would dial for ambulance immediately .
This would greatly reduce the consequences of the fall if actions are taken within a shorter time .
Another additiondoneuontion is the implementation of a temperature sensor .
For instance , in the case of a fire , the temperature sensor will be alerted and sends warning alerts to their caregivers or call for Civil Defense Force immediately .
Furthermore , when considering the design of the producmadehere is eed to make special considerations that are suitable for the elderly use .
Those factors that migheed to tpopulation ,onsideration when designing the product are inflexible movements nd slow response time .
Engineering would have to use the engineering design processes to list out multiple solutions the designing of product ) .
For  solution , they would have to analyze and select one of the best solutions that suits most of the criteria listed .
In order to make sure the product works well , engineers have to test it before they launched the product .
will sendwouldIn conclusion , we have seen that the problems of ageing population could get more serious for the next few years , thus there is a need to design a product that could help to reduce the risks and impacts faced by the ageing population .
By the example of these two products , we could see that both of them have make use of the engineering design processes to meet the need .
And thus , it proved that it is really important to follow through the engineering design processes when inventing a new product .
setting asideTherefore ,itsyHuman activities on Earth have depletedalready available engineering  , modifyiresources ,pthuscesses , orthe Earth'stly identifying thecausesor the rise of that need .
setting asideTherefore ,Firstly , engineering processes that are available nopletely depleted in the year 2050 .
Therefore engineering processes of technologies thatfunctions enetheir precursors fuels must be abolished and ones must be introduced to ensure a constandependedeony for humans .
For example , western powers fuels ,countries in Europe and the United States is planning tos'onstruct large scales solar energy farms in areas in Africa like the Sahara desert to Therefore ,enerating energy from fossil fuels .
Since solar energy is a renewable source of energsupersededrefore cannot be depleted .
Furthermore , the burning of fossil fuels produces harmful substances like carbon dioxide and smoke particles that can destroy Earthare environment .
However , clean energ sources like solar energy do not cause these problems .
Therefore we can see how abolishing old engineering  , sincees and embracing new ones can satisfy that need .
Secondly , instead of removing available engineering processes , they can also be modified so that their original functions are still available but at the same time satisfies the need to preserve natural resources and protect the environment .
For example , transportation systems like cars require fuels like fossil fuels which are processed from a depleting natural resource , fossil fuels .
Furthermore , greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are produced from these cars which  contribute to the notorious greenhouse effect .
To solve this problem , engineering processes like the designing of the car's engine can be changed .
For instance ,  electric cars by General Motors use electricity to power the car's engine instead of fossil fuels .
This satisfy the need as electricity can be generated from renewable sources of energy like solar and wind energy .
Furthermore , greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide will also not be emitted  .
Thus , we can observe how modifying available engineering processes can satisfy the need .
Thirdly , the need can be fulfilled by correctly identifying and analyzing the reason for the rise of that need , so that  correct decisions can be made through engineering processes  .
For example , CFC gases in the past are a by-product of many of our industries .
These gases caused the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer in the atmosphere which caused more harmful ultraviolet , UV rays to penetrate the atmosphere , and consequently health problems like skin cancer to humans due to these UV rays .
Therefore , a worldwide policy was implemented to ban the emission of CFC gases into the atmosphere by industries .
Thus , we can see how making  correct decisions to prevent pollution to the environment can fulfill the need .
In conclusion , to ensure a sufficient supply of natural resources and a healthy environment for us and our future generations to live in , these processes can meet our needs by removing and introducing or modifying available engineering processes and making  correct decisions through engineering processes  .
which sometimes causes warsAccording to Khandani  , engineers design products or systems that meet human needs .
Out of all the human needs in the pared pany .
Te , since the two methods mentioned above are both costly and difficult to apply , they can be restricted by the economic and market and thus , they may be not able to solve the shortage of water in a short period .
But what is important is that , at least , these two methods give us hope .
It is t kind of hope that motivates humans to develop , to improve , to pursue our dream , and finally to have such awater , tareul world today .
Hope is the most significant contribution which engineers have ever made to the world .

Lastly , Japan's engineers had followering design processes , Khandani  , thuman lifeir fihas , in fact , eco-car .
They started by defining the prom of the fuel injection system .
They definthat the fuel injection system's problem lies on the fuel it uses .
Therefore , Japan's engineers started to look for alternate fuel for their eco-car .
They gathered information in order to arrive successfully at the right fuel's source; subsequently , they decided to use electricity as the fuel .
The road to success is not smooth; likewise , Japan's engineers had gone through a lot of challenges and tests before they arrived at their final prototype of Japan's first eco-car .
it produces , therefore ,designingonHumans need to care about the environment's condition , in order -freereserve it for the new generon .
The new generation deserves to live in the same environment as we do .
To conclude , by using engineering design processes , eby engineers to meet human needs meets humans' need .
Healthcare is a basic essential in every country .
It compromises of the people's living condition , availability of medical treatment and prevention of disease .
Emphasis on healthcare services differs from country to country .
For instance in Singapore and Japan , healthcare is emphasized on the elderly due to their aging populations but both execute their policies in different waysity has become an eminent issue in Singapore .
With a replacement rate of 1 .5 children to 2 adults and estimation that by 2030 , 18 .4% of the population panies tend to seek younger employees causing the older mon places should be equipped with more ramps and handicapped friendly escalator .
Furthermore , on trains in Singapore , certain seats are allocated for the elderly .
Last but not least , health benefits for elderly should be protected .
They should be offered free medical checkups and treatment if necessary .
impoveelderlyIn conclusion , healthcare services should not be neglected especially in countries , which face aging population .
More an estimation done to improve our healthcare sector so as tomadeieveby healthier and wealthier society .
which hasofOver the past century , numerous research breakthroughs and creative innovations have allobining different technologies and innovations to satisfy a particular human need creating ability for humans to complete a task faster or more efficiently .
To produce these systems , design processes are carried out over a period of time , ranging from months to years , and they are conducted based on a series of steps .
For example , ing more and more an issue of raising concern as little has been done to eliminate or tremendously reduce pollution .
Temperature has been increasing due to the excessive release of greenhouse gases; and sea levels have been rising due to the melting of ice caps in the North and South poles .
Time is running out and to protectustainability of life on Earth , necessary actions have to be taken immediately if not , as soon as possible and the help of engineering design processes should not be left out .
,To conclude , pollution is an ongoing , serious problem in which swift actions need to be taken .
It is a human need to neutralize this situation because Earth's and human's sustainability is at stake .
With engineering design processes , the benefits of gaining control over pollution are tremendous .
However , engineering design processes take a certain period onon-harmfulctors such as safety and other side effects have te put into consideration too .
Moreovhumans cannot be totally dependent on engineering design systems only .
We have to be socially-responsible as every living person has a part to play in tackling pollution .
gasoline-poweredThroughout the years , there has ales impractical to have an electric car for travelling .
For example , the gasoline popared to a maximum dnce of 15shapesor a full charge on an electric battery .
In big cities like the United States , travelling to and fro from es money .
No one is pressed ntural gas  .
This is made possible only pared to the past .
For instance , the regenerative brake system has been invented ing up petitor .
However , technological restrains like limited resources has b a set back for hybrid users .
Looking at Singapore for example , there are only 5 CNG refueling points around the country .
To get your igasoline-poweredld be troublesome if the nearest CNG petrol station is far away .
This constrain makes consumers think twice before purchasing a hybrid vehicle .
Also , the fact that hybrid cars are a relatively new technology , car repair shops might not have the knowledge to repair hybrid cars yet , and any repairs must be sent back to the car manufacturer .
This makes it inconvenient if the shop is located far away from the consumer .
In short , these few factors have played an important role in shaping the automobiles that we know today .
Imagine if there no technological restrains and that we could create a self replenishing battery .
The possibilities are endless , but it proves one point .
Technology and society co-exist and affects one another .
Even till now , we are shaping many other technological inventions .
Only the future can foretell the impact of these factors on technological advancement such as in the automobile industry .
Who knows , hybrid cars might actually manage to successfully dethrone the gasoline powered cars in the near future .
Electronics such as lights and cars have become essential to  human beings over the past years .
However , these electronics though e the milese motion sensors use infrared energy to detect human beings .
In addition , these sensors are also highly sensitive to human body temperature , therefore resulting in a highly accurate detection .
Today these motion sensor lights acos-savingost everypared to previously .
To overcome the price hikes , an alternative to petrol fuel is needed .
The outcome of intensive engineering design pared to petrol fuel which is getting limited as the oil reserves depletes .
In order for a car to be powered using CNG , there are certain modifications that needs to be done .
For example , new fuel storage was introduced , and took the name of Integrated Storage system .
Another example is the modification of the engine .
The natural gas from the storage cylinders flows into a fuel line when the engine is started .
The gas is then ignited by a spark plug , thus powering the car .
challengeIn Singapore , public transports such as taxis , buses have converted to CNG .
In addition , according to Channel NewsAsia , there is an increasing number of private cars owners converting their conventional petrol fuel powered cars to CNG cars .
Engineering designs have improved the designs of lights and cars , which used to consume a huge amount of energy in the past .
To sum up , with the depletion of natural resources and high electricity and fuel cost , engineering designing should be given priorichallenget saving electronics .

Hoprehensively .
The world today is experiencing global warming which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation .
The solution to this problem is the harnessing of an alternative form of energy called kinetic energy in wind .
An example of a product created for this purpose is the wind turbine and it is created using the three main steps in design process to address the problem which are problem definition , information gathering and testing and implementing of solutions .
The first step in the design process is  problem definition .
Following this procedure helps to generate more solutions to the problem addressed .
Tapping  kinetic energy in wind is a good solution as wind is abundant due to the frequent changes in the atmospheric pressure .
This step announces to  engineers that the Earth is in grave danger , thus giving them more motivation to think of a solution .
For example , by defining the problem as the fast decreasing quantity of fossil fuels ,  engineers gain insight into creating a product which can be used to tap kinetic energy in wind .
Referring to the earlier models of windmills like those built in Sistan , Iran , from the seventh century , which were used to grind rice grains , engineers used the same concept to create wind turbine which converts kinetic energy in wind into electrical energy .
The second step in the design process is the gathering of information .
The credibility of the problem needs to be addressed after it has been defined .
The important factor which determines the efficiency of the wind turbine is the general wind flow in the area where the wind turbine is built .
Since the wind turbine heavily depends on the wind to generate electricity , it is important to study the wind flow pattern before the wind turbine is built .
For this study , past weather forecasts and also the internet play vital roles in providing information needed to improve the efficiency of the wind turbine .
The overall gain in electrical energy needs to be calculated to decide whether the building of wind turbine is worth its value .
The last step in the design process is the testing and implementation of solutions .
The testing and implementation of solutions is closely related to the analysis of the design solution .
The main factor which contributes to the analysis is marketability .
For example , the Matilda built at Goland , Sweden produced a surprisingly high sixty-one gigawatts per hour of electricity in fifteen years which produced more energy than the other typical wind turbines .
However , the Matilda was demolished on June 6 , 2008 .
In conclusion , the main three steps in the design process help to create a guideline for the engineers to follow .
Problem definition requires knowledge of wind and thus making full use of it .
In terms of information gathering , the efficiency of the wind turbine is of paramount importance in determining whether it really solves the problem .
Lastly , the testing and implementation of solutions consists of marketability , ergonomics and safety which serve as a check on whether the product is deemed suitable to solve the problem .

A human need is a necessity that humans need in order to survive .
One main necessity is food .
According to the World Food Program's 2008 report , 25000 people are dying every day due to famine and related issues .
A large portion of the deaths comes from  Third World Countries like Africa and India .
By using the Engineering Design Process introduced by Seyyed Khandani , a professor at Diablo Valley College , we can reduce  famine .
Some factors that contribute to famine famine include political , technological and environmental issues .
In 1970s , the WFP provided food to India to temporarily solve  famine .
During this period , they analyzed the situation to generate other solutions to permanently solve the famine .
According to the design process , the second step is to gather related information , then generate possible solutions .
The first possible solution was to provide genetically modified seeds and fertilizers to  farmers , so that they would obtain higher yield .
Before this solution was implemented , they did a further study , and realized that the solution would not work as the farmers were using traditional farming methods which are not yield efficient .
Hence , the WFP provided machines and farming education to the farmers in the 1980s .
These aids  improved the famine situation as it dropped by about 20% in a WFP 1990s report; On the other hand , these solutions  not applicable to all  lands in India as different areas have different types of lands .
For the dry lands , the WFP had to do further researchresearch on water irrigation methods .
One of the solutions was to construct a drainage system from the Indira Ghandi canal to irrigate the dry lands in the region .
Some events like drought , flood and earthquakes cause famine .
These types of events are unavoidable .
Nevertheless , events like deforestation and overgrazing have also affected fertile lands and caused yields to go down .
Governments spend millions and billions of dollars on entertainment and military expenditure yearly , but ththis large amount of money could have been put to good use in helping their own people .
India has increased  military spending by 50% in 2008 , bringing the amount to 40 billion dollars , although 35% of its people are still affected by famine .
The famine caused by these situations is preventable .
The large amount of money could be invested in the agriculture sector , like using  technology to plant seeds that will grow on dry land which will greatly solve the famine .
In conclusion , the WFP can do more research and analysis , like creating genetic modified seeds that can survive in dry or wet land , or an indoor farming center that will shelter the crops from natural disasters , to resolve the famine issue .
In addition ,  governments can try to allocate more budget to  agriculture and research centers than to the entertainment sector , which is not right when people in their own country are suffering  .
The last step in the design process is to test and implement the solution .
Taking a small step forward will reduce  famine .
Poverty is unavoidable , but famine is preventable .
Thus , we should do more to help the people  are suffering from famine .
tThe issue of the depletion of earth's natural resources has been raised repeatedly throughout recent times .
The earth's natural resources are not e up e dopleted .
Currently there are 4 New water plant in Singapore with a fifth on its way .
Together , they will be able to meet 30% of Singapore's need .
Botarea , New wfaces were also given out during National events , promoting the use of the New water in our daily life .
byIn conclusion , New water has been a engineering design which was self-relianceetnthe human need of the lack of water resources particularly in Singapore .

For exampneeds gas company eveThe electricfor the Preswasent of America , Bush , to appear in their advertisement .
So you can imagine the difficult situation electric car's coa successt at that time .
didareThesethe automobileintoother words ,The electricnological aspect is also very important .
At that tian ordinaryelectric car panies of elhas beentric cars have realized thwasmportance of social and technological factors and they start to fight back .
In social aspgases , thea largeronment situation becomes more scausess than te interested in electric cars and the companies also take thsupplyantages to promote their products .
They also invited some superstars , like Tom Hanks , to help advertise the car .
In technological aspect , new kind of battery has be developed .
The travelling range has been expanded to 500 miles , nearly five times farther than before .
Many func like GPS and ABS , are also applied to the electric car .
The performance of electric car can be as better as normal car .
Through the case of electric cars , we can see that whether a product can be successful or not is decided by both the social and technological factors .
The change of these conditions directly influences the position of the product in the market .
So when engineer produce a new product , taking these two aspects of factors into consideration is important .

We can see that just a little change can benefit a large number of people .
from the customer's FromelectronicmadeTo sum-up all the points mentioned above , we would conclude that engineering design processes can meet people's needs by qualified products and services , continuous modifications and the attitude to think for customers .
There is an old saying goes , "Customer is the god ."

This is just lke pared to other insecticides .
However ,Nonetheless , apart from the differences , there are also similties bete up with ingenious discoveries .
One needs to be prepared to identify a potential serendipitous discoveries , as well as to develop a normal technology , so that he does not miss out any toortant details and gain success in the end .
All in all , technologies discovered through conventional means and those discovered by chance are quite different in the aspects of how they are discovered and the general impacts they have .
However , they also share some similarities like they can only be found by preparlikeindividuals .
In the end , though they may be so different , it is quite obvious that they are equally important and necessary for our lives and even the progress of mankind .

When you go shopping , do you usually see the same kind of products e from China .
In China nopanies just copy the existing patterns .
As these companies manufacture products panies in China usually copy basic ideas from others andillegallyscopiedhemselves .
In recent years , lo63% of productscompanies appeared in southern Ca huge .
These companies found their opanies dinnovativennovation design .
They imitate panies .
For example , some cellphone companies in GuangDong province imitate famous mobile ncopy as NOKIA , Apple .
In 2008 , the producing amount of this kind pholonger present fore than 80 million in China .
Thesereason hObviously ,xactly same appearance designs panies , even the first time you look at it , you cannot identify panies pay very little attention to design process because that design process alpanies copy ideas from others and reducing manufacturing cost .
In some sense , innovation helps humankind to move forward .
It is so important that innovation design should be existing anywhere .
In today's global competitive market , a product's functionality is not the only thing customers are looking out for .
Products must not only serve their functions but must look good on the surface .
No doubt there are products  , it is not difficult to purchase foreign goods .
This resulted in the lopetitions against other universities from other countries .
Associate Professor Seahtheirr Heng commented that one of the difficulties faced by the team is the lack of a suitable venue to test drive the cars .
Beside the lack of facilities , engineers are constrain by the strict regulatory imposed by the Governement .
The team from FSAE could only test- drive their cars pounds and in United States petitions prehensive guide for engineers who have no idea on how to go about designing a new product .
However , in Singapore , engineers will find that they will meet into some problems that may hamper the design process .
Due to the small market in Singapore and Singaporeans' preference for foreign goods , many may give up their innovations eventually .
For those who successfully designed their products , they are met with another problem the lack of facilities to text their products and the inflexibility of Government's regulatory .
Engineering design process is a tedious one and by analysing the problems that hamper it , one may be able to make the process a smoother one .
Firstly , scientists and engineers have been focusing using wind and solar power for decades of years .
Many solutions have been tested and implemented .
The most well known examples may be the solar water heater and wind power electrical generator .
These two inventions can not only meet our daily needs , but also protect the environment and save the existing resources like coal and petroleum .
To put it more specifically , solar water heater can take place of other kinds of water heaters based one coal gas .
So besides the reasons above , it is also very cheap to use these renewable resources so users can get a lot of economical benefits from that .
Secondly , some of the technologies are still under testing .
Engineers are trying to generate multiple solutions to some problems .
And these problemline .
However ,caused by restriction and immature technology of wind and solar power .
For example , scientists and engineers have found that the wind speed and hours of sunshine are not sput anotherhat the generating energy is also not very steady .
These two resources are restricted by the geographical position and climais a source efficiency foronverting wind power is very low .
So the focus of engineers is to design and test new technology .
For instance , car is one of the most important transportations in the world; however , new research has proved that the existing extra petroleum can only be used for another eighty to ninety years .
Engineers are trying to solve the problem that what we shall use after the petroleum run out .
Thus a new kind of solar-powered car has been invented .
But even engineers have reached certain success; the solar-powered car they can produce is still far from the standard of civil transports .
So engineers still have a long way to go to test and find solutions to make better use of wind and solar energy .
So ,onrun the placethe solarLast but not the least; engineers are tryingfocusing on usingheir dream in to reality .
They havan to build a power house in the air space because it is easier to get more solar energy and convert them in to electripoweredin a better efficiency .
They are still gathering the pertinent information .
With their great efforts I will not be surprised to see a total different world in the future .
thatcomputers around the world were usedprogressedto continuetogoOn the other hand , neither conventionally generated technologies nor discoveries made in skunking a popular technology .
Concluding the above , the world today are better equipped with the relevant infrastructure and network to facilitate the use of such a device , a 'picture phone' .
This spin off effect talked such development has proved to us that social determinants have definitely been playing a huge role on moulding the development of our technology .
torequirementspeoples'In modern society , e true .
Then , in the follofortable .
Similarly , the serendipitous is the effect by which one accidentally discovers something fortunate ,equipmenty while looking for something entirely different .
Hence , the result of serendipitous also helps explore the unknown things and places .
In additflightoth of technology that was discovered by research and serendipitous discovery contribute to the human swereety .
However , in terms of process and effort , the research to develop new technology is different from the serendipitous discovery .
Specifically , the majority of technological innovations arethe realeloped by scientific researchave spentch based on knowledge , research and application in practice .
In order to make achievement , it requires a of thelpingwork timprovementst would take a long time .
Even so the result is still unpredictable .
On the contrast , serendipitous discovery seems very fortunate because people receive uneserendipityhich are always beneficial for human society .
For example , Sir Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibioticpenicillin when he was doing research onserendipitous discoveryal materials occasioly .
Similarly , DDT was also discovered by accint in the 1930s , when a Swiss chemist , Paul Muller , was trying to find a way to protect wool clothes against moths .
Hence , serendipitous discovery is more convenient and fortunate but it is much more difficult than doing research to develop innovations .
Innovations are made every single day and plete an objective .
These are the conventionally planned research based innovations .
Febined es the desperate need for solving a problem .
However in the case of the serendipitous innovations there is no exact driving force .
Set of experiments accidentally yield results which prove to be significant .
Who could have thought that an apple would be enough for a man to develop the concept of mechanics and gravitation ?
The technologies innovated in this fashion were never meant to be innovated .
But today without them our survival seems questionable .
It overrd to conclude which type of innovation outshines the other .Infact it makes no sense as both are special in their own ways .
But it is important for us to acknowledge these innovations , respect them and strive to do many more things to make life better ! .
Kandani (2005) .solution ,implementingtestingsolutionsEngineers have been designing products or systems to improve our daily lives life .
The process that they used is called the engineering design process .
The process has constantly  developed nefortable by planes .
Engineers have been tryofg to solve a human problem for many years .
That problem is to make drinkable fresh water to everyone in the third world countries .
Engineering process involves defining the problem , gatheavailable tong pertinent information , generating mulThe engineeringions , analyzing and selecting solution and test and implements the solution as quoted from Khandani .
Second , in the design process is to gather pertinent information on why the problem still exists as stated by Khandani .
Third world countries' governments know that there is a need to solve the water shortage problem .
However , developing new and clean water technology needs large amounts of money .
This money can be put to better use like getting medication for their people .
Another possible reason for the problem  could be pollution from industries .
Inland water sources are being polluted by factories which dump chemical waste products into the water sources , which make the water source unfit for drinking .
Lastly , Engineers can do some testing on desalinating seawater into drinkable water after they have drafted  a cheap and affordable desalination process for the third world countries to purchase .
The results from the testing will be sent to WHO for approval for desalination plant to be built for producing drinkable water in the area .
If the technology is newer than the previous old desalination process , the engineers might be able to get it patented so the price for this new technology will be affordable to everyone .
In conclusion , the engineering design process aids engineers in developing newer technology to help meet the needs or solve the problem of the global population .
This process is applicable to  producing clean water from seawater , which helps solve water shortage problems in certain countries .
The process is able to identify the problem , understand why it is still not solved , produce solutions to it and get it work in an engineering way .
themIn the context of the innovation development process , the development of technologies may be viebat purposes .

The first difference is that engineers pany .
The second difference bete out e next .
First and the most important one is that those innovations all promoted development of the society .
Secondly , no matter hoe better and better .
In Singapore , innovations in engineering design have been in the cold pared to leading countries like Germany or Japan .
From my Inion , I can idthere arel gains rather thanhave ledovations es to engineering .
Our innovations came in the pared to the rest of the world .
Perhaps in future , there will be Singaporeans who can create engineering wonders to revolutionize the world .
We will then be able to catch up to countries like Germany or Japan and be labeled as a country with innovative engineering .
In the past fepressor that condenses the liquidrefrigerant and releases the heat , ponents that could breakdopared to an electric one .
In addition to this advantage the gas refrigerator makes lessnoisethan the electric refrigerator as panies such as General Electric , General Motors , Westinghouse and Kelvinator spent huge sums of money on research and development .
These companies realized that larger profits can be made by selling electric refrigerators and they aggressively marketed the product .
Even though smaller companies tried to compete in the market panies such as General Electric .
Hence the use of gas refrigerators never popularized and instead today panies such as General electric rather than it being the consumer's choice .
Also it goes to show that for a product to be approved and accepted by society , it should be socially determined rather than technologically determined .
As plicated theories and knoes up e less and less , the other goes to the bosses' own pockets .
Finally , the research group gets the money , but no use anymore , because the remaining money is not enough or the arrival time of money is too late .
When such things happen again and again , people will have no desire to innovate because they know they will not succeed .
Just in this way , corruption hampers the execution stage of engineering design processes for Innovation , killing numerous of engineering design processes for innovation .
In a nutshell , the two main problems what hamper the engineering design processes for Innovation in my hoimplementationy are corruption , which will probably kill the innovation on the process of execution , and education , which makes the youth less creative that their peers in other countries .
These two problems are very difficult to solve in a short time , but we can improve a lot and make the engineering design processes for Innovation better and better .
There are several issues that may affect negatively an engineering design process .
Tpanies or organization to finance their plete their innovations given the iterative nature of their mon religious beliefs .
Engineering processes that result in environmental issues will also face pressure from environmental groups or the government .
Another social reason would be the government factor .
In Singapore , there are several policies governing the ongoing design research processes .
Engineers are required to seek approvals before carrying out their work processes to meet safety regulations .
These may result in crucial time loss .
Time is a pressuring factor for designer engineers with date lines to meet .
Tedious 'red tape' in all the government processes would slow down the progress of research , resulting in lower working quality and efficiency .
In conclusion , the social and financial factors are maipursuings hamperiis the design processtake ia long times .
The problems are even more so in the Singapore context .
However , realizing the importance of designer engineers in today's society , Singapore government has implemented measures to encourage innovative engineering .
Development funds are set up and the many guidelines for designer processes are clarified .
It helps to alleviate the situation , but the problems will still continue to persist .
discussTechnology and inventions are not strangers in this fast developing e a formality noputer technology compared to the discovery of penicillin punormalityology are based on this factor .
For example , the companies have been developing different models of electronic devices every month to boost their sales .
According to Rogers , although gas refrigerators has overpanies had made electric refrigerators better products .
On the other hand , a serendipitous discovery does not depend on those factors .
An individual or a group of researchers can make discoveries panies and investors .
successfulOther major differences bete so popular that every potential research will be funded sufficiently and thus researchers can produce more innovative ideas and products .
In conclusion , technology , whether it is discovered accidentally or purposely , is the main ingredient of new innovations and products .
We have to make the technology useful to society because they are the main users of the end-products .
In the end , a serendipitous discovery will be just as good as a technology discovered by research as long as it serves the purpose of contributing to the society and making lives better .
Energy source is the key factor that pared to sunny ponents is another issue that engineers need to take into consideration mercial purposes due to environment impacts .
This will result in negligible pollution produced .
Hence , solar energy provides a remarkable invention to the earth .

Unemployment Rate for College Graduates Highest on Record .

Standing in the Third World , China has taken the challenge to improve the development step by step in the past fepete for the deficient universities in terms of their marks in exam .
Under such an stressful circumstance , students learn knomunication skills , using logical method to get information , and so forth .
Moreover , the most horrible thing is that they can not thinking creatively especially for design process .
Engineers as they panies e back to serve China in economic development  .
In the same way , China lost lots of design engineers which may contribute innovative ideas about construction either on specific field like civil engineering , or on the entire development aspectsnese economy .
However , only minority of the experts can make efforts on design process in China .
Thus , the acceleration of enhancement of engineering will be reduced at a large scale .
Additionally , every country nowadays is trying its best to protect human resources as well as technology and design ideas .
Less highly educated people staying in China will be a disadvantage on this protection .
Good designing ideas may be lost from China , or even not created in this country .
In conclusion , my home country China now faces two challenging troubles .
Examination-styled education kills children's creativity .
And , Chinese government does not manage well on resources of human talents .
Both problems will sharply hamper the design process of innovation of China .
Obviously , it will be an extremely heavy load on our generation and hopefully , we can handle this issue and change the situation .

Problems Hampering Engineering Design Process in China
Noe from and the negative effects they have caused .
In this essay , I plex scientific research projects , it need a long time to go .
When it comes to some design for specific purpose , it may not receive any economic profits in a short-term .
If the government cut off the financial support halfe to naught .
It is precisely because there is not enough money input , a lot of good ideas can not be implemented .
And because of no good treatment , many talents go abroad to carry on their study and prehensive way .
Technology and innovation is the soul of a nation's development .
So the government should reform the education system and provide more funding on technology to develop engineering design processes for innovation .
areIn this nee smaller and lighter ponents and the development of more sophisticated batteries .
Inventors realized the risk of not taking athe nd dare to challenge an outdated product .
Homercially significant levels of reuse beyond platform .
This is because the engineers design and develop most products as individuals in isolation from other products .
Eventually , all the products such as computer softmercially significant investments in identifying and harvesting the reusable assets , unless it is explicitly planned in advance .
With the constant rise of sea level , many countries face the danger of being submerged underwater .
If this happens , we may not even have sufficient rice for survival .
More than a third of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam , where nearly half of the country's rice is grown will be submerged underwater if sea level rises by one more metre  .
Vietnam is the second largest rice exporter after Thailand and this will put the rice on our table at stake .
Global Warming has been a persistent problem that engineers should step in and help .
Engineers should adjust their designs creatively; like constructing more green buildings and including more greeneries in any future plans for redeveloping Singapore .
Firstly , engineers should design all buildings in accordance with the Building and Construction Authority  green mark scheme .
The scheme would provide advicadviceow a green building should be built and what additional features should be included .
All these guidelines will save electricity wastareduce environmental impact as well .
For example , although the air conditioning system in a library cannot be switched off at night due to the moisture content in the atmosphere , they can be set to a higher temperature or partiparthe units can be switched off automatically at night .
Hence , it will help in decreasing the Chlorofluorocarbons  gases emitted which harms the ozone layer .
In short , engineers should adopt the green mark scheme for all the buildings they design in the future to reduce the environmental impacts that are harmful to the earth .
Secondly , engineers can dedicate more green areas to future plans on redeveloping Singapore .
Some of the emission of negative gases that affect the ozone layer are beyond our control , certain plans to recycle the harmful gases should be considered .
For example , trees and plants can be planted at strategic locations of Singapore as they will reduce pollution by photosynthesising and producing oxygen in return .
This is an ideal method which can be adopted especially in congested cities like Singapore .
Other than dedicating land area for greens , gardens can also be built on the balconies , facades and even the roofs of buildings !
The multi-tier idea will definitely increase the intensity of green areas , thus reducing pollution and help to recycle cleaner air for our atmosphere .
To sum up , there should be gardens in every town and parks in every estate to allow a good ratio of renewing air supply in the atmosphere .
In summary , all buildings in Singapore in the future should be built in accordance with the green mark scheme by BCA and include a certain minimum percentage of green areas for all future town plans .
All engineers should design creatively and innovatively not only for decorative reasons , but to tackle the global warming problem as well .
So do you know why Singapore's Minister Mentor , Mr Lee Kuan Yew wanted Singapore to be a garden city since she gained independence ?

for Being a country panies and a lopensated .
All these require financing petitive however absence of proper funding makes it challenging to gain such expertise .
Due to these reasons many products even fail to launch into the market .
The second reason that I feel makes it difficult for new engineering innovations to be successful is due to large number of professionally qualified Sri Lankans migrating to other countries .
Sri Lanka has the highest literacy rate in South East Asia with over 96% population being able to read or write , this is mainly due to a free education system introduced in the late 1940 s  .
All Sri Lankans enjoy a free education up to university level thus , a large proportion of the population gain high professional qualifications which are recognized all over the world .
However , there is no proper system such as the MOE grant system in Singapore to retain these individuals with in Sri Lanka resulting in most of these professionals leaving the country for better paid employment opportunities .
Reports show that over 8000 Sri Lankans have migrated to India from January 2009 to August 2009  and over 100 ,000 Sri Lankans are currently residing in Australia making them the 16th largest ethnic group in Australia  .
These numbers show the magnitude of the seriousness of this problem .
Due to this high rate of migration a vacuum of knowledge and expertise is gradually being developing nthe largecountry which eventually has lead to a decrease in fewer innovations especially in the field of engineering .
These professionals also make up most of the high spending consumer base in Sri Lanka therefore migration of these professionals contribute to the reduction of sales of new products indirectly .
In conclusion I believe lack of financial resources especially low amounts of government spending and migrations of professionals are the two main reasons that cause lack of product innovation and idea generation in the field of engineering in Sri Lanka .
It is rather unfortunate because these problems could be rectified through careful planning and strategic management .
What is engineering process ?
Engineering process is a process to find out the solutions to improving the performance of a system .
Engineering process can be divided into many stages from the initial stage identify the need research on it until the final stage presenting the products .
Engineering design process is important processes that have to be carefully done before the product send for mass production .
Hopany panies pounds that harm for human body and pollute the air quality .
As a result , their factories pany on improve their technology system .
the betterEver pared to creation like the micropared to gasoline popared to importantly , thus the high cost .
To conclude , for a creation to evolve into successful innovation , the acceptance from the society is the utmost importance , only then it will create a market demand for service provider such as organizations to bring in and further market or develop the product .
Users being the society and providers being the organization , the absence of either one will not lead to an innovative engineering design .
Like an old saying goes , "It takes both hands to clap" .
Do you knoplete or done es up e up e up ments on the projects .
Hence , engineers are unable to continue their work .
In conclusion , the political corruption & political parties' problems in India are highly affecting the work of an engineer .
When an engineer works hard to create an innovative or creative design projects , their works are delayed or rejected due to political corruption & misunderstanding between political parties .
The dream of an engineer is destroyed as there is no one voice to lead the country .
Engineers cannot provide good services to the public when corruption is involved .
Innocent people get affected by these problems too .
Public cannot get better living standard because of political corruption & political parties as they stop the engineer's projects & ideas for better living lifestyle .
To solve these problems , India has to form a good & strong politics .
The current political parties are mostto ccupied by senior citizens & uneducated members .
Young & educated members should join the politics to lend the country in the right path .
In that way , most of the engineer's hard work & innovative ideas will be fulfilled .
Engineering design is the process of an attempt to improve the current system by analysing the needs of users , researching , finding solutions and presenting the final product  .
Hopanies pacting a desktop sized personal computer into in the form of a laptop pany will also expect the engineer to show some tangible results for them to continue funding the project .
However cost , time and speed are related .
Therefore to be able to show some achievement , the speed of research would need to increase thereby increasing the total cost incurred .
With the significantly increased cost , less people would support the idea of continuing the research .
Hence , we are now trapped in a catch-22 situation where faster results would mean more cost and more cost would mean less support .
The engineering design process would then be stranded at the research stage if the support garnered is insufficient to justify its funding .
In conclusion , the problems that pose the largest threat to the engineering design process would be the disapproval of ideas due to fiscal reasons and also the need for quick results for proper funding to take place .
The latter is a more challenging problem as it not as straight forward to solve as the former .

Il Houng Lee , representative of International Monetary Fund  organization in Viet Nam  "To reach Singapore pace of gropare or justify by saying: "In the past , our time parison has already become outdated" .Noments about the system of education in Vietnam , including the Chronicle of Higher Education of USA mented that the sloe back to mother country; it is too easy to hold 2 or 3 degrees/diplomas/certificates but in fact the holders have no professional knopanies is not really effective .

There is a common catch phrase in the Singapore educational system - think out of the box .
Essentially the concept of 'thinking out of the box' revolves around the idea of innovativeness .
Some people find it difficult to do so and interestingly enough , they even take courses to learn to be creative .
Little do these people knoe , it becomes easier for one to innovate .
the airbusThe first problem that a prospective innovator plaints .
In doing so , they are not being objective in resolving the problem instead; they are trying to give themselves a false sense of disillusion that the problem is caused by others .
While there may be some truth in it , it just goes to show that Singaporeans place their priority in shifting the blame to others before identifying theirs .
This does not meant well for any new Singaporean innovator seeking to engineer a new product design .
By shifting the blame on external factors , the underlying problems will never be resolved .
Therefore , in order to be prepared in all aspect , innovators need to be alert to all possible problems he might face .
In conclusion , it is clear that there are many factors that will hamper engineering design process for innovation .
More often than not , many people succumbed to these obstacles and never had the chance to realize their ideas .
Ultimately it boils down to the amount of planning that an innovator does .
The more work he does in anticipating problems , the less he will encounter .
After all , people who fail to plan , plan to fail .
Undoubtedly , China has emerged as the petitive to stand out among all .
Perhaps , tinly best e the one of the largest semiconductor industry in the puter engineers created the poe a sensitive issue in China .
In fact , China even has a poor reputation for protecting intellectual property .
This has in turn discouraged engineers , both local and international , to conduct any research or experiment in the country .
Moreover , the issue of intellectual property even dismay many foreign investors to provide sponsorship for engineering design in China .
Therefore , the external factors may also undermine the engineering design processes .
All in all , although there has been significant progress e , the country would benefit even more significantly due to the contributions from the engineering design sector .
Many people usually consider Singapore as a hub for Engineering and Innovation .
We have a strong economy , a stable social system , as petitive1"  allopass these above processes to produce innovative design , certain problems arise to hamper our design processes .
Tparison to Europe and the United States .
Thirty years ago , our industry es .
Also , the second process of "Generate Multiple Solutions" is affected .
The value of 'going by the book' may render us so accustomed to stick to the fail-safe solution we learn from textbooks we do not want to write books anymore .
This problem can be seen from the way our students consider education .
To the Singaporean student , education is primarily aimed for the passing of examinations and to acquire a job , rather than to join ranks of our leading Engineers in development and innovation .
If we were to persist with such static frames of mind , then we can never breakthrough our existing achievements; be it through innovation and Engineering via the Engineering Design Process , or even by any other way .
Moreover , our lack of establishment in engineering research and development may pose further problems to the Engineering Design Process .
Professor Seah has given a classical analogy of this issue when he narrates his personal endeavours to design the NUS car .
According to him , one of the greatest problems the NUS team encountered during the design process was the inability to seek advice from experienced people on how to build a car; due to the absence of an existing car industry in Singapore .
"Testing and implementation" would hence be based on trial and error , and the pool of knowledge we base our future innovations upon is greatly limited to foreign talent and textbooks .
We would be unable to "Gather Information" effectively , as well as select the right solution to our problems if we were to encounter any .
We have seen how thisck of experience and expertise , coupled with our static mindsets , can affect multiple stages of the Engineering Design Process for Innovations , and ultimately innovation itself .
Unless we strive to break our existing conservative mindsets- to be inquisitive in mind and daring in heart as our government calls for; then can we bring to life the true knowledge of engineering .
We would then be able to impart the full knowledge of engineering to our future generations: the experience , mindset and example of true engineering philosophy .
In Singapore , there are various problems that may significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
These problems comprise  , insufficient funds , insufficient resources , design may not be aesthetically pleasing to be selected and copyright infringement .
Of these four identified problems , I willon of the process might be slowed down due to financial constraint and the parties involved in the engineering design process might have to seek financial help .
For example , in the case of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort , the engineering processes were affected due to financial constraint .
According to Channelnewsasia , it was reported that the shares for Las Vega Sands Corporation have lost an astonishing of more than 90% in a year , and it was US$8 .8 billion in debt .
As a result , many feared that Las Vega Sands Corporation might go bankrupt .
Therefore , the opening of the Marina Sands Integrated Resort had to be delayed .
The above example was an illustration of lack of sufficient funds to keep the innovation design going .
Lacking in funds can lead to the disruption of the progress of an engineering design process .
The engineering design process will be disturbed when there is not enough money to buy relevant resources required .
Insufficient funds may not allow the engineering design process to proceed .
For example , the innovation design of the race car from National University of Singapore may not have been so successful without sufficient financial support from the school .
Therefore , shortage of funds and financial help may hinder to the progress of the engineering process , as in the case of , the Marina Sands Integrated Resort and also prevent an engineering process to begin , as in the race car example .
Another problem that might hamper engineering design processes for innovations would be insufficient resources .
Insufficient resources would mean , not having enough raw materials or materials needed for the engineering innovation design process .
Resources need not be mainly on materials , but also manpower or labour .
For example , in the case of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort , there was a shortage of materials such as sand and steel .
There was sand ban on sand exports and contractors could not get sand that was needed from the fabrication of concrete .
Secondly , there was a lack of manpower and the construction process was slowed down as a result .
These two main factors , lacking in manpower and materials had hindered to the progress of the engineering design process .
In conclusion , as illustrated in the case of the marina sands integrated resort and the engineering innovation design of the race car , we can see that lacking in funds and resources are two obstacles that engineers had to consider .
The impacts that each problems had , can affect gravely on the progress of the engineering innovative design and they should be well- planned .
In conclusion , the idea of having a small size phone and internet came from the social people , and the GPS function and big button telephone is the idea which are proposed by the government .
The telephone is definitely both a big business and a successful technology story which and the society definitely played a big part in it .
Technology cannot change society , only the society can choose how the technology develops in a feasible way .
problemsproblemsEngineering design process may be defined as the process es very difficult and inefficient .
Advanced technologies used in foreign country cannot be introduced into Malaysia because of insufficient capital .
Maintaining and repairing the high-technology machines and devices require high costs , too .
Furthermore , talented people are hard to be attracted as there is no good e them as time passes .
With the world's population increasing , it is expected that there will be a growing demand for food .
Hence , one current human need that should be given priority is to have sufficient food for the world population because we all do not wish to be in the Malthusian trap of over-population .
According to Khandani  , engineering design processes can meet this need through the systematic application of the five main steps: defining the problem , gathering relevant information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing a solution and lastly , testing and implementing the solution .
The first step of defining the problem by identifying and establishing the need , ensures that we have chosen a 'real' need and not a 'perceived' need to work on .
Indeed , having sufficient food is a 'real' need because we have seen how Thomas Malthus's ghost stalks many of the poverty-stricken areas such as Ethiopia , Somalia and Niger where starvation due to famine has led to the loss of many lives .
More importantly , this step reminds us that we are addressing the 'real' need of having sufficient food for basic sustenance which deserves more attention and not the 'perceived' need of having food for relaxation , personal fulfillment or interest .
The next  step of defining the problem involves developing a problem statement which allows us to specifically address and successfully meet the need to have sufficient food .
In this case , it would be to increase food production by designing a crop that is able to withstand adverse environmental conditions so that more land can be used to grow crops and a crop that can be harvested all year round so that the amount of food produced is not limited by seasons .
The crop designed must be low cost so that even farmers living in poverty can also afford to buy the seeds of the crop .
Moreover , the crop should not rely heavily on the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in order to grow well as this will have detrimental effects on the environment .
The next step of engineering design process-gathering relevant information enables us to be aware of the types of crops currently being manufactured and used , from which we can assess their effectiveness and improve on the current crops used .
Information regarding current research efforts on crops development can also provide us with an invaluable insight .
We can also utilize our creativity to generate alternatives to meet the need to have sufficient food such as devising new irrigation methods or new ways to make barren land fertile again .
Furthermore , analysis of the design also makes sure that the design can really work and people are willing to use the design .
For example , we can test the feasibility of the design by first implementing it in a small field and see whether the crop designed actually matures faster .
We can also carry out market surveys or make industrial visits to obtain people's responses and opinions on the design which we can take into considerations when improving on the design .
All these will help us to make an informed decision whether to implement the design on a larger scale .
In conclusion , through engineering design process , we ensure that only 'real' need is being addressed , relevant information is gathered to serve as a basis to generate multiple solutions and the design is analyzed thoroughly before it is implemented to meet the need of have sufficient food .
What determines a technology to be good or bad ?
Well , technologies are there to supposedly to improve our peting panies like General Electric and General Motors had an economic advantage over smaller companies that produce gas refrigerators .
For example , Kelvinator , a large electric refrigerator production company had a budget that pany .
As a result , these larger companies can afford to pour huge amounts of funding into electric refrigerators as they had earlier decided that larger profits could be made from them .
Moreover , panies can afford to spend a huge sum of money to intensively promote their electric refrigerators to gain better advertising .
Smaller companies panies being influenced by potential profitability and having gained access to better funding , social factors also played a part .
Better advertising by larger companies has led consumers to believe that electric refrigerators are still the product of choice .
This is an example of hopanies socially shaped the product .
In addition , consumers also have an issue petitive edge over the other .
In conclusion , companies and even individuals have economically and socially shaped electric refrigerators , making them a preferred product over technologically better gas refrigerators .

As a result , many state-run companies do not have incentive mechanism or the mechanism of selection through competition .
The consequence is that a large number of the employees treats theirs jobs as "iron rice bopany corrupts and becomes obsolete .
With regard to the next problem , the proteyears , along into play .
China is no more than a neplete .
Thus , there are cases of intellectual properties not being protected .
Moreover , the lapany for so many years e from Instead ,side ohave switchedentrepreneurs in China .
From the inside , petitive environment and a legal system which helps innovation of engineering design prosper .

Governments have been encouraging and giving apany to develop the alternative energy efficient products like solar technology .

In the cut throat competition , less revenue isenvironmentnd less fund is put to the research .
These petition pany pany has created solar technology advancement on military petition and engineering advancement , not a product of compromise and negotiation .
The need for innovation and technology are to bring along for daily aspect of life .
"Great innovators and original thinkers and artists attract the munist party .
Therefore , academic institutions are difficult to escape from acting like a government department .
For instance , the head of research groups and the presidents of universities are all assigned by their superiors in the party .
So e a consensus that China does little on the protection of intellectual properties and patents .
What is puters in China are illegally installed puters for government use .
Moreover , the protection is also inadequacy in terms of patent .
According to the statistical figures , about 30 percent of patents are illegally used e out in China , it is more likely for them to be ignored and discarded .
So in this es more prevalent and China becomes more open .
According to an essay in Sina .com  , China has sent 1060 ,000 students to study overseas but only 275 ,000 of them have come back and contribute to their motherland .
The rate of brain drain is near 70% .
It is astonishing .
As knoe back .
The road for China to become strong in innovations of engineering design is still very long .
We Chinese should work hard together to make China strong and we would grad to see that one day , the logo of 'make in China' can change to 'create in China' .
I believe the current human need that should be given priority is the need to reduce traffic congestion as it has always been a problem left unresolved for many decades .
With the help of engineering design process , many of such problems that we face in this present world can be minimized and resolved .
Engineering design process flows through these stages of defining the problem , gathering information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and finally testing and implementing of the solution .
Firstly , on defining the problem of traffic congestion and also gathering vital information on this human need .
The problem of traffic congestion is constantly happening throughout the world everyday and it is affecting the way we carry out our daily routines .
This problem leads to the loss of precious time that could be put to good use and it also affects the progression of work and major projects .
With this loss of precious time , we often have to make use of extra time to make up for the time lost in traffic congestion .
Thus it will also create an impact in the financial losses and holding back economic growth throughout the world .
Secondly is the generating of multiple related solutions , analyzing and selecting of a suitable solution .
One of the solutions that I came up with is to have a signboard attached to all traffic lights; this will indicate to all the drivers whether they should avoid travelling on certain roads that may have traffic congestion .
Although there are radio stations to report on traffic congestion ,  some drivers may not tune in to radio stations or may not know of other alternative ways to redirect their paths .
This results in accumulating the length of traffic congestions as the number of cars keeps piling up after it occurs .
This solution of indication can prove to be very useful , when an accident or traffic congestion occurs .
The sign board will have the three arrows mainly representing , left , straight and right directions .
For example in an event of traffic congestion , the central transport system will be notified in the shortest possible time .
Signboards that are in the area of traffic congestion and other possible affected areas would be updated and give suggestions to the drivers to redirect them away from the traffic congestion .
This central transport system would also provide an update for the traffic police; so that they may go down to rectify the situation .
Lastly is the testing and implementing of the solution .
With this idea of the solution , I would build a 3D replica of this system to test on the effectiveness in reducing traffic congestion .
I would continue to improve on the design with more stringent tests and experiments which will give me the most suitable configuration for a specific area on the island .
In conclusion , I see the need to improve on the transportation system around the world .
Using engineering design process , we could design a specific solution to allow the transportation system to have a faster and smoother flow of traffic .
stomachsonly meansEngineers have a constant need to upgrade current technologies to keep up e up es too late .
Another way to increase food production is to engineer grains and seeds so they produce more within a shorter timeframe .
They are genetically modified with desirable qualities to meet the needs and conditions of the place they are grown .
Crops are more robust and can withstand harsher conditions like strong winds , while carrying more grains atop their stem .
By genetically engineering many of our foods , we can actually increase food yield from the same plot of land in a shorter amount of time .
However , Khandani mentions that the solution is not perfect and we should keep revising and "going back to the drawing board" .
Our solutions are not one off .
We need to constantly modify them even as they bring about more problems .
In short , man will always find ways to solve our daily problems through engineering .
When people around the world are dying from hunger , engineers can be called to present possible solutions and find the best and most efficient way to deal with them .

Many useful feed back is needed in order for more problems to be identified .

Let's expect the prospective heart pacemaker can be more convenience and more powerful features at lower price .
I'm sure it will be fantastic news for the whole human beings .
Technical innovations are essential to the development of a nation .
Hoplex engineering design processes .
According to Khandani , the process of solving design problems can be generalized to five steps: "define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , and test and implement the solution" .
In most cases , it is not easy to go through all these steps successfully due to the hindrances from various facets .
In this essay , I e up e these hindrances one day .
At that time engineering design products or systems will boom to meesourcesle' needs .

From his perspective , since every natural event happens as a result of a cause or collective causes , I am not sure if it is proper to refer to the discovery of LSD , short term of Lysergic acid diethylamide , as an accident .
At least it is not an intentional consequence like the discovery of risperidone , a medicine for mentally disordered people .
In the follomon side effects include severe anxiety , akathisia , sedation , dysphoria , insomnia , sexual dysfunction , loplicated than that of risperidone .

There are tmercial airliner plish their tasks at night through GPS- receivers that coordinated their movements mand posts .
When the GPS is paired together with satellite cameras , enemy tracking and identifying targets are made convenient .
Next , the public demands have pushed the benefits of the GPS greater when gadgets are integrated with GPS to provide constant relative motion and time coordinating .
Using such products , users are capable of navigating in any part of the world .
At such , even the user's estimated time of arrival can be calcuusesed .
Such products have saved lives when rescuers tracked the GPS signals from their gadgets to locate the victim's whereabouts , bringing the success rate of search and rescue mission to a higher level .
Today , the GPS is a widely used technology in not just the GPS:nsport industry , but also in military and civilian purposes .
It has also since developed into a cost saving technology as it saves not just petrol and gasoline , but also time and effort .
Besides that , many victims owe their life to GPS when rescued from disasters and accidents .
preventedIt has been published that the GPS will fail in the year 2010 , however , with its wide range of purposes and benefits , efforts are being put in place by various goveforments arouusehe world to not just keep it functional , but also to improve its capabilities .
Therefore , we can expect to see more GPS-related technology in future .

Serendipitous scientific discoveries often refer to those unexpected surprises scientists came across fully by chance in the area of science and technology .
These unplanned serendipitous "accidents" often turned out to be good results .
Actually a lot of major discoveries made by excellent scientists are unexpected gifts from good luck .
Some of them did change the course of history and still have a significant influence on the entire human race today , even the mon fields mon antibiotic in drug storesis one of the most famous .
Alexander Fleming was a British bacteriologist  who served as a captain in an army medical corps during World War I .
He had been searching for antibiotic substances that can attack a variety of bacteria since his graduation .
When he served in thmanyhe noticed that a lot of soldiers died from simple infections caused by small wounds .
In fact , at that time doctors had no cure for infections .
Every day hospitals were filled with patients who only got infections from a small cut or a scratch and more seriously those who were contracted with pneumonia or tuberculosis .
However , doctors and nurses could do little to save their life .
Fleming spared no effort to carry on his expharmacology is perhaps ch in this area , field that he could find a cure for such simple but lethal infections .
After the discovery of the new substance , he came to the problem of how to cultivating the mould and how to isolate and purify the antibiotic agent .
Both of them seemed to be quite difficult .
Fleming continued his research and trial for a long period of time with his assistant , but to no avail .
During World War II , the work was taken over by two other scientists and they soon found a technique to purify penicillin and started the mass production .
It saved a lot of soldiers' life in the war .
Of course Fleming's contribution was never forgotten .
He shared the Nobel Prize for physiology/medicine with the two scientists .
It is quite interesting that penicillin was once discovered by a scientist cultivateusly .
However , what would have happened if Fleming had never been concerned about the search for the cure or he had had no interest in this area at all ?
What would have happened if Fleming had ignored the contamination and just dropped it into the cleaning mixture ?
The whole world would have waited for more decades to see the discovery of penicillin .
It is just because Flmanys intriguedliveshis research that he could notice the mould contamination on the bacteria culture and stretch out further reflection on it , while others couldn't .
Hard work finally pays off .
Serendipity only favours those with high aspirations and determination who whole-heartedly dedicated themselves to their beloved career .
Century after century the engineering design processes for innovations speed up all-round social progress and create the civilisation panies involved in the research have some experience of breaking off or failure .

Then , this becomes a vicious circle .
High risk means less money pumped in .
Less money leads to higher risk of failure .
Finally , fepanies pound talents .
But the fact is that the lack of researchers has become the 'bottleneck' restrictions for most of the companies in China .
Statistics suggest that the R&D teams in companies tend to reduce .
What is panies e the last choice for some talents .
All in all , it is the lopanies to pump in more money to the process and attract more talents to contribute to the technology progress .
Additionally , companies should import the advanced ideas and skills from the developed world to improve the technological skill of themselves .
Only in this way can we expect a better environment for innovation and more significant scientific and technological progress .

Similarities and differences betpare and contrast the discovery of penicillin and the development of embryonic stem cells these tes from the needs of society .
However , differences still can be seen from the impetus .
For the development of embryonic stem cells , the main reason why it can develop rapidly during such a short period is that the society needs a new way to transplantation .
It is not applicable to transplant an organ from one person to another .
Similarly , because the society needed a new medicine to cure some diseases like pneumonia , penicillin was discovered .
But there are significant differences between these two technologies .
The discovery of penicillin is by accident and after a long time it was being used as medicine .
Impetus to these technologies is society needs and differences can be seen from it .
Besides impetus , researchers involved also have a sli , especiallyerence .
Obviously , almost all researchers involved are scientists and engineers and that is the similarities between these two technologies .

Besides the environmental factors , cars can affect our economy negatively .
With the depletion of natural resources , funds have to be diverted into researching a cheaper alternative to gasoline as a fuel .
Cars drain our Earth's natural resources , thus inciting political skirmishes over oil , and overwhelming the roads of today's cities  .
Countries with few natural resources have to spend increasing amounts of money to import gasoline and other crude oils for these cars .
According to research on gasoline prices  , the price of a gallon of gasoline was about US$150 in 2000 .
By the end of 2009 , the price for a gallon is expected to increase to about US$250 .
Once again the solution presents itself in the form of hybrid cars that run more on electricity that can be harnessed from the sun or produced in man-made power stations and cost less than gasoline .
oncausesapproachingWhile the damage done by our continued reliance on cars and gasoline is severe , it is still not too late to do anything about it .
In order to prevent more serious economic and environmental damage , dramatic reductions in oil use and carbon emissions have to be made within the next decade .
Policy makers and carmakers need to change the vehicles they design and the energy and transport systems they are embedded in .
Relying on hybrid cars might just be one of the most feasible solutions we can look at to save our planet .

Conventionally generated technology and technology created in a skunkpare on their development differences .
One puter; another puter .

When Tetsuya Mizoguchi , the inventor of Toshiba laptop computer envisioned developing a product patible to an IBM system , he pany back then suffered huge losses in marketing their personal computers .
Wilaptopng disagreement from the compMizoguchi could not realize his dreams of making laptop computers .
O .Another difference is hoputer by going 'underground' in the Toshiba's Ome factory  .
He channelled funds secretly and shifted 10 engineers from a military project to puter .
The development process ponents puter and generated gon their ales results .
In spite of these differences , both Compaq and Toshiba flourished in the laptop computer market puters puters , they had the same motive of creating great laptop computers and took part of the big pie in the market .
We are living in the flourishing era of telecommunication pany founded in 1984 - , e more accessible to the users by increasing the memory and embedding entertaining features such as music player , integrated camera , and 65 ,000-color display instead of monochrome display .
The remarkable launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007 e . Itsspluralreen panies thrive and panies fail in personal technology" , "but RIM is an example of hopany to survive in the shadow of better-financed giants"  .
In other words , RIM has defied all odds and survived due to its understanding of the ne of its users , the risks from its enemies , and other social factors that could shape the success of an innovation .

This technology uses global plasma to eliminate unposite coating , Sponents , land-based turbine blades , helicopter rotor blades , military ponents , oil and gas productions .
Having a wide range of applications , namely apply outer coating for different kinds of engines from all fields which includes food industry whereas for CWRU's technology , the aa most renowned non-profit organisation on applied research in United States known as electronic parts .
On the whole , it is not important whether a technology is discovered via research or by serendipity discovery and given a similar technology it is not necessary for them to have similar objectives , applications and methodologies .
This is because the most important issue is that both the technologies are able to improvise the outer layer of materials , making them more durable and long lasting .
For example like the wings of the airplane , with the help of the new discovery they are now more resistible to the air pressure and strong air resistances .
Hence both the developments can be considered big contributions to the world technology .
Robotics technology plays a significant role in the military forces of modern era .
Many nations , especially the United States , are increasingly focusing their research on the field of robotics today for military purposes during bat medics during times of ing obstacles such as stairs or rough bumpy grounds during the rescue  .
Another reason is that it reduces the risk of losing a human's life .
For instance , in situations e a part of the U .S . military operations .

Technology has been evolving fast throughout in the 50 years .
Neputer into reality .
The smallest laptop it produced , Toshiba's Libretto U100-S213 , has onlytypes: conventional  x 3 .33 x16 .51 cm and weight of 2 .2 pounds .
Obviously , it is much more portable than many of the other laptops .
On the other hand , Apple has also release its highly portable laptop called Macbook Pro which is the thinnest 17-inch laptop in the world .
Since it has the smallest thickness , its weight is also very small .
Hence , we can see that both Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop are similar in their portability .
However , in spite of being highly portable , Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop have significant differences in their designs and durability .
Apple aimed to make Mac its own unique laptop .
As a result , the corporation spent a lot of time in designing Mac laptop .
Mac laptop is designed to be beautiful in its appearance and advanced in its operating systeweighsstware .
Its fashioned design has brought it many customers , especially the young people .
According to a Student Monireleasedvey conducted in US in 2009 , 43 percent of the university undergraduates in US preferred to buy Mac laptops .
While Apple works hard to ensure that Mac laptop has the most gorgeous design , Toshiba focuses more on the performance instead of the design of the laptop .
Despite the change in size , Toshiba put little effort in changing the appearance of the laptop .
There is no dramatic change in the design of Toshiba laptop over the last 20 years .
Besides , the two brands of laptop also differ in their durability .
Since the lifespan of the laptop might be difficult to measure , we investigate the durability of their batteries .
The battery is the most significant device of a laptop .
Computer engineers always endeavor to enhance the quality of the laptop batteries in order to enable the laptop to work longer without plugging in A/C supplier .
The latest Macbook Pro has achieved the maximum working time of 8 hours on a single charge .
In order to achieve this , Mac has adopted two innovations , which are bigger battery pack of lithium-ion cells as well as adaptive charging .
The battery pack in Macbook Pro occupies the space of the removable battery and obtains a 40 percent more capacitance .
In addition , adaptive charging reduces the wear and tear on the battery and gives it a much longer lifespan .
In contrast , although Toshiba also adopted lithium-ion cell battery pack in its laptop , the longest battery life was measured to be 5 .1 hours , which is much shorter than Macbook Pro .
Therefore , in terms of design and battery durability , Mac laptop has a better performance than Toshiba laptop .
has alsocan investigatechangeshas not beenOn the whole , there are quite a number of similarities and differences between a conventional technology and a skunkworks technology , just like Mac laptop and Toshiba laptop .
Although Mac laptop seems to have a bigger market , Toshiba never stops innovating new type of laptop .
In addition , without Toshiba , we may not see Mac laptop today .
It is hard to conclude which fashionabley is betterconventional or skunkworks .
They both have their advantages and disadvantages .
As long as the importance of the innovation is highlighted , the development of the technology would be bright .
When the first laptop puter users find it hard to puter .
Furtfoundore , most of the Japanewas do not have a computer at home .
These factors clearly shoputer in Japan .
Hence , this has ddidven Tetsuya Mizoguchi to develop a portable computer , despite being rejected by his company , Toshiba  .
He recognized the market potential of the portable computthesedroved to develop a portable computer pany's knoputer .
Dalthough the idea wasme , Toshiba has just suffered huge losses puter  .
Therefore , they are unputer has great market value  .
It proved the Toshiba Company panies to develop their opetition , each company is constantly trying to outdo each other by constantly developing and promoting their latest product .
This trend has stayed on even till today , peting e a product , if factors such as economic , government support and usability of the product supports the development of the innovation .
producing potentiallyIn Singapore , there are tes to innovating nees to learning and adapting to nee up ing up with good ideas and innovations .
Therefore we might need to first look into the causes of the problems such as the Singaporean's "Kiasi" and "Kiasu" mindset caused by the kind of environment we live in and probably the education system for the younger generangapore .
As is known to all , nowadays  ,science and technology are playing a more and more important part in social society .
We can even say that science and technology have been treasured so much that they are almost treated as a symbol of a country' strength .
Design , therefore , as an important source of more advanced science and technology , is being valued more and more by people and even countries .
As the saying goes , knowledge is wealth , knowledge is power .
In spite of such facts , however , there are still some problems appearing in our country which hamper engineering design processes for innovation .
As a result , in the long run , the problems will make a bad effect on the development of science and technology .
The first problem that hampers engineering design is the old education style .
In China , we attend classes just to remember useful knowledge which can be applied in the exam .
We are always adapting such a teaching pattern that teachercountry'sand students memorize .
That is to say , teachers never value the importance of training students' thinking ability .
Besides , in the examination , we only solve problems with methods that teachers taught us and almost never think about other methods .
In other words , faced with a problem , we cannot solve it using our own methods .
What is more , teachers also do not pay much attention to practical activities , such as social research and experiment class .
In fact , they just think It a waste of time .
iconsiderTo be a designer or inventor , the most important and also the basic quality is creativity .
Only when scientists have rich experience and various methods can they succeed in their work .
Also , before they can begin to design , they must know about their objectives first .
That is to say , before they design and innovate , they must know what to create first .
During the process , they must know how to design .
But due to the current teaching style , students do not have any aim and ability to create and invent .
The second problem is rules in the protection of inventions .
Since China has been built for less than one decade , it is certain that there are some problems in the laws and rules .
As a matter of fact , China does not realize the importance of laws in protection of invention in stimulating development of science and technology .
As a result of the defect in invention law , the production invented by scientists cannot be protected very well .
Therefore , many scientists may make an invention , only to find that it was stolen by others and their works made no effect .
In such conditions , scientists will be discouraged from inventing to some extend .
extentdo not have any effect .isDue to the above two problems , Chinese Engineering design was harmed seriously .
To help China make great improvement in science and technology , we must pay attention to design .
In other words , we should create a good environment for design and solve problems that hamper the design process .
It is time for governments to take measures to make improvement in education and laws .
In Singapore there are many constraints panies such as Nokia , Samung and Sony Ericsson have released their oe in order to progress .
Our government does in fact provides some kind of incentives to researchers .
thatandnot in touchIn this year's National Day Rally Speechation and the mindset of Singaporeans may prove to be a challenge to engineers , it is possible to overcome them .
Engineers must be open to new ideas , adept to their target consumers and be willing to take risks .

As a result , it may end up in failure eventually .
Hopanies e across problems due to insufficient funding and event it leads to a standstill .
'whether' thisorganisationssponsorsprovidessupports'it' financially The second prom that hinders the engineering design is the environmental issues .
Frankly speaking , there are engineers e out e out with a clear policy to benefit for its people together with the concern towards the environment .
Otherwise , most of the engineering design for innovation could be a failure without any success .
Noputer technology and network technology broaden the range of credit card's service and make a strong link between the card and our daily life .
Thirdly , from a social perspective , credit card brings a lot of convenience to our life .
There are several simple methods of payment by using credit card such as punching the card on POS machine and RFID machine , network payment andbroadenedone payment .
No mattecard pluralre itmade one can get money by credit card instead of clivesing a lot of cash .

Therefore , Malaysia government petitive and creative .
Thiinnovationsse they are not taught to think critically since they panies in Malaysia can hardly create a new technology due to the financing problem .
They do not have the modal to do research even they have a great idea .
Moreover , Malaysians with these kinds of qualities and attitudes also act as an obstacle in the innovation process .
They will just blindly follow the trend .
It is hard to have a new idea pops out from their minds as they will not think out of the box .
In lusion , the engineering design processes for innovations in Malaysia still in the very first phase .
Malaysia government should be more concern about these two major problems and solve them adequately .
In my opinion , the problems can be thinks of changing the education system .
Besides that , Malaysian should also start to work hard in order to make Malaysia a developed country instead of developing country .
Hence , creating a new gathe MalaysianMalaysia would not be a dream; it is just a matter of allocatee and effort .
In the eastern part of the globe there exists a place called India , renoe his ing an innovation !
These malpractices are one of the reasons for the greedy nature of the private sector as e a success .
For example , broadband costs in India are still one of the highest in the world , simply because not a lot of people are aware about it and thus not a lot of them want to take it , this forces the ISP  to raise increase the profit margin per person .
Is this because of the lack of IT literacy in India ?
Well , first , the literacy rate needs to improve before we can even start thinking about IT literacy .
The government education system at the primary and secondary level is a total flop , the syllabus is outdated and the curriculum is something of a joke .
India has a long way to go in terms of primary and secondary education although university level education is on par with the international standards .

Only about five years ago , mercialized only in recent femon usage of laptops , it is economically advisable to use search engines for information gathering .
Comparing with going to bookstores or libraries and watching TV , which cost people time and money , it is cost effective to search information through search engines .
For advertisers , the cost of search marketing is much lower than that of the advertisements in other forms like on TV programs .
In this world where profit means so much , more and more advertisers are exploring the new field of search engine advertising .
The economic factor really contributes to the growth and development of search engines .
Secondly , search engine is a relatively easier tool that everyone can accept .
For example , the homepage of Google is very clean and simple .
Without much distractions from fancy designs and display of every piece of information , users can access to what they want to find directly .
Morthe Internethe sophistication of the search engines enables users to accurately describe the information they want and view them in an assorted manner .
In additi ,n , search engines are mostly globalized .
For example , "G .eThis is 81%as many versions in different languages .
Singapore also has its own "Yahoo !"
search engines .
This helps to expose their people to the outside world by browsing other countries' WebPages through search engines .
Thus the above mentioned features have encouraged more people to use search engines .
The last but not the least , search engines lead people into a realm of information .
It is so resourceful that people basically can find anything they want by typing some words in it .
It really links up the real and the virtual world as people gain knowledge from inComparedd apply it to the everyday life .
It does no only have a vast database , but also possess advanced functions which classify and sort these information into different categories .
For instance , the "Google" scholar function allows users to search specifically scholastic articles .
Furthermore , as most search engines use "spider" protocol , the information presented is least biased because they are listed out based on their relevance to the user's input .
Without many advertisements to disguise the truth , users can process the information more conveniently .
As a result , the problem of too much irrelevant information present in books and TV can be alleviated .
The development of search engines is thus undeniable and spontaneous .
In conclusion , the emergence of search engines in our daily life is due to the economical , practical and information coverage factors .
It definitely started a new age of information gathering .
Through making the gathering process easier and more reliable , it saves the time , effort and resources of people .
Therefore , it is no wonder that it has remained popular in these years and still dominates the international search landscape .
According to recent statistics , every 1 in 8 people in Singapore aged betmunity to be able to design product to convenient them .

Reports also show that the increased connectivity through mobile phones and the internet may lead to improved economic growth and job governance .
The government encourages the wide usage of mobile broadband service such as 3G and 3 .5G broadband services .
Furthermore , with the private sectors cooperating with the government to offer more different kinds of mobile services , this helps in the usage of mobile phones .
As a result , the number of people using mobile phones is increased .

E-commerce scenario in mind: a man sitting in front of a computer is busy using email , eBay , online banking , and teleconferencing .
This is ecommerce , puter netmerce is considered to be socially determined rather than technologically determined .
To specify , the formation and development of this technology is mainly contributed by three factors: public's needs , economic consideration , and government regulation .
Engineering design , also knoe easy .
It has to go through a five step process before coming out fort of their opanies are more concerned about their profits , and hence are reluctant to risk on innovation .
In addition , the society is unable to accept nepany .
Thus , issues promise the quality of another area .
As a result , it is very difficult to attain a balance among all the areas .
Unless a balance among the areas could be achieved , the design process plete before being able to come up ing the two major problems , Singaporeans will then be able to create and innovate .

The engineers often follopany rules while their leaders support them financially .
Skunk work projects do not have the backing of their leaders , resulting in secrecy and extra work .
Engineers must be highly motivated and passionate to achieve results .
Therefore conventional projects and skunk works projects are different in nature .
However an engineer can be successful as long as he is highly motivated , passionate and diligent .

It is necessary to recognize that the entire process is fraught mercialization .
For a nefort zone and is often unmon in the market are electric refrigerators , which generally produce a "humming" sound .
A soundless refrigerator was in fact produced in 1930 .
However , during that time , large investments went channeled into the research and development of electric refrigerators .
Furthermore , electric refrigerators were more aggressively advertised for .
All these factors led to the downfall of the soundless refrigerator .
In sum , a society which is less receptive of new ideas and innovative products could lead to the hampering of engineering processes for innovation .
In conclusion , there are several factors that play a part in the success of innovative engineering processes .
It is necessary for engineers to exhibit a high level of creativeness .
Moreover , for a new product to succeed in the market , it has to be accepted by the society as they are the ones purchasing the products and making them profitable .
Two problems are identified which might hamper creativeness in engineers .
Although measures that tackle these problems might have already been introduced , we have yet to witness the effectiveness of these measures .

Compressed Natural Gas  vehicle is an alternative fuel vehicle .
Instead of using fossil fuels such as gasoline or diesel , it uses compressed natural gas ing more and more serious , the development of such environmental friendly vehicles becomes a must .
Many automobile manufacturers  conducted a lot of research , development and innovations for a number of years using CNG as a fuel source for vehicles .
CNG equipment manufacturers have invested in research and development to improve this technology and make it convenient and available for consumers globally  .
Apart from reducing the air pollution , Natural gas vehicle also produces lopress natural gas in a small container which can be put inside a car .
With this development , the modern CNG vehicle became possible .
From 2000's , the oil price grew tremendously , but the price of natural gas was much less .
In order to reduce the fuel cost , many people preferred CNG cars in that period .
More owners of private cars country wanted to convert their petrol-driven vehicles to also run on CNG .
This actually spurred the manufacturers to improve the technology of conversion from gasoline vehicle to dual-fuel vehicle so that the cost can be reduced and more car owners could benefit from the CNG technology .
Lastly , the development of CNG vehicle is also influenced by the government policies .
Due to the increase of the oil price and the necessity of improvement of the urban environment , many countries' governments support the development of CNG vehicle .
Many countries which are abundant of natural gas introduce CNG cars and buses to their public transportations .
For example , in countries of South American , such as Argentina and Brazil , there are about 3 million CNG vehicles which are mainly used as taxicabs .
Some other governments provide tax rebate for the owners of CNG vehicles , so that to incentivize the using of eco-friendly vehicles .
For instants , the Singapore government provided 40% discount on the Open Market Value  cost of newly-registered green passenger vehicles from 2001 in order to build up the intensity of CNG vehicles  .
With the help of the favorable policies and sponsorship from the government , more talented people are attracted to the CNG vehicle industry research .
As a result the CNG vehicle technology is shaped by the government policies .
In conclusion , CNG vehicle technology is a socially determined technology .
Without the requirements of cheaper and cleaner vehicle and the governmental support , it might not as well-developed as now .

All of these included building a prototype of the machine used to pick the tomatoes , contacting producers who were willing to sell their products , making their research results known to the local farmers and collecting their feedbacks to improve .
Finally , they came up with their research results after many years' research , in due time according to their plan .
In contrast , in the case of Warfarin , the process was a reversed one .
The product came out first accidentally , followed up with some research to get a better understanding of the discovery .
Warfarin was put into practice directly after it , because its use was totally known when discovering it .
The whole process was highly effective and by chance .
No one expected it before head .
Besides , although both these two technology were successful , the keys to their success are different .
As the hard tomatothe 1970's ,am was a research project conducted by a group of people , I think the success was mainly due to teamwork and comachineson of the whole group .
On the contrary , the key to success in Warfarin lies on Prof Link , who discovered the chemical .

Hopefully in the near future , more effort will be put in to encourage society to be more accepting of new innovations that would greatly change their way of life for the better , and also to implement in not just aspiring engineers but students in general , skills that they are able to use and apply in handling problems in the real world .

The naissance of all the greatest technologies and discoveries aling out of a technology people plete numerous experiment and test , plenty of money e to help them make the most popleted and formal research process , like the atomic bomb , many others technology es from their experiment or research .
Even some greatest discoveries come from accidents without any indication , for instance , the discovery of penicillin and the invention of gunpowder .
Gunpowder is invented by an ancient Chinese alchemist accidently .
One day the guy wanted to find some medicine called elixir of immortality aiming to give people a permanent live .
Dramatically , what he encountered was not the success of the magic drug , but an explosion and the birth of gunpowder .
However , the a bit foolish guy didn't set enough value on this great power as it should , so didn't the other Chinese people .
Gunpowder didn't have a chance to step onto the stage of the history until the famous adventurer and merchant Marco Polo introduce it to Europe from China .
Only after that the world began to pay enough attention to this powerful chemical medicine gradually .
In 2005 , one of the most dreadful nepare the feasibility of all the solutions as well as the efficiency .
If all the solutions are capable solving the problem , then the one which is the most efficient should be chosen .
The real example is that people now are pro to hybrid gas-and-electric-powered automobile instead of the conventional ones .

According to Rogers , due environments that Toshiba's laptop creator Tetsuya Mizoguchi failed to convince his superioris known  in Toshiba to support his laptop project , he parison , although Bill Gates himself is the boss of Microsoft , he received much external support .
In January 1975 , the president of Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems  agreed to let Gates and his partner to develop a program for MITS neputer .

The program was then sold to IBM , without the copyright .
This had allowed them to be a monopoly in the industry .

Over the last couples of years , panies like Lenovo and Haier exist panies are operating their small business everye ?
I think it is because of lacking innovations in engineering designs .
Many companies , especially the small ones , are follopanies lack money to support innovations in their product design .
As I mentioned , many manufacturing companies in China are running their business in a small-scale .
What they manage to do is making their designs slight different from other similar ones , panies have to take the price from the market , panies have enough money to support innovative design , they may not do so .
In Chinese emerging market , not all invests in innovation are repanies are manufacturing products for large transnational corporations , panies .
And the main reasons why we lack innovation are high costs and low rewards of innovation in China and unsatisfying engineering education system .
I hope things are starting to change now .
The common challenges faced by  developed and developing countries are the daily demands for improvement in various areas , be it economy , infrastructure or even society .
Nation building is never easy; hence governments mon obstacles , in mon global issue , especially worst in Japan , and that is the ageing population crisis in Singapore .
The entry into the 21st century prow set ooblems: pandemic flu , terrorism and the emergence of a group of senior citizens .
Singapore has no chance of avoiding it as it also experienced a post war 'baby boom' period during the 1960s .
A new research report revealed that Singapore is set to be the world's third- fastest ageing nation , as the proportion of those aged 65 and above will double to 20 per cent in 2020 .
Adding on to this problem Singapore , being a small country , has always faced a talent crisis .
Low birth rates coupled with the outflow of local talents force the government to resort to adopting a foreign talent scheme in order to increase the talent pool in the city .
An ageing population creates a new dilemma to engineers working on their designs , because they have to rebuild or edit all their past creations so as to be 'elderly-friendly' , a phenomenon unheard of during the early days of nation building .
This will be a somewhat testing task as they cannot rely on any past references in Singapore , so any designs will be a risk taken by them .

The purpose of this saving scheme is to emphasize on self reliance .
To meet healthcare needs , Medisave was introduced to allow CPF members to use their CPFhandle; therefore ,italization .
In this way , most problems of the aging population is taken care of .
Singapore has also emphasize and instill filial piety to the children of the aging population and to support their parents through meeting their financial needs and emotional nenumberhe children of the future should provide for their parents as much they can even though their financial status looks bleak so that the aging population will not have to rely too much on governmenspentp .
Children also should arrange for their parents to live under the same roof so as not to only provide for them financially but also to show care and concern to their aging parents .
For example , children of the aging parents are able to bring their parents to consult a doctor if any minor medical conditions arise , thus preventing serious illnesses from developing .
Singapore has encouraged people to buy a HDB flat near their parent by subsidizing a substantial amount of money .
By living together , the children can also provide a listening ear to their parents and even warn them against making wrong decisions .
This will definitelreduced the fiscal cost of elder dependency .
However , some critics might disagree with this strategy .
No matter how much we encourage young people to care for their parents , it's still their personal choice , the society or the government cashape ,force them to do their part .
However , if the government helped a good job in educating the young people and introducing policies to encourage young people to be more caring towards their aging parents , this would be a very effective strategy .
This is because what the aging population needs are their children providence and their care and concern .
In conclusion , I think that many developments and policies have helped to reduce the aging process and also solve the problem of a fast aging population .
Although this problem cannot be solved in a short period of time , theses policies and developments will help to curb the problems of an aging population .

Aging is becoming a hot issue e less vulnerable , it is not so good to do so e less vulnerable when they are aged .
Moreover , when more money is spent frisesple when they are younger , it could raise a better workforce for the nation .
The productivity of the country will therefore be increased , and again , with more wealth earned , public spethe governmenteneral , anuse more moneyulars , will be increased as a certain result .
easearchitectural andeaseHave present studies , development and policies helped to relieve the aging process ?
This is the question many people grapple e less painful .
As one ages , they need not suffer the torment of illness as the previous generations did , and are able to spend more time on other meaningful activities .
havehave helpedFifthly , various social policieeasee been introduced to ease the aging process .
For example , filial obligation is stressed through informal and formal channels to increase the pelled by lae earned es at a cost .
For those who are not able to afford them , they will not be able to enjoy the benefits .
Social policies also require funding in order to put the plan into action .
Therefore , the ability of recent advancements to ease the aging process can be greatly limited by financial constraints .
In conclusion , economics , medicine , arceaseture , technological inventionincreasing prevalence ofs have helped to ebuildingsarocess but they required financial resources to achieve .
Therefore , the elderly and their children supporting them must have sufficient financial resources in order to take advantage of the benefits of modern day advancements to ease the aging process .
In recent years , there is an increasing number of countries faced ing up pulsory .
We have to prepare more healthcare teams to specialize in treating illness related to the old as it is counteractised for the e . The elthese measures depend on their savings or their children to support themselves throughcare of old age .
Even though so , some of the elderly may not have saved enough to last them till death or their children are not pared to the young and also , the old age may receive less all-rounded treatment in healthcare sector based on the stereotype that they are in the natural process of aging and that they are less likely to recover .
The government then has to interfere to educate the public to be less prejudiced against the old aged .
This will take up part of the public spending which should not be limited .
the elderlySomeOn the other hand , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country's development such aillnessesconomic sector .
If the economic improves , people would earn more money and thus the burden on the children taking care of their old-aged parents would be relatively lillnessesthey could better afford the costs of taking care of elderly .
On the contrary , this is only applicable to filial children who are willing to take care of their parents .
Those elderly who are unfortunate or those without kids may face problems as they would have no one to take care of them and would be worse off without any help from the government .
As a result , public spending on the aged should not be limited as it is needed to help these elderly .
the healthcarelooking formay faceTo sum up , the government has to assume responsibilities in taking care of the elderly and to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to accept an ageing population , public spending on the aged should not be limited and money should not faceverteinto other areas of the country's development .
Statistics from the World Health Organization  stated that:
From 2000 until 2050 , the munication , keep track of their personal health record and also make follofort of their omunication .
Next , national developments and policies such as pension systems are arranged to provide the retired elders income .
The fund may be set up by a corporation , the government , or any other organization to pay the benefits of retired munity .
In conclusion , technology and the national development and policies have helped ease the aging process .

"Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development ."
Clearly , this suggestion considers the interest of the country but not the aged .
Although the country's development is essential , it cannot neglect the frailer aging group of the population .
Regardless of the problems an aged population may bring along , it cannot diminish the fact that the elderly is still part of a country's assets .
If the government decides to cut its expenditure on the aging population , the elderly mon problem faced by the elderly .
As they aged , their body constitution becomes weaker .
As a result , they are more vulnerable to sickness and disease .
They have to make occasional visit to the doctor for diagnostics and remedy .
The cost is heavy , especially nowadays when new technologies and treatments are expensive .
This is where the government can provide financial aid for the healthcare services required by the aged .
The government can subsidize part of the healthcare expenses borne by the elderly .
This will lighten the burden of the aging population as well as the younger workforce .
Therefore , public spending for the aged should not be reduced for the country's development .
Instead , the government should increase their spending on the aged so that they can reach out to more needy senior citizens .
less savingsa lower ,to assistthemselvesCertainly , if the government diverts its spending to other areas of the country's development , they would enjoy a growing economic growth .
Because of that , they will be able to collect more taxes , increasesn be used to aid the aging population .
On the other hand , with little economic growth , the government has no choice but to cut down on benefit programs for the aged .
However , it takes time to realize a noticeable increase in economic growth .
It may be many decades from now .
By that time , an unfortunate group of the aged will have been deprived of welfare programs previously planned for them .
These people will suffer as the country works toward other areas of its development .
This is because the coucontributedit its spending on the aged while expanding other areas of development .

Clearly , the consequences of cutting expenditure on the aged outweigh the other in many aspects .
Ahave been left stranded of the aged will be sufshelterhrough have been abandonedf achieving an economic growth .
Consequently , they will be struggling for survival with the limited welfare policies available to them .
In other words , if welfare programs for the aged are reduced due to limited spendon thegagedy problems will arise .
Subsequently , the government have to spend more resources to solve the arising problems .
Therefore , it is better to give equal if not more spending to the aged , keeping existing welfare benefits in place .

Moreover , their experience gained can prove valuable to the economy .
For example , with increased measures fthe elderlyernment for putting eldeindividuals'nto the workforce , the elderly will be able to depend on themselves .
All in all , the strategy for reducioldder dependency through the 3 methods caannounceso be valuable for an aging society .
"Old age is like a plane flying through a storm .
Once you are on board , there is nothing you can do" , said Golda Meir .
Indeed , perhaps everyone is afraid of aging because it not only marks deterioration in physical health and significant psychological changes , but also places more financial burdens on the government and the society , because obviously , the elderly need fiscal support , better health care and facilities specialized for their age-related problems .
Therefore , it is suggested that "public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development" .
From my point of viemendation is completely reasonable and convincing for several reasons .
First of all , investment should be focused more on education as it takes a higher priority than other fields of development because education plays a very important role in the society , determining the wealth and success of the entire nation .
More specifically , a good education system will produce a more talented and creative generation who can replace the current old generation and continue to devote their best to develop the country' economy in the future .
One example of necessary financial support is the investment on developing and upgrading the current facilities used in education , including information technology equipment , laboratories and library systems .
This is particularly important to the education in developing and less developed countries , like Vietnam , China , the Philippines and Malaysia , where teaching and learning still utilise traditional methods with little IT support and the use of old textbooks , as well as using laboratories with obsolete devices .
With improvements in educational facilities , students will be able to accessup-to-date knowledge more easily , as well as experiment with and apply what they have learned in reality .
Another way to carry out this strategy is that the budget can be used to promote and export the country's education .
This is exactly what the Singapore government is doing to attract excellent students from other nations .
By providing tuition grants  and financial aid for living costs for foreof students along with a career bond , Singapore will have a greater workforce serving them for at least 3 years after graduation .
Besides the concerns surrounding environmental protection and education , public spending on the aged should be partly transferred to public infrastructure development projects such as public transportation , schoolsand hospitals because such developments are directly related to the improvement in the living standards of senior citizens .
Firstly , a modern infrastructure will bring about s , effectiveness and efficiency .
One example of this is the extension of access to most public places and even on public transport vehicles for people with physical disabilities , through designing paths or elevators specialized for wheel chairs , or placing special directional signs for the elderly with sight or hearing problems .
Secondly , due to its higher efficiency , such facilities will help reduce operational costs and subsequently decrease the cost of living for citizens .
For instance , a well organized public transportation system will help minimize the use of private vehicles , which is costly , and reduce traffic congestion and accidents .
And therefore , to some extent , the elderly will indirectly benefit from this policy .
In conclusion , people may be upset with the idea of limiting public spending on the elderly because they may think that the aged increasingly lack  care from the society .
However ,  considering the positive impacts it brings about to the entire society , obviously the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages .
Hence , this idea should be carried out soon for the sake of everybody and the government needs to promote and analyze the pros of this policy in order to avoid misunderstandings  .
"Old age is still young , its potential is not fully realised , and institutions , norms and resources advantageous for old age still need to be developed ."
-Baltes and Mayer , 1999
Population ageing is an international phenomenon .
Singapore is no different .
According to SingStats , 8 .5% of Singapore's population is above the age of 65 .
This figure was 7 .2% in the year 2000 .
As the population continues to age , government spending on the aged will probably increase as more and more people would rely on the government for their needs .
Many arguments have been raised on whether the government should limit this spending as the money could be used for other areas of the country's development .
I do not agree with this .
The government should not limit the spending on the aged .
In fact , they should make sure the needs of the aged are attended to .
In the past , the literacy rate of the people was low .
Many elders of the current generation have little to no education so in their economically active years , they weren't able to save a lot .
Moreover , most of the money they earned was spent on their children to make sure that they received proper education .
This act of placing the younger generation's interest before theirs and making sure that they got proper education increased the literacy rate of the country and contributed to the country's development .
In other words , the old have contributed a lot to shaping our country into what she is today .
Therefore , now that the country has prospered , the government should look after the people who helped made it possible .
some may argue that since the elderly spent their money on their children , it's now the responsibility of the children to look after their needs , and not the government's .
However , if that were to happen ,  would increase and the younger generation may find it harder to start a family .
Throughout the years , Singapore has concentrated on the country's development .
According to the Singapore Ministry of Finance , in FY2009 , 41 .5% of government expenditure would be placed on the economic and social development of the country .
Looking at the numbers , we can tell that sufficient funds have already been allocated for the country's development so no additional funds are required .
Even if there is a need for additional funds for economic and social development , instead of limiting or cutting expenditure on the aged , the government should look at other areas to cut .
For example , expenditure on security and defence is 34 .3% of government expenditure in FY2009 .
This is certainly too much an amount to be spent on security and defence .
A reason for the stand that the government should limit spending on the aged is that the aged is not of much use to the society so the government should not concentrate so much on them .
However , Singapore's policy of re- employing the old has proven that to be not true .
Most of the aged have proved that they can continue to work and contribute to the society in one way or another and thus their welfare should be looked at as well .
In conclusion , spending on the aged should not be limited or diverted as , for a developed country like Singapore , many successes have been brought about by them and they have helped shaped the country into what it is today .
If there was ever a need for more funds to be injected into the development of the country , other areas and not the spending on the aged should be looked at .

Aging population is becoming a more and more serious problem , consuming a great amount of money from public programs .
There are several solutions proposed to ease this problem .
One solution is limiting the money spent on programs for the aged and diverting that money to other areas of a country's development .
Some critics say implementing this solution might imply that the government does not e like older single e test anhowever ,s test to assess compensatiotoayments  .
Starting from 1 January 2009 , Singapore has run a mean testing system in its public hospital: a certain group of citizen e e lower than 3200$ per month will have their hospital fee subsidized by 80% while those who earn more than 5200$ monthly will only have their hospital fee subsidized by 50%  .

Althoughese statistics were not specifically targeted on the aged , it infocusesing a financial burden played a part in their decision to terminate their life earlier , be it instigated or not .
Thus , the well-planned move for moral education may not be imparting the correct moral value in the end .

With the development of societies , governments and policy makers pay more attention to the phenomenon of aging populations , especially in developed countries .
According to incomplete figures , in the European countries , spending on pensions , health , and related issues is currently 15% of GDP  currently .
Hoe unstable ,ltures are differentd cultural fusion need a long period of time .
Hence , it is not necessary to limit the public spending on the aged for attracting talented immigrants .
On onarguelimiting the public spending on the aged does not mean that munities .
Such costs may even be higher than the original cost of public spending on the aged .
At the same time , cutting doethe agedwith more ways to help the vulnerable group and it is the cannot government that pays more attention to the vulnerable group in the society .
The aged belongs to the vulnerable group , as the productivity of thelmay below , but their medical expenses and social costs are higher than otenterroups .
Thus , public support on a finance for the aged is extmay ly important .
In contrast , some may say that it is obligation for cneedsren to show filial obedience to the er generation , so youfamily members need to take cto of the older generation and government can bear less responsibility for older people .
Due to this , the public spending on the aged should be limited .
However , the aim of government is to enable people in its country to live better and happier .
If we just cut down the public spending on the aged and divert the money to other areas of the country's development , this is contrary to the purpose of the government .
In other words , why do we divert the money to other areas of the country's development ?
Because we want to make our country stronger and the lives of citizens better .
In consequence of the same aims , diverting the money to other areas of the country's development is an extra and needless job .
which ,areasI agree e .
If public spending on the aged were to be limited and diverted to funds to encourage coupleshave more babes , many people will plan to have more babies since their worries of not having enough money to bring up or to support so many babies have een partially subsidies by the fund .
As the increase in the fund for baby bonus leads to more people planning to have more babies , this would eventually reduce the problem of having too many elderly which make us move towards an aging society .
Besides , when these babies grow up , they ill be able tond earn money to support their parents .
In this way , it indirectly reduces the problem of having to set aside a big amount of money to aid healthcare services for the elders .

Hence , there is no munity to ask for financial aid .
Thus there shouldivertedlimit to the public spending for the aged .
in eachIn conclusion , I do not agree that puc spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be dividehaveo other areas of the country's development .
The elderly can contribute to the society by using their life experiences to make important decision for the country .
They e the safest county that can make the best decision .
Until recently , there was tiveness , productive capacity in the economy and decrease in public services petitive and productive .

Furthermore , foreign investors petitive society , Singapore needs to make the necessary investments on other areas to ensure that it remains its foothold in the global economy .
Therefore there is a need to analyze the importance of each area and cleverly distribute the spending .
If we do not limit the spending on the aged , Singapore maysk the possibiltof losing its current global recognition status that it has always had .

On the other hand , I mentioned in paragraph two that Singapore is a highly developed country now .
Despite so , we cannot take things for granted as we are still mainly dependent on external economies of other countries especially the Europe and United States of America .
Unlike other countries , Singapore has limited land and has no natural resources .
Thus the solution is to pump in money to further educate younger Singaporeans , invest in other countries and constantly carrying out Research and Development .
All this will be possible only when Singapore continues to invest more money in that respective area .
As the amount of money needed to invest in the respective area is huge , the government may need to consider using money from other aspects such as setting a limit to the amount of money spent on the aged if there is a situation whereby Singapore is financially strapped .
To conclude , these are the probable factors that may arise if public spending on the aged is implemented .
Not only that , if the government is scrapped financially , the government may consider setting the limit and help Singapore in its development .

This description of old age is true as most countries have nopulsory saving scheme for citizen old age .
Alike munity health screening programme is also inaugurated for seniors .
These enable the aged to lead a better quality life e to mind are visions of loneliness and neglect .
Over the years , efforts have been made to develop elder-friendly public infrastructure and housing as munity based support services .

thisIn  modern societies , the aging population is increasing  es to mind: if someone cannot work in his young age , so that he cannot live when he is old if he has no one who care for him personally ?
It is such how itttreatsrgument is trugroup not but I hold the belief that the governments should try their bests to help these kind of people to earn money in priority .
For example , the disable peopleial help all their lives , including the old periods as well .
existsconcernAging , a biological process e a quite serious problem for some countries in the recent decades .

Their industrian agingtarting from the modethe actual problem with the aging problem ?re luxurious and "heavy" industries of sport cars such as Mitsub are well-known have a wide range of customers around the world .
With the industrial sector well-developed , Japan can still maintain its economy from falling despite of iverage population age of 42 and proved that funding the industrial development sector can really help in easing the aging problem by reducong the impact .
itsJust as the aging population is a serious problem , spending for to haveold age populofalso a problIn if it is todone properly .
Spending on the old age must be limited and not too many as there are other aspects as shown above that also need to be funded .
On the other hand , spending on the old age should not be too little either as spending too little will cause the population to be upset and therefore decreases the government stability .
It is a challenge for the government to find country ,ht portion of the spendiits workforceas to be allocated for the old age population in the country as it is one of the obligations and responsibilities a government has .
The better , however , is spending more on the other aspects rather than spending on the old population .
If one can solve the aging problem and develop the country at the same time by spending more on other sectors in the country just as mentioned above , why would one chooseMitsubishi ,d spend more on the old age population ?
The aging problem is gradually groe more serious in the near future as the lifespan of mankind keeps increasing .
This is es into play .

Governments often put their focus on the country's development such as economic gropelled by laplacency , the benefits of investing in a military can only be projected as a contributing factor to the economic gropromised for the country's development .
In  contemporary society , the elderly are e a profitable workforce for society .
As a result , they can support themselves more effectively not only when they are young , but also during their old ages .
In addition , governments can spend more on developing technologies .
By doing this , more and more useful and efficient tools and machines can be invented which will improve the productivity of every economic activities .
So it will enable the economy to expand which means more jobs will be created for everyone .
Not stopping at this point , governments can also use money to encourage more researching in many fields such as healthcare , etc . . . That will definitely better the living standard of citizens and improve the economy as well as ease the aging issue .
In conclusion , governments should cut off the inefficient amount n the aged and use it to invest in other aspects of society so that the result is bettelderlyf not just for the aging problem .
Many developed countries such as Singapore are faced e a restraining factor for the groe in parallel to the nation prosperity .
Furthermore , non-profit organizations dedicated to take care of the elderly are able to obtain donations easier as the members of the public are more able to contribute .
Clearly , economic groplicated equipments that enable them to bring revenue back to the country .
Educating the population not only improve the economy by alloe more efficient , but also alloe here for these special treatments to cure their illnesses .
The country's expertise can also be sold to other countries too .
However , the mentioned advantages to the elderly are only applicable to the aged who have caregivers and are able to afford health services and education .
Single and poor elderly would not be able to reap the benefits but suffered because of limited public spending by the governmecitizens'm .
Effective measures to identify these needy elderly are needed to separate them from the wealthier cohort .
Following which , appropriate amount of help is given equally to them so as to fully utilize the limited resources .
wishequipmentIn conclusion , the country's development is more important than the aging population as it helps the entire population including the elderly .
The public spending on the aged should be limited as the other domains that would assist the country's developments are beneficial both to the population and the elderly .
The statement puts forpared to other sectors such as social , economical and political progress in a country .
Based on this idea , the government of a country should focus on improving these areas munity .
We cannot abandon them as ultimately they are still an integral part of our society .
Government should spend much effort to take care of them by providing financial support .
It plained that he had no job , no children to support him and a petty monthly sum from the government simply could not support him .
He had no choice but to resort to bank robbery for survival .
He further confessed that even if he gets jailed , at least then he ing years , as people live longer ing a group that's too significant in numbers to ignore .
If a country fails to take care of this significant portion of society , its people would lose confidence in government's ability to handle other topics as well .
Then , all other developments are futile as no amount of progress can replace a government's credibility in its people's heart .
Public spending on the aged should not be limited in order to divert this money to other areas of the country's development .
The reduction of the funds allocated for the elderly might lead to many social issues .
Apart from that , it is morally e . Thus , public funds are essential for the aged to uphold their standard of living .
Certain social issues such as poor quality of life and insufficient funds for basic healthcare may arise from limited funding .
In general , most of the aged in Singapore are economically inactive and have a lot of free time on their hands .
In order to prevent them from turning to vices such as gambling and drinking , organizing more activities at various community centres are required for them to lead healthy social lives .
As these activities require government funding , limiting spending on the aged e families who face high costs of living and cannot support both their children and elderly parents .
Hence , there should be distribution of public funds to the elderly parents of these families .
On top of mentalere physicaly who have no children , so if their financial conditions are unstable , they should able to given the necessary funds to make ends meet .
In retrospect , in order to maintain a healthy social life for the elderly and lessen the burden of their families , sufficient funding should be allocated .
Therefore , considering all the various negative impacts in terms of social , economic and cultural factors on the society , I feel that public spending on the aged should not be limited and diverted to use in other areas of the country's development .

I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
This is because excessive public spending on the aged can hamper the country's development in other areas such as education , research and investments .
If the aged have children , the children should also be responsible for their parents' pulsory saving policy can be a double edged spulsory for children to provide for their parents with the basic necessities such as housing and allowance .
Although such policies can reduce the people's dependency on the government , it may not be practical for some .
This is because some children may already have problems supporting themselves or even a new family which they started , so they may want to support their parents but are practically unable to do so .
Nevertheless , the government can be flexible with the policy such that if the children have financial difficulties they can then seek aid from them .
In recent years , many developed countries have been facing problems related to aging population , especially pressures on social support systems .
In view of the  dramatic increase in national budget spent on the aged , some people suppose that the government should limit its expenditure on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .
However , from my perspective , I unhesitantly take issue with the above idea and believe that elderly people deserve public support policies , instead of boundaries on healthcare and welfare schemes .
One of the primary reasons why the government  should not set limits on public spending on older people is the aim to create a higher quality of live for almost everyone .
A society is developed  only if its citizens satisfy the minimum requirements of health , happiness , safety , prosperity , and fortunes .
And obviously , those of old age should also be provided services such as healthcare , insurance , housing . . .Thus , there is no reason for the government to eliminate its expenditure on this area while many people's lives can be improved thanks to the support .
Another factor that policy makers should consider before deciding to set boundaries on public spending on the aged is issues related to moral standards whose decline has been witnessed in recent years in many countries .
From this angle , public support policies for elderly people will make young generations change their attitude toward older people .
Improved healthcare services , subsidies . . . not only aid the aged in poor financial situations or make their health better but also are the ways people express their respect to the older , which has positive impact on enhancing younger people's treatment .
Last but not least , most elderly people after all have contributed to the development of the country during their young age through productive services as well as taxes .
Therefore , limiting public spending on them is irrational .
They deserve more support policies .
The government should not consider the rising expenditure related to programs to support a growing elderly population without mentioning their contribution in the past .
When taking into account  all the above factors , I can safely conclude that public spending on the aged should not be  limited  even though the amount of money can be used to invest on some areas like education , infrastructure and development projects .
Policy makers should find another solution to reduce the rising cost of healthcare or welfare schemes to maximize the benefits of both citizens and the nation .

Most developed countries are nomunity hospitals as munity hospitals .

Also , special apartments called studpartments are being built for the elderly .
On the other hand , some may argue that the public spending on the aged shoulsuchdiverted into other areas of the country's development .
Diverting the public spending into other areas of the country's development will cause the aging population problems to increase aemployment of the elderlycreases the burden of the younger generation .
As such , the public spending on binfrastructures thatrcaterture for the aging population should be encouraged so as to prepare countries for their aging population and ease their aging process .

By creating policy of encouraging elder employment , the elders in the societyemployment of the elderlydependent and able to support themselves .

Finally , building nelderlyvelopment of infrastructure caters to the elders will help a country prepare for the aging population .
In many countries , the proportion of older people is steadily increasing .
It has been shoe up with many strategies to deal with the problem .
Although we cannot solve the problem in the short run , we can ease the problem in many ways .
To a large extent , current research and development/policies hcountries that have ease the aging process .
However , we should still go on to ease the problem .
The growing number of aged people  has brought with it many problems including greater pension pressure , increasing medical expenses , and the heavy burden of nursing care for the elderly and so on .
It can slow down the productivity of the society .
It also gives more burdens on young people .
It also discourages the young people from working hard because they think they can depend on the society when they are old .
It also has great impact on health-care .
For governments , there are generally two ways to deal with the problem .
One is to reduce the future old-age dependency burden by increasing available resources , which means to increase the size and productivity of tomorrow's working-age population .
One is to rethink the private attitudes and public policies that now equate old age with a loss of health which somehow entitles the elderly to government spending .
We should do  both  to  deal with aging problem by making aging both more secure for older generations and less burdensome for younger generations .
The policy makers have found out many ways to ease the problem .
For example , the the government encourages old people to continue to work , and government encourages people to save for their old-age , and encourages young people to produce more and so on .
These policies have indeed eased the aging problem .
Without these policies , the government may increase spending on the old people or the young people will be more burdened .
For the young people themselves , they should work hard for their old-age and save to prepare for the old-age .
In this way , it can reduce the burden of the next generation and reduce the spending of the government .
Also , it can encourage people to work hard and help to increase productivity .
For example , Singapore encourages people to save for their old-age .
In the past , the old people just depend on their next generations .
This can make the old people not secure if they have no children or their children are poor .
Thus , the people can secure themselves when they are old in this way .
For the society , it can support the old people by building charity .
There are many charity funds in the society to help old people .
It can ease the aging problem without giving burden on the government and poor people .
Furthermore , it can help to distribute the property and decrease the gap between the rich and the poor .
However , some developed countries have high healthcare costs and thus aging may still impose an economic burden .
It is important to set appropriate limits on healthcare .
To do this , we should know what "health" means for an aging population .
Thus the government should decide on what is essential and should therefore be supported by the public sector , and what should be left to individuals .
Besides , different countries have different policies for their own .
Every country has its own features .
Thus one should not copy the so called paradigm of developed countries .
The developing countries may not have enough capacity to deal with the problem because they have not enough money .
The developed countries can also help developing countries to ease aging problem as it is a global problem .
Some countries deal with the aging problem by encouraging young people to have more babies .
It is a good way to ease the problem for the countries having small population .
However , it does not always work in other countries having big population like China .
To a large extent , governments , society , and young people should do something for the aging problem .
We can ease the aging problem from different angles .
So far current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .
However , we should keep calm and continue to deal with the problem .

The government funds petitive elderly people e more skilled and hence increase their competitiveness in the global market .
The country pete more effectively on a global scale .
peopleIn conclusion , government spending is important for all sectors of the country's development .
However , there are limits on how much they casavend on each area .
Furthermore , new challenges and problems will arise in the future; hence because of these two reasons , I feel that government should not be too focused on the ageing population issue as there might be other more urgent issues that require their immediate attention in the future .
Personally , I do agree that spending on the aged should be limited so that more money can be channelled to other areas of the country's development .
Instead of priming the spending on the aged as one of the key focus on our annual budgeting regularly , I strongly feel that the Singapore government should redefine its focus and divert its focus to other key areas such as military , urban development and education spending .
lion'smanyFirstly , military spending is of paramount importance to all sovereign countries like Singapore .
The adequate spending on the military aspect not only conveys a strong deterrence message to our potential aggressors , but willnt personals .
These competent people petitive edge over our competitors , it petitive edge over our neighbouring countries and also build a strong presence in the finainvolvement in this region !
the country'sinEvery country has its oe along e , they will know that their future is well-secured .
Correspondingly , people will work harder , and there is no doubt that the country will thrive by leaps .
inforworkIn conclusion , caring about the country's future development is good , but we should never foinet about the past , the people who are now not capable of supporting their own lives .
It is much better to have a suitable and balancing money distribution of public invesfort between elderly care and other aspects .
Population aging generally refers to the increase in the percentage of elderly people in a country .
According to the latest statistics reports , the current number of elderly people is increasing constantly at 8 million per year globally .
Due to this situation , many countries have made huge amount of public spending on the aged in order to ease the various problems that came along e . This could be a huge economic burden for countries like Japan promise on the part of military spending so as to obtain a harmonious and stable society pared to the spending on the , which .

The 2 technology that are mentioned in this essay are amongst many that facilitate the old in handling age-related decline in health , performance and productivity .

as well the fact that the elderly still stay with their grown are still being practised .countriesT .ThesesacrificedIn long term stagnation , the increase of aging population had lower down the Gross Domestic Product  of the country .
The government has to take this issue seriously before it affects the economy growth of the country .
Before the leaders taking effective action , the ideology and engage of the practical realities have to be risen .
They must realize by lessen the impoverishment future generation and limit future public spending from expansion of retirement benefits .
For instance , The United State of America created a status of attitudes toward the elderly- Aging Population: Opposing Viewpoints to improve the trecountriesof demographic aging .
The government has to concern about this issue , so the further impact would not happen in the future .
However , critics of this poshaveon argue that the government should not spend time and resources to ease the aging process .
Instead they should implement hase policies on the younger generapolicieso boost the economy growth so as to move towards a knowledge based economy and also to introduce more schemes to increase the birth rate so that the government is able to meet their goals .
Moreover , it is the children's responsibility to take care of the parents instead of the government .
If the elderly well- being is not well taken care of , the younger generation may not want to reconsider giving birth since the society is unprepared for the aging population in the future and this will cause more elderly living in this society .
If the society is well-prepared , the younger generation does not have to worry about their own welfare when they turned old .
Besides that , not all children have the ability to support their parents as they might be facing financial problems and hence unable to take good care of them .
In addition , some elderly do not have any children .
Therefore the elderly need the government helps to meet their physical needs .

The problem of aging population has become es terrible as the elderly are drained from high medical and healthcare fee .
Thus governments' pension , subsidy and medical insurance perform a main role to help such old people .
Hoparably less pension to support them .
Their loparing to purely spending more money on the aged is to restructure the pension , subsidy and medical insurance systems to ensure the limited government's money can effectively help the aged .

Many countries have made different nepulsory education in urban and rural places .
The vision of this policy is to raise the civilization level f the count .y and give its citizens abilities to keep pace e the radical part of the aging problem .
Some people may have doubts about the productivity of elder people and argue that it is elder people's right to lead later lives of ease .
However , that is not true .
On the one hand , life today is different from the past , in part because of demographic and economic changes .
The a largeaamounted 65 to 75 is healthier and better educated than those in this age group in past generations .
Most people retired from work today are still energetic and in quite good health .
So there is no doubt that elder people are able to lead longer working lives .
On the other hand , since elder people are mostly more experienced and patient , there truly exist some certain jobs more suitable for them .
In that case , elder people are even more productive than younger workers .
the elderlyTIt is shown that we are able to efficiently solve the problems caused by aginelderlyulation with limited spending .
Through the methods of requiring people to provide in advance and encouraging longer working lives , more money can be diverted to other areas to promote the economic development .
And with sufficient economic development , there will be more choices for governments to care for the old .
It is panies or insurance companies provide a variety of investment plans pel people to save by law .
andSpending a lot of money is not the most effective way to solve the aging problem .
We can also achieve the goal of easing the aging process bcouraging advance savings and providing suitable jobs for the old .
Since the money should be reduced by promoting these two policies , more money can be transferred to other more urgent areas .
In a nutshell , money spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development .

Therefore the retirement age should be pushed back and eld .

With sufficient economic growth , there will be lesser needy people as well .
Healthcare Service
The cost of healthcare is on the rise , oreliancee challenges of the Government is to try to make healthcare services more affordable .
Healthcare service is very essential to t elderly as they are more prone to illnesses therefore by lowering the cost of healthcare , elderly can have more money to use in other areas of retirement .
As the saying goes "prevention is better than cure" - free health screening and health campaigns should be implemented .
Getting more elderly to get free health screening can ensure health prosubsidiesbe treated at an early stage thus reducing cost of expensive treatments when symptoms turn serious .
The citizens should also be encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle to prevent any possible illness to ensure a smooth retirement with more money spent on other areas other than healthcare .
Vulnerable Group of Elderly
The human's life expectancy has increased over the years with the advanced technology and different living environment; more adults are better educated and well off than before , this have changed our peion towards what is healthy and what is ageing .
Despite all these improvement , it does not mean that every single one of the elderly in the country would be covered and well taken care of .
There will still be a group of vulnerable eldresource the oa lot of single elderly as mentioned by Robert B . Friedland and Laura Summer  .
This means that lower educated people will be more likely to be needy of the public spending funds .
But all in all , the advantage of limiting of the public spending overall outweighs the disadvantage as the needy group of people would be minimised .
In conclusion , I agreed that public spending should be limited as citizens should not be over reliant on their Government and the focus to solve such problems should be to increase workforce and also make use of more money on lowering healthcare costs or in other areas of the country's development .
Lastly , the potential contribution of an elder would definitely be valuable for the current generation because of tare livingwledge and experience that thas broughte , that would bring manyhouseholdsssons to the younger generaand then , making use of this important factor would allow the younger generation .tR appreciate them so much more .
An elder is a valuable asset if we know how to make use of their strengths and not focus on their weakness .
Hence , when they are contributing to the society by giving vpaysssons to the younger geneon , the best that we can repay them is in monetary value to allow them to get b this expensive and fast-paced world that we live in .
As they grow older , we must not leave them alone instead help them get through with just a little guidance to bring them alongside the society to help , there is much that an elder would be able to give their advice on .
theftsS ?W .In conclus much that we can learn from and theylives todeed a precious human resource in a country , instead of looking at them in a negative light and saying that they are of no use , instead let's make use of strength erms of experience and knowledge to help thweeneration and advice them more .
Thore government should all the more try their best to support them not financially , that also includes , in all aspect of their life , emotionally , physically and mentally .
Aging is the accumulation of changes in an organism or object over time .
Aging process happens naturally and does not result from disease or accident .
The effects of this process differ from each person but most likely they munication .
Elderly e such problems .
In 2006 , an electronics brand , Samsung , launched its Jitterbug J , an excellent cell phone for the elderly .
This gadget provides the elderly a simple mon in elderly because the sense of smell changes as people age .
When sense of smell changes , elder people will lose the ability to detect smoke , leaking gas , or airborne pollutants and toxins .
Thus , they will need warning devices to detect smoke and carbon dioxide .
A device called The Shake-Up Alarm is a solution to this problem .
The Shake-Up Alarm contains of two parts: smoke detector and signaller .
When smoke is being detected , the smoke detector will transmit signals to two receivers which are a bed vibrator and a strobe light .
The bed vibrator can be placed under a pillow or mattress .
Thus , the vibrator will alert the owner even when he falls asleep .
The second receiver , which is a strobe light , will flashes 60 times per minute .
The other illness thofusually attacks elderly is memory loss .
According to a mid-March story from HealthDay , "5 .4 million Americans over 70 have memory loss that affects their daily lives" .
One problem that occurs as an effect of memory loss is a difficulty to manage a strict schedule of numerous prescription drugs .
Many pills look similar and there are different instructions for takiphonesch of them .
Thus , it will be a big problem for the elderly with memory loss to remember the instructions of each pill .
However , there is a device called Med-eMonitor which can help ease such burden .
Med-eMonitor is a pill organizer which functions as medication separator and system reminder .
This device also shows on-screen instructions which will help elderly take the drug with proper dosage and schedule .
Another device that can help elderly with memory loss is Mnemonic .
Mnemonic is a wrist-wrapped device that reminds the owner about important events or meetings .
It has a special feature which is built-in accelerometer which will keep the display on top no matter which direction it is rotated .
In conclusion , every people will face the aging process and as a result , various diseases such as vision and hearing loss , smell problems , and memory loss are likely to attack as they age .
After all , nowadays research and development in technology has eventually provided a variety of gadgets that suit the elderly and help them handle the aging process .
Thus , elderly will feel convenient to do their daily activities and live independently .
A research conducted by The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States shomon chronic health problems mon types of arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis .
Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many tissues and organ but mostly attacks the small joints .
The disease disables the elderly from doing their normal activities because it causes the joints to become smon in individuals mented that  "the silver rings look better than the old bulky ones .
They are also ae durable andas they used to live
handa human Heart disease makes up more than 30% of the death of American adults aged 65 and above caused by chronic disease , making it the disease es in the second place .
In the United States , Lung cancer kills the most people among the other cancers .
The traditional method to cure lung cancer on a patient is by surgery or radiotherapy mended to cure the disease depending on the patient's condition .
The problem is , most elderly patients are not as fit enough as younger patients to stand chemotherapy .

Victor Hugo , poet and novelist , once said that "Forty is the old age of youth; fifty the youth of old age" .
Old age is therefore not the end of our life but a start .
There are many physical and mental ailments that often arise from aging , such as brain degeneration , disdiscriminationom the public , social isolation and no sense of direction in life .
To reduce the negative impact of agithe aging processt is therefore important to create a role model for the elderly , elito eliminate ageism in the society , d imprto improve detection of depression and encourage lifelong learning .

People today are able to  ease the aging process because of current research and development .
One area of focus is on psychology .
In psychology studies , scientists analysed human mental functions and behaviours and came out petent and useless as tthe elderlylong contributes to the society .
Firstly , live long learning is emphasized to help them .
They can upgrade their skills by taking up enriching courses like computer classes .
At the end of the course , a certificate munity munity service clubs like NUS CSC have gathered volunteers to visit these elderly at least once a munity activities munity centres , they can also form groups with other elderly to do morning exercises .
"People who are physically active in their leisure time aged more slowly than" people who live a sedentary life .
.
Exercise can help them to improve blood circulation , bone strength and immune systems functions .
Therefore , make them look and feel younger .
the elderlyto confide inThe saying goes: "You're only as old as you feel" .
Since the solutions from current research and development can help elderly to feel young and create a positive attitude towards life , hence aging is eased to a large extent .
Caring for the oldcontroversial topic has been put forplaints of the public .
Thirdly , limiting the public spending on the aged plaints of public , e . Limiting the public spending es are limited , it must arouse complaints and evokes the indignation .
People may be anti-government and try to hinder the implementation of neplaints and indignation from the public .
According to the definition from the Internet , "psychology is an academic} and applied} discipline involving the systematic , and often scientific} , study of human/animal mental functions} and behavior} ."
.
As psychology develops , it has benefitted human a lot , helping people knoe life-threatening , can be prevented and eased mon elderly mental illness , elderly depression could as pany regularly and care more about him .
Probably elderly depression pete in employment .
As an old saying puts it , it is never too old to learn} .
By continuous self learning , the elderly is able to refresh their mind and keep up mand of computer use has become increasingly necessary for everyone .
If a grandfather knopetitive in the es more competitive in employment , it is easier for them to choose late retirement .
As a result , the aging problem can be eased .
With the population of aged getting larger in society a big sum of money is involved in helping the aged .
If this huge amount of spending is reduced , but in turn , spent on other areas of the country's development , the e unbalanced and would be insuffic on the other areas , for instance , education .
Let us imagine a country that has slower development in education .
In the near future , children in the country would have lower chance to be educated .
With little knowledge and skills , the country would be poor and would not grow .

As much as there are many positive reasons to use nuclear power , many people still have their doubts about this source of energy , mainly due to the fact that they remembered the infamous Chernobyl incident and the atomic bombs of World War Two .
Any accidents could lead to widespread damage and nobody can afford another radioactive leakage which could signal the end of nuclear energy .
Despite a generally high security standard , accidents will , nonetheless , happen .
Technically , it is almost impossible to build a plant which is totally safe .
There is always a chance of the plant failing .

In the 21th century , energy issue becomes a serious problem that human beings are facing .
It is predicted by experts that the fossil fuels es really urgent to find a substitutable energy source to meet the increasing demand of human beings .
As a result , many scientists have turned to the nuclear energy and are doing research on future Generation IV reactors pared to the previous reactors .
These evidences all shoe the challenge and to turn this reactor into reality .
Modern life depends on energy supply to a great extent .
All the inventions have improved our quality of life and made each human being a large consumer of electricity and fossil fuels .
With the development of technology and the increase of population , energy demand explodes .
Contrarily , the main energy supplier mercialized .
Only if it is massive built , the energy problem of human beings can be solved ultimately .
As some may argue , maintenance also needs money and may lead to the increase in the average costs .
Homon sense that maintenance fees should be much lower than the cost of building a new one .
Besides , building less reactors and longer their lifetime saves money as well as natural resources such as land .

Such as the munication as an important issprocessestry to find a precise and standard language for aviation communication .
disastersUp tillbut not least , the training of the captains and the cremunichas beenion systems and the manpower training , indirectly caused the accident to happen .
The use of psychology in the design process can help the designers to consider these issues more thoroerrorsnd perhaps ifailureing his decision .
The result of any of theseoneminor changes could perhaaccidentsprevented the accident from ever occurring .
According to a BBC report , in Europe alone , there are 165 nuclear reactors .
On the other hand , there are also countries that are against this idea , such as Germany , which is withdrawing  its nuclear programme  .
The reason for opposing isopposing nuclear programmesclear accidents release harmful radiation that has adverse effects on humans and the environment .
This is seen in the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 followed by the Chernobyl accident in 1986 , which have reinforced fears in thfears of nuclear powerple .
In addition , many are concerned that nuclear reactors are prone to being used as a weapon ofweaponsstruction by terrorists and hostile countries .
Thus , they are against the idea of building nuclear plants .
With these concerns in mind , scientists and engineers have developed six Generation IV nuclear reactor concepts with enhanced safety features that would prevent another Chernobyl .
Furthermore , nuclear energy is a clean alternative to fossil fuel as it emits far less greenhouse gases  .
In this essay , I will discuss the benefits of the molten salt reactor  , which is one of the six Generation IV concepts , and show that it is superior to the very high temperature reactor  in terms of safety , performance and cost .
Firstly , in terms of safety , the VHTR is said to be a relatively safe nuclear reactor because it includes a back-up emergency core cooling system .
However , the MSR operates under an even safer condition .
Unlike the VHTR , the MSR adopts a passive emergency cooling system .
The method of cooling in the MSR is more efficient than the VHTR because if the MSR coolant salt overheats and overflows , the coolant salt will be transported to various storage tanks which are installed with passive decay heat cooling systems , so they are verified to be critically-safe .
Besides the storage tanks , freeze valves that will automatically open whenever they detect overheating of the salt are also installed .
As a result , heated fuel will be disposed of immediately without threatening an explosion or leakage  .
Therefore , the MSR is a much safer reactor than the VHTR .
Secondly , the overall performance of the MSR also surpasses the VHTR , making the MSR a better nuclear reactor .
The VHTR operates at a core outlet gas temperature of more than 900 to 1000 with output power estimated to be 600MW .
On the other hand , the MSR is able to not only operate in small sizes , but also in large sizes .
Besides the varying sizes that an MSR could work in , it is also able to operate at two varying temperatures of 705 and 1000  .
At 1000 , the VHTR's overall plant efficiency is about 50% while the MSR's overall plant efficiency is about 60% .
This shows that at constant tempethe samethe MSR is at least 10% more efficient than the VHTR .
Therefore , countries should invest on the MSR whiin is more efficient than the VHTR in terms of overall plant efficiency .
Last but not least , waste recycling in the MSR allows better usage of materials as well as ensures a lower cost of operation .
The wastes produced in VHTR go directly to the repository .
However , in the MSR system , wastes produced from generation of electricity will be recycled .
The system collects and processes the wastes according to their physical and chemical properties , and separates the residual fuel from the wastes .
During the process , plutonium and uranium would be recovered and then recycled to produce more energy .
This in turn reduces the volume of material disposed of since plutonium and uranium make up almost 97% of the entire mass of fuel used in generating nuclear energy .
This will also lead to reduction in costs since capital spent on reactants are significantly reduced  .
Therefore , adoption of the MSR as an alternative to electricity production is a wiser choice than choosing the VHTR .
In conclusion , the MSR is a much better reactor than the VHTR as the MSR is safer , has higher overall plant efficiency and more efficient recycling method .
Thus , we should invest in the MSR to produce energy efficiently .
With emission of green house gas noe these disadvantages .
Actually , GIF  has already set a R&D funding for the nepetitive with coals and gas  .
As mentioned above , the new reactors are operating at very high temperatures and have highly automatic cycle system , so they are more efficient .
For instance , the VHTR  can produce half more electricity with the same amount of resources  .
Therefore , the cost on the resources can be significantly reduced .
Also , due to the highly automatic system , the capital spent on hiring experienced operators and building offsite monitoring systems can be reduced .
Both of these make it cheaper to build nuclear plants .
provideThe final argument advanced bgaseshe opponents is that this new generation of reactbeings will be more of a terrorist target , because they are more powerful  .
However , the experts say tpreventthe Generation Ifromtors will be less of a terrorist target  .
The reason is that all the six concepts of Generation IV reactors contain simplified safety features that no longer depend on sophisticated operators , which means that they can cool themselves if there is anything wrbudgetedforn the whole progress .
Therefore , any at trigger an accident deliberately will be in vain .
must thuswould not be able torate ,without a solution , andand so on)The principal challenges today are sustainable development and climate change and hopetitive and proliferation-resistant .
Very High Temperature Reactor  one of the Gen IV reactors holds much potential .
Till date the nuclear industry has created a lot of problems pared to existing reactors and it can be useredefiningydrogen petitive .
Large capital cost is required for the building of Generation IV nuclear reactors .

Firstly , most of them have higher pest and disease resistance .
So the usage amount of chemical substances ing desperate in today's context , these tmon drags or chemicals , they are more complex .
But if ponent for a proper assessment is defining the appropriate baseline for comparison and decision .
One of these assessment methods is to compare the GM food and their original natural species .
Moreover , scientists have come up with new method , through which they can insert a special kind of gene in to the plant cell to prevent the plant from breeding .
This new technology can eliminate people's concern about the transmission of special genes .
On 26th April 1986 , a severe reactor's meltdopared to the time pared to the old nuclear poponents in that bined pared to other type of nuclear reactors .
This is due to MSR system offers an integrated fuel cycle and embodying a breeder reactor concept . 
AlthoughareIn conclusion , despite many people are still opposing the concept of reactor generation IV , I believe that MSR could bring the nuclear poe the main source of energy in the next decade .
Engineering is concerned plements engineering process .
As defined by Blum  , psychology in engineering is concerned ponents of the structure , it munication munication can often be a problem .
Not only do engineers have to communicate munication system can lead to disastrous consequence .
In the case of Hyatt Regency accident , the miscommunication between the engineering team and Havens Steel Company , the contractor responsible for manufacturing the rods , are very much accountable for the fatal accident .
Since the calculation for the structure was made according to the engineers' initial plan , adjustment will have to be made for a different material used .
The manufacturers are not informed of the possible effect of the change in material .
Use of psychology in engineering process is also necessary in predicting the possible dilemma faced by end users using the product and the possibility of wrong usage which can cause potential harm .
Study of behavior of man is necessary in the prediction and adjustment of the system to suit users .
In the case of Hyatt Regency accident , the failure to foresee the large crowd and hence larger workload is one great mistake made by the engineers .
As a heavily advertised project , engineers should have anticipated response from the people .
Hence , it will be utmost importance to verify the maximum load that the walkway is able to withstand .
In the event that the crowd predicted is above the maximum load the walkway can withstand , possible measures can be taken to divert the crowd , and ensure load within a safe boundary .
occurrencesissuesIn the caof Hyatt Regency accident , the application of psychology would have possibly prevented the accident .
It is apparent that the negligence of the engineering teams was to be blamed for the accident .
Since the first use of nuclear reactor as electricity generator in 1957 , the public has been very concerned about its safe operation  .
Public opposition is even more intense after the accidents at Three Mile Island } and Chernobyl .

With the fast groing an increasingly serious problem nopared bustible , it is likely for the VHTR to explode at high temperatures .
Once the accident happens , the related safety components of the reactor e safe and environmentally friendly .
Another argument advanced by opponents of SFR is that it can only produce electricity and it has shoing an economical reactor so far  .
It is true that the VHTR can produce not only electricity but also hydrogen; hopletely meet the demand of markets for electricity .
.On the other hand , the cost of the research and development of SFR is only about 610 milhave emergedollars , which is much less than that of VHTR .
All of these facts show that the SFR is more economic and flexible than VHTR .
reactorIn a nutshell , it can be seen that the arguments against the sodium cooled fast reactor are inconclusive and not valid .
On the contrary , the SFR system has more advantages over VHTR on its safety , efficiency and costs , which made the SFR a promising reactor .
Therefore , the research and development of sodium cooled fast reactor is necessary and overwhelming .

Supercritical-e weak .
Therefore building a reactor to run under the conditions of a supercriticthat a similarr-cooled reactor could be dangerous .
I agree that under high temperature and pressure , materials generally tend to deteriorate faster and would have a lower lifespan .
However , the structure of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor is designed such that its pressure threshold rises with temperature .
CITATION Sat08 \l 1033  This makes the skeptics' worry redundant as the structure isan incidentd to specifically operate under the high temperature and pressure .
Therefore , further research and funding in the supercritical-water-cooled reactor should take place .
Lastly , the benefits that a supercritical-water-cooled reactor could bring make it worth further researching and funding into the reactor .
The reactor is much more efficient than conventional light water reactorsworkede supercritical-water-cooled reactor has a thermal efficiency of 45% which is approximately one-third higher than that of conventional light water reactors CITATION Sat08 \l 1033  .
Furthermore , the supercritical-water-cooled reactor is just an improvement of the conventional water reactor , making it relatively cheap to build .
Also , nuclear power is not a source of carbon dioxide , a major greenhouse gas that causes global warming .
The high thermal efficiency and environmental friendly characteristic of the supercritical-water-cooled reactor make it attractive to build the reactor .
Therefore , there should be further research and funding into the building of supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
In conclusion , the skeptics' worries of safety are redundant with the current level of technology .
In addition , the high efficiency and environmental friendly characteristic of a supercritical-water-cooled reactor make it profitable , in the long run , to build .
Hence there should be further research and funding into the building of supercritical-water-cooled reactors to further improve on this new generation IV reactor concept .

First , it won't give off carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide , which has a positive impact on our environment .
We are really worried about the Green house gases now , there is a data shows that every year the temperature globally increases 0 .2 to 0 .3 degree Celsius .
So , it is very effective to use Uranium to stop the Green house gases .
Second , the cost of purifying Uranium and getting coal which generate the same amount of energy is almost the same .
It is means that the cost is acceptable .
Pure Uranium is easy to transport , because only 1 ton of Uranium will give use the same energy as burning 5000tons of coal .
So , many countries , including U .S , China , Russia , France , U .K and Japan , begin to use Uranium .

One more argument for nuclear energy is that it is cheap .
However , the nuclear power plants are all operating at low temperatures now , rendering them inefficient , due to limitations of technologies .
The cost advantage of nuclear energy is not so obvious here .
However , if we take into account of e set up cost of the nuclear plants , which are more high-tech than coal plants , they are definitely much more expensive .
The equally expensmanytenance cost covered will in the end together contribute todevelopederage cost of producing nuclear energy , which is now mudeformed than that of coal and other sources .
Optimists say that the cost will be greatly reduced when generation IV reactors are developed as they will work with much higher efficiency .
Nevertheless , the technology required is not readilyarettainafewerand it will take a long time to be realised .
Thus , nuclear energy should not be accepted .
In conclusion , nuclear energy may have some seemingly advantages , however , the problems associated with it is not negligible .
Specifically the high cost , radioactive wastes and the safety concerns .
Therefore , nuclear energy may not be a desirable alternative , we should put more of our focus obetter energy sources like solar power .
Many accidents happened over the past decades , some related to design flapassed into the design process .
The Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 illustrates this notion .
On the 25th of April 1986 , reactor 4 petency requirement to the test and thus limit its handling to upper management .
In this manner , there is a high chance that the accident passes the understanding of human reaction during panic stages  .
The design of the reactor could thus include simple idiot-proof automated safety mechanisms petency .

As a result , the use of psychology in the design process may have prevented the Chernobyl accident thereby justifying its cost .

The Generation IV International Forum  has selwere six nuclear systems}
needaddressThe first nuclear reactor pared to the extreme conditions such as high temperature required for the other designs .
Also , according to Butler  , at such temperatures the conversion of heat to electricity is efficient , thus producing more energy than present nuclear plants .
Thus the expenses to develop and operate the LCFR are cheaper than the other designs , increasing profit .
This relieves the considerations industries have for profits and operation stability .
Furthermore , with stability , accidents are unlikely to occur , and therefore resolves the concerns people have for safety .
Next , the LCFR enables waste recycling .
The advantage is the maximized use of uranium , the fuel for nuclear power .
As uranium is a non-renewable resource , wasting should be discouraged , as uranium reserves will deplete as rapidly as fossil fuel .
This is critical as one motive of looking for alternative energy sources is to have a long lasting source , thus this property should be prioritized .
In addition , with waste recycling , the amount of radioactive waste to be disposed is reduced .
This dispels the environmental concerns that governments anaddressesries have .
However , waste recycling is dangerous , as plutonium is separated .
Plutonium is a key ingredient of nuclear weaponry , thus causintherefore it resolves  security concerns .
Nevertheless , this can be resolved by implementing restrictions on nations , preventing nuclear weaponry development .
Hence this property should be present in the future nuclear plant .
Another property of the new nuclear plant is the production of hydrogen fuel together with electricity .
As hydrogen is capable of replacing fossil fuel as an energy source , having nuclear plants that produce hydrogen will relieve us of our dependence on the fast depleting fossil fuel for energy .
This will benefit the world , as carbon emissionssource; thusecrease , slowing down global warming .
However , considering the large amount of space taken up by a plant and its hydrogen output , governments will debate over whether it is worthwhile to use so much land to produce enough fuel for the nation .
In addition , for small countries such as Singapore , there is no room to even construct a plant to power the country .
Nonetheless , land constraints may be resolved by situating the nuclear plant offshore , listed as one of the considerations by the government of Singapore  .
which is  listed as With alterations to the operating temperature , pressure , waste recycling ability and power output of present nuclear reactors , the LCFR design is able to address mansource (Bose , he world has towards the utilization of nuclear power .
In addition , with the advantages of the LCFR design heavily outweighing the possible problems it may bring , the LCFR design is arguably the most suited solution amongst the six designs to the concerns the world has towards nuclear power .
Therefore , more funding should be provided for research and development to be carried out on the LCFR design .

An effective measure can be mandating a 'design check' by a competent and independent third party before construction , prehensiveness of the design process it needs to be in order to give good coverage against a placency in yet another example of human psychology .
This is pliment the design process , by looking out in the directions plexity of modern systems means that there are more opportunities for human errors to creep in .
The resulting system is then too complex for efficient fault-finding for safety insurance .
Therefore it is necessary to apply the studies of human psyche to the design of systems so as to prevent the loss of human life by such errors .
Since the beginning of the 20th century , a number of major engineering accidents have occurred plexity of large engineering projects .
It is important to study these cases and analyze the causes in order to prevent potential accidents .

While the demand of energy is constantly increasing , earth is running lopared to other popared to oil , gas and coal .
In addition , if the coal-fired popound .
VHTR could recycle their coolants and requires minimto be exhaustedn of helium from time to time .
In a nutshell , the opponent's reasons are debatable .
Energy generated by VHTR is abundant , inexpensive , safe and reliable .
Nuclear energy
The first nuclear power plant provided electricity to the power grid in the 1950s .
What separates the first nuclear plant from the recent one is the reactor , which has undergone a series of advancements .
The reactor has evolved from Generation I to Generation III over the past five decades with Generation IV being the next prototype .
However , the one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built over the years is public opposition .
Despite the public claiming that nuclear energy is dangerous , an expensive form of energy or of poor performance , the use of molten salt reactor can address their protestations with new desiconcernsactor and a cheaper , cleaner and sustainable form of energy .
Thesis statement
The major reactor meltdown happened in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and in 1986 at Chernobyl , Ukraine .
Close to a hundred people died and a few thousand people developed cancer over the decades due to exposure to radiation from the reactor meltdown  .
Hence , the radioactive materials are conIn the new reactor within the chamber and if there is a reactor meltdown , the release of large amount of radiation can be prevented .
Eerkens , J . W .  .
Nuclear Facts and Fables  .
Most of the public has the misconception that nuclear energy is expensive , therefore  opposing it .
However , it is easy to conclude without substantiating with a proper cost analysis .
The cost of building a nuclear plant is admittedly more that for than other kinds of power plants but the consideration should be based on performance and cost per unit energy .
According to statistics from the Nuclear Energy Institute , nuclear power plants have achieved increasingly higher capacity factors with the same or greater levels of safety over the past two decades .
In the United States , for example , the average capacity factor for nuclear plants in operation in 1980 was 56 .3 percent .
By 1990 , it had risen to 66 percent , and in 2007 to 91 .8 percent . 
Some opponents of nuclear energy argue that coal reserves can last another 120 years and funds should be spent on researching technology for coal .
However , this is based on the assumption that coal is used solely for producing electricity .
In fact , coal is an alternative raw material to manufacture plastics in place of oil which will be depleted in 40 years , meaning that coal will last much less than the alleged 120 years .
Unlike coal , nuclear energy uses the fission of atoms to generate electricity .
There are many types of elements and their isotopes available for fission like Thorium , Uranium-235 and Uranium-238 , and reprocessing is possible , resulting in at least a thousand more years for nuclear energy .
The burning of coal also produces carbon dioxide and other air pollutants , contributing to the global warming .
Thus , nuclear energy could be a long term solution and it does not contribute to global warming .
It is evident that the claims from the oppositions of nuclear energy are flawed .
In spite of them claiming that nuclear energy is unsafe , costly and of low output , there is research and data to show otherwise with Generation IV reactors .
In conclusion , it could be a wise decision for the public to evaluate nuclear energy as a form of energy and eventually , support further research and development funding for it .

and the critical MSR also provides a very high transmutation capability "fissioning of over 99% of the TRU fed , accounting for loss of actinides in the process of soluble FP extraction from the MS . " Moreover , the Thorium's fuel cycle in MSR resists proliferation .
The Th230 produced will contaminate the Th232 breeding material and is inseparable from it .
When Th230 decays , it emmits strong gamma-ray ,which would harm the electrons needed to process the chain reaction of U232 .
Besides , the consentration of Th232 is only 9% , which is far away from the concentrition of building weapons .

The Chernobyl accident that happened on 26 April 1986 , has led everyone to realize the damages and consequences that e due to an old technology and poor management in the past .
In the next 50 years , demand for energy ponents during operation .
VHTR uses a mixed fuel composition to operate and this composition can produce improvement in fuel performance thus making it a very effective reactor in generating electricity .
This composition is a mixture of 15% carbide and 85% oxide in the fissile particles .
GCFR is a concept pare to the VTHR , therefore the materials used for construction is cheaper and there are more choices of material available .

In the case of the Very-high-temperature reactors , the cost of running the plant is lopared to Molten salt reactors .

As the world copes with the rising cost of oil , governments are investing into different energy fields to diversify their energy sources so as to increase their countries' energy independence .
Some argue that we should not be investing into nuclear energy as it is expensive to build and run and that it is not a renewable energy source , hence we should invest into renewable energies which are more sustainable .
Though renewable energy may be sustainable , their energy supplies are intermittent depending on environmental factors .
Therefore , they are unable to meet the intense energy demand of our growing economies .
Nuclear plants are more expensive to build than the other energy sources , but it is a premium that we have to pay to obtain a reliable and consistent supply of energy to drive our economic progress .
Furthermore , the VHTR concept has a high fuel burn up ratio which translates to an efficiency of 80% which is significantly higher than renewable energies which have efficiencies of 20-30%  .
The VHTR also produces hydrogen which could be used as another source of fuel for power plants or could be sold to industries which use it , hence generates a source of revenue for the state .
It is also good that we diversify our energy sources to booster our energy security .
Hence we should continue to develop nuclear energy as it is a proven tool to obtain constant steady supply of energy .
Furthermore the high energy efficiency and potential uses of hydrogen , gives it more economic advantages over the renewable energies .
Another issue that nuclear energy would address is global warming .
As we know global warming is mainly caused by greenhouse emission from the burning of fossil fuels and its impacts include climate change and the flooding of low lying area hence jeopardizing the survival of our future generations .
Nuclear energy is 'clean' as it does not release any greenhouse emissions .
Furthermore , the ability of the VHTR to produce hydrogen provides another source of clean energy which we could utilize to power our economies and cars which are the main contributors of greenhouse emissions .
By reducing the carbon emissions from these two sources , we would be able to buy us more time to develop technologies to tackle the global warming issue; therefore we should develop the VHTR to aid our cause .
The design of the VHTR has incorporated a lot of safety features which enhances the safety of operating a nuclear plant .
Coupled with that , the strict regulation of the IAEA and its frequent checks ensure that the infrastructure remains safe and intact hence safeguarding the interest of the public .
Furthermore , the high power efficiency of the VHTR makes it economical to operate and the production of hydrogen provide a source of revenue for the state as well as another alternative source of clean energy which reduces greenhouse emissions .
Since the VHTR is able to benefit us economically and environmentally , we should continue to develop it despite its risks .

The first generation of nuclear reactors was built in 1950 .
Since then , continuous researches has been done to produce a better generation of nuclear reactors .

One of the Achilles' heels of nuclear poe environmentally hostile to human and pared to SFR .
The element sodium has a lopared to lead's higher 2023 Kelvins , es overheated and starts to boils .
In the event of an unprotected total loss of poe radioactive and therefore harmful to life during refueling e a very important criterion in the e a consideration .
The LFR's smaller core and lesser required cooling systems , such as the omission of an intermediate cooling link , saves significant building costs as compared to SFR .
In fact , the lead/bismuth-cooled SVBR-75/100 is the cheapest to build amongst other types of fast reactors .
Furthermore , it costs less per kWh of electricity compared to SFR .
Another strong advantage is the scalability of LFR that allopared to 65kW/kgHM of the SFR .
.
Iand betterpromiseOn the other hand , SFR does have some good points .
Sodium danger times more effective as a cooling agent than LFR , because of its better thermal hydraulic properties .
.
Furthermore , SFR has better net efficiency than LFR , 46 .2% versus 34 .6% for the latter .
SFR has been the mainstream for nuclear poplex design .
All in all , the overwhelming advantages of LFR as a future implementation of the new generation IV nuclKelvinnt , proves that it is better thanKelvinR in all of the abovebecause itspects .
Therefore , we should push boilevelopment of LFR nuclear power plants .
toTo conclude , nuclear energy is relatively cheap , environmentally and socially responsible and safe to use .
Most of the participating nations and organizations of the Generation IV International Forum are supportive of this new technology and they have pooled US$500 million over the next 5 years to fund its further research and development  .
It is imperative for us to accept and embrace this new form of technology in order to meet the world's increasing energy demand .

The most common method of popared to 70% and above for non-nuclear popared to 300-400  C in current nuclear reactors .
This higher temperature translates to the extraction of 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel  .
Improved engineering and design parison is not practical .
Lastly , because of the higher temperature , it is possible to produce hydrogen gas from e a fuel for cars in the future .
Therefore , the VHTR design is superior as it produces more energy and hydrogen gas
Another objection is raised by the taxpayers; they are not convincthe heavy investment of building a nuclear plant .TS A nuclear plant costs on average , a billion dollars and is designed with a lifespan of sixty years  .
Although the price is high , the nuclear plant will not produce any greenhouse or acidic gases .
Acid rain had caused power , whichon and affected fisheries , the damages amounts to millions per year .
Global warming has been linked to the more frequent occurrence of natural disasters .
These disasters created uncountable losses in terms of damage to infrastructure , economy and lives .
In rebuttal to the "limited lifespan" of the nuclear plant , in sixty years , this nuclear plant will have produced much cheaper electricity and caused less harm to the environment .
These two advantages are definitely significant .
producing nuclearIn conclusion , funding for research on the VHTR must be supported .
This is because the VHTR is much safer due to s superior design and "proliferation-proof" process .
The VHTR will ihaveact produce more andaboutheaper energy thaRecently ,er plants .
In addition , the VHTR produces useful hydrogen gas and is environmentally friendly .
Aforsuch , there is no doubt that this technology is superior .
On March 27 , 1977 , the ment "We are uh taking off" or "We are at takeoff" from KLM and the single channel radio munication could still happen , having the tense situation of Tenerife in mind .
Moreover , even munication still causes accidents such as the Garuda A300 Airbus crash in Sumatra  .
For takeoff regulation , it is the first officer's responsibility to obtain ATC clearance and oversee the captain .
Hopleted after the suspension of his decision by the first officer to ask for clearance .
In addition , bination of various accidental factors .
Firstly , the terrorism attack bination of the fact that the controllers were bad at English and unfamiliar with handling Boeing 747s  , there was a high chance that accident would happen even with contingency plans .
In fact , the Pan Am was told to turn at exit C-3 which was impossible for a 747 so the captain decided to turn at C-4 and collided with KLM between C-3 and C-4 exits  .

The heart is the most vital organ for every human being .
This brings no surprise to cardiovascular diseases being one of the leading causes of death in the patible heart at a short period of time .
Proving to be very difficult , the mortality rate of cardiovascular disease remains high .
As medical technology advanced , heavy amounts of research and development have been put to finding a better alternative for saving cardiovascular disease patients .
The research and development efforts gave rise to the creation of Heartmate II .
Like hopatibility and durability , there is still much to improve in terms of safety , performance and cost .
Currently Heartmate II is operating at a 70 .6% success rate plications2 .
I feel that there is much room for improvement for the design to enhance Heartmate II's safety and performance and efforts should not stop till a much higher percentage success rate is achieved .
This proves to be very difficult , and Battery life is one of the main concerns that need to be addressed for the Heartmate II .
Currently , the external battery pack of tpromise in the size of Heartmate II .
The bulkiness of the device could reduce the mobility of a patient and in turn increase the possibiliwork ,or bleeding issues internally .
EsseA heartly , pact and less bulky battery with longer life span .
Another factor to increase the safety of Heartmate II would be the altetoon of the materials used to manufacture the appliance .
Firstly , it has been reflected that users are facing problems with regard to issues surrounding water resistivity externally3 .
Being caught in a rain would prove to be fatal to a Heartmate II user .
Upgrading the material's water resistivity would make Heartmate II safer .
Furthermore , users could even enable the user to take a proper bath , instead of being restricted to just wiping themselves clean with a wet cloth .
In addition , the materials of the wall of the internal artificial ventricles and pump have to be made to have none or negligible resistance so as to ensure smoother blood flow rate .
Lastly , a lighter material should be preferable for the Heartmate II to reduce any strain whilst being attached to its users internally and externally .
All these elements are crucial to the performance and safety of the Heartmate II .
a longerThere exist many more avenues that can be explneeds to improve the Heartmate II and the invention of an artificial heart is still in early stages of its development .
Amidst this discussion , I feel that the cost should not be a determining factor in the construction and application for such health devices that could determines ones life and death .
Issues of security and performance hold the highest priority for medical prototype designs like the Heartmate II .
I strongly feel that the strife for more development and research should be done for the sake of creating a more durable and lightweight Heartmate III .

The parable economics .
which  arenuclearExpertsnuclearwaysdemandThe very high temperature reactor , belonging to the nepared putational methods can be used for simulating air ingress in the VHTR to help prevent the accident  .
lossreducesSo ,water ,Apart from safety issue , in order to implement the very high temperature reactor , people also concern about the economic factor .
Without arguing , it is more expensive to build a nepetitiveness , nuclear safety , is promising to be implemented in the future .
Firstly , people paring to that of the current nuclear reactor e by that time .
With  rapid industrialisation , the energy requirements of the ing graver everyday and threatens to eradicate life altogether on this planet .
This calls for rapid steps to be taken .
The present idea is to seThere an extent with nuclear energy .
The problem with nuclear fuel is that it is extremely hazardous and painstaking research into effective tapping of the nuclear energy continues everyday .
After the Chernobyl disaster involving the radioactive substances escaping the nuclear reactors and killing several people , the world has realised it wants an effective  , clean and safe way to tap this dangerous energy source .
Most of the present research into the nuclear reactor designs is being directed into perfecting the series of reactors called the GENERATION IV REACTORS .
All these reactors are still in the design stage and do not have operational status .They are aimed at providing energy in a more safe and efficient way .There are 6 types of reactors amongst the Generation 4 reactors each with its own advantages and disadadvantages .However  , the type of reactor called the Very High Temperature Reactor  seems really promising and has much greater potential than the other models .
The fuel which is used in VHTR is uranium carbide pellets which are extremely heat resistant .
One of the major reasons for accidents in a nuclear power plant is the meltdown within a nuclear reactor .
With the fuel being so thermally inactive that it doesn't break down even in the event of a meltdown clearly poses as a major safety advantage .Another advantage is that the VHTR does not require frequent refuelling which extracts a heavy toll on the human labour  .
This takes care of a potential risk , human error .
In fact , the refuelling in this type of reactor can be achieved when it is still running .It is so highly efficient that a single pebble can last upto three years . 
One of the major problems related to generating energy from nuclear fuel is the disposal of the spent fuel which is highly radioactive .
In the case of the VHTR the spent fuel is literally infissionable .
The energy generation is so efficient that there is almost a negligible amount of fissionable substance left .
China , Canada , France  , Japan , Euratom and the USA have already signed on the System Agreement for the VHTR under the Framework Agreement  .The total budget for the research and development of the Generation 4 reactors is estimated to be 6 Billion USD according to a GreenPeace report of 2005  .
Arguments to support further research and development funding for Very High Temperature Reactor .
power eraNuclear popared to other energy sources such as coal , oil and pared to gas , coal and oil which are the three main energy sources in the world .
The implicit cost stronglylution that we have to pay is also essentially zero .
This is because the only emission to the environment is steam , which does not pollute the environment in any manner .
Thus , cost should not be an area of concern for the general public .
pebblesIt is therefore evident that safety and security issues have been well addressed by the 'new pebble bed core' of VHTR .
The problem on disposal of nuclear waste is also solved by the ability of VHTR to consume existing nuclear waste and producing nuclear waste with shorter half-lives .
Finally , high cost of nuclear energy is not a valid argument as its cost has always been one of the lowest in terms of implicit and explicit cost .
Hence , I conclude that there must be further research and funding for the Generation IV reactors .

4Lack of experience
Obviously , the human factors occupy a large proportion .
In fact , according to a recent study conducted at the Spelled to be the target of public criticism for a long time , feprehensive study on human factors to reveal thuth .
Actually , the e out to take the consequences .
inis is unfair to engineers , the most important founders of modern world .
As it is suggested by psychology , prowereing favorable working conditions and environment for engineers can be an important element in preventing accidents from happening .
Yet the design of environment of workplaces is just the very process which is neglected by most of the governments and industry directors .
The glare , noise , extreme temperature , vibration , high humidity , acceleration and other physical factors can seriously affect the performance of engineers and both their physical and mental health .
Therefore , psychologists can play an irreplaceable role in designing workplaces by analyzing the structure of users' physical and mental system so as to guarantee that workers can perform in a good condition from start to finish .
Relieving fatigue and restores vitality should be the best way for engineers to prevent accidents .
Third , the public criticism upon engineers needs to be more objective when referring to the theory of possibility .
Just like what B .Wilpert have illustrated in Psychology and design processes , engineers are human and it is possible for human to make mistakes , in other words , engineers need more understanding from the society in a sense .
In theoretical speaking , everything must eventually fail to perform its given function .
The possibility is there .
That is why accidents are called "accidents" and that is why human are called "human" not "god" .
In conclusion , study of psychology regarding prevention of accidents is necessary under this people-oriented situation .
Engineers should not have been over-expected; after all , engineers are also ordinary people and have limitations of human as well .
As human , they need relaxing , they need working in sound conditions and they also need the understanding and recognition of the society as well .
Only if the key players , engineers , are concerned and given due attention can the world of engineering run in the right direction .
That is the best approach to prevent accidents .
Fortunately , a new subject named "Engineering Psychology" has already started to boom recently , which is concerned with adapting the equipment and environment to people , based upon their psychological capacities and limitations .
From the development and achievements of this subject in not-too-distant future , the choice for a better design and the way to prevent accidents can be directly obtained .
Very-high Temperature Reactor  is one of the six generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV nuclear reactor systems selected by the Generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV International Forum for further development in 2002  .
The VHTR uses graphite as the core material and helium as coolant of the reactor to generate nuclear heat e . The VHTR is a safe and profitable nuclear reactor with excellent prospect .
Thus , the VHTR is worth further research .
Hopefully , it will be widely used within a decade .
For decades surgery is operated by human force only , plicated procedures .
In 1985 , the emergence of a prototype "PUMA 560" pointed out a nees of robotic surgery also reveal that it is a safe surgery method .

Therefore , in my opinion , robotic surgery idone developing and trusting .

Chernobyl accident happened on April 26 , 1986 .
It is knoponent , system or process to meet desired needs , and it is a decision making process .
Design is a human activity , and human may make mistakes .
Therefore , designers may make mistakes in the design process .
Psychology is the scientific investigation of humans' mental process and behavior .
Using psychology to analyze hoponents or systems under development , petence of the users .
Therefore , they give insufficient instructions to the users to equip them petence  .
Obviously , in the case of Chernobyl accident , the operator did not have a well-designed instruction manual and was not adequately trained .
If psychology was used in the design process , it would point out this flaw and advise designers to provide an adequate instruction manual including the operations in emergencies so that operators would know how to operate the reactor when facing emergencies .
In this way , Chernobyl accident may be prevented .
The Chernobyl mentions in his book that the RBMK reactor in Chernobyl had a dangerously large positive void coefficientcauseda total oft in the design of the reactor protection and control system .
The designers was aware of the defects of the reactors , however , they did not make efforts to correct them .
Some people argue that these defects caused the Chernobyl accident , psychology cannot solve them .
Technically , psychology could not solve the technical problem for engineers .
But , psychology could point out the potential danger and consequence of the problem so that engineers would search for better options .
If the designers know the severe consequence of the accident , they would try their best to prevent it .
Psychologists could also indicate the flaws in the design process and advise designers to lower the positive void coefficient and enhance the protection and control system in this case .
Thus , the disaster may be prevented .
In conclusion , Chernobyl is a result of flawed design of reactor and inappropriate operation by inadequate operators .
However , the use o f psychology in humansesign process would be helpful to prevent the Chernobyl disaster .
The errors in the design process and the operation process may be prevented with the help of psychology .
Noe difficulties they face during researches rather than give up half mon funds  .
Thus , the public should look forward to Generegarded  IV reathe potentialrformance rather than oppose it .
fundsto the livinghaveGiven the advantages mentioned above , I believe that R&D funding should be given to Theyneration IV reactors .
Even though the fund is limited and by allocating funds for Generation IV reactors , we have to forgo other possible benefits such as spending the same amount of money to solve poverty or terrorism , I support to explore new and advanced technology , Generation IV reactors , to solve environmental and energy problems .
To sum up , the nuclear reactor is a necessary evil .
I feel that the Supercritical water reactor should be further researched and developed and help the whole world in the near future .
People have albustibeen concernedar-grade graphite , pared to the amount produced by wind so in total , the nuclear energy is a cheap kind of energy .
conceptsAfter all , the energy power concept like VHTR helps prevent the effects of global warming .
It is safe and efficient , so therefore can produce a lot of energy and be able to replace traditional sources of energy .
It is clear governments should fund the VHTR nuclear projects to develop it further , and nuclear energy will definitely be the energy of the future .
Some people think that nuclear reactors are not safe .

MSRsIn conclusion , Generation IV MSR does provide the energy hungry cities with the amoMSRs of lectricity needed and it reduces greenhouse effect due to the zero carbon dioxide emission , and lastly it is much safer than the previo;s Generation plants with the enhanced meltdown technology .
On the other hand , the danger of nuclear radiation , fear of terrorism and the high initial and running cost of a Generation IV nuclear plantarekes us consider if there are any other alternatives .
mshelium-cooledOn the other hand , lead cooled fast reactors  has various safety issues es to building a safe reactor .
There are chances of corrosion of leaes ponent materials pared to VHTRs , because the Gen IV's VHTR  are built oofe older geneigh temperature reactors , therefore many of the the lead-cooledems pared pared to LFRs due to the greater system performance and system safcompare itprovides .
Hence VHTRs are , to an extent , better than LFRs .
In the last century , most of the energy paring SWCR busting hydrogen is position and capacity for breeding excess fissile material  .
Therefore , I hold the point that GFR is cheaper in an overall viees from the several nuclear accidents in the last few decades , such as the Three Mail Island one in 1979 and the Chernobyl one in 1986 .
So now , people concern most about the security of any kinds of nuclear plants .
Some think that SWCR is safer than GFR because once accident happen , the pressure of SWCR will decrease immediately , and then the plant will shut down automatically .
Actually , it is not true because safety issue is not only about pressure inside .
The major R&D gaps of SWCR include in-core materials development and demonstration of adequate safety and stability  .
I think that GFR is safer than SWCR .
The three reasons are as stated below .
First , the reaction pressure of GFR is much lower than that of SWCR , which obviously will reduce the risk of accident .
Second , the coolant of GFR is helium , a kind of inert gas , very hard to react with other reagent .
Third , the radioactive reaction waste of GFR can be recycled , while SWCR's cannot .
In a conclusion , Gas-cooled Fast Reactor is better than Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor , respectively in the field of efficiency , expend and security .
I believe that GFR is one of the most penergy-producingion IV nuclear reactors , and its large scaled application is just around the corner .

Energy is one of the biggest problems around the pare tplete and pany paring to the other five protocols  .
In addition , the effectiveness of its utilization of nuclear fuel also contributes to its low cost if it is launched into production .
Therefore , SFR benefits more with its lower cost than VHTR .
fortsNevertheless , andThe devastating damage and long-term , "chronic" consequences of the tpared to other developing kinds of energy like ar energy andring to other kinds of energy .
Thus , a large amount of money can be saved .
Last of all , more procedures will help decrease the potential danger of nuclear energy .
Nuclear waste can also be recycled and reprocessed .
Thanks to theHrapid pace of technology development nowadays , new materials for reactor construction , ways of observing and controlling process , we can be assured that past accident like Chernobyl will never happen again .
On the other hnd , without nuclear disasters , no people died due to working inside nuclear power tenlants .
Howevyear , many people all over the world die from respiratory diseases because of the burning of coal , gas , oil , etc .
In conclusion , the advantages of nuclear energy outweigh the disadvantages .
Regulatory systems will create more strict safety eseasures .
As global enedemands predicted to soar and soar relentlessly , nuclear energy is a prominent resource .
It will not only mitigate the consequences of global warming , but also help lessen the world's thirst of fuel in a long period .
We , human beings have to adapt to a new age of nuclear power , have to fully exploit it rather than being uneasy and in doubt of this controversial type of energy .

Typworld's increasingment cost of a nuclear poes oition with the Nazis todevelop the world's first atomic bomb during the War World II .
The technology was later used to generate energy , thus it is inevitable the most countries own both nuclear weapons and plants .
With the introduction of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Wea; s  , majority of the nations have adhered to it and has since concluded that it is also in their security interest to remain without nuclear weapons .
In summary , nuclear energy will continue to play an important role in meeting the world's energy demand .
However with increasinublic opposition to nuclear tchnology due to the harmful efs ,ects of the radiation produced , in recent years more plants shut down than new onepen .
The cause is due to concernsesover the cost of nuclear plants and most importantly , the safe operation of nuclear plants and the issue of nuclear proliferation .
The concerns are uncalled for as continual research and development will bang about cheaper and safer operation of nuclear plants .

As noted in "Nuclear poprehensive national strength , or the national power , not the nuclear energy , however , they may not see the importance of nuclear energy in improving it .
According to a report made by OPEC , in 2009 , China consumed oil 8 .27 million barrels a day , which is 0 .29 million barrels more per day th8 .
And China will rely almost 50% of its whole energy consum .
The money for oil import is a huge number and that money can do many other infrastructure constructions .
As mentioned beforial for nuclear energy can produce much more energy per kilogram .
Hence , China will reduce a lot of its oil import if nuclear energy is widely used and accepted by the public .
The generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors will perform very satisfying in this aspect .
If we can support and fund the nuclear energy for future development , it will enhance the speed of economy development .

s'There has been much debate on pared to the other chosen reactors , and pared ponents can be recycled .
In addition , the coolant , pared with the other Generation IV reactors .
Research and development has to be done before any of the Generation IV reactors can be implemented  .
In terms of the research needed , the SCWR has the least amount of research needed .
The only areas that require more research are mainly security and safety  , which mainly require new materials that can withstand high temperature and also radiation at the same time .
Materials that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures are also required  .
To date , several suitable materials have been identified .
Materials such as ferritic-martensitic steels and lowswelling austenitic steels for parts exposed to high neutron doses , high-strength austenitic steels and nickel-based alloys parts exposed to low neutron doses were some of the materials indentified .
These materials are currently being tested for their suitability  .
As for security , all reactors havemostly madeaddressame problem of preventing terrorist attacks and sabotages .
Therefore , without any other major problems , the SCWR is the more logical choice to place more emphasis on .
The SCWR is clearly the reactor to receive more funding , as it requires the least cost and research to be developed .
In addition , the SCWR is one of the two reactors that does not reprocess plutonium waste  .
This further supports the case of more funding for the SCWR .
In conclusion , the SCWR should receive more funding , as it is the most promising concept out of the six chosen concepts .

wedThe first nuclear reactor e to a crossroad bustion es steam and drives a turbine pletely , thereby shutting down the whole system .
This is evidenced by the test carried out on one of the VHTR prototype , HTR-10 in 2004 .
The helium coolant was cut off from the system and the reactor was able to shut down automatically without leakage of any radioactive particles  .
haveThe second aspect lies in its economics .
Most people are aware that building a nuclear plant is expensive .
According to a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  on cost of nuclear power , the overnight cost  of building a nuclear plant is US$4000 / kwh  .
A coal-fuelled plant of the same scale only cost US$1300/ kwh .
While its initial cost is high , VHTR makes up for its efficiencybeingnresearchedility .
Besides electricity , VHTR also produces heat and hyR ,rogen which can be harnessed for other industrial applications .
For example , heat can be used for petrochemical reprocessing while hydrogen can be used as fuel in fuel cell plant to produce even more electR ,icity .
Hence VHTR is actually more profitable to operate as electricity , heat esnd hydrogen can be obtained altogether .
Besides , the non monetary economics should be considered at the same time .
Traditional coal-fuelled power plants produce 20% of the world's emissions of greenhouse gases  while VHTR does not produce any of such gases .
The environmental damage done , though not measurable in dollars and cents , should also be taken into account as the cost .
In this context , VHTR is much cheaper than coal-fuelled plants .
To conclude , VHTR is not only safe , but it is also more efficient than existing reactors .
With further research , it is possible that the cr'sst of VHTR can be lowered further and will appeal as a better alternative to existing nuclear syR ,tems .
Nuclear energy e a viable energy source in the future .
The safety measures can be improved and the hazardous by-products can be reduced petitiveness .

In addition , although human errors were also accounted for the nuclear explosion , they were nexplosiony unpreventable .
Behind every mistake , there is a psychology leading to the mistake , and there is another psychology which could have been used to correct it .
To sum up , i the design engineering stage , feedback loops would function to minimize have beenman errors in thewithrocess .
Psychology can reduce misunderstanding between designers and processors , helping infoation better channeled and decreasing the probability of misunderstanding problems .

In conclusion , psychology approach could prevent engineering accident , regardless of different possible mistakes which may occur in the process .
The es some controversies that the VHTR requires very complicated technologies and very high cost construction compared to the Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor .
Though many people criticize the VHTR for its great cost and immature technology , the VHTR should be popularized and the essay es out of the reactor , it still causes little effects on the environment .
We control the speed of the atoms to slopany in South Africa even has efficiency of 47% .
The heat efficiency of sodium cooled reactor is only 20% .
For example , one spends 1 billion dollars to build a 200MW VHTR and one builds a 100MW sodium one that costs 0 .5billion dollars .

Just as what I have mentioned above , nuclear reactors have its own advantages on both cost and performance .
Also , what people worry about , like security , is actually not that bad .
Therefore , further research and development funding for nuclear reactors is necessary for our society since it is a good way to solve the energy offering problem .

In contrast , nuclear power can replace trnsditional energy resources very well .
Moreover , it can help to protect environment and is much safer than using traditional energy resources .
Hence , in my opinion , using large amount of nuclear power as an energy resource can bring human benefits .
