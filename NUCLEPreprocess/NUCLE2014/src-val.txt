One point in favour of SCWR is that scientists plan to manufacture it with simple and economical design .
Some people still doubt the safety of SCWR's design; in their opinion , a simple design may lack specifications that cause unexpected accidents .
In fact , on the contrary , the balance of SCWR plant design utilizes a relatively simple direct cycle power conversion system , which also allows for the incorporation of passive safety features .
Moreover , compared to the Light-water reactor (LWRs) , it provides a simplified , reduced volume system with higher thermal efficiency .
SCWR's efficiency is achieved about 45% while this one in advanced LWRs is 33% (Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) , 2007) .
Another advantage of SCWR is very cost-effective because it involves only one cycle .
In addition , because of similarities in primary system design between the SCWR and LWRs , it is expected that some of the current LWRs technology will be applied in this area .
So the overall simple design of the SCWR will also cut down the construction cost .
Finally , while it's true to say that reprocessing nuclear waste is still controversial , the general characteristics of the SCWR make it an attractive candidate for addressing Generation IV safety goals against terrorism .
The attack on September 11 in 2001 has provided a wake-up call for facing the threat of nuclear terrorism .
Freely circulating plutonium in the global market is really a huge threat to countries around the world , especially the US .
According to Li (2008) , the Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator in Cabot House , the United States Congress has decided to use 555 billion USD in formation of an "international fuel nuclear bank" (p . 54) to prepare for the safe reprocessing .
Furthermore , improved technology used in the SCWR "allows plant operators to shut down the reaction completely at the slightest sign of trouble" (pp .
53-54) , said Li .
That means human intervention will be reduced to minimum to prevent potential terrorist attacks on nuclear reactors .
On the other hand , in his research , Butler (2004) also reported that scientists of the SCWR would add more steps to lengthen the stored time of long-lived waste , especially plutonium , the "key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons" (p . 240) .
Taking everything into account , because of its achievement in research in advanced materials , effective design and security , the SCWR should be so highly appreciated to pursue the GEN-IV goals that it can be continuously developed and funded .
Jacopo (2002) argues that electricity generated by SCWR may cost 2 .9 cents per Kilowatt hour , much lower than the recent electricity rate .
So if successfully improved and deployed , the SCWR reactor would effectively generate low-cost electricity .

Our natural resources are rapidly consumed to supply energy for the society .
This exploitation of natural resources will result in a shortage of energy in the next few decades .
Therefore , the search for a quick and powerful new source of energy is urgent and vital .
One of the most promising technologies available today is nuclear energy .
Although the construction of new nuclear power plants is strictly restricted , a new concept for the next generation of nuclear power plants have been announced .
This concept , known as Very-High-Temperature-Reactor (VHTR) , is capable of improving our energy supply , clearing all doubts about the efficiency and safety of nuclear power .

Firstly , although the efficiency of nuclear power has been proven by older models , the new VHTR promises an even more effective production .
Despite critics about its safety , over the past decades , while still undergoing many restrictions , a small number of nuclear plants alone located in North America and Europe provide 15% of global total power .
Some countries such as France rely solely on nuclear power for 80% of its nation's energy supply (Gerstner , 2009) .
This shows how powerful nuclear energy was in the past .
Today , with the upcoming VHTR technology , the amount of electricity produced will be increased by 50% (Butler , 2004) .
With the prediction about the US's shortage of fuel by 2025 and VHTR expected delivery by 2020 (Butler , 2004) , if this new generation of reactors receive enough funding , it would be available at the right time to ease the lack-of-fuel crisis .
The second advantage of VHTR is that it does not only produce electricity but at the same time create hydrogen fuel as well (Butler , 2004) .
The concept of hydrogen fuel is not new and its efficiency is of course nothing to be doubted .
Being the lightest element of all , Hydrogen is capable of producing the highest ratio of energy-to-mass ratio (Schlapbach , 2009) .
The public may argue that the conversion from petroleum- fuelled to hydrogen-fuelled would be very complicated and costly .
However , the investment in hydrogen fuel will bring us more pros than cons .
The design for hydrogen vehicles is not similar to that of petroleum vehicles .
Car runs on hydrogen does not need heavy materials and much space for its fuel tank .
Therefore , it would be much more lightweight than a petroleum car .
This allows a higher safety level for drivers and lower production cost (Schlapbach , 2009) .
Although the mass conversion to full hydrogen- fuelled vehicles might be costly , it will bring more advantages as a long- term strategy .
Finally , other than nuclear , there is still one source of energy that is believed to bring us an abundant amount of energy , solar power .
Evironmentalists argue that solar power is not just unlimited but also safer .
However , our solar power technology is not that advanced yet .
No one can understand the current situation of global power supply better than oil- supplying countries themselves , and these global oil providers are hurried towards an IAEA's admission for producing nuclear energy in the Gulf (Brumfiel , 2008) .
These oil-rich nations include Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates (UAE) , and Bahrain .
With the pessimistic view about the current global oil supply , these countries hope to quadruple their energy supply using nuclear plants .
Moreover , they are willing to pay up to $7 billion for each plant .
We can see how urgent these equatorial nations need nuclear power and not solar energy .
A vast area of solar panel can only provide energy for 6000 houses (Shukman , 2007) .
With a VHTR constructed on the same amount of area , the UAE can expect an amount of energy far outweighs that created by solar energy .
On the whole , the concept of VHTR can clearly benefit the society much more than any other sources of power .
The development of VHTR ensures us a safe and abundant source of energy for the next centuries , before solar power technology is that advanced to meet our energy demand .

Generation IV (Gen IV) reactor are theoretical nuclear reactors designs that are undergoing researching and is to be completed in 2030 .
They are projects initiated by Generation IV International Forum (GIF) which aims to come up with nuclear reactors that is more desirable for human use .
However , government's policies to promote nuclear energy are still met with resistance from the public .
This can be attributed to the fact that the public are not well informed about nuclear energy .
Many of them still see nuclear energy as it was decades ago , when it was expensive , low performing and might lead to nuclear arms proliferation .
As such , we must find a reactor design that eliminates all these concerns of the public .
Out of all gen IV reactors , only the supercritical water cooled reactor (SWCR) can fulfill these requirements , thus it should receive funding for research .
One of public's concerns is the proliferation of nuclear arms .
A nuclear powered nation can also be a nuclear armed nation .
If nuclear arms fall into the hands of rouge states , regional security will be jeopardised .
An example will be North Korea , which threatens East Asia's stability .
Thus opponents argue that we should stop investing in nuclear energy for security issue .
However , they fail to realise that nuclear arms can be produced only with recycled nuclear waste .
If the nuclear reactor runs on opened loop fuel system , nuclear waste will not be recycled .
The SWCR is able to operate on open looped fuel system which does not recycle nuclear waste (Butler , 2004) .
If nuclear waste is managed well , nuclear waste from SWCR cannot be use for nuclear arms .
Thus , funding for SWCR should be increase .
Another drawback of nuclear energy is the cost factor .
Public perceive that nuclear energy is more expensive than conventional energy sources (Hughes , 1999) and thus opposed the use of nuclear power .
However , they did not consider the fact that fossil fuel is depleting quickly (How much Fossil fuel are left ?
When will fossil fuels run out ?
n .d ) .
Moreover , the cost of nuclear energy can be lower by research and adopting nuclear energy in a large scale .
Although nuclear energy is expensive now , we should be far-sighted and considered the potential of nuclear energy becoming an affordable energy source in the future .
With high thermal efficiency , SWCR is able to produce electricity at a price comparable to fossil fuel reactor (Butler , 2004) .
Thus , by investing in SWCR , we are paying to secure an affordable energy source in the future .
For the sustainability of our modern lifestyle , funding for researching SWCR should increase .
Many people opposed developing nuclear energy because of the large amount of money required for its infrastructure (Wald , 2008) .
They argue that by allocating majority of available fund for nuclear power's development , funding for other potential energy sources like solar power is reduced .
Opponents of nuclear energy propose that we should look at energy sources that are cheap to start up instead of expending our available fund for nuclear energy .
Although their concerns about the diversion of funding are valid , they fail to realise that nuclear power has the greatest potential to meet our demands .
Unlike the green energy , which is unstable and cannot be produced on demands (Wald , 2008); nuclear power is dependable at all time .
In addition , nuclear power is cheaper than alternative energy (Wald , 2008) .
Thus , it is logical that nuclear power receives the lion's share of funding as it is our best option .
An example will be SWCR that is efficient and cheap to run (Butler , 2004) , making it worthwhile to fund its research .
In conclusion , funding for SWCR's research should be increase as it is the best investment for energy .
In conclusion , public reject nuclear energy for fear of nuclear arms proliferation , the perception that nuclear energy is expensive and the thinking that nuclear reactor is costly to build .
However , the use of opened loop fuel system in SWCR can prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms .
With technological advancement , SWCR can reduce the cost of nuclear energy .
Moreover , nuclear energy has the greatest potential of fulfilling our demands .
As such , it is logical that we support the research of SWCR .

In 1986 , the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine exploded , resulting in a massive power excursion and many deaths caused by radiation poisoning .
It is considered the most damaging nuclear accident in human history .
By later research , the accident was caused by multiple reasons .
Among all the reasons of the explosion , there were three main causes , which led to the function failure of the nuclear power plant .
These mistakes were either due to machine design flaws or humans' instantaneous errors , and all of them could have been prevented by application of psychology .
Some people may not agree , because they believe that some design problems of the nuclear plant system could not be properly solved at the condition of technology at that time .
Besides , no matter how advanced and well-designed of the control system was , the machine was processed by man and it could never predict the human errors , which occurred by chance and were dependent on people's emotions at particular time .
Secondly , the control rods of the reaction section were not properly built .
Only the tips of the rods were covered with the regulated material .
On the contrast of slowing down the rate of the reaction , it sped up the separation of atoms , which caused such a serious explosion .
The psychology behind this is that the workers who built the rods had no idea of consequences of the grossly built rods .
However , if psychology was applied , there would have been better understanding between workers and the design engineers .
The workers , who were in charge of the building of engineering segments , would be aware of the uses of their product and more careful when making important parts of machines .
Then , the accident could have been avoided .
The information of designing and processing would be better channeled and translated to all the people related , if they input psychology into the process engineering stage .
In addition , although human errors were also accounted for the nuclear explosion , they were not totally unpreventable .
Behind every mistake , there is a psychology leading to the mistake , and there is another psychology which could have been used to correct it .
To sum up , if psychology was applied in the design engineering stage , feedback loops would function to minimize human errors in the process .
Psychology can reduce misunderstanding between designers and processors , helping information better channeled and decreasing the probability of misunderstanding problems .
Psychologists can see through the problems in a different aspect and contribute to the solution by an integrated approach (Wilpert , 2007 , P300) .
In conclusion , psychology approach could prevent engineering accident , regardless of different possible mistakes which may occur in the process .
The world cannot forget what happened in the Three Mile Island in 1979 .
A cooling malfunction of the nuclear power plant in USA caused part of the core to melt in the second reactor .
Some radioactive gas was released a couple of days after the accident .
(World Nuclear Association ,2001) The incident raised the fears of the public over the nuclear power .
Therefore , the engineers design Very High Temperature Reactor to make it safer .
However , there comes some controversies that the VHTR requires very complicated technologies and very high cost construction compared to the Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor .
Though many people criticize the VHTR for its great cost and immature technology , the VHTR should be popularized and the essay will discuss about it on three aspects: security , performance and cost .
To sum up , comparing the Very High Temperature Reactor with the Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor , the VHTR really does better in security and long-term performance .
Some technology problems proposed by the opposing views can be soon solved as the science develops very fast .
The Very High Temperature Reactor will definitely have a bright future and everyone can benefit from it .
The ability to experience something that we cannot naturally experience is indeed a blessed feeling .
With the advancements in technology humans can now have the joy of swimming long hours inside deep waters or even step on the far away moon .
Well to have the opportunity for those is great; but unlike many of us with flawless senses , for those with impairments in senses , a blessed feeling would be to see a flower , smell its fragrance , hear a bird or sing along to a song .
Fortunately those with the talent and education required to invent such things are using existing technologies and extending them to suit human purposes .
One such innovation is the Haptic chair .
The chair is named using the word "Haptic" which is a derivative of a Greek word to mean "touch" .
The haptic chair depends on tactile senses to deliver the musical experience to the receiver .
The basic idea is to allow the receiver to feel the musical beat , tone and volume as vibrations of different strengths and frequencies .
For the complete understanding of the invention , it is important we learn the exact built of it .
The haptic chair is a cushioned wooden chair with five contact speakers attached at the back of the chair .
The speakers are connected to a single music source which carries the music from the source to the receiver .
To make the experience livelier , the chair is accessorised with a screen which displays visuals that correspond to the music depending on the characteristics of the music .
The screen displays are of two types: one with visual of an individual enjoying the music corresponding to the beat or a mosaic of lines and circles triggered by the music .
With the promising results the studies have shown , it is safe to deduce that in the future we shall see a row of haptic chairs for the hearing impaired in concert halls .
This will provide them the opportunity to live a more normal life and enjoy the joys of life as any other citizen .
Still there are stepbacks in the technology .
Speaking in plain terms would be to admit that their music experience is not fully compatible with that of one with normal hearing where they hear the lyrics etc .
The musical understanding would be limited to beat , tone and volume alone .
Since it is a new technology , there are still many refinements that could be made .
The chair could be upgraded from time to time , involving technicians from other disciplines and not just engineers .
Currently the chair is not in mass production .
This means the chair would come with a heavy price tag .
Given that it is also equipped with many speakers , heavily cushioned chair , and accessories , the chair uses much space and has quite limited mobility .
This makes the usage very inconvenient and could discourage the use .
This indirectly could lead to the suspension of the development and upgrading of the technology which finally could terminate its usage .
Since there are foundations for the benefit of the hearing impaired , one step that could be taken is to unite these institutes with the developers of this technology to make ensure the research continues .
This innovation is for the better living of the hearing impaired and with the help of those currently involved; the developers could create an advanced version in the near future .
Innovations are for the betterment of the living conditions of humans , comfort and convenience in their life .
This technology can be extended to animals such as dolphins which are facing threats of extinction .
Nowadays , our society has to face a very serious problem which has actually existed for a long time .
That is the energy problem .
In fact , although the problem came into being long time ago , we start to pay enough attention to it just in recent days .
We all know that the world's energy reserves are limited , especially the fossil fuels widely used all the time .
It is said that by the end of this century the fossil fuels , which consist of gas , coal and oil , will be used up .
In other words , we do not have any fossil fuels to use in nearly ninety years' time from now on .
This leads to quite a tough situation where we have to find some other ways which are even more efficient to provide energy for the whole society .
Due to some kinds of research , people pointed out that maybe nuclear power is a good solution .
Thus nuclear reactors started being built in some countries .
However , these days fewer and fewer nuclear reactors are planned to be built for the reason of public opposition .
People are firstly concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
They think it is very possible to have some accidents in the nuclear plants .
Even a quite small mistake may lead to a great disaster to the people around .
For example , one of the reactors in Chemobyl plant , Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , once exploded .
What was worse , further explosions and the resulting fire sent a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere and cover an extensive geographical area which in fact became a nightmare for the local people .
This of course makes people scared .
However , the truth is that in more than 12700 cumulative reactor-years of commercial operation in 32 countries , there are only two major accidents happened including the one we have mentioned above .
There is actually no need to be that worried .
To achieve nuclear safety furthermore , we also need to develop high-quality design& construction and invent equipment to prevent operational disturbances developing into problems .
Redundant and diverse systems are also needed to detect problems , control damage to the fuel and prevent significant radioactive releases .
Provisions are needed to confine the effects of severe fuel damage to the plant itself .
When it comes to the cost , many people may think building the nuclear reactors is quite an expensive process .
However , the conclusion is exactly reversed .
Nuclear power is quite an economical choice for countries with limited natural resources .
For example , nearly 80 percent of the energy used in France is generated from nuclear plants .
Although the building cost may be high , the whole cost also includes waste disposal cost and decommissioning cost .
While in fact , a successfully operated nuclear plant is much more environmentally friendly than coal or gas power stations , which means a relatively lower waste disposal cost .
Just as what I have mentioned above , nuclear reactors have its own advantages on both cost and performance .
Also , what people worry about , like security , is actually not that bad .
Therefore , further research and development funding for nuclear reactors is necessary for our society since it is a good way to solve the energy offering problem .
As the world's energy demand is on the rise , the world has to look into alternatives to solve this issue .
At the same time , the alternatives have to be cleaner so that current global warming situation will not be aggravated (Butler , 2004) .
They also have to be cheap and safe , which is beneficial for the users (Buongiorno , 2002) .
To address this situation , a variety of Generation IV nuclear reactors is developed .
One of the nuclear reactors , the Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor (SCWR) has been proven to be one of the excellent methods to generate cheap and safe power for consumption .
Although there are criticism cited about its flaws , it is still a reactor which is worth to be developed (Idaho National Library , 2009) .
Danielyan , D . (2003) .
Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor System-as one of the most promising type of Generation IV Nuclear Reactor Systems Retrieved from http://www .tkk .fi/Units/AES/courses/crspages/Tfy- 56 .181_03/Danielyan .pdf
Idaho National Library (2009) .
Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor Nuclear Energy .
The Energy of Innovation Retrieved from http://inlportal .inl .gov
Secondly , the SCWR systems are able output great performance with its unique characteristics .
It is able to produce high thermal efficiency of about 45% versus about 33% efficiency for current LWRs , which evaluates to greater energy output (Danielyan , 2003) .
This is due to its ability of operating at higher pressure and temperature (at 550 degree Celsius) with a single phase operation , unlike the current LWRs that need recirculation of heat and components like jet pumps and steam generators .
Critics of SCWR think otherwise .
Other Generation IV reactor , such as Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , is also to output high thermal efficiency at about 50% and at a high temperature of 1000 degree Celsius (Butler , 2009) .
With such performance , the VHTR can also have high energy output when compared with SCWR .
However , the high temperature produced may cause a reactor meltdown (Butler , 2004) .
Hence , this shall attribute to a good reason why SCWR should be used instead of other Generation IV reactors .
Lastly , research and development (R&D) is crucially needed as this is the most important aspect needed as part of the implementation of any Generation IV reactors (Butler 2004) .
For example , VHTR requires research to be done on the reactors (specifically pebble bed type core and prismatic block core) , power conversion unit , and its production on hydrogen (supply for future energy source) .
These are very complex researches that could take a long period of time and requires collaboration with partners across the world (Carre , 2006) .
In contrast , the SCWRs require the least amount of R&D for its implementation .
The area of research is on the materials that could withstand high temperature , stress corrosion cracking , radiation and creep resistance .
Although Dr Buongiorno highlighted that this "was not easy" to be done , he and his research team collaborated with researchers from University of Michigan , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Westinghouse to do a research by testing new materials under the supercritical condition (Buongiorno , 2003) .
In conclusion , there should be funding allocated for the Research and Development of SCWR .
This is a much promising system to be invested for its benefits in terms of low development cost , better performance and least research and development processes .
Although there are odds in proving the system's efficiency , it is said to be a great investment for a better future (Idaho National Library , 2009) .

Assessing Gas-cooled Fast Reactors for Generation IV Services To meet the energy demand in the 21st century , a new generation of nuclear reactors termed as Generation IV , are being developed .
One of the most popular concepts of the Generation IV is gas-cooled fast reactors (GFR) , which uses a direct-cycle helium turbine for electricity generation or hydrogen production with a high efficiency CITATION Hej05 \l 1033 (Hejzar , Pope , Williams , & Driscoll , 2005) .
However , there are concerns about its impact of its radioactive waste on environment and its safety in operation CITATION But04 \l 1033 (Butler , 2004) .
Although GFR has certain deficiencies at this stage; further R&D funding should be supported because it has three main advantages in terms of sustainability , safety and industrial applications .
Opponents of GFR point out that it is inevitable for nuclear reactors to produce radioactive waste which has destructive effects and due to the high cost of pollutant management , it seems impossible to install nuclear reactors without any radioactive emissions .
However , a research conducted by the MIT GFR development team CITATION Hej05 \l 1033 (Hejzar , Pope , Williams , & Driscoll , 2005)shows that it is possible to develop a closed fuel cycle with full transuranics(TRU) recycling so that all TRU will be recycled with losses of 0 .1% or less .
The long-term waste will be substantially reduced with a core with a conversion ratio to be close to 1 .0 CITATION Gir08 \l 1033 (Girardin , et al . , 2008) .
Consequently , GFR has a significant improvement on radioactive waste minimization over the previous generations .
Hence the GFR system is highly-ranked in sustainability among all the nuclear reactors and this makes it a favorable energy supply in the future .
There are also worries about the accidents caused during processes of coolant depressurization and decay heat removal because GFR has to be operated in an environment of both high pressure and temperature .
Fortunately , under Generation IV International Forum , a number of researches are dealing with this safety problem using "passive decay heat removal options" CITATION Gir08 \l 1033 (Girardin , et al . , 2008) .
In the design of GFR system , combined systems of both active cooling and passive cooling is applied: active systems are used to remove the decays of heat at high power level then passive systems will take over after 24 hours when decay heat is reduced to 0 .5% .The active part defends the system at the first place and the passive part only dues with the pressure achieved after depressurization .
In this way , less human labor is involved into the operation of GFR and thus accident risk in minimized .
Some also claim that GFR can hardly change the energy supply scenario in the globe because the nuclear energy today is mainly utilized to generate electricity , which only accounts for 16% of the total energy consumption CITATION Her09 \l 1033 (Herranz , Linares , & Moratilla , 2009) .
However , except for electricity generation , the future GFR is predicted to achieve an excellent thermal performance based on a direct Brayton cycle configurations .
Herranz , Linares , & Moratilla (2009) predicts that GFR can use a few hunderds MWs to produce heat at a very high temperature .This will satisfy most heat applications of industrial processes .
Besides , some scientists suggest that the thermal efficiency of GFR can probably be increased from the present level 30% to higher than 50% with no additional economic penalty CITATION Her09 \l 1033 (Herranz , Linares , & Moratilla , 2009) .
Hence , this will reinforce the competitiveness of GFR in the energy market of most industries .
To summarize , GRF can be a favorable energy supply because it can achieve wider range of industry application with minimized radioactive waste .
Moreover , it better ensures the safety during operation so that accident risk is lowered .
Hence , to make such energy supply possible in the future , the development of GFR system should be funded .
Nuclear power is widely used around the world today .
There are more than 400 nuclear power plants operating in 30 countries , which supply almost 17 percent of the world's electricity .
Scientists debate whether using large amount of nuclear power as an energy resource might bring human benefits .
Although some scientists argue nuclear power has negative effects in environment , it is unsafe or security , there are some evidences which show nuclear power yields great benefits such as protecting environment , safer than using traditional power .
In addition , the appearance of nuclear weapon cannot be avoided when nuclear power was developed .
Opponents of using nuclear power claim that it has negative impact on the environment because of some accidents which had happened before .
However , it is inconclusive .
Despite the fact that the nuclear power plants accidents real pose environmental contamination , it is still relatively not so bad by contrasting with the pollution which is produced by traditional power generation .
Nuclear power plants produce electricity by using Uranium , but not burning of fuels .
As a result , no air pollutants are released such as nitrogen oxides , sulfur oxides , dust or greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide .
A research report from University of Michigan (Ilan Lipper&Jon Stone , 2009) shows that USA's nuclear power plants reduce electric generating emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percents , or 128 trillion tons per year .
Without nuclear power plants , electric generating emissions of NOX would be 2 million tons per year higher and sulfur dioxide would be 5 million tons per year higher .
Also in France , SO2 and NOX emissions produced in the electric generating were reduced by 71% and 60% respectively .
In addition , nuclear power alleviates the global carbon dioxide producing which is one of the major contributors to the global warming .
If 16 percents of the world's electricity generated by nuclear power plants are replaced by generating using coal , 1 ,600 million tons of CO2 will annually produced .
Using nuclear power to generate electricity really helps to protect environment .
Opponents also maintain that nuclear power is not safe .
They say that the accidents caused by nuclear power plants caused huge harm to human .
However , such an argument completely ignores the fact that only two accidents happened in the half century of the nuclear age and only a small number of people died due to the accidents .
At Three Mile Island (World Nuclear Association , 2009) , no people died and no one injured .
At Chernobyl (World Nuclear Association , 2009) , about 50 people died , and 1 ,500 people got disease from the radioactive emission .
However , the disease can be treated successfully and less than ten people died .
Comparing with people died in coal mining disaster , this number is very small .
According to the State Work Safe Supervision Administration (2009) , 4 ,749 Chinese coal miners were killed in 2006 .
The total number of people died during the coal mining accidents is obviously far more than this number .
The final argument advanced by opponents of using nuclear power is that nuclear power can be used to create mass destruction nuclear weapon .
However , it is true that whenever a new technology is developed , it is always used for war .
For example , powder was created in the 9th century .
At the beginning , it was only applied in acrobatics and later it was used as the energy source for shooting weapons .
In addition , in the project Apollo 13 , a huge number of new technologies was developed and applied to the spacecraft .
Later Americans used those new technologies to create new powerful missiles .
Hence , the appearance of nuclear weapons cannot be avoided when nuclear power was developed .
In conclusion , it should be evident that the arguments against using nuclear power are not valid .
In contrast , nuclear power can replace traditional energy resources very well .
Moreover , it can help to protect environment and is much safer than using traditional energy resources .
Hence , in my opinion , using large amount of nuclear power as an energy resource can bring human benefits .
Global warming and increasing energy demands revive the nuclear energy .
Aiming at providing "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resisitant" , generation IV nuclear reactors(six concepts) would operate at high temperatures that enhance productivity and efficiency .
Despite the huge economic and social benefits , the technical hurdles involved in building the reactors are difficult to overcome .
Furthermore , recycling nuclear waste and producing hydrogen power are under dispute .
In spite of the controversies , the "very-high-temperature reactors " which is independent of reprocessing nuclear waste and generates hydrogen as by-product , is the most feasible one among the six .
"With no effective method of disposal , radioactive nuclear waste , such as Caesium giving off Cherenkov radiation , has to be stored on site ."
says Ed Gersterner , a senior editor of nature Physics .
In recent years , reprocessing nuclear waste has become an alternative .Reprocessing nuclear waste could cut the final amount of waste produced; meanwhile all the uranium and plutonium could be recovered and reused .
Hence , the supporters believe that the new generation of nuclear reactor should make use of this technology .
However , the opponents suggest that recycling nuclear waste is not an effective method .
"Fuel recycling may look exciting on paper; in practice , it is part of the problem , not the solution ."
they argues .
Reprocessing the nuclear waste endures great economic and political cost .
First of all , the recovered plutonium and uranium are too active and unstable to be stored safely , and this storage costs a lot .
The Energy Department of US recently released an industry estimate that a reprocessing plant with an annual capacity of 2 ,000 metric tons of spent fuel would cost up to $20 billion to build while the cost premium for reprocessing spent an extra $3 to $4 .5 billion per year .
Secondly , the action endangers global security , which includes deterring terrorism and nuclear weapon proliferation .
"International research effort in advanced reprocessing would itself spread expertise in the chemistry and metallurgy of radioactive elements; moreover , the recycle would separates out plutonium , a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons .
"says Declan Bulter(WA2R) .

The main difference between VHTR and SCWR is that the former generates hydrogen as a by-product .
Hydrogen is a carbon-free and non-toxic fuel that could probably replace oil , especially for transport applications .
However , the advanced generation and application of hygrogen have not yet been fully developed .
Due to current technology , hydrogen produced by nuclear reactors is not enough to completely replace gasoline for transport demands , the opponents argues .
They also raise concerns about the corresponding infrastructure such as "hydrogen-fuelled cars" and "hydrogen-stations" which have not yet been widely implemented .
"To complete a worldwide , fundamental energy overhaul , we need to exploit the vast , unfulfilled opportunities for fuel efficiency in electric motors , light bulbs , appliances and home heating and cooling .
"words from Jeffery .D .Sachs , director of the Earh Institute at Columbia Universtiy , implies that gasoline is replaced not only by hydrogen , but also electricity , biofuels , solar energy .
The more hydrogen put into use , the better the situation could be .
Besides , the hydrogen technology is developing rapidly .
"Hydrogen-powered buses in Germany and Japan have already been successful , and about 50 prototype cars both thermal-combustion and fuel-cell types have so far been tested , with good results .
"says Louis Schlapbach , a scientist from the National Institute for Materials Science of Japan .
Hence , the generation of hydrogen is an advantage of VHTR .

Nowadays , as industry develops much faster , more energy is needed .
However , because of more used resources for producing energy , the environmental issues are more serious , for example , the global warming and water pollution .
Furthermore , resources which are used to produce energy are usually not renewable .
We may have nothing to provide energy in the future .
For solving these two serious issues , nuclear energy has been proposed as the solution for many years .
Many countries have built up nuclear plants which have developed to generation IV .
VHTR is one of plants of Generation IV .
I think it is necessary and feasible to build VHTR to solve energy issues , although some people hold opposite ideas .
Dealing with the current increasing demand for energy and the threat of global warming by worldwide nation , the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) came up with six generation IV nuclear reactors which were believed to be able to deal with the problems by 2025 (Butler , 2004) .
Based on studies (Elder & Allen , 2009) , these nuclear reactors were capable of replacing gasoline with hydrogen in the long run with its enhanced efficiencies .
However , the public possessed strong opposition against the building of nuclear reactors .
Despite the concern by the public over the safe operation of the nuclear reactors being built , there is strong evidence that very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , one of the six generations IV nuclear reactors , could bring positive results for further research and development funding .
According to Butler (2004) , further research and development funding for the VHTR would mean there will be increasing demand to build a lot more nuclear power plants in hope to replace the gasoline with hydrogen .
This would results in an especially high cost for the government to bear .
Yet , the opposing argument ignores the fact that building more nuclear power plants will need time and good management to achieve full results in a long run (Greenwald , 1991) .
Supporters argue that with the nuclear power plants being built , it will contribute to the nation by the use of hydrogen being produced for other important usages such as a direct fuel or as feedstock (Farbman & Brecher , 1975) .
In addition , the nuclear power plants offer life-cycle cost advantage over other energy resources (Perera , 2004) .
It was believed that the nation will profit with the effort and large investments being made to build the nuclear power plants .
Then , another opposed argument being raised states that building of nuclear power plants will make the country more vulnerable to terrorist attack as plutonium is a key ingredient to nuclear weapon (Butler , 2004) .
Also , destruction of nuclear plant will emit radioactive substances which will be detrimental the public of the country and its neighbouring countries (Elder & Allen , 2009) .
However , research studies (Butler , 2004) shows that VHTR do not undergo waste recycling for which the waste being produced will go directly to repository and this lead to the possibility of obtaining of plutonium ingredients to make nuclear weapons to be low and in turn , increased the security of the nation .
In the point of view between opposition and the experts and supporters , the new generation nuclear reactors proved to be more effective in terms of cost , performance and its security .
With the doubts being raised by public opposition , supporters and experts believed that the nuclear hydrogen production by VHTR has the potential to meet the future's needs with the nuclear energy .
Hence , it was reiterated that VHTR , one of the generation IV reactor concepts could be supported for further research and development funding .
According to a report "World population may reach 9 .2 billion by 2050" from the Associated Press , the world's population is expected to expand from 6 .2 billion to 9 .2 million people by the end 2050 which will lead to an increase in the demand for energy .
But the current nuclear industry can only maintain its current position of generating 17% of the world's electricity .
Therefore groups of international experts were organized to take up research job to develop a new concept on nuclear reactors .
Thus by comparing the Generation IV reactor concept with the previous generations , we can discover significant advantages .
They are manageable nuclear waste , recognized safety performance and secure nuclear energy .
Within the concept , the most beneficial reactor will be the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) compared to the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and other 4 .
Generally , modern small reactors for power generation are expected to have greater simplicity of design , economy of mass production , and reduced sitting costs .
These requirements greatly fit the bill for the MSR .
Therefore I conclude that MSR has a better stand over the other reactors .

The consumption of electricity in the world is increasing continually .
In the long run , there will be a shortage of non-renewable sources of energy that we are using .
This raises a need to apply new technology to create power , and building new nuclear reactors such as the very-high- temperature reactors would be a choice to consider .
However , the safety and the efficiency of the new generation power plants raise many opposing public concerns .
Should countries , especially developing ones , sacrifice the funding that would possibly solve poverty and unemployment in order to build new nuclear reactors ?
The answer , to me , is no .
Supporters of the new nuclear power plants claim that building new plants will provide unemployed people with job opportunities , both in the construction phase and operation phase .
According to DePillis (2009) , constructing a power plant would require 2 ,000 people while operating it would involve approximately 500 technicians , reactor operators , engineers , security guards , and administrators .
However , building new power plants only provides workers with temporary works .
Moreover , the new generation reactors oblige skilled engineers to operate .
For instance , the unemployment rate of China in 2009 is 4% , which is equal to more than 52 million people (Central Intelligence Agency , 2009) .
Substantiably , new power plants cannot thoroughly solve unemployment .
If the governments spend the funds on building nuclear power reactors , which , according to The U .S . Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy (2009) , is approximately US$70 .0 million in Fiscal Year 2009 , to do research on agriculture or some other necessary matters , they could help decreasing famine and poverty and providing works for millions of people .
Another claim of the supporters is that the new generation would reduce the green house effect , which is worsened by the smoke of the traditional coal-fired power plants .
Although it is substantiable that smoke released from burning coal is the largest contributor to the human- made increase of CO2 in the air , there are still several unpolluted and renewable replacement such as solar , wind , and tidal energy .
They are free and environmental-friendly sources of energy that we can apply in the future .
In addition , new nuclear power plants still threaten possible leakage of hazardous waste , which could result in a catastrophic accident whose effect could last for decades .
One typical example is the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine in 1986 , resulted from a flawed reactor design .
Within 4 months , 28 people died from radiation or thermal burns; another 19 have subsequently died , and there have been around 9 deaths from thyroid cancer apparently due to the accident .
As of 2004 , a total of 56 fatalities have been recorded (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
In a journal in 2004 , Butler showed that the radioactive waste of the very-high-temperature reactors is not recycled; instead , it goes directly to the repository .
This raises such awareness that the waste may be leaked either inadvertently or purposefully , any of which would cause another disastrous catastrophe .
Nuclear energy is a promising source of energy that can replace the traditional power that we are using nowadays .
However , it is still in researching process , which means that many other problems comprising of health matters and the efficiency of the concept could arise before it can reach the final stage .
Hence , developing countries should first focus on dealing with poverty and unemployment before they can shift the funds on building new nuclear reactors .
Only when the issue is solved and the process of researching the generation IV reactors reaches a stable state should those countries channel the funding into developing the generation IV reactors .

Engineering psychology is defined as the analysis of how man behaves in the designing or constructing of equipment or man-made environments for better usage to meet the demands of its users .
On March 27 1977 at Los Rodeos airport , a massive shockwave shook the control towers as the airport witnessed the collision of 2 Boeing 747s , PA1736 and KLM4805 , taking the lives of 522 people .
Some argue that the cause of this accident was mainly the result of human errors , thus it would be inevitable even with the best procedures and equipment in place .
However , in my opinion , the implementation of psychology can help to anticipate some events that led to the accident; therefore allowing designers to prepare for such emergencies .
This might have changed the course of action of the pilots and thereby preventing the accident .
Two major areas that psychology could have helped include the design of the airport and the communication equipment and procedures .
Skeptics claim that the region usually sees few people and thus there is no need for a larger airport that can accommodate larger planes to be built .
On the contrary , the construction of the Tenerife south airport in 1978 suggests that more people , rather than less , were visiting the region .
Still , designers failed to improve the airport to accommodate larger planes such as the Boeing 747 , even when was widely used at that point in time .
The use of psychology in this case can help designers to anticipate that the airport would eventually see a Boeing 747 and thus make the necessary preparations .
One step that can be taken would be to remove sharp 148- degree turns that the PA1736 , a 747 , would not be able to take .
This might have allowed the PA1736 to make an earlier exit rather than stay on the runway and hence prevent the accident from ever occurring .
Skeptics also suggest that one main cause of the accident was the Air Traffic Controller's (ATC) choice to use non-standard words in communicating with the pilots despite the fact that radio conventions were already in place at that time .
It is undeniably true that although psychology can help to produce the best procedures , the accident would have still happened if the ATC chose not to abide by it .
However , the convention that was used at that time could have been improved to avoid confusion amongst the pilots .
One way to do so is by the implementation of psychology in the compilation of the radio convention .
During the accident , the words 'take off' resulted in a serious misunderstanding between the pilot and the co-pilot of the KLM4805 .
The pilot mistook the phrase 'take off' as a clearance rather than a request between the co-pilot and the ATC .
Moreover , aviation governing bodies such as the International Civil Aviations Organization [ICAO] were quick to revise their phrasing convention , replacing all traces of 'take off' before the actual take off itself to 'departure' .
Should proper psychology be used in the development of the phrasing convention initially , the pilot would not have executed take off before the clearance was given and hence preventing the accident .
The failure of the respective designers to consider several crucial factors in the airport design and communication phraseology indirectly caused the accident to happen .
The use of psychology in the design process could have helped the designer to consider these issues more thoroughly and perhaps influencing his decision .
The result of any of these minor changes could perhaps have prevented the accident from ever occurring .
Nuclear energy is known as atomic energy .
It is the energy produced by fusion of atoms in the nucleus .
Since long ago , scientists and engineers have made use of nuclear energy in the production of electricity and explosive weapons .
Infinite nuclear power is combining in the nucleus due to extremely strong force inside every atom in it .
From that atomic bomb was developed in the Alamogordo close to the desert on July 16 , 1945 .The energy produced by nuclei explosion will cause a lot of heat .
It can be transformed into water vapor and the water vapor can be used to create electricity .
Nuclear reactors are being built by the engineers who make and distribute out the nuclear energy .
That has to be relatively cheap , safe and that produces greater output efficiency .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) has been research in the six different types of nuclear reactor methods which they think that it will be the prospect way of producing nuclear energy .
Among this six reactor technologies , I am going to argue why people should make further research and development on one of the reactors called Supercritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) .
After the Three Mile Island Explosion people had a bad impact in production of nuclear energy since they have been suffered from the accident .
However in recent century according to the survey done by Nuclear Energy Institute on September 29 , 2008 it shows that 74 percent of American is supported for nuclear energy while 24 percent opposed .
Moreover , nuclear energy has been the second largest source of electricity in America's after coal .
In addition it did not produce carbon dioxide which can lead to global warming .
Then there are still technical problem in inventing the next generation of reactor .
That is why if researcher can overwhelm that problem , then new generation will have energy which is "clean , secure , plentiful , dependable , cost-effective , secure from terrorist attacks and proliferation resistant" .
The main feed-water pumps ceased running , owing to a technical failure , and caused the reactor to heat up and pressurize .
The pilot operated relief valve opened , but contrary to what the operators assumed , it did not close .
Nobody knew that coolant water was leaking out of the reactor , since there was no clear signal indicating the status of the valve .
The subsequent series of action of the operators only made conditions worse , until the hydrogen exploded , consequent of the complete meltdown of the reactor (U .S .NRC , 2009) .
The meltdown at Three Mile Island (TMI) can be considered as the biggest engineering accident in the U .S . nuclear history (U .S .NRC , 2009) .
Technical errors of the system , combined with human errors , led to a series of wrong decisions , confusion , and subsequently aggravations .
In the article "Psychology and the Design Process" , Bernhard asserts that the accident at TMI was caused by the 'little understood interaction of factors' from different system levels; rather than a 'single component failure' or technical error (Bernhard 2007) .
He calls this 'interaction of factors' the consequent of the lack in consideration of psychology during the design process .
In other words , should we have better understood this interaction of factors , and anticipated the possible errors during the design process; we could actually prevent the accident at TMI from happening .
This stand is highly debatable , and we will be basing our debate on 3 out of 5 of Bernhard's major areas of psychological consideration during the design process .
We will see that it was the lack of consideration in terms of preparatory work obtained from commitment , identifying safer options , and monitoring and evaluating implementations (Bernhard , 2007) that caused the accident at TMI .
We assert that if these factors were more holistically considered , then the outcome could have been reversed .
We will also consider various objections to the effectiveness of psychology to prevent the accident , and assert that such objections are falsifiable .
One of the most heated objections is that the cause of error actually lies in the technical malfunctioning of the relief valve , not out of the lack of safety considerations (U .S .NRC) .
The valve was designed to close automatically , but remained open for various reasons which we still do not know .
Proponents of the man-machine view believe that it was ultimately a freak error , and not a psychological error , that resulted in the inability to close the valve and prevent overheating .
However , such claims tend to be speculative and over focused .
Yes , it's true that initially it was due to the malfunction of the instrument , but it had been asserted that even so , the accident could still be prevented at that point in time .
Rather , "It was the subsequent series of baffling and contradictory information that made plant operators shut off the emergence water system that would have cooled the core (Chana Gazit 1999) , turning the problem into a mishap .
The meltdown was not caused by a single event , but rather by a series of wrong decisions and actions .
Should the operators have a better schema on emergency response , or if the information output by the reactor was designed to be more conclusive , then such confusion would not arise , and the meltdown would have been prevented .
Opponents may also maintain that the reason why the use of psychology could not have changed the situation is because of its subjective and inconclusive nature .
They assert that the use of psychology is no more than a whimsical 'what if' speculation after witnessing a real-life situation goes wrong .
Indeed , there is always room for criticism of 'why didn't you think of a better mousetrap' after a particular design failure .
Similarly , we could retrospect the accident at TMI to see that there is always room for improvement , and then conveniently tag one of Bernhard's safety design process to claim that the meltdown could have been prevented with a little extra attention in psychology during the design process .
However , due overwhelming possibilities for error , such introspection for potential sources of error is almost practically impossible during the design process .
This premise leads to their conclusion that nothing could have been done , on the part of psychology , to change the situation should things went wrong .
To this , we must look at the nature of psychology .
Indeed , psychology has its roots from speculations , primarily owing to its roots in the philosophy of mind .
Structuralism , the first movement of psychology , banks its primary research tool on introspection , literally 'looking within' (Kosslyn/ Rosenberg 2006) .
However it has since evolved as an empirical science to include realistic models and hypotheses .
Such models were set to ensure that there is no chance for an accident to occur , and if it did , be quickly resolved before it becomes a catastrophe .
Psychologist James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model was adopted by the US department of defense to conclusively pin-point the four possible stages of error during the designing , planning and execution phases (Department of Defence 2005 , qtd by Illinois 2008) .
Many multinational corporations have also employed psychologists to scientifically monitor the psychological states of their employees .
For a fact that such models were not considered during the design process at TMI , instead shows the lack of preparatory work from commitment (Bernhard 2007) , one of Bernhard's major areas of psychological consideration .
Now , one of the ways the use of psychology could have possibly prevented the accident at TMI would be if it had identified safer options during the design process (Bernhard 2007) .
This included the consistent functional review of instruments and constant search question identifications (Bernhard 2007) .
Indeed , we have to admit that there were existing safety considerations in place , since there were instruments to allow feedback of reactor status to the operators .
But we can claim that such psychological considerations for occupational safety were not holistic enough- since there was evidently nothing to indicate the valve's actual position .
Such a fact can be succinctly summarized as a failure in consideration of identifying safer options during design .
Should greater consideration be place on the designing of the valve to ensure accurate feedback (and potential safety) when the reactor core is not functioning as per normal , it can be argued that the problem would have been identified by then , and a meltdown would not have occurred then .
From the above arguments , we can see that the considerations of psychology are much more than a convenient 'tag-along' during both the design and execution process .
In summary , it was the failure to identify safer options during the design process , to monitor and evaluate these implementations , and the lack of preparatory work from commitment , as seen from the failure to consider safety models , that had brought about the accident at TMI .
Systems are designed by humans , and for humans .
Hence , design considerations have to be constantly tied into the man-machine interface to ensure that both man and machine are at ease during operation and contingent when problems arise .
Such a list is not exhaustive , and much more detailed considerations could be introduced .
But in the meantime , we have definitely proven that the use of psychology is mandatory , and could definitely have prevented the TMI accident , had relevant safety considerations be made during its design process .
Nuclear power plants , which produce minimum global warming emissions when they operate , give a relatively high thermal efficiency .
Therefore , nuclear power is considered as potential energy options to ease the deteriorating energy problem we are facing today .
For example , the United States now acquires roughly 20 percent of its electricity from 104 nuclear plants (Butler , D . 2004) .
However , the further research and development of nuclear power plants could also raise widespread concern for human safety that results from worries about both massive radioactive releases due to power plant meltdown or terrorist attack and the access these nuclear reactors provide to the materials that can be used to make nuclear weapons .
In spite of the growing concern , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor (SCWR) , representing advances in sustainability , economics , safety , reliability and proliferation-resistance (Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) , is the proper concepts for further research and development .
Although this nuclear reactor concept faces issues of high requirement of materials , past record of cost overruns , and nuclear safety threat , it still prevails because of the promising research on needed materials , simplified design , and advanced design features in proliferation and safety .
The most obvious controversy over the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is about the materials .
Opponents claim that the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is supposed to operate at superior thermodynamic condition , which refers to the operating pressure as high as 25MPa and the maximum temperature of more than 500  C . Compared with current Light-Water-cooled Reactors , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor raises the operating temperature in outlet coolant from 300  C to 500  C . Furthermore , the supercritical water environment may also cause some compatibility issues in practice .
The materials used in this reactor must be capable to withstand various supercritical water conditions that range from the low temperature inlet at 280  C to the outlet at above 500  C , and from a compressed liquid to a fluid nearly an order of magnitude less dense than ordinary water as the supercritical water traverses the core from bottom to top .
Besides the wide range , in extreme conditions , the operating temperature can reach 840  C (Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) .
Opponents of the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor claim that the existing materials are not qualified for the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor and the advanced materials under current research are not economic enough .
According to Alain Bugat , who heads France's Atomic Energy Commission , there is a considerable gap in the fundamental research .
"This is a long-term research; if we have a working demo of some of the designs by 2030 we will be doing well ."
said Alain Bugat (Butler , 2004) .
However , the research on advanced materials is promising .
Japan's Atomic Energy Research Institute based in Kashiwa already managed to operate a similar high-temperature engineering test reactor at Oarai .
The reactor is reported to have reached the maximum operating temperature of 950 C for the first time in research (Butler , 2004) .
On the hand , the cost-effectiveness is inconclusive .
Climate 2030: A National Blueprint for a Clean Energy Economy , the recent UCS report has pointed out that nuclear plants are not the most economical approach to realize our ambitious targets for cutting global warming emission through 2030 ("Nuclear Power: a"  , n .d .) .
Nevertheless , it also shows that it remains difficult to predict the cost-effectiveness of using nuclear power as electricity supply to homes and businesses after 2030 when no projections are made on technology advances past that point .
Therefore , we can still expect the cost to fall during further research and development in finding the material qualified for the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor .

Opponents also maintain that building nuclear plants is likely to induce cost overruns .
They say that there are several records of cost overruns of building nuclear plants and the high construction costs have been and will continue to be the "economic Achilles' heel of the nuclear plants" .
For instance , in the article Nuclear Power: a Resurgence We can't Afford (2009) , the scientists from the Union of Concerned Scientists stated that utilities' cost overruns of building nuclear power plants during the 1970s and 1980s averaged more than 200 percent .
In October 2008 , the cost of building one nuclear plant is estimated to be roughly S$ 9 billion .
In 2009 , the cost overruns of Olkiluoto plant in Finland have reportedly topped 50 percent (Kanter 2009) .
However , opponents of the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor have neglected the fact that this new nuclear plant is not completely the same as any nuclear plants that have ever been constructed .
According the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Ten-year Program Plan prepared by the Idaho National Laboratory (2007) , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is designed upon two proven technologies .
One is the Light-Water-cooled Reactors , which are the most widely deployed nuclear reactors generating power in the world; the other is supercritical fossil-fired boilers , many of which are applied in industry throughout the world .
Additionally , since the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor uses supercritical water as coolant , its design features considerable simplification by reducing the containment volume and eliminating the need for recirculation and jet pumps , pressurizer , steam generators , steam separators and dryers (Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) .
In conclusion , because of the above simple design features and proven technology basis , it is possible to run the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor at relatively low cost .
The final argument held by opponents of the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is that the nuclear power plants provide access to materials that can be used to make nuclear weapons and the potential massive radioactive releases are threat to human safety and security .
Despite the public's growing concerns over nuclear safety , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor can clear people's doubt due to its safety features .
According to the roadmap of the Generation IV Reactors , to which the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor belongs , the new nuclear reactors , unlike any of the current Generation III Reactors , are the representatives of advancement in sustainability , safety , and reliability .
They are resistant to diversion of materials for proliferation and secure from terrorist attacks , too .
Moreover , the simplified safety features of the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor are independent of all the sophisticated backup system or experienced operators .
In fact , these features are all "meltdown proof" due to the reactors' basic principles .
According to Butler , D (2004) , the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor can cool down all by itself when it encounters an accident without any technical support from experienced operators .
Thus , terrorist attacks to the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor may be the last concern for the public and nuclear weapon proliferation may be effectively controlled due to the new reactors' safety features coupled with enhanced strategies to manage the nuclear fuels and materials in the international markets .
To sum up , I firmly reckon that the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor is the most suitable nuclear reactor concept for further research and development , despite the issues of high requirement of materials , the potential cost overruns , and the threat of nuclear safety and nuclear proliferation , because the Supercritical-Water-cooled Reactor's advantages of promising research on advanced materials , simplified designed factors , safety design features and resistance to nuclear proliferation overweigh the problems it faces today .

Nuclear energy is a source of energy which originates from the splitting of uranium atoms in a process called fission .
At the power plant , the fission process is used to generate heat for producing steam , which is used by a turbine to generate electricity .
(Westinghouse Electric Company LLC , 2009) Nuclear energy started in 1942 .
Till date , there are 436 active nuclear power plants and they generate more than 370 ,221 Megawatts of electricity which constitute to 16% of the world's total energy consumption .
Nuclear energy is used because it does not produce carbon dioxide which causes greenhouse effect .
Also , nuclear energy does not rely on oil and coal which are limited resources and its energy generation is the most concentrated compared to other sources of energy .
Despite the benefits of nuclear energy , few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries due to public opposition .
Nuclear leak is the fear that most people have after the Bhopal incident which occurred in 1984 .
It continues to evoke strong emotions even after 25 years later .
(Union Carbide Corporation , 2001) However , as time goes by , new reactor concepts have been developed and the aspects of safety and performance have been improved .
Therefore , I feel that we should allow further research and development funding for nuclear energy so that it can our future source of energy .
There are 6 new generation IV reactor concepts which have been developed: gas-cooled reactor; lead-cooled reactor; molten salt reactor; sodium-cooled fast reactor and very-high-temperature reactor .
In this essay , I will be using the "very-high- temperature reactor" (VHTR) due to several deciding factors .
Firstly , the concept of VHTR is the most practical among the 6 reactor concepts .
Similar concept has been tested out in Oarai , Japan and the test run was successful as it reached its operating goal of 950 Degree Celsius .
As the reactor operates at such a high temperature , it can be use to split hydrogen from water thermochemically .
Hydrogen can be used as fuel cells to convert the gas into electricity for cars and homes .
VHTR can also operate without having to depend on the controversial reprocessing of plutonium waste which will deter terrorism and prevent nuclear weapon proliferation .

Operational safety is a prime concern for people working in nuclear plants .
Workers working in a nuclear plant are prone to radiation doses .
However , workers need not worry about it as radiation doses are controlled by the use of remote handling equipment , physical shielding and limiting the time workers spend in nuclear plant .
(Levenson , M . & Rahn , F . 1981) Others may argue that accidents are inevitable .
However , based on statistics , the number of fatalities in nuclear plants caused by operational accident is the lowest compared to other energy plants .
(Ball , Roberts & Simpson , 1994) Therefore , we can say that nuclear plant is the safest to work in compared to other energy generation plants .
New equipments that will protect workers from radiation doses can be obtain through research and development .
The Bhopal nuclear incident which was due to worker's carelessness has fear among people .
The educational and experience level of the workers working in nuclear plants need to be of certain standard .
As nuclear accidents can be devastating such as the Chernobyl incident , we need to carefully select people to work in nuclear plants .
However , critics may argue that human error cannot be avoided if human is involved in the process .
Then , to minimize human error , one way is to minimize manual labor and computerize the whole operating process .
Therefore , we need research and developments to explore the possibility of computerize the operating process .
Cost and performance of nuclear plant is two of the main factors that people will look into before deciding whether to invest in it .
Cost will include the operating and maintenance cost and performance is determined by the amount of output energy it can achieve .
Based on an article published by U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee and the Generation IV International Forum on December 2002 , the estimated cost of building and maintaining VHTR nuclear plant is one of the lowest compared to the other generation IV reactor concepts .
The article also stated that the efficiency of VHTR exceeds fifty percent which is the highest among the six reactors .
We cannot deny that the advantages of having VHTR are through years of research and development .
Therefore , we cannot stop the research and development process if we want to continue to have a better energy source
In conclusion , I support further research and development funding for nuclear power as a source of energy for the future .
Research and development is an important process that will bring up the standard of human life .
As we traced the history of nuclear power since 1942 till today , we can see that there is a vast improvement in the field of nuclear energy in terms of global security , operational safety , automating the process , cost and performance .
We cannot be contended with the result that we currently have .
Research and development needs to be done consistently so that we can better improve the concept of nuclear reactor in the future .
From the trend and progress of nuclear energy , I can predict that the future will rely very much on nuclear energy to power the world .

The funding for generation IV reactors has always been a controversial issue .
One of the Generation IV concepts include sodium-cooled fast reactors .
The controversy is that some people believe that all nuclear reactors bring disasters after the accidents in Chernobyl in 1986 and the accident in the Three Mile Island in 1979 .
However , the funding for the research and development for the generation IV reactors is a must as there is an increasing need for energy these days .
Furthermore , the issue of global warming also arises and nuclear power would help reduce the greenhouse gases that cause global warming .
In addition to that , generation IV nuclear reactors also reduce the waste produced after the generation of the energy .
However , opponents may argue that the funding for such reactors may not be useful as it is expensive to construct and the resources used in the funding of the nuclear reactors could be used to further enhance renewable resources currently available .
They also argue that nuclear reactors are not safe as there had been previous accidents in nuclear plants .
The two main accidents cited by the opponents are the Chernobyl accident and the accident in the three-mile Island .
For this case investing in the nuclear reactors would not go to the waste .
However , opponents might argue that resources could be diverted to research more into renewable resources .
However , research had been done and there was no potential into further improving the process of tapping renewable energy but there is potential in nuclear power and hence the funding is required to carry on .
Furthermore , the world today require more energy and the energy demand is not met with the existing renewable resources as they have their own limitations .
For , example , wind energy cannot be tapped on non-windy days and solar energy cannot be tapped at night .
This causes a country to lose out its profits as the production in industries could not be carried out if there is not enough energy supply .
Hence , due to our growing energy needs we need to concentrate on the generation IV Reactors .
Italy initially constructed 4 nuclear reactors but shut all of them down after the Chernobyl accident .
However the Prime Minister of Italy , Berlusconi , and the President of France , Nicolas Sarkozy , signed an agreement which states that that the both countries would work together to bring back nuclear power in Italy .
Initially , Italy had no back up energy source on its own and need to depend on other countries .
CITATION Ita09 \l 1033 (Italy , 2009) In fact , Italy had more than 80% of its energy supplied by other countries CITATION nuc08 \l 1033 (Italy n .  , 2008) .
Italy now plans to build nuclear reactors as it does not want to depend heavily on other countries for energy .
If the country supplying power to Italy decides to stop importing power to it , Italy's economy would come to a halt .
Furthermore , it would destabilize the society and would potentially cause political instability as people would be unhappy with no electricity in the country .
For example , citizens living in the village Banthara did not participate in the elections in India as they were upset over having little access to electricity CITATION Kam09 \l 1033 (Hajela , 2009) .
Hence , nuclear power is required for social peace and to meet the increasing energy demand .
Therefore , research and funding would be necessary for generation IV reactors .

Opponents might also argue that nuclear reactors are expensive to construct .
However , the claim is not true .
Nuclear suppliers reported that the newer plants actually only require 10 to 40% of the price needed to build the first plant .
Also , the generation IV reactors are researched as a consortium .
Hence , the countries can benefit from Economies Of Scale and create Monopoly .
This would cause profit for the reactors .
Also , if nuclear power is not used , then the world's economy could not progress as the energy input is not met .
Hence , there would be more loss to the world if production stops .
Therefore , research and funding for Generation IV reactors is necessary .
CITATION joh06 \l 1033 (madslein , 2006) .
Funding for generation IV nuclear reactors would be useful as they help reduce greenhouse gases .
The Massachusetts institute of technology reported that more than 40 percent of the greenhouse gases produced would be attributed to the burning of fossil fuels by 2020 CITATION Lau08 \l 1033 (Sullivan , 2008) .
However , using the generation IV nuclear reactors would reduce the emission of greenhouse gases as a method known as nuclear fission is applied to tap energy .
The energy after the uranium is burnt in the fission process is used to vaporize water to produce steam which is then used to turn turbine to produce electricity CITATION Gab07 \l 1033 (Gache , 2007) .
Moreover , if power from six nuclear reactors is used in Australia instead of fossil fuels , the greenhouse emission in Australia alone would reduce by 4% .
Hence , further research and funding is necessary for generation IV concepts as they help reduce the effect of global warming .
However , opponents backtrack to the accidents on Chernobyl and the three-mile island and argue that funding should not be given for generation IV reactors .
However , the accidents happened in the past .
Furthermore , the new generation IV reactors are more safe and also help combat future climate changes .
The generation IV reactors are not only safe to operate as they are machine operated , but also reduce greenhouse gases that the current energy sources produce .
To sum it all , funding for the generation IV concepts is necessary as there is an increasing energy demand today .
Also , a country cannot depend solely on other countries for its energy as it would cause socio-economic problems .
Furthermore , nuclear power helps reduce greenhouse gases and help combat climate change .
Also , the plant is not very expensive to construct as the opponents claim .
Hence , the funding for the Generation IV nuclear reactors is a useful one .

People usually have the misconception of nuclear power .
Whenever people heard of the word "nuclear" , they usually associate this word with nuclear warfare , radiation emitted by nuclear and all the possible detrimental impacts that nuclear can cause (Donald , 2004) .
People have this misconception because they think that nuclear is actually a very lethal "weapon" .
However , the public usually forgets the fact that nuclear can actually be a rich source of energy and is able to have a substantial effect on the reduction of cost and environmental pollution .
Moreover , with the advancement of technology , nuclear fission and waste disposal of nuclear can be assured of safety (Partha , n .d) .
Indeed , nuclear energy should be funded for further research and development .
With the numerous benefits of nuclear energy , there is no doubt that nuclear energy should be used .
Researchers are currently researching and finding ways to further reduce the cost and enhance the safety of generation IV reactor concepts .
One of the most advanced concepts is the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) which incorporates maximum safety features and produces more energy than expected (Burtler , 2004) .
More research should be done on the VHTR reactor because currently , the expected cost of operating this VHTR reactor is still relatively high .
However , the cost is still cheaper in contrast to using fossil fuels to generate energy .
For example , the cost of nuclear energy per kilo watt hour (KWh) is just 1 .68 cents only .
This is much cheaper compared to using oil which cost 18 cents per KWh or using coal which cost about 4 cents per KWh (Economics of Nuclear Power , 2009) .
The low cost of nuclear energy is mainly due to the abundance of uranium which can be mined at a low cost and just a tiny amount of uranium can provide a huge amount of nuclear energy for usage .
However , for fossil fuels , the most optimistic estimate on the lasting for fossil fuels is about two hundred years (Enzler , 1998) .
Cost is definitely an issue for people .
With low cost of electricity , people will enjoy the benefits .
In addition , if further research is done on VHTR reactor , the cost of using nuclear energy may even be lower .

As for the environmental factor with regards to using nuclear energy , opponents of nuclear energy may argue that nuclear power plant produces waste that is not environmental friendly .
It is a fact that nuclear power plant does produce waste known as spent fuel .
This spent fuel has different radiation level and requires special handling .
However , the US Department of Energy , just like France , has vowed to ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste by transmuting problem components of nuclear fuel into less harmful components and buried it deep into the ground (Nuclear Power and the Environment , n .d) .
The strict regulation of nuclear reactors by the government and together with the current technology is enough to ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste .
Furthermore , in the aspect of zero pollution by nuclear energy , opponents of nuclear energy will have no choice but to agree with this fact .
If we were to compare the amount of greenhouse gases and poisonous gases emitted by fossil fuels in contrast to nuclear energy when operating the reactors , there is an astonishing statistics showing the huge amount of harmful gases emitted by fossil fuel .
2249 pounds of carbon dioxide and thirteen pounds of sulphur dioxide is being produced in the production of 1MWh of electricity (Nuclear Power and the Environment , n .d) .
This amount of carbon dioxide definitely expedites the process of global warming .
Comparing the amount of gases produced by fossil fuels and by nuclear power plant , the latter will definitely be the wise choice for energy purpose because it produces zero carbon dioxide and zero poisonous gases .
Only with the usage of nuclear reactor we are then able to claim the title of environmental friendly .
Opposition of nuclear energy may also claim that nuclear reactors pose a security threat because terrorists may target nuclear reactors , hence causing mass destruction to the country and its citizens .
The fear of using nuclear reactors as a cover up for making nuclear bomb is even more prominent .
However , with the generation IV reactors coming up , especially the VHTR , maximum security is assured .
VHTR is designed in such a way that in the event of accident occurring , there will be a temperature control sensor to switch off the nuclear reactor automatically .
(Very High Temperature Reactor , n .d) Though people may still be worried that the temperature control sensor may fail , all these safety features can be enhanced by having a back up sensor in the event of breakdown .
Security guards and camera can also be used to monitor the safety operation of nuclear power plant and ensure that the power plant is free from terrorists .
All the research and funding for the VHTR is definitely worth the money and effort with regards to the security issue of nuclear power plant (Nuclear Energy Information Centre , 2006) .
There is definitely no question that producing an increased share of electric power using nuclear fuel in lieu of fossil fuel will reduce greenhouse gases emissions .
Substantial replacement of fossil fuels would result in substantial decline in global warming and greenhouses gases .
Furthermore , the cost of operating nuclear reactors is low in compared to fossil fuel power plant .
Cost will definitely be an issue for the people when using electricity .
There is no doubt that more research and funding should be allocated to generation IV reactors , especially VHTR which opens a new arena for nuclear energy as VHTR incorporates the safety of nuclear reactors and also provides low cost of nuclear energy for users .
Nuclear energy is definitely the one and the best choice of energy .

In the near future , nuclear power has an important role to play to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases which cause global warming .
In the video Inconvenient Truth (2004 , Al Gore) , statistics showed that 650 ,000 years ago , carbon dioxide levels never reached 300 parts per million .
However , in recent years the level of carbon dioxide emission doubled and could increase even further if carbon dioxide continues to be produced without any restriction .
This results in a high amount of heat being trapped in the Earth and thus makes the world an impossible place to live in .
New generation IV reactors address these serious issues and bring new hope to mankind .
However , critics reject the new concepts of nuclear reactors due to concerns about security , costs and environment .
Anna Aurilio , Legislative Director for the U .S . Public Interest Research Group claimed that" . . . nuclear power is too dangerous  . . .and should not be part of a global warming solution" .
But with the use of sophisticated technology , generation IV reactors are safer .
Moreover , accidents pertaining to nuclear power are already rare .
Hence , it is imperative to set aside funds for researching and developing generation IV reactors such as the very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) to improve on the past reactors and solve global warming .
Firstly , for security reasons , opponents of the new reactors insist that terrorists could easily make nuclear reactor one of their targets .
Shelly (25 March 2002) reminded us that the terrorists who attacked the world trade centre could have easily attacked the Indian Point's twin reactors and the United States would agree with Shelly that they were somehow fortunate .
However , one could question why did the terrorists not fly the plane into the twin reactors ?
Could it be that the twin reactors were more difficult to hit or the terrorists knew that the twin reactors were well protected or prepared to handle terrorists attacks ?
In fact , the core of the present nuclear plants are already well protected by strong materials and there is a safety plan (Goldstein , 23 September 2009) .
Since researchers would also be finding suitable high heat-resistant materials for the VHTRs to prevent the plant from melting down , the extra protection would make the future plants almost impossible to penetrate in the future .

Secondly , detractors argue that consumers would prefer to use other forms of energy due to their cost competitiveness .
According to Russell (June 2008) , the price of one unit is estimated to be US$12 billion .
The operating costs after paying off building fees for around 12 years are still higher than those of solar and wind power by 4 cents per kilo-watt hours .
Why would one choose to pay more for the same amount of energy used ?
It is because the new reactors could produce hydrogen as well which is an important source of fuel (Butler , 2004) but expensive to produce .
Moreover , wind and solar power depend on inconsistent factors such as sunlight and wind respectively .
Hence , nuclear power has the advantage in terms of higher output and consistent energy production as it runs 90 per cent of the time (Kurt , 24 September 2008) .
With much more consistent energy production , factories and companies that rely on consistent energy to be productive would certainly choose performance over costs as disruptions might incur losses higher than paying for nuclear power .
Lastly , disputers argue that nuclear waste storage is a problem as nuclear waste remains reactive even after a long time .
This causes citizens oppose strongly against the nuclear waste being stored near them .
In the U .S . , Mr Obama also questioned whether nuclear waste could be stored in a safe place (Steve , 10 November 2008) as the search for a suitable place to store nuclear waste in the U .S . continues .
However , he explained that the U .S . could store the waste near the reactors .
Naturally , that is possible as the waste is about 33 tonnes per year (Wald , August 2009) and this relatively small amount of waste should find the space at those nuclear sites .
Moreover the impact of global warming is growing and is of immediate concern to the world and nuclear power help solve the problem by reducing the emission of carbon dioxide by a total of 31 ,243 MtC in 2050 in France and Canada alone .
(Cochran , 23 April 2008) .
It is without doubt that the world needs to solve global warming or else the Earth might perish first .
In conclusion , the Earth's temperature is increasing rapidly towards a level that causes widespread heatstroke .
If the world do not cooperate to support VHTR or nuclear power , it is difficult to find an alternative that could produce energy that is clean and affordable in the long run .
As a result , the world might see an increasing number of casualties due to glebal warming .

In the recent years , oil prices have been soaring new heights and this reflects the high energy demands all over the world and the limited supply of fossil fuel .
This sounds the siren for us to find an effective source of alternative energy before the fossil fuel that we depend so much on runs out .
Today we have candidates such as the solar energy , wind energy and the nuclear energy .
Since energy harvested from nuclear reactors are highly efficient and have low material cost , they are seen as a good source of alternative energy .
A nuclear reactor is very similar to a typical coal burning power plant where they heat water into pressurized steam which drives the turbine generator .
Only difference is the type of fuel used to heat up the water .
Nuclear reactors use energy generated from nuclear fission which has a very high output to material used ratio .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) was initiated in 2000 and formally chartered in mid 2001 to come up with more advanced nuclear reactors called the Generation IV reactors .
(Gen IV Reactors ,2009) By far , six designs of generation IV nuclear reactors have been finalized which the GIF believed to represent the shape of future nuclear energy .
(Butler , 2004) But public opposition due to several factors such as terrorism , safety , renewability and environmental issues caused few reactors to be built over the past decade .
Although nuclear energy should not be seen as the only solution to depleting fossil fuel , due to its ability to generate huge amount of energy using small amount of resources , its development should be encourage .
Further research and development and funding for generation IV reactors such as the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) have benefits outweighing the disadvantages it has in the aspects of security , cost and environmental concerns .

(2007 , October 8) Greeendaily .com This or That: Nuclear power vs . alternative energy sources .
Oppositions have very good reasons to go against nuclear reactor development especially after the 911 incident and the Chernobyl disaster .
After the 911 incident , Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) enforced strict rules and regulations on the nuclear power plants .
(Order Code RS21131 , 2005) These include having all nuclear plants licensed by NRC to be protected by layers of physical barriers and a highly trained security force .
Another benefit that comes with this heighten security is the generation of more jobs helping to ease unemployment rate .
NRC also requires the power plants to conduct regular security and evacuation exercises which will be closely monitored by NRC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) .
(Order Code RS21131 , 2005) Furthermore , a decades-long test and analysis portrayed that actual radioactivity escaping from molten fuel is less than initial assumption as the nuclear activity slows down a lot when it is not in the internal structure of the reactor .
Also the containment structures of modern reactors were designed to effectively prevent the escape of radioactivity even if it sustained severe damages .
(Safety , 2008) These factors would certainly ease the minds of people worrying about the security and safety issues of nuclear reactors .
In contrast to the two other alternative sources of energy , the cost of building a nuclear reactor is higher than a wind turbine or solar panel .
Also since a wind turbine or solar panel are more unlikely to be in a terrorist's hit list than a nuclear plant , cost of maintaining security of them are relative less .
But in contrast to what many people would think , even a generation III reactor used today have structures that can sustain a plane crashing into it .
In addition , a MSR uses an integrated fuel cycle system where it uses its molten salts as its fuel as well as its coolant .
(GIF , 2007) MSR has lower fissile inventories and no need to spend on ways to handle solid fuels .
(Gen IV reactors , 2009) Moreover , newer advanced reactors have simpler designs which further reduce capital cost and they are more fuel efficient and safer .
(Advanced Reactors , 2009) The construction of wind turbines and solar panels are very space consuming because of their low energy efficiency and they are unreliable as they are weather dependent .
(Gibson , 2007) Although nuclear reactors too need large area of land space , the great energy output it has compensated for it .
All the alternative energy mentioned are green compared to the burning of fossil fuels in terms of emission to environment .
But some still feel that wind and solar energy are greener than nuclear energy due to the nuclear waste .
Since the first generation of nuclear reactors , advancement in technology has greatly increased the fuel efficiency thus cutting down on the waste .
(Gen IV Reactors , 2009) Furthermore , MSR's fuel doubles up as its coolant due to the good heat transportation properties of molten salts further reduce on the waste produced .
Due to the nature of MSR , its waste has lower amount of radioactivity , safer due to passive cooling up to any size and very low fuel usage .
The French self-breeding variant claims 50kg of thorium and 50kg U-238 per billion kWh .
(Gen IV Reactors , 2009)
There is certainly a need to find a replacement for the depleting fossil fuel and any feasible energy source could be a potential candidate .
All the possible should not be conveniently ignored .
Thus nuclear energy alike should not be dismissed .
Considering that the benefits nuclear energy brings outweigh the disadvantages , further research and development and funding should be done for more advance reactors that could be safer , more powerful and lower costing .

Nowadays , the energy shortage problem tends to be more serious as the demand for energy increases significantly , while most conventional energies are limited because of limited sources , especially oil and coals .
In such situation , the appearance of nuclear energy becomes so important , for the nuclear power has great advantages over other conventional energies .
For example , to produce same amount of energy , a nuclear power plant consumes much less fuel(uranium fuel) than that a normal coal-fired one consumes .
What's else , the nuclear power plant almost does not release any greenhouse gases or exhaust gases .
In other words , it is highly friendly to the environment .
Since the nuclear energy seems so perfect , it is a bit surprise that there are only 439 nuclear power plants around the world .
Why is it not so widely used like oil , even in the counties with the ability to deal with nuclear energy ?
However , some engineers hold the opinion that embed social psychology into the Engineering processes seems crazy and funny .
It is usually known that human factors mean the characteristic at the efficient and effective man-machine interface .
In their conservative view , they always care more about the how productive and reliable of the machines are and neglect to focus on the role of humans in safeguarding .
But from the previous analysis of the Chernobyl nuclear accidents , we can see that correct human actions are indispensable in preventing the disaster .
Indeed , the overall system's reliability and safety in a nuclear power plant is more often dependent on humans instead of the machines Why is that ?
Once the equipments be put into use , the maximum reliability are already fixed .
Afterwards , we need well-trained and experienced operators to maintain the performance of the machines and always keep track of the status of the equipments .
In addition , in a hazard industrial plant , well-organized working team is also very necessary , which has orderly shifts system , immediate backup , and so on .
Without any of the above measures of human resource management , the reliability of the whole system will not be easy to be ensured .
As the worlds' population grows ever larger , the worlds' energy consumption also increases; hence a sustainable energy source needs to be found to supply developing countries and others with enough energy .
The world's natural resources are depleting and a clean and renewable energy source is required .
16% of the world's electricity is supplied by nuclear power plants , and 30% of the worlds fossil fuels are used to produce electricity .
A clean energy source like Nuclear power seems to be the ideal solution for the energy crisis .
The generation 4 nuclear reactors are much safer , more efficient and more secure .
However the scars left from the Chernobyl disaster and the Three Mile Island catastrophe has changed the public opinion on Nuclear reactors for the worse .
(US DOE Nuclear Energy research advisory committee and the generation IV international forum)
Safety is a major point , and it is important for the Generation 4 reactors to prove its safety .
The SFR has a passive cooling system; this is because the thermal difference between the coolant boiling temperature and the operational temperature is quite large .
Hence in case of a meltdown or any terrorist activities the system can avoid a meltdown without any human interaction .
On the other hand the VHTR has an active cooling system , which means a human interaction is required in case of an emergency .
This works in the favor of the VHTR , a scenario where a fast response is needed , the VHTR would be suitable and safer .
The SFR boasts a recycling system where 99 .9% of the actinides are recycled back to as fuels , such as plutonium and since the SFR is a closed fuel system , fuel can be used again in the system .
Unlike the SFR , the VHTR has no waste recycling system and hence It goes directly into the repository where the nuclear waste has a half life about a few centuries only (research is currently going on to reduce the half life) .
In addition nuclear waste is not plutonium , in the SFR the recycled plutonium could be a security threat .
This could be a serious security flaw; in case the plutonium is stolen it could be used to fuel nuclear weapons .
In the case of the VHTR this major security flaw is completely eliminated .
(Roglans , J . , Allen , T . and Lineberry ,M .)
In conclusion , the VHTR is much superior to the SFR in several ways; this has made it the most popular choice amongst the Generation 4 reactors .
The VHTR is a clean source of energy and could be the solution to the energy crisis .
Hopefully by 2025 we would have a dependable , safe , clean and relatively inexpensive energy source .
In the society nowadays , people have high expectations in the development of new technologies .
Due to the speed of advancement of technology , people have taken it for granted and are expecting more for less .
This is evident when we look at the issue regarding new nuclear power plants to be built .
People are very performance orientated and yet safety and cost conscious .
Thus it is a common contradiction faced by most engineers nowadays .
People expect the new and upcoming Generation IV nuclear power plants to be efficient and at the same time expecting engineers and researchers to make it safer and cheaper .
Thus with this in mind , I would strongly advocate further research and development on the Very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) as it suits the "requirements" of the public the most .
I feel that if ample time is spent in researching this model of nuclear reactor , it will yield the best return and result and it will also address public concerns .
Firstly , the VHRT had an earlier expected delivery date than most other designs and that was the reason behind why I supported it .
According to a table published in an article (NATURE , 2004 , Vol 429 , p . 239) , it showed that the VHTR could be delivered in 2020 while many other designs could only manage 2025 .
This is because the basic technology envisioned in the VHTR is already in use by several current high temperature gas reactor plants based in countries like Japan , China and the USA (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee and the Generation IV international Forum , 2002 , p . 49) .
This means that the technology is already quite well established and thus less time is needed to research on the basic technology that will be used in VHTR as compared to the other power plants that may involve the use of totally new technologies .
In times like this where the price of fossil fuel and coal is sky rocketing , an earlier delivery date of 5 years for an efficient energy alternative is very crucial .
If the VHTR can be realized as soon as possible , public concerns about the hefty pricing on carbon tax and fossil fuel can then be addressed earlier .
Secondly , the high temperature generated by the VHTR is advantageous in many different ways .
It allows for high-thermodynamic efficiency of up to 48% currently (AREVA , 2009) and it is one of the most efficient designs among others .
Thus it translates to higher electrical production efficiency meaning that it can produce more electrical energy .
The huge amount of heat produced from the nuclear cores can also be used in refineries , for petro chemistry , metallurgy and hydrogen production (U .S . DOE NERAC & GIF , 2002 , p . 48) .
With hydrogen generation made possible , the VHTR can replace future coal fueled hydrogen production plants , taking over the role of supplying other hydrogen intensive industries and may also be able to generate hydrogen as a source of fuel .
Therefore the implementation of the VHTR can offer a wide range of solution to the fuel crisis that is currently troubling the public .
Thirdly , the use of helium in VHTR has several advantages that can address the public's safety concerns .
Helium is an inert gas and thus it does not react chemically with any material .
This means that it will not cause any corrosion or react with any of the power plant's structure to cause damage .
Thus the use of helium will not compromise the overall integrity of the power plant .
In addition , unlike other coolants considered for other Gen IV power plants , helium also does not become radioactive when it comes into contact with radioactive materials .
Therefore , even if there is a leak in the coolant gas pipes , it will not pose any harm or danger to the public .
With these advantages , it is definitely an asset that helium is being used for the VHTR as the coolant because it is confirmed that it will not pose safety threats and cause any possible safety breaches in the long run .
However , there are also constraints and problems to be solved before the VHTR can be commercially implemented .
This includes extensive research on materials that can withstand high temperature , that are stronger and corrosion resistant .
Materials such as alloys , composite , fuel coating and ceramic based materials (Fraser , 2006) need to be improved on in order to make the power plant safer .
Mechanisms and processes to cool the cores down in the event of an accident have to be reinvented or improved on as well .
In all , I feel that VHRT would be the best bet as a clean , safe and cheaper alternative in the long run .
It is because it can co-generate hydrogen and electricity with superior efficiency , tackling the fuel crisis issue head on .
It is also relatively safer than the rest of the Gen IV nuclear power plants as it uses an inert gas , helium as the coolant .
Finally , the cost should not be an issue because it has been reported that the pricing of nuclear energy is comparable or if not lower than those generated by coal and oil fired plants (Nuclear Energy Institute , 2001) .
Nowadays , people are arguing about the research and development for the generation IV reactors .
There are many people support this while others do not .
The most heated argument is the how to ensure the safety of the operation of the nuclear reactors .
From my point of view , I agree with the continuous research and development on the Very-High-Temperature-Reactor (VHTR) , which is one of the generation IV concepts , because it is the technology that brings us solution .
Opponents of development of nuclear reactors claim that why we should put so much money and efforts on such a dangerous plant .
Safety is the factor that the most people worry about .
There are two nuclear power plant accidents in the history .
The Chernobyl accident caused a huge number of death and radiation-related health impacts .
In fact , the accident occurred because of the inappropriately operation of the nuclear power plant and the reactor was not placed in the well-protected area neither .
The Three Mile Island accident was due to a meltdown of partial core in unit 2 .
As it is well controlled , the releasing of radioactive gases was less than the particularly dangerous iodine-131 and no death caused .
Nowadays , when building a nuclear plant , the safety issue is considered .
The nuclear plants are always built far from the public community .
If an accident occurred , it will still prevent the public from the impact of the accident .

Besides safety , the cost , performance and environmental issues are also popular in today's argument .
It is true that to develop and build a nuclear plant will cost a lot of money , but the cost is reasonable .
Nuclear power technology is much more well-rounded and practical technology when compared to solar power or bio-power technology .
A lot of money is also spent on developing these technologies which are still in experimental stage .
According to a recent report of nuclear plants (European Nuclear Society , 2009) , until 24 September 2009 , there are 436 nuclear power plant units in 31 countries are in operation and 53 plants in 15 countries are under construction .
About 17% of the world's electricity came from nuclear plants .
It is obvious that spending more money on development of nuclear power is quite reasonable .
Moreover , the performance of a nuclear plant is very significant compared to conventional thermal power station .
They both used the same principle to generate electricity .
Finally , under normal operation , nuclear power plants are environmental-friendly .
It does not emit any carbon dioxide gases or other pollutions .
The only thing to care about is the radiation .
The plant can ensure there will be no radiation emitted out of the reactor under normal operation .

The generation IV reactor concepts bring a brighter future to the nuclear reactors .
One of them is the VHTR concept .
It has many advantages compare to the existing technology .
With this technology , the efficiency of the system can be brought to a new level .
It enables an output temperature up to 1000oC unlike the existing reactors can only produce a heat temperature about 300oC (Butler , 2004) .
VHTR is more than three times powerful to the existing reactors .
That means it will generate much more power during the same period of time .
Besides , the VHTR can produce not only heat but also hydrogen productions .
This is a valuable process because hydrogen-production can be further processed to other types of fuel which is suitable for use in vehicles .
If VHTR is widely used , the amount of hydrogen-production could be enough to become a major fuel that can be another solution to the vehicle power system .
Moreover , VHTR is the lowest risk technology .
The safety characteristics of a helium-cooled , graphite-moderated core are taken by VHTR .
VHTR benefits from the high heat capacity and structural stability of the graphite together with the single phase and inert of the Helium coolant .
The fuel allows high burn-up and remains fission as the characteristics of the cooled uranium-oxycarbide .
The high operating temperature of core in the VHTR allows emissions-free process .
Furthermore , this technology also provides an enhanced waste minimization .
We have strong evidence to show that with the improvement of technology , the concerns about operation of nuclear plants will fade away .
In comparison with the current technologies , nuclear power has its advantages .
It is clean and high efficient .
With the appearance of the generation IV reactors , it will become more and more clean , efficient and safe .
The most important thing is to ensure the safety of the nuclear power plant to prevent it from the attack of terrorism .
In conclusion , the generation IV reactor concept brings new stage to the development of nuclear power .
VHTR is one of them .
It provides high-efficiency operation; produces not only heat but also hydrogen productions; has lower risk; offers enhanced waste minimization .
With all these advantages , the generation IV reactors will be one of the best solutions to the world's energy shortage conjuncture .

The robotic surgery is usually defined as the surgery performed with the use of robot .
This technology has been in use since 1985 with the invention of PUMA 560 robot (Savatta , 2007) .
Robotic surgery is beneficial because it is precise and accurate such that it minimizes the incisions , decreases the blood loss and reduces the healing time .
However , there are several concerns about robotic surgery especially in terms of safety , cost and efficiency .
First of all , most people are questioning about the safety when talking about robotic surgery .
As robotic surgery is a new medical technology , most patients may not be familiar with it .
Thus they have no doubt on the robots and feel uneasy during the surgery with no human present .
In case of emergency , it will be even harder for the surgeon , who controls the robot , to know the feeling of the patient and handle the situation .
Thus , some people prefer surgery done by surgeon as they believe such surgery will have lower risk level .

However , this is not true and in fact , robotic surgery has a relative low risk level than conventional surgery .
As mentioned before , robotic surgery is more precise and causes smaller incision .
For example , according to Livingston (New York Health News , 2009) , the all-robotic kidney transplant surgery is easier and less painful with its tiny robot incision and the patient is able to be back to normal activities within few weeks .
Furthermore , to avoid the risk , the professional engineers are required to check and maintain the system before and after every surgery to ensure the functionality of robot .
Surgeons are also well trained before they actually use the robot in performing the surgery .
The robot is designed in the way that in case of emergency , it will stop operating immediately and the surgeon will take over the surgery himself .
In this way , the safety of the patients is not more an issue .
Another concern by the general public is the cost of surgery .
According to Sherman (Science News , 2009) , the prices of da Vinci Surgical Systems , one of the newest robotic surgery systems , range from $700 ,000 to $2 .25 million per system .
Hence , the public are afraid that the poor patients cannot afford the robotic surgery .
Although it is true that the cost of the robotic surgery system is high , we have several solutions to solve this problem .
The most important part is government subsidy .
The robotic surgery is expensive because the robot is costly .
Hence , if the government could subsidize the hospital in purchasing the system , the cost of robotic surgery will dramatically drop to an affordable price to the general public .
Also , according to an article (Bonsor and Strickland , 2009) , the number of surgeons and nurses required for robotic surgery will be much less than conventional surgery and the hospital stays are generally shorter due to quicker healing time .
These will also cut the cost of robotic surgery .
In addition , more and more patients prefer robotic surgery as they agree that robots will perform more accurate surgeries with shorter healing time .
Thus , even the cost of robotic surgery is relatively higher than conventional surgery; most people believe that the money is worthy spent .
Last but not least , people may concern about the efficiency of robotic surgery .
There are doubts about whether the surgeons will be able to perform robotic surgeries effectively .
Recently , there was one case that one patient died from complications during the robotic surgery because the surgeon was not familiar with the system and could not perform effectively (Science News , 2006) .
This concern is reasonable because if the surgeon is not familiar with the system , he may take longer time for the surgery and thus create a risk .
To avoid this kind of risk happening in Singapore , a training center should be set up in each hospital .
Professional engineers and foreign experts are invited to train the local surgeons with certain hours of practicing to ensure the surgeons are fully familiar with the system and will be able to perform in real situation .
Now , if the surgeons are well trained , the robot will eventually increase the efficiency of the surgeons .
According to Wiley (ScienceDaily , 2009) , if the surgeon is well trained , using robots could help him perform many surgical tasks without other human assistants .
This is beneficial especially in case of Singapore as there are limited skilled assistants available in hospital .
Also , with the help of robots , the fatigue of the surgeon will reduce as most work is done by robot and time taken for each surgery is generally shortened .
All these will increase the efficiency of robotic surgery .
In conclusion , robotic surgery is a safe and effective prototype with a worthy cost .
In the future , with our advanced innovations of technology , most patients will be able to enjoy benefits of robotic surgery in the setting of minimal pain , low blood loss and early recovery .

Supercritical water cooled reactors (SWCR) are one of the generation IV reactors designs that are still undergoing research .
They will need two or three decades before any construction of commercial generation IV reactors .
(GIF , n .d . , para .
2) In fact , the idea of having SWCR may be perceived as a double-edged sword .
Until today , opponents of nuclear power have argued on the potential dangers which might cause by nuclear reactors in the light of major engineering accidents such as partial rector meltdown at Three Mile Island and the explosion of reactor core at Chernobyl in Ukraine .
Nevertheless , influential factors in terms of security , performance and environment should be looked into to show how and why the funding contributed to the areas of research and development for SCWR are beneficial .
Security is one of the primary factors that need to be addressed when monetary support is involved in the advancement of nuclear plants .
Unlike the rest of generation IV reactor concepts , SCWR is capable of running the operation without relying on the process of reusing plutonium waste .
(Butler , 2004) This could reduce the misuse of nuclear waste which can threaten the world peace as seen in the case of recent North Korea nuclear saga .
Under the concept of SCWR , Butler (2004) also states that SCWR have simple safety features that do not depend on well-trained operators and complex backup systems .
Furthermore , they are able to solve the heat emission by cooling themselves down if accidents do happen .
Opponents of nuclear energy might argue that the radioactive waste which will be produced by the nuclear reactors is susceptible to accidents due to human intervention .
However , researchers could only suggest better solutions for the nuclear plants to produce less radioactive waste but not to the extent of eliminating radioactive waste till today .
In addition , engineers and researchers are not the only ones who are responsible for the security of the nuclear reactors .
Military protection in nuclear plants is another factor that should be considered in the security of the nuclear plants .
With strong ground and air defence within the nuclear reactors , the plants would be well-protected and could deter any forms of terrorist threats .
It has been popularly argued that the the performance of SWCR could play a major factor in the financial contribution for the development of SWCR .
According to Butler (2004) , if the concept of SCWR is successful , it could compete with other elements such as coals and gases in terms of the prices in producing electricity .
With this statement , proponents of nuclear power would highlight the economical benefit in generating electricity using nuclear power .
Since SCWR and other Generation IV designs are reactors which can produce electricity as well as high temperature , they can also provide process heat for industrial purposes .
In addition , Bouchard (2008) mentions the uses of process heat for various types of industries such as chemical plants , petroleum refineries and hydrogen production .
Of course , some might be doubtful over the advantages gained through the performances of SWCR in the upcoming decades due to the slow development process .
However , Heber (2008) has explained that fact of the slow process in the new designs of SWCR is due to the great emphasize over the overall safety performances of the nuclear plants .
It is evident that the funding in the area of research and development of SWCR will provide benefits in the aspects of security , performance and environment .
With strong performance in the SCWR concept , mankind would experience better protection with the construction of new nuclear plants .
In the long run , the development of SWCR could also provide solutions to the environmental issues Ultimately , mankind need to accept new technology confidently and ethnically that might bring about unexpected improvements to the world .
One of the world's most devastating gas leak accidents occurred on December 3 , 1984 , in Bhopal , India .
The accident caused thousands of death and many are still suffering from its aftermath effect .
Methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas escaped from a pesticide producing plant owned by the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) and intoxicated the people in Bhopal .
After investigation , it was found that someone deliberately added water into the storage tank of the highly reactive MIC , causing a runaway reaction , pressure built up and caused large volume of toxic gas to escape and intoxicate the area .
Safety systems such as the alarm system , a refrigeration unit (for cooling down the storage tank) , a caustic soda scrubber (to neutralized the toxic gases) , and the flare system (to incinerate excess gases or toxic gases) were all not in operation at that time .
According to Psychology and design processes (Bernhard .W .
2007) , the article defines design as a strategy allowing the final product to meet the user requirements in many different areas and accidents usually occurs when there are miscommunications , inadequate organization or errors contributed by individuals .
Summing up , accidents occur when the outcome is not within the expectation of the designers .
Bernhard suggests idea of adopting psychology during the design phase of a project , because engineers are humans and humans are prone to mistakes .
Implementing psychology in the design does have advantages .
It can be use as a reminder to engineers if there are any areas neglected during the process , allowing better communication to take place within the team and reduces the possibility of problems arising from miscommunication or individual's action .
Also , instead of having the traditional feedback controls of safety , use of psychology predicts the consequences of having mistakes in design and take corrective actions immediately , this will greatly reduce the probability of accidents occurring due to design errors .

In current engineering practices , a method has already been use to update and reinforce safety , known as Hazard and Operability studies or HAZOP .
HAZOP is conducted every 3 years (varies with different company) and it is used to update the design of the plant or equipment in case of any changes .
It allows the representative from different departments to collaborate and discuss the best possible solution to enhance safety in the plant .
Hence , psychology in design phase maybe unnecessary and replaced by a set of regulations obliged by the company .
In conclusion , adopting psychology does have benefits in the initial phase , as it reduces accidents arise from design errors .
However , the usage maybe limited to the design phase , as root causes like operation error , human behavior and company's stand are common causes for accidents .
Thus , psychology maybe use in areas like promoting safety issues among the workers , reduce the behavior of bad practices in workplace and enhancing the communication between the different departments .

World Resources Institute showed that transportation sector contributed 13 .5% of the total greenhouse gas emission .
Of this , 9 .9% are due to road (cars , trucks , and so forth) activities[1] .
On the average , fossil fuels powered cars emit 6 tons of carbon dioxide each year[2] .
Hence , there is much interest in research and development of solar powered cars which produce zero harmful emission .
Since 1987 , the World Solar Challenge has been showcasing latest advances in solar cars .
Subsequently , the first prototype solar car that travelled 52 ,000 kilometers across 38 countries was developed and driven by a Swiss school teacher in 2008[3] .
He demonstrated that this concept is indeed viable .
Unfortunately , solar cars are not too safe compared to conventional cars .
The first fatal accident of a solar car occurred on August 12 , 2004 due to a head-on collision with a Chrysler minivan .
The driver of the solar car died instantly while the minivan's driver was unhurt[4] .
There are numerous reasons why the solar car is unsafe .
The best solar panel in the market today is less than 30% efficient at converting solar energy to usable electrical power .
Hence , solar cars must be made of very light materials .
Unfortunately , in any collision , a lighter car would suffer greater damages than a heavier car .

Ever since that fatal accident in 2004 , organizers of solar racing have imposed safety regulations on the cars .
Safety aspects include the design of the steering wheels , roll bars for the cockpit , safety belts , brakes , tyres , electrical insulation of the car and others[5] .
Unfortunately and much surprisingly , there are no requirements for airbags .
It is important that such an idea is explored as the concept of these prototype solar cars will one day be translated to cars of the future .
Having airbags is a common safety feature in cars today .
However , there is an opposing view stating that airbags can cause major injuries[6] .
Fortunately , since the introduction of the first airbag , the technology has advanced .
Today , scientists are studying on "smart airbags" which can tell the size of a person in the seat and how fast the airbag inflates , so as to minimize injuries[7] .
For comparison , safety belts which have widely been accepted on all cars including solar cars , can also cause injuries such as sternal fracture , bowel trauma or spinal injuries[8] .
A study done by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that the seat belt contributed 16% while the airbag only 8% of the injuries sustained in the vehicle[9] .
So , what is the reason airbags cannot be accepted as a safety device in solar cars too ?
In recent studies , airbag deployment with or without seat belt used , has shown to decrease the risk of head , thorax and spine injuries[10] .
In another study , airbags have reduced fatal injuries by an overall 11% for drivers and a reduction of fatalities of 31% for purely frontal crash[11] .
Like conventional fossil fuel driven cars , the airbag can be installed in the steering wheel or dashboard of the solar car , although some research still needs to be done on the exact location of the airbag , the crash sensors and the inflators .
Last but not least , I believe that an addition of a few airbags would not vary the cost of the solar car too much .
Just like in conventional cars , the addition of airbags only cost an increase by two to five hundred dollars at the most .
Of course , this also has to depend on branding and quality of the car and the airbag .
Also , the airbag weighs less than one kilogram[12] and hence should not affect the performance of the solar car significantly .
Thus , I stand strong on my point of view that solar cars should be improved and designed with airbags to enhance safety .

The challenger accident , happened on the morning of January 28 , 1986 , was a rooted accident in history for its catastrophic consequence and the great depression it brought to people .
The Orbiter challenger , the launch of the 25the space shuttle into space , was also well-known as the first time that a school teach had the chance to go into space .
However , only after seventy three seconds into flight , the Challenger exploded and all seven of its crew were lost .
As reported officially , "the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Booster problem began with the faulty design of its joint and increased as both NASA and contractor management first failed to recognize it as a problem , then failed to fix it and finally treated it as an acceptable flight risk" .
(Dick , 1986) The cause of the accident therefore lies in technical deficiencies in design and human factors .
Some expert (Robert E . , 1997) claimed that the challenger accident was mainly caused by the mechanical failure due to the flaw of the original design .
In my opinion , deficiency in psychology guidance were the main causes , as the accident would be prevented if decision makers act more rationally and the concerns of engineers from {Morton Thiokol}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Morton_Thiokol] and Rockwell International were recognized .
Meanwhile , some engineers at Rockwell International also noticed that a significant amount of ice built up on the fixed service structure that stood beside the shuttle .
These engineers feared that during launch , ice might be shaken loose and harm the challenger's thermal protection tiles .
Likewise , the engineers warned their mangers about this concern , and once again it was neglected .
If still this concern had drawn close attention of the decision makers , the accident would have been prevented .
Some people may argue that the ice beside the shuttle was actually not the cause of the problem , so it would not make a difference even if the launch was delayed and the ice was removed .
Again , this claim was invalid , because more inspections would be conducted and the real problem would be found out with enough care .
To sum up , even though the Challenger was designed with some serious flaw and destined to fail in such a cold environment , appropriate psychology could still be implemented to prevent the accident from happening , as long as decision of the launch was made with surety and the potential dangers found by the engineers were cleared up .
In the case of the Challenger accident , lack of psychology education was indeed the main cause .
And not just in that case , the use of psychology should always be marked as a necessity in future engineering designs to enhance safety .
Nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions .
The heat produced during nuclear reactions is used to boil water to produce the steam used to turn the turbine generator .
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (2009) , as of September 2009 , "30 countries worldwide were operating 436 nuclear reactors for electricity generation and 53 new nuclear plants under construction .
The nuclear power plant provided about 14 percent of the world's electricity production in 2008" .
Although there are certainly dangers in nuclear power plants , I believe that its potential benefits will certainly outweigh its dangers .
The Chernobyl accident in 1986 and Three Mile Island in 1979 had led to serious concerns about the safety of Nuclear power plant .
For instance , Sweden is moving out of the nuclear power industry within the next 10 years .
Sweden is even committed by law to phase out its existing nuclear power plants (Fred Guterl , 2002) .
This indicates that the public support has declined in the recent years .
One of the main reasons of the decline is due to the fact that the nuclear power plant might cause dangerous consequences when it malfunctions , due to its unstable nature .
Secondly , the amount of radioactive waste emitted by the nuclear power plant is also harmful to the earth , and yet , these nuclear plants release large amounts of highly radioactive compound .
Thirdly , the challenge faced by the countries to isolate the leftover , highly radioactive material discharged by the nuclear power plant is also a main reason why it is in decline .
The wastes produced are required to be isolated from humans and the environment for about 100 ,000 years before it is deemed safe and harmless to humans .
Although nuclear power plant has its disadvantages , it also has its advantages too .
The warming of the Earth is partly due to the emission of carbon dioxide gas from power plants that burn coal , oil or natural gas .
The September 11 attack has also provided valid political reasons for cutting down on the reliance on fossil fuels .
Actually , Nuclear power plants emit one hundredth times less greenhouse gases as compared to coal or gas power plants .
The cost of Uranium Ore is a very small portion of the operating cost of a Nuclear power plant .
Fourth Generation Nuclear plants can fully utilize all the energy in Natural Uranium .
The amount of uranium accessible on Earth is able to support fourth generation nuclear power plants for hundred of centuries .
In short , nuclear power plants are more environmental friendly than coal power plants .
Lastly , the cost of building nuclear power plants has greatly reduced over the years .
Current reactors will still be usable for a long time thus the construction cost will be spread over the years .
New plants are easier to build and maintain , thus reducing construction cost .
Current Generation III reactors are around $2000 per KW which is lower than $2300 per KW for coal power plant .
To reiterate , it is not true that nuclear power plants are much more costly than coal power plants .
In conclusion , the advantages of nuclear power plants have outweighed the dangers involved .
Very High Temperature Reactors concept , which is based on the lowest risk technology developed , achieves the need for commercial functional requirements to provide an economically competitive nuclear energy (Idaho National Library , n .d) .
Furthermore , there is the capability of VHTR to consider , the ability to use current wastes left behind as a source of energy .
From the first nuclear reactor plant was built in Obninsk , a city in Russia , in 1954 .
The debate on whether we should use the nuclear energy has never been cooled down .
Although nuclear energy was famous for its cleanness and abundance , the public was anxious about its safety .
The catastrophic nuclear accidents such as three mile island event and Chernobyl accident put a shadow into people's eyes .
However , can we draw a conclusion that nuclear energy is not the suitable energy that human beings can use ?
The answer is no .
Beginning in 2000 , ten countries including US , UK , Canada , France , Brazil , Japan and so on started to cooperate in the research on a future generation of nuclear energy system , known as Generation 4 .
After two years' great effort they came out a concrete and significant report about Generation 4 reactor concepts .
In this report the concepts of very-high-temperature-reactor (VHTR) are attention-getting because the new features of VHTR will greatly improve nuclear energy's popularity , thus resetting opponents' conservative views .
The opponents thought that it was not worthy to generate electricity by nuclear energy because the cost of building nuclear power plants will be an astronomical figure .
Although the cost of building a nuclear power plant is much higher than that of a traditional power plant , some evidence shows that it's possible to reduce the price difference .
First , scientists have been studying how to recycle used nuclear fuel to recover its energy content .
VHTP will use this kind of fuel , thus reducing the cost .
Second , research has been done to extend the tenure of use of the facilities .
The nuclear facilities of VHTP will be used for about 50 years (the generation 4 international forum , 2002) .
The long life span of equipment helps save cost .
Third , the traditional energy like coal and petroleum are getting more expensive because they are non-renewable-resources and will be exhausted one day .
In the contrast with the development of the nuclear technology and application of nuclear energy on a large scale , the efficiency of nuclear reactors will be improved gradually and the price of nuclear energy will decrease .
The above three points prove that it is worth to build VHTRs because it will pay back in the long run .
Through taking a look at the current energy situation and analyzing the special advantages of VHTR , the Generation 4 nuclear reactor , it should be evident that VHTR concept is advanced and VHTR will gear to actual circumstances .
The three outstanding characters of VHTR are passive safety , high efficiency and having byproduct hydrogen .
These distinctive features are significant in the nuclear industry because they can avoid miserable nuclear accidents , raise the efficiency of nuclear reactor to a new peak and decrease the cost of nuclear industry .
Therefore , further research and development funding are essential for the VHTR concept .
"Nuclear energy would be dominant source of energy by now if it hadn't been Chernobyl and Three Miles island ."
(Our Energy , 2007) Without the public fear and reluctance to accept nuclear power , the world may now be enjoying the abundant electricity and accelerating economic growth , especially in some developing countries like India and China .
Now , human beings are facing a series of harsh realities: greenhouse emission , depletion of non-renewable resources , increasing thirst for energy .
As expected , every possible ways of generating energy is under research .
However , only nuclear reactors can generate electricity at high efficiency and is viable for long period of time .
Therefore , it is obvious that nuclear power will be undergone immense research and development .
Amongst the six most probable concepts at present stage , the Super-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) is relatively the most suitable and worth extensive research , after comparing its properties with the other five .
First issue concerned is the performance of reactors .
Opponents of SCWR point out that its thermal efficiency is not the highest among the 6 concepts .
To maximize level of energy output , it seems that the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , which could achieve 50% efficiency level when deployed , is a better choice .
However , it operates under super high temperature of 1000 .
This results in the increase in temperatures of the whole system and the whole area .
Energy is needed to run the cooling machine to maintain the temperature at the safe level .
Furthermore , the disparity between the two efficiencies is not huge .
This is attributed to the existing light water reactor technology which SCWR is developing upon .
With modifications , the efficiency can be increased by one third , reaching a high value of at least 44 %( A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy System , 2002 , p . 6) .
On the other hand , the electric efficiency of a conventional thermal power station , considered as saleable energy , is typically 33% to 48% efficient .
Therefore , SCWR is able to provide a consistently high level of energy output .
In addition , the system does not require steam-water separation , which reduces the flow path of the coolant , water , and subsequently minimizes the heat loss to surroundings .
Hence , it is reasonable to further develop SCWR system , since its overall performance excels .
Opponents also claim that constructing nuclear power reactor is a huge capital-intensive project , which requires intensive investment of money and research .
After the deployment of nuclear plant , more funds are needed for insurance coverage , maintenance and labor .
Hence , nuclear energy may not be worth it .
In the case of SCWR , due to the presence of high pressure and possible corrosion , the expenditure on research and maintenance will be high .
However , the other reactors also face challenges that require substantial technological and financial supports .
If the ratio of energy output and all inputs is considered , the rate of return of SCWR is faster than the others , not mentioning the low price of the electricity when the design is successful .
Then the traditional oil or coal generators will be disadvantaged because of the rarity of these non-renewable resources .
Moreover , comparing with the other five ideas which use inert gas , liquid compound or metal as coolants , water is much easily accessed and present in relative abundance .
Thus , the manufacturing process of coolant is simpler for SCWR , and also cheaper .
Also , due to the presence of light water reactors , there is already extensive worldwide experience in constructing and operating this sort of reactor .
This saves a lot of experiments and provides information for scientists .
The experience minimizes the chances of any experimental failure and in turn saves the research funds .
The final design proposed a reduction in the size of the reactor coolant pumps , piping , and associated equipment .
So SCWR is economically favorable .
As mentioned at the beginning of the essay , safety is always the most essential concern in the whole designing process .
Opponent views are that the very high pressure SCWR required may impose risks , which is indeed a realistic concern .
However , this potential peril can be avoided by testing and choosing suitable materials which can withstand huge pressure and corrosion .
Consequently , they help prevent formation of cracks or explosion .
Furthermore , the proposed design of SCWR is much less sophisticated than the present reactors .
It is greatly simplified after discarding away the step of steam-water conversion .
It reduces the probability of making mistakes and level of seriousness of accidents .
In fact , the safety measures are executed to the maximum for every design .
It is hardly , as what many nuclear research associations have asserted , to have a second Chernobyl incident .
Another advantage of SCWR is that waste generation is optional .
This feature limited the extent of its nuclear pollution which leads to health problems like birth defective .
Hence , although there are inevitable risks that we have to bear for every type of design , we can still choose appropriately the one that can minimize this risk .
In conclusion , SCWR reactor is more perfect in the aspects of performance , cost and safety .
Its advantages make it the suitable one to help the world transit into a new era of energy .
As nuclear energy is taking over the world , the development on SCWR will be the step stone and lead us to a "new dawn"
Nuclear power is the up and coming alternative green energy source which will tackle global and environmental issues such as depleting natural resources , escalating energy consumption and global warming .
Nuclear technology has always been a controversial issue , with much public opposition arguing their concerns , such as high cost , security problems and safety issues .
Researchers had proposed new generation IV reactors , which is targeted at answering these pressing concerns .
An example is the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) which boasts a super helium coolant which is much more effective than water , and yet it is both inert and unreactive (Teri Ehresman , 2009) .
It also has ultra hard ceramic materials which are heat resistant and very safe if meltdown were to occur .
The by-products of VHTR are hard to extract and the usable amount is of insignificant amount .
These generation IV reactors can only be realized if everyone sees the benefit of nuclear energy and supports the research for it .
Nuclear reactor produces a large amount of energy relative to the average fossil fuel combustion .
The amount of nuclear energy given off is huge in a typical nuclear reaction , amounting to an average of 3 .4 thousand billion joules per kilogram of fuel , which is about one hundred thousand times as much energy as the combustion of fuel (Gene Smith , 1999) .
With human population rising at an exponential rate , peaking at an estimated 9 .1 billion in 2050 , energy consumption is too expected to rise proportionally .
Nuclear is definitely a viable option that can meet this demand .

Nuclear energy can be utilized to relieve the world's demand for depleting fossil fuel .
Fossil fuel is the main source of energy worldwide , contributing up to 95 percent of world's energy demands (David Johnston , 2008) .
As this natural resource is being used up at an approximated rate of 6 .2 billion tons annually , it is calculated to last for a maximum of four more decades (Bob Williamson , 2009) .
In addition , burning of these fuels emits harmful greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide , whereas the nuclear technology is clean and green .
Opposition parties are always concerned about the safety of having nuclear reactors .
As seen from the recent Chernobyl accident , many people were killed and injured , and many were adversely affected by the nuclear materials that were left behind for close to a decade .
Therefore , research for a new generation of reactors is needed to address this problem .
As seen from the introduction above , the VHTR has many new additional and improved safety aspects , thus being much safer as compared to the ones we have currently .
Thus , all the safety concerns that the opposition party has are answered to and nuclear reactors can be an option to take over the current fuel intensive reactors .
Another argument against nuclear power is the security concern .
As nuclear technology is known for its vast and massive destruction , much policies and measures are taken to ensure that this nuclear technology does not fall into the wrong hands .
Many had also argued that terrorists were able to collect these by-products and use them as a weapon .
This new generation IV reactor has also been improved to work on this problem .
The by-product now is embedded in an ultra hard material , and also heated up to very high temperature , which is almost impossible to be extracted out .
All these measures taken will deem the by-products safe from terrorist's reach .
As one can see from the argument above , security issues are considered seriously and the risk of it being breached will be very minimal .
It is clear that nuclear technology is the best alternative to the current fossil consumption as it produces a relative larger amount of energy .
It is also able to meet the increasing demand for energy consumption , without the expense of the environment .
In a long run , nuclear technology is definitely going to be more efficient and beneficial to the society .
Even though it may be costly as extensive research has to be carried out and expensive construction is required , the benefits and advantages will definitely outweigh this hefty price .
Importantly , global issues such as greenhouse effect and depleting non-renewable resources are being addressed and can be solved .
Although nuclear technology has a few disadvantages , many changes had been proposed to minimize them .
As we know that we have a technology gap between now and the proposed Generation IV reactors , it is important that research commences as soon as possible so that implementation of nuclear technology will not be distant .

With the global growth in population and economy , energies needed for either manufacturing industries or home appliances are increasing , hence developing nuclear power becomes an important issue .
Nuclear power is a power obtained from controlled nuclear reactions in a nuclear reactor; generally electricity can be produced after the reaction as the output power .
Among the six generation IV reactors , compared to other similar reactors which are able to generate both electricity and hydrogen power , the Lead-cooled fast reactor requires relatively lower temperature and low pressure with the support of recycling of the waste .
Although a large scale of energy can be obtained by generating nuclear power , there are criticizing views over the use of it in terms of safety concerns and environmental pollutions .
However , there are solutions provided to avoid nuclear accidents and in fact nuclear energy does not contribute any pollution .
Hence , nuclear energy is definitely a safe and reasonable approach to solve the problem of producing enough energy currently and also for the future needs .

Secondly , from an environmental standpoint , the opposing views think that the life-cycle emissions of the nuclear energy are the great pollutants .
However , several analyses have shown that the life-cycle emissions are far less than those of coal or natural gas-fired power plants (Nuclear Energy: A key tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions , n . d) .
Furthermore , in fact 15% electricity globally which generated by nuclear power greatly reduces the amounts of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere every year by 2 .1 billion tonnes (Position Paper , n .d) .
And the nuclear plants emit hardly any key agents for acid rain and photochemical air pollution , the sulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxides .
About 4 .8 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 2 .6 million tones of nitrogen oxides are avoided each year in European countries (Position Paper , n .d) .
Thirdly , people oppose the development of nuclear power due to the problem of long termed radiation influence caused by nuclear wastes .
However , it is not an issue that could not be solved .
Several physicists in Germany claim to find out a way to speed up the decay process of radioactive waste on timescales of a few tens of years and make it harmless .
The technique could avoid burying the waste in deep repositories , which may cost a lot for the government .
(Physics World , July 31 2006) .
Same goes for the discovery of Nuclear Solution inc . , its president and CEO Dr . Paul M . Brown claims that they have a technology to make the nuclear waste a safe energy by burning it .
(Spirit of Ma'at Online Magazine Feb 2002) .The six generation lead-cool fast reactor also provides a function of waste recycling to handle the waste , this will again ease the work of disposing the waste (Butler .
D ,2004) .
To sum up , nuclear energy is safe to develop and use with the continuing evolution of the nuclear plants and reactors , and it is also an emission- free energy source which can significantly reduced carbon dioxide gas and acid rains .
The waste produced by it can be recycled and reused to reduce the radiation influence to the environment and our society , as a result , cost will be also reduced in total .
In conclusion , in my opinion nuclear energy can be used to solve the problem of increasing energy demand in various industries , because it is safe to both human being and environment , and it is capable to provide relatively larger amounts of energy than other sources .

Design , as Wilpert (2007) defines , is a human activity that produces something in the future which does not currently exist .
The most fundamental pursuit of any design is the guarantee of the product to be usable , functional , safe and competent .
For many cases , safety is the most important aspect of a product , since it may be connected with countless lives .
On the morning of June 3 , 1998 , a tragic train accident happened in a small town in Germany .
The passengers on the fast travelling Inter City Express were comfortably enjoying the journey when they felt an unusual shaking sensation .
After a while , the whole train was pulled away from the railway and the bridge , bringing the road down onto itself .
(Eschede , n .d .) The tragedy happened just like that .
When people try to analyze the causes of the train accident , many believed that the use of psychology during the process of design could have prevented it .
(Wilpert , 2007) They claim that human actions , which tightly related to psychology , play a major role in the process of design .
However , some people oppose this argument .
In their point of view , psychology is not the deciding factor of the design process , and it is certainly not only the design process that contributes to the accident .
As far as am concerned , the use of psychology may help prevent the tragedy , but it's far from enough .
Rather , developing high technology and taking proper safety precaution when the accident happened are more important .
Design engineers can make mistake .
Their design errors eventually would result in the malfunction of the products , thus cause accidents .
Some people accuse that the design engineers of ICE didn't handle the safety design of the train in a careful way .
They claim that the engineers were being unprofessional (Eschede , n .d .) , because the engineers were concerning more about the interior facilities of the train .
According to them , the facilities of ICE trains are second to none .
Passengers could enjoy the radio , the newspaper as well as refreshment , including wonderful meals provided from the luxurious dinning car .
The design engineers were said to put so much effort into these trivial factors rather than the safety concern .
On the other hand , some people defend the engineers .
They believe that the engineers should not take the responsibilities and be blamed for the accident .
Germany adopted high speed trains and made some changes to them .
Soon , ICE were travelling across the whole Germany and were favored by passengers .
It is not wrong if the engineers decided to make the train more comfortable and attractive .
In fact , over the years ICE expanded throughout Germany , the safety record was perfect .
(NASA , 2007) What went wrong when the train accident happened would rather be the construction and the maintenance of the track and the bridge .
The maintenance of the track was poorly done , as well as the maintenance of the bridge .
They are unprotected by any form of crash barrier .
(Eschede , n .d .) If only the work had been done well , countless lives would have been saved .
Some people always claim that engineers tend to focus on component failures , but they lack the understanding of the breakdown of the whole system .
Moreover , they blame the design engineers for not coming up with the plans against system breakdown .
In other words , they did not take the safety issues into account when they were designing the train .
(Wilpert , 2007) However , some people argue , it is not fair to the engineers .
The train , ICE , did have adequate protection system as well as warning system .
Actually , the tragedy can be attributed to the flawed emergency operation procedures instead .
(NASA , 2007) Passengers would have pulled the emergency break to stop the train as soon as they witness the wheel failure .
This is the key reason why the accident was so serious .
In face , one passenger sensed something is wrong , and tried to remind the driver of the hazard .
The driver , nevertheless , chose to ignore the report until it was too late .
(NASA , 2007) One way and the best way to prevent the accident may be taking the appropriate safety precaution and applying correct methods to deal with the accident .
Many people believe that the use of heritage also contributed to the accident .
(NASA , 2007) The ICE engineers just followed whatever had already been designed , neglecting the current situation .
In addition , ICE was insufficiently tested before it was put into use .
However , it was not the case at all , according to others .
Technology at that time limited the designing of ICE , thus caused the design failure .
If high technology had been used , and sufficient testing was performed , the accident would have been avoided .
(Eschede , n .d .)
To conclude , the use of psychology during the design process is important .
The key factors to prevent the train accident from happening are safety precaution , the proper actions taken during the accident and the use of high technology .
For decades , people have been searching for better energy sources .
Nuclear power is always a controversial choice .
Although nuclear power is effective and efficient , it can be incredibly dangerous .
Now nuclear reactors come to their forth generation , including six different types of safety enhanced reactors .
The molten salt reactor is one of the generation IV reactors .
It uses fluoride salts as coolant and the uranium fuel is reacting in a liquid environment (Butler , 2004) .
The prospect of molten salt reactor is promising as its safety is enhanced within the reaction system as well as out of the system and it can profit in a long run .
Due to these reasons , it is worthy of supporting the research on the molten salt reactor .
Many people believe that nuclear power plant is dangerous as reaction cores have the potential to explode and fuels can release radioactivity which may be fatal to creatures .
People oppose research on nuclear power because they do not want to see the Chernobyl tragedy happening again .
However , for the molten salt reactor , this is definitely not a problem .
Compared to the old generation reactors which use light water as coolant , the molten salt cooled reactor operates at low pressure which prevents explosion caused by steam .
Due to the low pressure , a high-pressure steel vessel is not necessary for a molten salt reactor ("Molten salt reactor ," 2009) .
This makes the reactor smaller and lighter so that plant controlling and emergency handling will be easy .
In addition , the inert property of fluoride salts and the liquid reacting environment further prevent core explosion (Gat and Dodds , 2006) .
For radioactivity leakage , it is unlikely to happen in a molten salt reactor as the salts will freeze to prevent dispersal (Gat and Dodds , 2006) .
Moreover , the on-line reprocessing reduces fission products .
The long-term radioactive waste generated in a plant with reprocessing is a thousand times less than that in an ordinary plant ("Molten salt reactor ," 2009) .
In a word , the probability of major accidents is significantly reduced in a molten salt reactor .
Besides the major accidents , security in the reprocessing is another concern of opponents .
They worry that plutonium , which is the material used for producing nuclear weapons , can be stolen during reprocessing .
In fact , this problem can be solved and prevented .
In a molten salt reactor , plutonium is separated from nuclear waste and added back to the reactor as fuel .
This indicates that the separated plutonium will not be discarded but can be well monitored .
Besides , the amount of weapons-grade fission generated in the molten salt reactor is small ("Generation IV nuclear reactor ," 2009) .
Furthermore , scientists have been developing reprocessing technologies that maintain high proliferation resistance .
Currently , there are technologies like Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by Extraction (PUREX) , Uranium Extraction (UREX) and Mixed Oxide (MOX) .
The PUREX and the MOX both can handle the weapons-grade plutonium as the reactors-grade plutonium is hard to be stolen due to lethal radioactivity .
The UREX can ensure relatively high proliferation resistance which results in high radioactivity ("Nuclear reprocessing ," 2005) .
In France , the plant at La Hague deals with more than one thousand metric tons of spent nuclear fuel per year by adopting an improved version of the PUREX (Kingery , 2009) .
If there is more research being carried out , better outcomes can be achieved .
Lastly , opponents point out that reprocessing costs a lot of money and there is research demanding expenses too .
In fact , despite the fact that reprocessing and research cost too much money , the molten salt reactor is profitable in a long term and it is economy compared to other reactors .
Firstly , the molten salt reactor does not need the high-pressure steel vessel which is expensive .
There is no requirement for fuel fabrication .
All these can compensate part expense on the reprocessing and research .
Secondly , the molten salt reactor is highly effective and efficient .
With less fuels , it produces electricity and hydrogen four to six times greater than high temperature reactors do ("Generation IV nuclear reactor ," 2009) .
Thus it is worthy of investment .
With the demand for energy increasing , it is urgent to find an economy and efficient energy source .
Nuclear power is inevitably becoming one of the most important supplies .
As a generation IV reactor , the molten salt reactor has outstanding safety advantage in both reactor and reprocessing , and it is profitable in a long run .
Hence , it will be reasonable and wise to support the research .
As the developing countries build more factories and cities throughout the years , the global energies consumption is rapidly increasing over the years .
This is a concern as at the rate countries are consuming energies it is a matter of time before the earth run out of natural resources .
The alternative way to generate electricity is the use of nuclear technology according to Butler ,D .
Countries are spending large amount of money to develop the Generation IV reactors to meet the demand of energy consumptions .
There is a need for this development as currently nuclear reactors are not that safe and efficient .
The objectives of Generation IV reactors are to improve safety features , minimise waste output and to decrease the construction and operating cost of nuclear reactors .
The VHTR (Very High Temperature Reactor) and (MSR) Molten Salt reactor are Generation IV reactors currently under development .
Although there are many risk hazard involving the VHTR , it is still one of the most promising model , many countries are keen on adopting this model as the future reactor .
(Ogawa ,M .
and Lensa , W .V .)
One of the most practical issues concern is the cost .
Countries want to build reactors that are cheap in cost and that are efficient in producing electricity and hydrogen gases .
For the VHTR Model when compared to the MSR , the construction of the plant is costly and takes up a relatively large space .
The construction of the plant is costly as it requires materials that can withstand the extreme heat and corrosive operating condition of the reactor .
The molten salt is preferred as it operation system is less complicated which means that it is cheaper to construct and it does not need to run on very high temperature or pressure .
However , in term of the overall development cost , the Very High temperature Reactors is still much cheaper than the Molten Salt reactor .
The cost is 679 million dollars compared to the 1000 million required by the MSR (NERAC) .
This is so as the VHTR is simply the upgrading of existing high temperature reactors while the MSR is a relative new technology .
Hence VHTR need less testing and less time to develop whereas extensive testing is required for the MSR .
In term of efficiency , there is criticism regarding the high fuel burn up and the need to periodically change the graphite core .
The initial design of the VHTR also does not allow the system to produce electricity directly as modification are required to be make to the plant to achieve generation of electricity .
Whereas for the MSR it is considered a better choice as it is safer to operate at lower pressure and temperature .
The efficiency of the MSR will improves in the near future as scientists are working to increase the output of hydrogen and electricity (NERAC) .
Despite the negative points of the VHTR , it is still way ahead of the MSR and all other generation IV models , only VHR has an efficiency of more than fifty percent .
Not only it produces more electricity , the high temperature generated is actually not useless .
The extreme heat produced can be used for heat application process such as the petrochemical industries (Billot ,P .
and Barbier , D) .
The final issue brought up by people opposing the usage of VHTR is related to the safety aspect of the system .
This is due to the fact that the VHTR runs on very high temperature and it will have a higher chance of failure of parts due to creep .
The isolation of the reactor when failure occurs is another issue being widely debated .
For VHTR the safety features are manned manually by safety officers and it is not as reliable as human will make mistake .
Then for the MSR about 200 million dollars were spent on safety testing .
Since the safety of the system is tested intensively , it is unforgivable if failure occurs .
Although the safety aspect is being widely debated , the safety feature of VHTR is improving with time (INL) .
In conclusion , the VHTR is still one of the better choices when compared to the MSR .
This is so as it will be ready in the year 2025 , five years earlier than the MSR .
With the operation of the VHTR five years ahead , the revenue generate by the VHR will provide more funds for further research and improvement .
Then in term of efficiency it is ahead of the MSR and there is no guarantee that after intensive research the efficiency will improve .
Hence VHTR has the potential to be the main provider of electricity of the future .
With the fast development of high-technology , more energy is needed both for industrial use and for home use .
Nuclear energy as a more efficient method to produce electricity attracts many scientists' attention .
In 2000 , The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) , an international collective representing government of 13 countries , was initiated .
Scientists from these countries cooperate to get the development of the next generation of nuclear technology , the Generation IV Nuclear Reactor (World Nuclear Association , 2008) .
Six concepts are put forward .
William Magwood (2004) , chairman of GIF's board , predicts that no more than three of these six concepts will become research prototypes and be put into practice .
In my point of view , among all the six reactors , the Sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) is the one should be chosen as one of the prototypes .
The generation IV SFR is a new concept which is safe not only when it operates for electric producing , but also when it meets the problem of nuclear weapons and the terrorism attack .
Moreover , by now the research on reducing the cost of this reactor has received significant achievement and the research is still undergoing .
Scientists are still looking forward to more research findings in the coming years .
Many people think that comparing with traditional ways of producing electricity , using nuclear reactor is not safe .
In fact , the SFR is a very safe nuclear reactor operating under low pressure , at low temperature as well .
The operating temperature of the SFR ranges from 500 to 550 , one of the two reactors with the lowest temperature among all the six together with Supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
Moreover the sodium-cooled technique was started to use since the year 1951 .
"It builds on more than 300 reactor-years experienced with sodium-cooled fast neutron reactors over five decades and in eight countries (World nuclear association , 2008)" .
Scientists from Japan also concerned about the chemical reaction between sodium and water .
They add double-wall piping to their Japanese sodium-cooled fast reactor (JSFR) to improve the security of the reactor .
Nuclear weapon and terrorism are always sensitive topics to both government and ordinary people .
Because the waste of the nuclear reactor can be used by terrorists to produce nuclear weapons , many people doubt whether it can provide true safety if scientists can only promise that the reactor is safe during the operation .
However , this is not a problem for SRF .
New design for SRF is likely to have all the neutron action in the core .
That is to say "the new processing technologies will enable the fuel to be recycled without separating the plutonium (World Nuclear Association , 2008)" .
In this case , the waste will all be recycled in the reactor and terrorists will not get a chance to reach the nuclear raw materials .
Closing the nuclear fuel cycle through the use of advanced reprocessing and fast reactor technologies is a good way to improve the security of the reactor and avoid duplication of effort at the same time .
Opponents say that comparing with the other five generation IV reactors , the cost of the SFR is relatively high .
Yes , this is a drawback of the SFR; however , scientists are working hard on it to find out the way to reduce the capital cost of the SFR and they have already received some achievements .
On November 27-28 , 2006 , Mr . Kazuo Mukai , from the Advanced Nuclear System Research and Development Directorate Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) , had an international seminar on "Coolants and Innovative Reactor Technologies" in Cadarache which is a research center for nuclear energy in France .
In this seminar he talked about the JSFR and the achievements Japanese scientists got to reduce the cost of the SFR .
Kazuo (2006) said that by adopting high chromium steel with higher strength and lower thermal expansion , the capacity of the heat exchangers and the heat exchangers and the flow rate in the pipe got enlarged , so that the piping could be shortened and the loop number also got reduced .
In this way , the capital cost of the SFR was reduced .
This is just an example of the received achievements .
The research is still undergoing and scientists have confidence that they will have more findings in the future .
According to The U .S . Department of Energy (DOE) , the sodium-cooled fast reactor technology is one of the most advanced nuclear technologies being researched to date and could potentially be used as an advanced recycling reactor ("U .S . , France" , 2008) .
With the participation of the experts from 13 countries , more achievements will be received during the next decade .
The advanced technology of the SFR will benefit people all around the world in the not far future .
The Chernobyl disaster was one of the worst engineering accidents ever happened in history .
Not many people died that day but thousands of people were exposed to radiation that caused them to suffer severe health problems (BBC News , 2000) .
Unfortunately , the cause of this incident was found to be unnecessary mistakes made by the nuclear plant operators .
People usually say that mistakes are inevitable and nuclear is in fact extremely dangerous so that working with it will always involve a high chance of accidents .
However , there are ways to reduce the possibility of this human-caused accident .
Including psychological factors consideration during the design process is found to be one of the ways to improve safety which might have prevented the Chernobyl incident .
Opponents claim that as a human being , we make mistakes and it cannot be avoided .
I agree to the point that human can make mistakes .
However , it does not mean that mistakes cannot be avoided .
This includes the mistakes made by the Chernobyl nuclear plant operators .
They did not request to maintain the power which caused it to run down rapidly until it was below the permitted safety level (Onisawa and Nishiwaki , 1988) .
This mistake was actually unnecessary since this was not their first time doing the safety test .
The problem lies on the behavior of the plant operators .
They took light of their task since for them this was just another safety test .
They did not have any sense of responsibility and were not aware of the consequences if anything went wrong .
Therefore , during the design process , these plant operators are supposed to be 'designed' as well .
They should be given the required knowledge and should also be warned about the worst thing that may happen if they make even a simple mistake .
In this way , they will be more careful in doing their task and as a result able to avoid making mistakes .
Opponents also state that nuclear power is indeed dangerous for that reason , it is impossible not to have accident while working with it .
Accident is a situation when there is a failure in the interaction between man and machine (Stoop , 1995) .
Therefore , even though nuclear power is certainly dangerous , it can still be safe to work with as long as the interaction between man and machine is designed carefully so that it will not fail .
Again , this shows the importance of considering psychological factors in design process .
Most of the times , while designing a system , engineers are likely to overestimate the ability of the user (Wilpert , 2007) .
As a result , most users are not able to properly use the equipments .
In the case of Chernobyl , the plant operators failed to make the right decision which then caused the reactor to explode .
Instead of following the safety procedure , the plant operators even blocked the reactor's protection system (making it impossible for automatic shut down) in order to keep the test running (Onisawa and Nishiwaki , 1988) .
If the plant operators were familiar with the system and the procedure , they would have known which one was more important and would definitely have prioritized safety rather than keeping the test running .
Thus , in designing a system engineers alone are not enough .
The final argument proposed by the opponents is that psychologists are also humans who can make mistakes just like engineers .
Hence , even with their help mistakes are still inevitable .
The point of involving psychologists in the design process is not because they are better than engineers .
It is rather to balance the engineers' point of view which is usually machine-centered .
Since man and machines are equally important to achieve safety in design , psychologists' role is to concern about the human resources which are usually neglected by engineers .
If both machines and man are well designed , safety will definitely improve and the possibility of accidents will be reduced .
In conclusion , carefully designing a system's safety is useless unless psychological factors are also considered .
Without considering psychological factors , there is a big possibility that there will be a bad interaction between man and machine which will then results in an accident such as Chernobyl's .
Therefore , psychological factors play an important role in reducing the possibility of accident as well as improving the system's safety .
The world has been searching for different sources of energy to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels .
In some countries , they have turned to nuclear power .
Despite producing less carbon footprints , nuclear power is a relatively dangerous source of energy .
One unmistakable example is the 1986 Chernobyl disaster .
Some psychologists have wondered whether the use of psychology in the design process would have prevented the accident .
While opponents reasoned that there is no distinctive link between psychology and engineering design process , the use of psychology could theoretically have prevented the accident through its intervention in the controls and the safety mechanisms design .
Also , use of psychology could counter the underestimation of the number of errors that will form inevitably .
Opponents argue that the use of psychology would not be useful as the chief cause for the accident is the lack of knowledge of the operators .
According to Rich(1986) , the accident was the fault of not complying with strict operating regulations governed by the reactor designers .
However , one way of how psychology could have averted the accident is that the designers could have anticipated that the operators might not understand the physics behind the reactor .
They might have been trained to operate but do not understand the principles behind it .
The design could have incorporated automated controls to reduce the number of errors that could be made .
Leptak(2009) suggests that to maintain a safe operation , there should be fewer autonomous control and more 'redundant automated safety interlocks' .
This is to prohibit safety controls from being bypassed .
This could prove to be an essential part of the design as Stellman(1998) provides evidence that the chief engineer involved actually approved the shutting down of the Emergency Cooling System .
This move compromised the safety of the plant .
Thus , psychology could have indeed changed the reactor plant to a vastly safer environment .

On the other hand , other opponents blame the heavy politico-military factors attached to the Chernobyl reactors .
In Chernobyl(2006) , the writer points out that the reactors were designed and adapted for the production of plutonium for military businesses .
This dual function could have compromised safety of the reactor .
Psychology or the employment of psychologists to assist the design process would thus be futile .
However , this may not be the case .
Psychology understands that almost every action has a causal history which leads up to the root of the problem .
This concept is evident when accounts of the accident reviewed that the operator indifferently disregarded safety protocols .
In fact , Stang(1996) notes that running the reactors at low operating standards was commonplace .
Hence , designers could have could have brought in psychologists to evaluate the design to inhibit such unauthorized practices and to ensure the safety standards are kept high .
In short , the use of psychology could have been used to uphold the safety of the reactors and hence might have prevented the accident .
In contrast , other opponents may argue that the design process is beyond the domain of psychologists .
Instead , only the designer and the engineers have the expertise to partake in the design process .
However , this perception could be wrong as designers make human errors .
Psychology could be used to minimize these errors .
According to Wilpert(2007) , the design process encompasses both social science and the engineering .
In Reason(2000)'s article , he notices a distinctive element that separates high reliability organizations from others .
This element is the consensual agreement that errors can occur anywhere and every stage in should be treated meticulously .
Stang and Liptak have deduced that the designers involved in the Chernobyl reactor did not understand certain aspects of the reactor .
This implies that the design was not given scrupulous care .
Therefore , psychology could be used in the design process and perhaps have minimized the possibilities of accidents .
To sum up , use of psychology could have been used in some phases of the design process .
Psychology could have helped in automating several safety controls , improving safety and enhancing the reliability of the reactor design .
Though the use of psychology could have aided the design process in these three areas , whether the use of psychology would have prevented the accident is really hard to say .
Many factors contribute to the accident .
However , current reactor designers should take the Chernobyl accident as a valuable lesson and do their utmost efforts to prevent such painful and costly incidents from happening again .

Since the introduction of nuclear-powered generators , public opposition was one of the reasons why only limited nuclear reactors have been built in the past .
The public is against the idea of constructing nuclear reactors because they are concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Their concern arose because of a few incidents that have happened in the past which includes a partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and also the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , which the reactor core exploded and caused the death of 31 people and spewed radioactive debris across Europe (Butler , 2004) .
However , I believe that previews of the nuclear reactors should not influence the decision to fund the research and development of the generation IV reactors as people will be more careful not to let the same incidents happen again with the advancement in technology .
Therefore , I feel that generation IV reactors such as the Supercritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) should be funded for their research and development .
Nevertheless , the first reason that the public is concerned over the funding of generation IV nuclear reactors is that the nuclear reactors will not reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions as compared to natural gas and oil use (Nature , 2008) .
However , this is not the case as there are countries constructing nuclear reactors because it can indeed improve the environment .
For example , reducing greenhouse-gas emissions is the main reason for the endorsement of the construction of nuclear reactors by the UK government (Nature , 2008) .
Furthermore , according to Butler (2004) , the SCWR does not emit carbon dioxide , which is a greenhouse-gas that is soaring because of natural gas and oil generated power plants .
Therefore , such generation IV reactors will certainly improve the environment and should be funded for their research and development .

Another concern from the public opposition is that nuclear reactors should not be used in medical research because they pose a danger to the people using nuclear power for their medical researches .
According to Ruth (2009) , medical isotopes used in the cancer research can be supplied using accelerators instead of nuclear reactors as it is a safer and cheaper method .
However , nuclear reactors should continue to be used to supply the medical isotopes as it can produce the isotopes much faster than the accelerators .
Furthermore , the idea of accelerators to supply the medical isotopes has still not been put to practical use as it still requires further research and development unlike the nuclear reactors , which is already vastly used in medical researches .
This can be shown as many researchers were lamenting on the shutdown of the nuclear reactor located in chalk river , Ontario , and their medical research has to be put to a halt (Nature , 2008) .
Therefore , generation IV reactors will be more stable to maintain the medical research process and should be funded for their research and development .
The last concern from the public opposition is that nuclear reactors are not safe enough to be built as they are under-designed for earthquakes as the earthquake in Japan killed at least 9 , injured 1000 and caused the evacuation of further 10 ,000 people and sparked a fire and caused radiation- contaminated water from the nuclear reactor to spill into the sea (Nature , 2007) .
However , damages done from an earthquake on a nuclear reactor is inevitable no matter how well a building is designed and such damages done are already considered very minimal even though the nuclear reactor in Japan was under-designed to deal with an earthquake of magnitude 6 .8 .
Furthermore , due to technology advancement , the new generation IV reactors are designed to deal with an earthquake of magnitude 8 .0 (Nature , 2007) .
Therefore , the concern of the public opposition over nuclear reactors which are under-designed for earthquakes is unnecessary because the generation IV reactors are strong enough to handle tough conditions already .
To wrap up , I believe that the new generation IV reactors such as SCWR is nothing like their previous generation of nuclear reactors because technology is constantly improving each day to make the nuclear reactors safer to be built .
Thus , the public opposition should look at the new generation IV reactors in a different light and not just based on some of the incidents that had happened in the past .

Computers , television sets and air-conditioners , all these household appliances require electricity to work .
In most countries , fossil fuel power plants are the main generators of electricity .
However , fossil fuels are not a renewable source of energy and will be depleted one day .
Furthermore , according to the recent energy outlook , energy demands in the United States are expected to grow by 0 .5% per year (EIA 2009) .
Governments are well aware of this and have been looking at alternative sources of energy such as solar , wind and particularly , nuclear energy .
However , nuclear power plants pose a danger to the surrounding as a target of terrorists and in the event of a nuclear accident .
Nevertheless , with the new generation IV reactors , especially the sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) which will be the first generation IV reactor to be completed and more efficient in the usage of the nuclear fuel , nuclear energy will definitely be one of the main sources of energy in the future .
There is no denying that nuclear energy is a dangerous source of energy and an example is the Chernobyl accident in 1986 .
It was caused by an error during a safety test and resulted in over 4 ,000 deaths and many more may die due to the radiation from the accident (Nature 2006) .
In recent years , there are also fears that nuclear reactors may be the targets of terrorist attacks .
As a result , the public has been reluctant about the use of nuclear power as a source of energy .
Nonetheless , there are still over 400 nuclear reactors around the world which make up for 17% of the world's electrical consummation (Butler , 2004) .
All of which have improved safety precautions and higher security levels to ensure the safety of the public .
In addition , the new SFR will be equipped with better coolant system to prevent a reactor meltdown and stronger containment structures to guard against terrorist attacks (Smith , 2009) .

Out of the six generation IV reactors , SFR is expected to be the first reactor to be developed .
Therefore , we can tap on the use of safer nuclear energy earlier .
This is mainly thanks to the fact that sodium-cooled reactors are already in operation in Japan and Russia (US DOE NERAC/GIF 2002) .
Thus , less research will be required for the SFR , which also means that the research cost will be reduced .
Furthermore , by choosing the SFR's proven method of cooling the nuclear core , it removes the uncertainties of using new and untested technology which are present in the other reactors .
The SFR is also chosen by the United States as their front runner for generation IV fast reactors due to its strong technology basis (US DOE/NE 2006) .
On top of its technological readiness , the SFR is designed for high efficiency as well .
It recycles nuclear fuel through a process whereby a group of chemical elements called actinides is produced .
Plutonium is also included in this group and it can be used for production of nuclear weapons .
Therefore , to ensure the nuclear non-proliferation , the SFR is designed such that the plutonium cannot be extracted from the nuclear core .
Furthermore , 99 .9% of the actinides will be recycled again .
The SFR will also be using spent thermal reactor fuel from other older nuclear reactors as its initial fuel (US DOE NERAC/GIF 2002) .
All these designs will lead to a more efficient usage of the nuclear fuel and it also helps solve the current problem of the disposal of nuclear wastes .
The truth is , we will one day run out of fossil fuels , hence , we must plan ahead and look for other sources of energy .
And despite its risks , nuclear energy has its significant benefits as well .
Nuclear power plants maybe hazardous , but the new SFR boosts many new safeguards .
It also allows us to utilize more capable generation IV reactors sooner and helps reduce the amount of nuclear wastes .
Therefore , governments should continue to fund these nuclear research projects so as to ensure that we can continue with our way of life even after our fossil fuels run out .

Nuclear Power has been a controversial issue ever since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II .
Over the years , Nuclear power has evolved with the help of technological advancement .
Today , scientists have gone a further step in developing what we know as the Fourth Generation Reactors .
Out of the six new reactors , Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is the most favorable .
It is known for being more environmental friendly and less hazardous .
Nuclear power is encompassed by four main factors .
These factors are economic benefits , security , safety and effects on the environment .
Firstly , the cost of operating and starting cost of a VHTR is truly subjective .
Some may feel that the costs are too high .
According to a survey done by researchers from the Keystone Center , the cost of building a new reactor varied from $3600 to $4600 per installed kW and the operating cost would be about 30 cents per kWh (Benjamin , 2008) .
Naturally , The public would have an impression that VHTR would be much more expensive , comparatively to renewable energy such as solar and wind .
However , this is not the case .
VHTR will be cheaper as cost incurred on transportation of nuclear waste is redundant .
This is because the nuclear waste goes directly to a respiratory which is located within the nuclear plant (Clayton 2009) .
Furthermore , VHTR produces cheaper energy compared to solar and wind energy .
Barry (2009) cites that the capital cost of building a solar plant is 25 times more than nuclear plant and the land area solar plant occupies is 400 times more than nuclear plant .
With cheaper energy , more people are able to afford electricity .
Countries going through industrialization will also benefit from the cheap energy .
In addition , building of VHTR will boost the economy as it creates job opportunities in the areas surrounding the power plant .
Secondly , ever since the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 , the world has heightened global security against terrorism .
Nuclear plants have become prime targets of terrorists .
This is because the plutonium waste that the nuclear reactor produces are ingredients for making nuclear weapons .
Hence , security of nuclear plants is strengthened as well to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons .
If nuclear weapons were to fall in the hands of terrorists , it would pose a great threat to the safety of the public .
However in VHTR , plutonium are spiked with heat producing and radioactive elements (Butler , 2004) .
These elements cause the plutonium waste to increase in temperature such that it is too hot to handle and therefore prevent anyone from stealing them .
Hence , the public does not need to worry about nuclear waste falling in the hands of the terrorists .
Thirdly , safety of the employees working at the nuclear plant and the residents near the plant has to be taken into consideration .
The VHTR is actually an evolution from the present High Temperature-grouped reactor (HTGR) .
In the VHTR , heat resistant materials are used to build the nuclear reactor so that the heat is carefully contained .
Moreover , the heat produced during the processing of uranium is used for hydrogen production and desalinization (Very High Temperature Reactor , n .d .) .
Also radioactive leakage is prevented with the use of corrosion resistant materials .
For example , helium is used as a cooling agent in VHTR as helium is an inert gas and does not provide and hazardous effect .
Finally , as global warming becomes more perilous , governments and several communities are placing greater emphasis on being environmental friendly .
The main environmental concern is the disposal of radioactive wastes .
It is known that these radioactive wastes have very long live shelf and will not decay until a few hundred years later .
Most importantly , the radioactive emission is harmful to human body .
However , in VHTR , an additional processing step is taken to shorten the live span of the wastes and these wastes are carefully contained .
In addition , VHTR produces less nuclear wastes .
This means that there will be minimal chance of weapon proliferation and reduced pollution to the environment .
Compared to other solar plants , nuclear plants actually produce less carbon dioxide .
Barry (2009) writes that solar plants produce 25times more carbon dioxide than nuclear plants .
In conclusion , VHTR is much safer , more environmental friendly , more efficient and is much cheaper .
Hence , we should abandon those pessimistic views on nuclear power and embrace this new source of power .
Nuclear energy has been a hot topic since several decades age .
It is clear and powerful .
As Declan Butler (2004) said that nuclear energy is not a source of carbon dioxide , and with the emissions of the green-house gas now soaring , and the energy demands predicted to double by 2050 , the nuclear option is a finding its way back onto the table .
Besides , nuclear reactors are great power output of electricity and hydrogen .
However , some opposing controversies appear .
Some people hold the opinions that nuclear energy is very dangerous and building nuclear plants requires a large amount of money , etc .
Nevertheless , at present , there is a safe nuclear reactor which is called sodium-cooled fast reactor .
Because of its safety , no waste and powerful output , I support further research and development funding for it .
Some pacifists are sceptical about the safety of nuclear energy also because that reprocessing nuclear waste is controversial as it separates out plutonium , a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons .
Besides , they are worried about that nuclear reactors would become a terrorist target because of the radioactive waste .
Nevertheless , these terrible things won't happen in sodium-cooled fast reactors , because the reaction is within the core and the recycling is closed which means the recycling is not separated out .
As a result , the percentage of plutonium in the waste is reduced effectively .
Besides , the reprocessing can cut the final amount of waste produced .
Moreover , the systems based on mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel are primarily under development in Japan , and their preferred recycle option is an advanced aqueous process; and metal-fuel cycle systems are under development in the United States which use a pyroprocessing recycle as the preferred fuel cycle option .
As a consequence , people do not need to worry about the radioactive waste during the producing .
Except the problem of the safety , the second one is the cost .
The cost of nuclear reactors which consists of the construction cost , operating cost and decommissioning cost are very high .
It is the fact that several billion dollars is needed to get a nuclear reactor going and the sodium-cooled fast reactors are even more expensive than other ones .
However , in order to make the nuclear energy more powerful and safer , the money spent is worthy .
Seen the value of the sodium-cooled fast reactors , many countries are investing in the sodium-cooled fast reactors .
Meanwhile , many engineers are looking for the methods to cut the cost of nuclear reactors .
New plants are designed to be much simpler and quicker to build , reducing financing costs by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars .
In details , the cost can be reduced by reducing the refuelling outages' number , compacting the reactor vessel , sampling the vessel internals , reducing the loop number , shortening the pipes , integrating the primary components and so on .
Thus , we should believe in the bright future of the reducing of the sodium-cooled fast reactors' cost .
Nuclear energy , the most powerful energy in the world , will attract more and more research and develop further and further .
As one of the fourth generation of nuclear reactors , sodium-cooled fast reactor has its own advantages .
It has more factors of safety and it is now under further improvement in many developed countries .
Briefly , sodium-cooled fast reactors are with brilliant prospects and the public do not need to be much concerned about its safety .
Nuclear power plants across the globe are producing about 16 percent of the world's electricity .
However , no nuclear reactors have been built for the past 30 years .
This was partly due to the 1979 incident at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania where a partial reactor meltdown and the reactor core exploding in 1986 at Chernobyl in Ukraine which resulted in casualties and spewing harmful debris across Europe (Butler , 2004) .
This was the result of inadequately trained personnel operating a flawed reactor design without proper regard for safety .
However , the fourth generation nuclear reactors can broaden the opportunities of nuclear energy for use .
Also , the new reactors are designed with the following objectives in mind; economic competitiveness , enhanced safety , minimal radioactive waste generation and proliferation resistance .
In particular , the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) are outstanding in safety , cost and performance; but the SFR has more benefits than the VHTR .
SFR uses liquid sodium as coolant to lower coolant volume fractionre outlet temperature to approximately 600 C (Roglans , et al 2002) .
As for VHTR , it produces both electricity and hydrogen from only heat and water by applying the steam reformer technology .
This way , temperature at the core outlet temperatures can reach more than 1000 C (Corwin , 2003) .
So , this design is significantly more thermally efficient as its reactor core is able to withstand higher temperature (VHTR's 1000 C to SFR's 600 C) .
It can be therefore be used as a significant source of electrical power and hydrogen generation or as a heat source .
Furthermore , helium is used as the coolant in the VHTR system .
Not only is it advantageous to sodium because it can be subjected to high temperature , it is also efficient in transfer of thermal energy .
Helium will not become radioactive and will not react with other materials .
Therefore in my opinion , VHTR is rated better only in terms of physical protection and performance as compared to SFR .
Safety is another major concern about nuclear power .
The main safety concern has always been the possibility of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material , leading to contamination and consequent radiation exposure off-site (Lacy , 2009) .
Active and passive safeguards features against accidents are to be carefully considered .
To reduce the probability of radioactive elements leaking to the atmosphere or damage to the plants , there must be an emphasis on the human factors pertaining to plant operations .
VHTR employ the method of burying waste into the floor bed of deep oceans in the middle of inactive oceanic tectonic plates .
However , geologists and biologists have expressed concern .
They do not believe this idea of seabed disposal will work .
Even with deep trenches used , it is possible that life forms living in it would bring back the still harmful nuclear waste back into contact with other life forms .
Also , it might be very difficult to safely recover the waste once it has been placed in the seabed .
As this is not the case for SFR , it is rated higher in terms of waste disposal .
SFR is designed for management of high-level wastes .
The systems increase performance requirements by employing a fully closed fuel cycle to reduce repository space (Lineberry , et al) .
This is considered a very effective actinide management strategy .
Next , the cost of new reactors must be competitive in a changing market place of energy demand .
Nuclear energy has to be economically comparable to other energy sources in order for it to be a competitive energy source .
Nuclear energy plants need to be modular or with standardized technical specifications so that plant parts can be duplicated and replaced .
This would be more economical than if each plant is uniquely designed .
As is the case for both the reactor and the fuel cycle , technology development to achieve cost competitiveness is necessary .
A key issue on the SFR system is reduction of cost to competitive levels .
None of the SFRs constructed to date have been economical to build or operate (Lineberry , et al) .
With innovations to reduce capital cost , it can extend to electricity production , given the proven capability of sodium reactors to utilize almost all of the energy in the natural uranium .
In this way , SFR can competitively serve markets for electricity .
In conclusion , plant design should be streamlined for technically sound , robust , passively safe , and low-cost production .
Despite challenges within steps of the nuclear fuel cycle that do exist , it can be solved with improvements in technology and with global cooperation .
Although the advantages of VHTR are the high fuel burn up , SFR performs better in area such as having low maintenance and operating cost , passive safety and potential modular construction .
The tradeoff of increased capital cost against cycle efficiency , VHTR must overcome these challenges , particularly in reactor safety and costs in order to be comparable with SFR system .
In 1986 , the world's worst nuclear accident Chernobyl took place in Ukraine .
The explosion of the Unit 4 reactor core had spread radioactivity across many areas , claiming lives of some 50 emergency workers and leaving health problems , such as thyroid cancer , and psychological trauma on over 5 million people .
(ElBaradei , 2005) Critics have found out that mechanical errors such as the building of Unit 4 was not up to its highest standards and that some of its safety devices were faulty; while the human management of the whole plant was questionable .
(North , 2006) This , therefore , boils down to the question as to whether the use of psychology , both in technical and human terms , during the design process of the reactor would have prevented this accident .
In any design process , the use of psychology covers the areas of safety , usability , functionality and requisite user competencies .
(Wilpert , 2007) Thus , if psychology were to be used in the design process of the Chernobyl reactor , it would have considered the possible technical failures and had used different materials for the construction , such that the radioactivity of the nuclear explosion would have been kept within the plant .
However , in the 1986 Europe , the level of technology and knowledge available was limited and the understanding of the use of psychology was constrained .
This resulted in flaws of the construction in its cooling system and containment structure of the plant itself , leading to the escapade of the harmful radiation into the environment when everything collapsed .

Disregarding ergonomics design principles: Chernobyl .

Introducing psychology in the design process can foresee the possible human errors , such as the operators' incompetent mental state of mind during the operation of the plant .
Safety measures , for example installing auto power shut-off for the reactors in the event of an accident or overlook , would have been taken to assist the operators should any human error occurs .
Having said that , the use of psychology during the process is done on the basis of an ideal situation , where the human labour is of the highly skilled and high capabilities .
However , psychology during the design process fails to consider the lack of appropriate skills and training of the labour employed during the time of operation .
For the case of Chernobyl , the designers admitted that they had not taken into account the possible user-machine interactions , thus leaving this area undetermined .
(Munipov , ND)
Critics have brought out the point that the explosion of Unit 4 was due to the poor management of the whole plant , from the failure to follow certain safety standards , to the design flaws of the reactor and structure to the incompetency of the labour .
(BBCNews .com , 2000) Even if psychology were to be used in the design process of the Chernobyl plant , it would still have overlooked the national culture and working style then .
In the old Soviet Union , the people were taught to be obedient and politically correct .
There were hardly rebuttals from the lower ranks to the senior management even if the former had found anything amiss with the machines or operating procedures .
(North , 2006) Furthermore , the state was practicing the policy of secrecy for 35 years , such that only certain information on safety standards were made known and approved , while the design flaws were always hidden from the light .
(Munipov , ND) Psychology is the study of the mind and if included in the design process , it would be seen from the user's perspective and thus , coming up with an effective design for the end product .
The use of psychology during design process would have minimize the effects of the accident , but would not have prevented it from happening because accidents happen due to the combination of errors on multiple levels , such as the context of time and national culture .
The Chernobyl accident was inevitable due to the various faults made in the different levels of the management of the plant and political factors , and this accident did provide an important lesson for both the human engineering and nuclear power world .

Title: Could the use of Psychology as described in "Psychology and Design Processes" during the design process have prevented the collapse of Nicoll Highway ?
On the 20 April 2004 at about 3 .30pm in the afternoon , a major construction incidence occurs in Singapore , the collapse of Nicoll Highway .
This caused soil subsidence of the immediate surrounding area which resulted in substantial damages on the Nicoll Highway carriageway .
This incidence had also resulted in 4 fatalities and 3 casualties .
The incidence is mainly due to the collapse of a deep excavation work alongside Nicoll Highway .
The main contractor for these works is Nishimatsu-Lum Chang Joint Venture and the client for this Circle Line project is the Land Transport Authority of Singapore (LTA) .
What could have caused this incidence ?
And who should be responsible for it ?
According to the committee of inquiry (Press Release 2005 , Ministry of Manpower) , it was concluded that the incidence was due to inadequate temporary works and design construction errors .
Very often , such mistakes are always link to the negligence and carelessness of human .
Psychological factors play an importance role in the root of this incidence .
It was reported (New Civil Engineer May 2005) that the main contractor , Nishimatsu-Lum Chang used an inappropriate soil analysis model in the early stages of the temporary work design on the highly plastic marine clays area .
The use of such model then leads to serious false predictions of forces and hence undersign in the temporary work which resulted in the fatal catastrophe .
The consequences were due to the carelessness of the engineers then .
According to Land Transport Authority's counsel K- Shanmugam (2005) , he stated that Nishimatsu-Lum Chang maintained that designs were satisfactory even after discovery of minor designs faults and pressure LTA to allow them to continue their excavation activities .
It was observed that the main contractors wanted to avoid troubles and further expenses for rectifications of minor faults , and hence resulted in the negligence .
The committee inquiry (press Release 2005 , Ministry of Manpower) stated that Nicoll Highway collapse was initiated by the failure of the strut- waler support system for the excavation .
However , the committee also highlighted that there were deficiencies in the project management that perpetuated and aggravated the design errors .
Psychological factors in the design processes such as negligence , impatience and carelessness leads to inadequate instrumentation and monitoring works , improper handling of the instrumentation data .
From the analysis of major accidents , we learnt that human's actions always plays a major role in triggering accidents as well as mitigating their consequences .
B . Wilpert (Psychology and Design Processes) .
According to the Committee , it was also discovered that there was a lack of competency of persons carrying out specialized work which resulted in the incapacity of the project management team and supervisory personnel to identify adverse trends in the construction process and implement corrective measures .
The committee of inquiry for the incidence had also pointed out that the temporary works pertaining to deep excavation were not regulated to the same degree as permanent works .
Many of the considerations in the aspect of safety were more leniently treated as compared to those required for permanent works .
As such , the designs of diaphragm walls were not strong enough to support the deep excavation and hence failures occurred .
The lower standards often lead designers to underestimate in their design .
They tend to have a psychological effects of letting down their guards in the designs where the standards are not as strict and often lead to carelessness , negligence and eventually accident .
The Nicoll Highway collapse was caused by the failure of the overloaded temporary structure connection on the level 9 strut-waler .
This resulted in the death of 4 workers .
There are three main reasons for this incident cutting cost on the temporary structure , the lack of concentration at work and negligence in checking the design of the structure due to its temporary identity .
Catastrophic incidents always take a series of mistakes to happen where human errors usually play a main part (B .Wilpert , 2007) .
Thus , the problem lies in whether psychology is important to fuse into the design process .
One of the major reasons for the temporary structure to collapse is the use of a cheaper material which made the structure unable to withstand the capacity to cater for the loads .
Erroneous individual action is crucial link in this chain .
In order to avoid the delay penalty of S$25M , Nishimatsu-Lum Chang(NLC) , the contractor company for constructing Mass Rapid Transport under Nicoll Highway , did not seek their client Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s for approval on replacement of material .
With the intention to complete the project on time , NLC replaced lower- priced material to build the remaining temporary structure when the original raw material had depleted .
Dysfunctional relations with the other organizational party created this problem .
If both NLC and LTA can communicate and negotiate efficiently by extending the deadline , NLC may not resort to risk compromising safety for fines .
In this case , this incident might not have happened .

Workers are required to work overtime to ensure timely completion of the project .
Although the standard legal law sets by Employment Act states that each employee can only work 44 hours per week (Foreign , 2003) , NLC did not oblige to the law .
Therefore , it is necessary to forbid the company from making the workers to work overtime .
Excessive overtime causes them to lose concentration and eventually wear out .
As a result , workers tend to pay less attention to the details and surroundings and are more incline to erroneous action which , in this case posed great dangers .
If anyone is alert , there will have enough time to evacuate everybody from the site before it actually collapsed since it took 1 hour for the first failure of the connection to the total collapse of the excavation (Design , 2005) , the incident might not have happened .
There was no law stating safety rule for temporary structure in 2004 , thus it was not significant to make the temporary structure a very well-built one .
Problems arise where individual organismic perspectives come to play a part .
Assumption has always been made when personnel are doing the 'assuring' job .
In addition with inadequate work team activities make the design process worse .
First , the LTA personnel thought that the contractors 'will' do a good job on designing the structure and do the calculations to ensure it is acceptable and 'assume' that the contractors already did the proper checking for the design .
Assumptions are made in between both parties .
As a result , they missed out 2 mistakes that can be easily spotted .
First mistake is the contractors used the wrong soil analysis at the early stages of the design process .
Second mistake is the contractors miscalculated the capacity of the loads for the temporary structure .
Moreover , when NLC's engineer brought out an alternative analysis models , LTA's engineer rejected because he/she thought that it was overcautious .
Second , the LTA's personnel , due to slothfulness , did not do his/her job on ensuring the safety of building works by performing checks on construction work .
Currently , there already has a set of Safety Control Process (Seetoh Hon Hoy , 2005) for temporary structure to prevent this from happening again .
Even though this incident looks like a system or technical problem , it all boils down to human faults .
Humans are responsible for designing the system , creating and enforcing laws , rules and regulations and regrettably , making mistakes during work .
By having certain degree of psychology knowledge , we are able to understand human weaknesses so that design processes can incorporate with technical knowledge to improve the system .
This can greatly reduce human errors made during work which may able to lessen accidents from happening .

"Times are exciting for nuclear ," says Ronaldo Szilard , director of nuclear science and engineering at the Idaho National Lab , a part of the U .S . Energy Department (Smith , 2009) .
Nuclear power , a breakthrough discovery that was celebrated at the end of nineteenth century , is ironically feared as a tool of destruction today .
Acting like a double edged sword , scientists hailed it as the wonder that can solve current energy crisis while critics believed incidents such as 1986 Chernobyl accidents in Ukraine and 1976 Three Mile Islands reactors meltdown may occur again .
However , due to worldwide soaring increase in carbon emission , a series of new generation IV nuclear generators concepts were proposed .
Lead cooled fast reactor (LFR) was presented as one of them .
Among the six proposed generation IV reactors , three of them belonged to fast reactors .
So what are fast reactors ?
Fast reactors utilized neutrons of much higher energy to cause fission , which differs to present types of reactors that slowed down neutrons using moderator such as water .
LFR is a type of fast reactors that relied on lead as coolant in the reactor .
The ability of it to provide reliable safety , efficient waste management and effective cost minimization enabled itself to have a competitive edge over other energy sources .
Skeptics believed that if nuclear energy replaces oil to further increase its current 21percent contribution of electricity in United States , the nuclear reactors may posed as potential targets for terrorist groups .
In addition , there is still no safe guarantee that these new LFR operate without any malfunction as they have not been presented to the National Regulatory Council for review .
Despite all these factors , general public may not aware of the refined safety measures that these new reactors possessed .
First of all , all generation IV nuclear reactors included passive design that relies on law of nature , which simplifies the current nuclear generator design that has redundant valves and control system .
Therefore , during any emergency process , the required human intervention was minimized .
Moreover , LFR has a comparative safety advantage compared to the other nuclear reactors designs .
Calculation were done to show that LFR has a better safety design mainly because lead served as a better coolant that does not react as readily as compared to sodium and air .
(Kamil Tuek , 2006) In fact , the numbers of accidents that may lead to severe accidents were declining in recent years .
(U . S . NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION , 1998)Thus , with these years of experience in improving the safety aspects of nuclear energy , the new design is deemed to be safe to provide service to mankind .
The waste management was another problematic issue in current generation III nuclear reactors .
An ordinary thermal nuclear reactor was only to extract approximately only 5 percent energy contained in uranium .
(Smith , 2009)That shows the other 95 percent of the energy would ended up as waste and needed to be store in safety for thousands year .
Million tons of radioactive materials are currently sitting somewhere in this world .
Instead of waiting them to lose their radioactivity , fast reactor is able to utilize most energy from the remaining 95 percents energy .
With current nuclear energy wastes sitting in the storage sites , GE Hitachi Company believe the power extracted would be able to meet 70 years energy demands in USA .
(GE Reports , 2009)By supporting the research on LFR , not only it would provide tremendous energy power to the world , it would also solve the headache waste issue that every OECD nations faced .
Feasibility also needed to be analyzed in our discussion .
One of the current LFR research , SSTAR (Small , Sealed , Transportable , Autonomous Reactor) offers a good solution in minimizing the capital cost of building a nuclear reactor .
Its main concept is to develop portable nuclear reactors that are able to provide their services in developing countries .
(Rennie , 2004) "With SSTAR , countries won't need a large nuclear reactor industry to benefit from nuclear energy ," says Craig Smith , a nuclear engineer in Livermore's Energy and Environment Directorate .
Cost of manufacture including materials , expertise requirement and manpower were effectively lessened with this concept .
The future is unknown .
We do not know which researches may ripen before the others .
Any research may come to a dead end due to strained resources .
LFR , a highly feasible solution for earth's energy crisis , has a clear direction and promised future .
It deserves more human and financial resources in order for it to reach maturity stage .
Safe , less waste and more affordable , these are the characteristic of our future energy .
Therefore , we should give our fullest support , as this technology may turn out to be essential for our future generation .
On April 26 , 1986 , one of four nuclear reactors at the Chernobyl power station , Ukraine , exploded .
The explosion went with large amounts of radioactive poison , causing 30 deaths and hundreds of illnesses (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
This disaster raised great public concern about the safety of nuclear power .
Although we still could not tell whether such accidents would happen in the future , the Very- High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , one of the very recent concepts of the generation IV nuclear reactors , can possibly be a promising plan for the nuclear energy innovation because of its safe design , small environmental impact and relatively low cost .
Opponents argue that the VHTR would have a great explosion potential since the VHTR operates in an extremely high temperature of more than 1000  C . However , there is subtle safety design in the VHTR to reduce the potential of explosion .
One good design is the utilization of helium as the coolant .
Helium is aninert gas .
It will not chemically react with other materials (International Atomic Energy Agency , 1996) .
Unlike water and most other coolants , helium can maintain its non-radioactive property even when it exposes (Institute for Scientific and Technical Information , 2000) .
Another safety design is the temperature-resistant material .
Some promising materials like zirconium carbide can allow the plants perform at the temperature up to 1800 C (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2002) .According to Butler (2004) , a similar high-temperature engineering test reactor in Oarai , Japan , has already successfully operated at the temperature of 950 C . The success of this reactor suggests that more advanced temperature-resistant material can be developed in the near future .
Besides these , other safety designs like the passive heat removal system can also enhance the safety factor of the VHTR .
It can not only cool the nuclear plants fast , but also protect plants from seismic and other external events (Eul , 2006) .

Besides the concern about safety design , sceptics also doubt the environmental impacts of the VHTR .
They say that the non-recyclable radioactive waste in the VHTR reactor can harm the environment and people's health .
Although the waste of nuclear reactors is indeed radioactive , the VHTR reactor design minimises the possibility for radioactive elements to harm the environment .
According to research , the radioactivity for VHTR waste is relatively small compared with other reactors .
The VHTR produces "less heavy metal radioactive waste" and "less plutonium per unit of energy produced" because of the VHTR's high thermal efficiency (Shropshire and Herring , 2004) .It has a high thermal efficiency of over 50% , while other reactors only have a thermal efficiency of 33%-50% (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2009) .Thus , the VHTR is less harmful to the environment .
Some opponents may think that the VHTR would be very costly .
However , recent research supports exactly the opposite conclusion .
The cost for VHTR including fuels and materials , reactor systems , balance of plant , safety , design & evaluation and fuel cycle is relatively low .
The total cost would be around 610 million US dollars , which is the second cheapest among the six Generation IV reactors .
Furthermore , hydrogen produced in VHTR can be commercialised as clean fuel for transportation to make profits (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2009) .
In conclusion , the arguments against VHTR reactor cannot be valid .
As Mr . Butler (2004) said , "Global warming and rising energy needs are rehabilitating the concept of nuclear power .
But if it is the figure in the energy equation , it will need to be cheaper , cleaner and safer" (p .238) .
The VHTR has the advantage of meticulous safety designs , small environmental impact and relatively low cost .
Therefore , the VHTR could be a promising nuclear reactor for the "Nuclear power's new dawn" .

The world's energy consumption is increasing every year .
With rising economic powers such as China and India , the burning of fossil fuel to meet new energy demand simply will not solve the problem of depleting resources on a long term basis .
An alternative to fossil fuel is nuclear energy which has been used since the 1960s .
Still , after many years , there are several factors against building new nuclear reactors .
The nuclear accident in Chernobyl and nuclear weapon proliferation are just two reasons why few reactors have been built in recent years .
However , with more than 40 years of knowledge and experience in nuclear reactors , scientists and engineers have developed research in safe and high performance nuclear reactors known as Generation IV reactors .
Six reactors concepts have been selected for further research by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) .
Of the six reactors , the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) are often debated among scientists .
Although VHTR is designed to be a high-energy-efficient system , there is evidence that proves MSR is the better concept .
Safety features are one of the main considerations when designing a nuclear reactor .
Proponents of VHTR claim that it has an inherent passive safety features for both the fuel and the reactor (Goethem 2008) .
For example , the core of the reactor will be able to withstand temperatures way above the normal operating temperatures .
In the event of an accident , the probability of a meltdown occurring is minimized .
However , passive safety features are present in the MSR too .
Unlike the VHTR which produces high pressure steam at the core , MSR produces low pressure .
This is due to the nature of molten fluoride salts , which is used as coolant and is mechanically and chemically stable at sea-level pressures (Forsberg 2004) .
In other words the MSR's core cannot have a steam explosion , thus it eliminates the need for additional advance technology to control the high pressure .
Due to VHTR's high temperature and corrosive operating conditions , the materials used must have high dimensional stability and be able to withstand high pressure .
New ultra hard materials that can resist continued high temperatures and intense bombardment by neutrons have to be developed (Butler) .
Practical advantages of MSR's high temperature low pressure cooling result in higher efficiency in removing heat from the core (Fosberg 2004) .
This also implies that MSR does not need to spend additional money developing new materials to withstand the high pressure .

Nuclear Energy The world's population will expand further in the next few decades .
Countries around the globe are all working for a better quality of life , this drives the demand for energy on the hike .
There are various ways generating electricity .
However , if a mixture of energy production options is continued , it will impact the environment adversely and cause climate change in long term .
Therefore we need to produce energy which is clean , safe , abundant and cost-effective .
Nuclear power plants are providing 16% of the electricity in the world which are the largest share provided by non- greenhouse-gas-emitting source (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002) .
It has significantly decreased the environmental impact of energy generation .
Nuclear energy can generate hydrogen which is important for petroleum refinement and can be used as an oil alternative in transportation .
Many countries of the world , both industrialized and developing , believe that nuclear energy can be used to meet their demand because of its sustainability in long-term and absence of environmental impacts .
The concept of Generation IV Nuclear Energy System (NES) is able to meet this demand and is inevitable in implementation .
In 2001 , founding members of the GIF selected six best designs as reactor prototypes for the future (Butler , 2004) .
The GFR (or Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor) system is one of them .
The GFR is primarily developed to produce electricity and is able to support hydrogen production from water .
There are different models and the reference reactor is a 600-MWth/288-MWe , helium-cooled system operating with an outlet temperature of 850 C using a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002) .
With ongoing Research & Development (R&D) for its related technology , the GFR is predicted to be delivered by 2025 .
Though questions have been raised on its pending features of development , the GFR should be chosen as the research prototype due to its performance , safety and economics features .
Features of GFR There has been doubt on the safety of the GFR system .
"The fundamental safety objective is to protect people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation" (Fundamental Safety Principles , 2006) .
Another aspect of safety is the Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR and PP) .
It is also one of the objectives of a Generation IV NES is to "increase the assurance that they are a very unattractive and the least desirable route for diversion or theft of weapons-usable materials , and provide increased physical protection against acts of terrorism" (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002) .
To address this , GFR system has involved measures to enhance PR & PE and has adopted an actinide management to ensure nuclear waste utilization and availability of fuel in long term .
Some people argue that the reprocessing of waste is unsafe .
However , there has not been solid proof of accidents .
Furthermore , new forms of reprocessing will be improved .
Technologically , research on the core design , materials , and fuels is still ongoing .
With the effort of scientists and researchers , the GFR will be safely deployable if the technical hurdles are overcome .
Supporters of other reactors believe that they have better performance .
Research has shown that the GFR system ranks the top for its sustainability (Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor , 2005) .
Like the VHTR system , GFR uses helium as coolant which has a high outlet temperature of 850 C , making it able to split hydrogen from water .
This is ideal for countries largely dependent on oil import because hydrogen is an important oil alternative used in fuel cells .
Reprocessing also enhances the performance as it could cut the final amount of waste up to 96% (Butler , 2004) .
The elements with long half-life are extracted and reused .
Only a small volume of waste is left behind .
Another debatable issue is the cost of building the GFR system .
Each of the six prototype costs about US$1 billion (Butler , 2004) .
However in long term , the cost is justified by the economics-of-scale .
It is also a research emphasis to achieve low system cost (Khalil , n .d) .
For the gas- cooled reactors , this might be done by considering other coolants such as the S-CO2 , replacing the cladding materials and so on .
The world population is increasing rapidly .
At the same time , the quality of living is also higher as the standard rises .
These have caused the demand for energy rising fast .
International energy outlook predicted in 2008 that the world energy demand will increase 60 BTU per year .
According to World Nuclear Association (WNA) , the current energy mainly comes from oil and gas .
These fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources .
As the current fossil fuel reserve is running low , the price of the energy is running high .
Based on data collected by WNA , the production cost of energy from oil is the highest , followed by gas , and the nuclear energy is the lowest among all .
Hence , as the demand for the energy will go up , the research for alternative energy is inevitable .
The current alternative energy sources include solar , wind , nuclear , and biomass .
Judging from the current demand , the only energy which can provide high power output is the nuclear energy .
Hence , scientists are researching the fourth generation nuclear reactor which can provide higher power output , at the same time reduce risks .
However , many people still concern about the risk of the nuclear energy and aftermath consequences which last long to disperse as what happened in the World War II .
In my essay , I shall discuss about the key features of nuclear reactor and its comparison with other alternative energy sources .
Hence , develop argument on whether there is a need for the research of generation 4 nuclear reactor .
It is shown that the fatality of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) is 11 .9 per TeraWattHour energy produced , much lower than the other conventional energy sources .
Another thing to mention about the nuclear power is its green approach .
The nuclear power will not produce any byproduct which can damage the atmosphere like CO2 .
Hence , it is a green energy .
However , people are worried about the waste of the conventional reactor which takes million years to decay .
The new generation 4 nuclear reactor promises excellent solution with its byproduct will decay in just decades .
Also , it will produce hydrogen to use it as another type of fuel .
Hence , the new reactor is more environmentally friendly at the same time reduces people's fear of the waste .
Finally , given that people are worried about the nuclear power , it is much needed that we should research on it so that it will be safer and more efficient for us .
It is a fact that there are thousands of nuclear reactors in operation in the world now .
Hence , we should research a new generation of reactor even more to replace the old ones .
In conclusion , the nuclear power is the solution for the current energy crisis .
By researching the new generation of nuclear reactor , we can enjoy more efficient and safer energy around us .
Further research and development funding for Generation IV nuclear reactor , particularly the Very- High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , should be supported .
Ever since Mankind has started using fossil fuels for energy , 400 billion tonnes of carbon is released and eventually would raise world temperatures by 13 degrees Celsius (Zoe ,n .d .) .
Global warming became an inevitable issue .
Mankind's hunger for energy is ever increasing , most experts agree that fossil fuels might deplete within the next 50 years (John ,2006) .
Nuclear energy was proposed to be the solution to this critical issue .
There are however , concerns about nuclear power with respect to its safety , economic viability and waste disposal .
Nonetheless , the advantages Generation IV nuclear power , specifically Very-High- Temperature reactor(VHTR) , could provide can offset its high start up cost and overcome its disadvantages .
Thus , further research and development funding for VHTR should be supported .Thesis
In conclusion , the increasing demand of energy would mean that fossil fuels would deplete in the near future .
In addition , continual usage of fossil fuels would increase the emission of greenhouse gases which causes global warming .
The VHTR would be an ideal model to supply nuclear energy to resolve the problems .
There are concerns about producing nuclear energy with regards to its cost , security and performance .
However , the VHTR includes features and benefits that would offset its disadvantages .
Therefore , the VHTR model should be given more funding for further research and development .
Whenever nuclear power is concerned , accident is always the first thing that comes into the picture .
However , people seldom think about how nuclear energy will benefit the world by providing a solution to global warming .
Increasing energy needs and Global warming are restoring the idea of nuclear power .
According to Butler (2004) by 2050 the carbon dioxide level in the air is expected to double causing severe global warming .
Therefore , new sources of green energy are needed to prevent this from happening .
There are many different green energy such as solar energy , turbine generated energy from wave and wind but nuclear energy especially Very High Temperature Reactor can be the most reliable source of energy in the future when security , safety and cost of nuclear power could be resolve .
Security issue against terrorist and use of nuclear weapon is a major concern when we think about nuclear power .
The destructive power of nuclear bombs can be seen in the history of World War 2 , when two atomic bombs are used on Japan killing 220000 people .
As technology become more advance , hydrogen bombs which are deadlier are now available and the world would be in trouble if it is in the wrong hands and effects worst than September 11 may happen .
However this is only possible when we try to integrate the process of recycling nuclear waste , which is not available for Very High Temperature Reactor .
During the process of recycling , plutonium a key ingredient for advance nuclear weapon is produce .
Most countries including The United States has refrain from reprocessing waste and discourage other from doing so too .
Since the very high temperature does not recycle waste the problem that people may misuse the technology will be resolve .
Even if there is recycling of waste convectional reprocessing does not generate weapon grade plutonium and chemical could be use to spike the plutonium to make it too hot to steal or transport .
Safety issue is definitely a concern as the history of the Three Mile Island in 1979 and the Chernobyl incident in 1986 leave a long lasting bad impression of nuclear plant .
During the Chernobyl incident the plant was blew apart in a very short time and cause 31 immediate deaths .
The worst thing when nuclear reactor like the nuclear bomb was not the immediate death but the exposure of human to radiation .
After the explosion the land was to be vacant and non usable and is believed to have increase the number of cancer cases in Europe .
However comparing the number of death cases to those in cave in land mine the number is minimal as cave in usually result in hundred and thousand of death .
One of the reasons of the accident was due to the staff inexperience but for the newer plant there will be more advance safety enhancement and inbuilt automatic safety features that will cool themselves in times of emergency .
Although the cost of building a nuclear plant is very high and the price of the energy generated is higher than those we have in the market , development on nuclear plant is still a necessity .
In the long run the price of the energy generated by coal and oil would skyrocket as the tax for carbon emission increase exponentially .
The development of nuclear plant would prevent this especially the Very High Temperature Reactor .
The very high temperature reactor can generate both electricity and hydrogen and it is 50% more effective than the conventional reactor and it allow countries to be self sustainable in term of energy .
In conclusion , nuclear power is definitely one of the better choices when we are looking for a green source of energy .
Nuclear power is one technology that must be accelerated promoted and relied upon if the world is to stabilize carbon emission at an acceptable level .
Nuclear power plants are not nuclear bombs waiting to go off .

In the modern world , nuclear power is widely used There are more than 400 nuclear power plants operating in 30 countries , which supply almost 17 percents of the world's electricity .
However , without successful generation IV concepts , the nuclear industry will struggle to maintain its current position of generating 17% of the world's electricity ."
There are six types of generation IV reactor .
Many people believe that the sodium-cooled fast reactor is the best of them .
However , after the research , I support the Gas- cooled fast reactor is the better one .
First , for the sodium-cooled fast reactor , it is top-ranked in sustainability because of its closed fuel cycle and excellent potential for actinide management .
Actually , it can make the use of 99% of fuel .
The outlet temperatures in the range of 510-650 makes the resulting thermal efficiencies range from 39% to 47% .
The performance of sodium-cooled fast reactor seems so perfect , however , compared with the Gas-cooled fast reactor , these data is not perfect anymore .
For gas-cooled fast reactor , it is also a closed fuel cycle and the use of fuel can reach 99% as well .
The outlet temperatures in the range of the gas-cooled fast reactor is around 850 , so it makes the theoretical value of its thermal efficiency is 50% .
This limit of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is just 47% .
Second , safety is another important factor .
For the sodium-cooled fast reactor , it is a primary system that operates near atmospheric pressure and important features of the system include a long thermal response time which is a large margin to cool the boiling .
It also offers a high level of safety reliability .
This fact is based on active safety countermeasures for self-controlled shutdown function and cooling function .
However , dynamic simulations indicate that an accidental reduction of flow up to 2-3 can be tolerated (with no control action) without sodium boiling or fuel melting .
From it we can find the most significant part for safety features of sodium- cooled fast reactor is the control action .
Thus , no matter which kind of generation IV reactor , if its system has control action , it is also relatively safety .
Furthermore , the gas-cooled fast reactor also has its own control action of the system .
This control makes the gas-cooled fast reactor can be as safe as the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
Third , the cost of the fast reactor is also significant .
Some evident shows the sodium-cooled fast reactor can reduce the cost of the raw material by changing it .
However , as the sodium-cooled fast reactor was developed later than the other kinds of factors , especially later than the gas-cooled fast reactor , the cost of research and investigation of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is so huge .
Just because of it , many developed countries do not have enough money to afford this expense .
Therefore , it obstructs the application of the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
Compared with sodium-cooled fast reactor , the gas-cooled fast factor is an old one which has been developed and widely used since 1979 .
Its cost of development is far less than the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
It does not need to be changed or improved so much .
The main cost of it is just the annual depreciation which is far less than the development cost of the sodium- cooled reactor .
In addition , we should consider the cost of time of the reactors .
The gas-cooled fast reactor can be used directly at once .
However , the sodium-cooled fast reactor should be checked for several years by the fact .
Therefore , the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor by cost .
In conclusion , even though the sodium-cooled fast reactor is a good type of generation IV reactor , the gas-cooled fast reactor is a much better one .
Compared with the sodium-cooled fast reactor , the gas-cooled reactor has its obvious advantages of performance and cost .
It has the larger thermal efficiency and less cost of expense and time .
Even though the safety of sodium-cooled fast reactor may be better than the gas-cooled fast reactor , it cannot change the fact that the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor in contemporary time , because there is still no way to make the nuclear power totally safe by now .
Therefore , the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
According to the latest energy consumption statistics in 2008 , the majority of energy consumption was still made up of oil , coal and natural gas 34 .8% , 24 .2% and 24 .1% respectively .
However , the fact behind the door is that under the current consumption pace , no more than 50 years the oil and natural gas will use up and the coal reserve can also only sustain 120 years more .
Faced with the unprecedented energy crisis , finding an alternative energy resource has naturally become the top priority issue .
For the present , nuclear energy is gradually playing increasingly vital role in the energy supply due to its high efficiency and abundant raw materials .
However , some of the public are still concerning some of the issues associated with the nuclear energy , for example the cost , safety and performance .
The concern is understanding , since the nuclear catastrophe happened in Chernobyl on 26 April 1986 is still fresh in our mind .
But those disasters are mainly result from the human's wrong operation .
Besides , as Declan Butler said: Global warming and rising energy needs are rehabilitating the concept of nuclear power .
Furthermore , with the six generation IV reactor concept coming out , especially the VHTR , I firmly believe all the difficulties will be settled in the near future .
To begin with , some of opponents will argue that the cost of building a nuclear reactor is too high and the cost mentioned above generally comprises of research , development , regulation , construction costs , and the contribution to the nuclear waste fund .
Frankly speaking , some of this problem does really exist , but we can view it from another perspective , which means comparing its cost with other kind of power plant under all the same factors .
Firstly , the cost of constructing a nuclear reactor is at most 2 to 3 times than the cost of building a heat-energy reactor with the same output .
But the raw material like uranium enrichment used for nuclear reactor is much cheaper both in transport and price under the same amount of energy output .
In addition , unlike the heat-energy reactor , the gas emitted during the operation has a little influence on the environment and global warming .
Lastly , the achievement obtained from the research can also be applied into other fields .
Secondly , numerous public are holding the view that the nuclear reactor is still existing huge potential safety risk .
Reviewing the history , the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island catastrophe indeed witnessed the enormous harm the nuclear reactor could cause .
While the investigation report showed that the direct cause was a series of wrong operations , the result actually didn't have much relation with the nuclear reactor itself .
Currently , the materials applied in VHTR are more advanced and steady compared to the past .
For example , the Carbon-Fibre reinforced Carbon can bear the highest temperature which the VHTR could generate .
In addition , due to the tri-structure-isotropic and its multi layer , the waste will become difficult to crack and release harmful radiation and fission products .
Therefore , the wastes become concentrated and then easily to deal with .
In conclusion , I firmly believe that the huge potential benefits the nuclear reactor creates will no doubt attract more support not only from the government but also public and once the VHTR construction completed , I think the dawn of nuclear energy has also already come .
Global warming has been the main concern of the governments around the world for the past decade .
High carbon dioxide emission has been one of the main culprits for global warming .
Thus there is a need to find alternatives to produce energy instead of relying on the conventional ones .
Although it is not commonly seen , some countries are already using nuclear reactors to produce energy .
These nuclear reactors unlike the conventional power plants , they do not produce greenhouse gases (Gerstner , 2009) .
However , these nuclear reactors also have their own disadvantages such as producing radioactive wastes , high cost and safety issues .
Research has shown that it is possible to have a nuclear reactor that is cleaner , safer and cheaper (Butler , 2004) .
Thus , there should be funding for research and development for Generation IV nuclear reactor .
Some people have the impression from the two major incidents which happened in Chernobyl , Ukraine and Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania that nuclear reactors are dangerous and are against the idea of having nuclear reactors .
The two incidents happened due to high temperature , which leads to the partial meltdown .
This would not happen in the new reactors as they have better cooling systems that will allow the plants to cool down faster when they reached too high a temperature (Butler , 2004) .
In conclusion , there should be funding for research and development for Generation IV reactors .
It helps in coping with global warming by not producing greenhouses gases unlike the conventional power plants .
Although it produces large amount of radioactive wastes , as long as the hybrid reactor could be produced , the wastes would not be a problem .
Furthermore Generation IV reactors are able to produce more energy , thus the cost of the energy would be cheaper .
Lastly it has better system which would prevent similar incidents of meltdown of the nuclear power reactor to happen .
Thus there should be funding to develop Generation IV reactors .
Very high temperature reactor is one of the six Generation IV reactor concepts , which is designed to be a high-efficiency system so that it can supply electricity and process heat to a broad spectrum of high-temperature and energy-intensive processes .
Some of its excellent features had inspired United States to do a lot of research on Very high temperature reactor .
Now , the very high temperature reactor is still in developing .
However , there is much debate over the development of the very high temperature reactor .
Opponents argue mainly about the security and cost of the very high temperature reactor .
Even the opposite opinions exist , it is still necessary to develop the very high temperature reactor .
Opponents argue mostly about the huge destructiveness in an accident and the hidden radioactive pollution .
Some accidents of nuclear power plants , such as the Chernobyl disaster occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant , caused huge panic about the new clear power plant .
However , during that time the nuclear reactors were not well developed .
Researches done by the experts in United State showed that the security of the very high temperature would be improved quite a lot .
First , since the core is composed of helium , whose coolant is dingle phase , and graphite whose thermal inertia is very large , the core becomes very steady and safe .
In addition , fuel of the very high temperature reactor is designed to cycle from ore extraction of final waste disposal and radioactive wastes will be sent to repositories for final geologic disposal which will reduce both the lifetime and toxicity of the radioactive waste .
Therefore , the safety of the very high temperature reactor is improved a lot .
Another reason for opposition is the high cost of the very high temperature reactor .
Given that the cost of the nuclear power plant including very high temperature reactor is very high and it will take several decades to recover from the cost , the opponents think it is not reasonable to use very high temperature reactor .
However , according to the research done by the experts , the very high temperature reactor will be designed in condition that the generation cost will be competitive when compared with other energy sources and the capital investment cost will be low enough for a large number of countries .
Hence , the very high temperature will provide competitive economics .
In conclusion , the reasons against the development of the very high temperature are debatable .
The safety and cost of the high temperature reactor should not be used to limit the development of the very high temperature reactor , on the contrary , they should be considered as challenges to be overcome .
Anyway , the research about the very high temperature reactor shows that the very high temperature is beneficial to the society .
Therefore , the very high temperature should be developed .
In the twenty-first century , the world is developing in a rapid pace that has never occurred in the past .
Countries like China and India keep their GDP up to 8% increase almost every year .
Besides the increase of GDP , carbon dioxide emission is also reaching the highest level compare to the past .
Obvious climate change experienced in many countries and regions remind us that the green house effect is really dangerous to the earth .
We should stop destroying our earth by continue mining and generating electricity through the coal plants .
Nuclear power seems to be a suitable solution .
However , the opponents feel that nuclear power is not acceptable mainly due to safety , cost and its pollution issue .
In fact , by using Generation Four nuclear power plant in coming future , these problems can be solved definitely .
And among all types of the Generation IV nuclear power technology , very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) would be the best choice due to its safeness , efficiency and environment friendliness .
Firstly , opponents of using nuclear power plants argue that nuclear power is not a safe technology .
The reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania seems that nuclear power technology is extremely dangerous to use .
I do admit that some of the public has lost their confidence and trust after this accidence happened .
However , we should understand that the TML used pressurized water reactor which is Generation Two model , the safety concern on that model is much lesser comparing to VHTR which is a Generation Four model .
VHTR make use of helium , an inert gas , as coolant .
It will not react with the VHTR materials nor become radioactive itself .
Hence , it is very safe to use .
Secondly , any supports of traditional power plants argue that the cost of building nuclear plants is much higher than for the coal plants .
Actually , the construction cost of nuclear power plants keeps on reducing in the past few years .
For example , the construction cost for the first third generation reactor , ABWR , built in Japan was 2000 per KW , while the Chinese Nuclear Power Industry has built new plants of their own design at capital costsreported to be$1500 per KW and $1300 per KW at sites in South-East and North-East China recently .
In fact , the VHTR could even produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with other nuclear plants .
In addition , the maintenance and labor cost of VHTR is much less than the coal plants .
With the low maintenance fees , low labor cost and the high output of electricity , the total cost of the VHTR is actually less than the coal plants after a few years of operation .
Thirdly , the opponents of nuclear power plants worry that the disposal of radioactive waste from the plants will cause serious illness or even death to people live or work near the place .
However , the VHTR has a reactor core made of graphite , which possess high stability even in high temperature .
And by using uranium dioxide fuel particles coated with graphite , the reactors will not release radioactive substances even in extreme high temperature .
It has zero waste .
In addition , VHTR is capable of producing hydrogen gas by breaking the molecular bond of H2O .
As hydrogen gas has zero carbon dioxide emission , it has a potential to replace petroleum as a clean fuel for transportation .
So VHTR is environment friendly and the most optimized solution towards green house effect .
In conclusion , it should be evident that the arguments against nuclear power plants are not valid .
Among the generation IV reactors , the very-high-temperature reactor is most likely to be the best choice due to its safeness , efficiency and environment friendliness .
As a good solution towards green house effect , we expect to see a bright future of nuclear power technology and it will be adopt in more countries in next few decades .
The Tenerife runway accident involved the collision of two airplanes , the Pan American (Pan Am) Boeing 747 and the Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KLM) aircraft .
The accident was caused by the lack of the use of psychology during the design process , and could have been prevented , had more psychological considerations been into the aircraft designs .
Both the KLM and Pan Am aircrafts were designed to work under normal conditions .
As such , the aircrafts were not made to be ready for unforeseen circumstances .
The plane could operate , lift off and function , but only under predictable conditions .
Here , we could see that aircraft designers were capable and technically competent in creating aircrafts .
However , the designers failed to understand that aircrafts were to be piloted by humans , and not some fearless beings .
When the aircraft personnel suddenly found themselves in a panic situation , they could not respond appropriately because the aircraft was never built to be put in tricky situations .
However , some people say that the accident was caused due to human error .
Upon realising that there was a crisis , the aircraft crew of each vessel responded without much consideration as to what their actions might lead to .
People then blamed the cause of the accident on the aircraft crew of both sides for badly managing the situation .
Still , the reason behind the cause of the accident cannot be blamed on the aircraft crew .
The aircraft crew reacted the way they reacted because the plane was not built with all the necessary functions for them to react in an unexpected situation .
For example , under low-visibility conditions , there was no way the Pam Am officer could differentiate between a stationary and a vibrating aircraft nearby .
Had strong light-emitting devices been installed on the KLM aircraft , an unambiguous signal would have been sent , leaving the Pan Am officer with a clear signal .
In this situation people cannot say that the Pan Am officer did not do his job because he a kept lookout on the surroundings , but in the midst of the fog , the presence of the KLM aircraft signaled an ambiguous message .
Also , had proximity sensors been installed within the Pan Am aircraft , the whole accident could have been prevented .
The Pan Am officer saw the KLM through the fog and noticed its apparent static state when it was in fact still moving .
If an alarm was sounded upon when safety distance between the Pan Am and KLM aircraft was breached , the Pan Am crew would have steered their aircraft away from hazard .
The undetected KLM aircraft collided with the Pan Am aircraft because by the time the Pan Am officer realised that the KLM was nearing their aircraft , it was too late .
Had he been warned by the ringing alarm of a proximity sensor , he would have gotten enough time to respond and not panic when the impending collision was apparent .
Therefore , psychology has been recognized as an integral part of the design process today .
Students enrolled in the engineering courses in Ngee Ann Polytechnic nowadays are required to study interdisciplinary subjects , one of which includes introductory psychology .
For these reasons , we conclude that the accident in the Tenerife runway could have been avoided , had the use of psychology been applied in the designing .
If designers still persist that psychological considerations are of hardly any importance , then the users of their products may well be put in situations where accidents are bound to occur .
At the beginning of 2002 , 438 nuclear power plants were in operation in 31 countries around the world , generating electricity one billion people .
They account for approximately 17 percent of worldwide installed base load capacity for electricity generation and provide half or more of the electricity in a number of countries .
These reactors are generating electricity in a reliable , environmentally safe and affordable manner without emitting noxious gases into the atmosphere .

We have achieved so much .
However , nuclear power plants sometimes could cause disasters .
Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania; Chernobyl accident happened in Ukraine .
We bear while using nuclear power .
As a result , a new generation of nuclear power- The six generation IV reactors concepts were raised to solve this problem .
Among all these six generation IV nuclear reactor plants , I think Very-high-temperature reactor is the most promising one .
We can use this kind of reactors to solve our energy problems .
Security has always been the most concerned problem which is also biggest trouble in using nuclear power .
For the last few years , very few new nuclear power plants were built .
We are not only concerning the shortage of technology but also considering the danger of terrorists .
Nuclear power could be easily used as weapon because we do not need to consider controlling the bomb , but if we use nuclear power as energy , then we should make it safe for us to operate it .
The big danger hidden in nuclear power plant also makes it as a target for those who want to destroy .
From "Baidu" dictionary , we know that the power released in Chernobyl Accident was about 400 times as big as the atom bomb which US threw in Hiroshima .
We must make sure that there is not a little danger in our building and using nuclear power .
Our new technology used in VHTR nuclear power plant includes simplified safety features that do not rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators .
"Meltdown proof" and can cool themselves down even if anyone shuts off the coolant or power supply .
(Nuclear power's new dawn) Different form the caution we must take in using traditional nuclear power plants , now we can make the most of nuclear power .
In the society today ,there are many ideas or concept that are currently in the stages of research and development .
Some of the ideas and new creations which falls into this category are robotics and hybrid cars .
There are many reasons amounting to the factors which results in the delaying of mass production in the market .
These include lack of technology as well as funding from the appropriate ministries or bodies .
With regards to hybrid cars , prior to the mass production and usage of it , there are some factors with respect to the construction of the vehicle that we have to factor in in order to increase the safety aspects of usage .
Some of the vito factors leading to increased safety levels requires the addition of new features into the vehicle as well as modifications being made to current existing design .
According to Smith(N .D) , hybrid cars are cars that run on electricity source via internal conversion of kinetic energy into electricity .
As it depends mainly on electricity to operate , the cost of a hybrid car is thus not cheap , as compared to vehicles that function on petrol or diesel .
Basically , as stated earlier , it works on the principle of conversion of kinetic energy into charging of batteries .
This is done when cars applied brakes and come to halt .
Upon applying of brakes , the kinetic energy which would otherwise be converted into heat energy due to the presence of friction will be converted into electricity instead and stored in the batteries .
When it stops , no energy is consumed as the engine will switch off by itself and operate upon motion of the vehicle .
The tyres have low resistance with the aim of drafting or cutting air resistance .
The weight of a hybrid car tends to be lighter than a normal petrol-powered car as it is made of materials that are of low density .
Given the structure of the present hybrid cars , there are indeed some areas of safety aspects that are neglected and should be included to increase the safety of users .
However , there are some limitations regarding the improvement of structure for the vehicle to increase safety levels .
These considerations are mainly with respect to the monetary cost of the improved version of hybrid cars as well as the capability of it after the restructure .
According to Weston(N .D)  , the cost of hybrid car is usually more expensive as compared to normal cars .
In terms of cost and fuel savings , it will take several years before one can see the effects of the savings .
Hence , by introducing new features into hybrid cars , it will then increase the costs of the car itself , making it more expensive than the current design models .
As a result , it will decrease the quantity demanded by potential consumers and manufactures may not find it profitable to mass produce it .
Also , according to Robinson(2007 , September 29)  ,with the introduction of more features into the hybrid car , this would means that more electricity would be required to operate the car .
This would then add up to the existing large amount of electricity present in the engine .
We must acknowledge the fact that there is a certain limit to how much electricity can be dissipated in the engine or stored in the batteries .
Too much electricity would pose a danger to the vehicle as a whole in the event of an accident and will also affect the performance of the car itself .
As the design of hybrid cars is in such a way that the motor and batteries are located at the back , too much electricity would also means that larger batteries would be needed .
This would then inevitably increase the size of the vehicle making the back heavier than the front , which is something undesirable as it may lead to unstability of the vehicle .
Some of the measures that could be introduced and implemented to increase the safety aspects of future hybrid cars include using higher resistance tyres or tyres with more grooves .
Currently , the tyres of hybrid cars are of low resistance to draft air resistance .
This poses a danger especially on rainy days or on wet surfaces .
A scientific and logical explanation was given by Serway ,&Jewett (N .D) , whom explained that on rainy days or on wet surfaces , static and kinetic friction would be reduced greatly .
Static and kinetic friction depends greatly on its coefficient , which usually ranges from 0 .5 to 1 .5 .
However ,on wet surfaces , the coefficient would be greatly reduced and vehicles would be more prone to skidding or swerving off-course .
Hence , by using tyres of higher resistance , it will increase the friction between the tyres and road surfaces thus reducing chances of skidding or instability of vehicles .
The inclusion of airbags into hybrid cars are also detrimental to the safety of its users .
In the present market , the size of a hybrid car is small .
Hence , they do not have airbags fitted inside the car .
This poses danger to the driver as well as passengers because in the event of an accident , when the driver jammed down hard on the brakes , the effects of inertia will be very large .
Thus , without the aid of an airbag , the driver and front passenger especially may just crashed straight through the windscreen and incurred serious injuries .
But , with the aid of an airbag , these will be prevented as the effects of inertia which caused the driver and front passenger to crash straight through the windscreen will be cushioned by the airbags .
Installation of earthing device is also necessary to increase the level of safety .
As claimed by Robinson(2007 ,September 29) , there is a large amount of electricity present in the motor of the hybrid car .
Should an accident or collision occurs , it may caused the batteries to be damaged severely .
There is also a danger of leaking or overflowing of electric charges as the batteries are damaged .
As the amount of electricity with respect to our subject is of a substantial amount , hence , it would then pose life dangers to the passengers on board , as well as rescuers .
By installing an earthing device within the vehicle itself , it would then ensure that excess charges are earthed safely to the ground and will not pose life danger to anyone .
The weight of the car also plays a part in ensuring the safety aspect of the hybrid car .
The present hybrid cars are designed light as they use mainly materials of low density to construct the whole vehicle .
This may not be desirable because if the vehicle goes too fast , it may tend to lose its centre of gravity and hence , lose stability .
So , by increasing the weight of the vehicle , the vehicle will be tougher and have a lower centre of gravity .
It will then ensure stability of the vehicle .
The weight of the car can be increased by adopting the several measures mentioned in the previous paragraphs .
In conclusion , there are pros and cons regarding the improvements to hybrid cars in order to increase its level of safety .
However , we must recognize that our safety is of utmost importance and take precedence above anything else .
I hope that in the near future , we are able to do our part for our mother Earth by driving such hybrid cars as it reduces greenhouse gases since it is not driven by petrol or diesel , but at the same time not compromising our personal safety .
Nowadays , people are living longer than in the past and the growth of the world's population is increasing expectedly to around 10 billion by the year 2050 .
Therefore , there is an increasing demand for energy usage throughout the world .
According to the article of Nuclear Power/Nuclear Dawn (The Economist , 2007) , the global electricity consumption is expected to double in the next few decades [1] .
Furthermore , due to the depletion of unrenewable energy such as coal and fossil fuel , the scientists in many countries start to seek for a new source of energy , which is nuclear energy .
Although the potential for the uses of nuclear power energy is great , there are a number of opponents with anti-nuclear sentiment , preventing the construction of nuclear plants in the past few decades in many countries .
Such issues include the safe operations of nuclear reaction As a result , the generation IV nuclear energy system was introduced , which was an improved design from their predecessors , Generation IV reactors are offering significant advances such as clean , safe and cost effective .
Therefore , The very-high temperature reactor (VHTR) was introduced to meet global energy demands .
Firstly , VHTR generates energy in a much simpler way compared to other types of reactors .
It is because it makes use of the thermo-chemical iodine- sulfur (I-S) process , so that hydrogen can be generated from heat and water .
A 600 MW VHTR can produce hydrogen which can supply over 2 billion cubic meters every day .
In addition , the use of steam reformer technology to core outlet temperature allows the temperature reach above 1000 C [2] .
Therefore , the thermal efficiency of the VHTR is 50 percent more compared to the Generation II and Generation III reactors .
With this high core outlet temperature , VHTR enables applications like hydrogen production or electricity cogeneration for petrochemical industries [3] .
Moreover , VHTR is graphite-moderated and uses helium as a coolant for supplying heat and generate electricity) .
In addition , VHTR system is flexible to adopt uranium or plutonium fuel cycles with the enhanced waste minimization .
As a result , it offers various heat processing applications for higher- efficiency electricity production , while preserving the desirable safety characteristics offered by modular high temperature gas-cooled reactors .

Does nuclear power now make financial sense ?

In addition , VHTR systems are economically cheap , safe and reliable due to its high hydrogen production efficiency and inherent safety features of the fuel and reactors [4] .
The application of open fuel cycle in VHTR system makes VHTR good at proliferation resistance and its physical protection .
With advanced electricity and capabilities , there are many countries like China , USA and Japan have chosen to develop VHTR systems as its priority .
By adopting the experiences from those countries , VHTR can be upgraded with a lower cost of the implementation .
It is because the construction of more advanced nuclear energy systems often addresses their economics in a variety of changing markets in order to overcome the high construction cost , the VHTR system reflects its potential economically and safely generating power energy such as electricity and hydrogen at a high efficiency without the emission of toxic gases .
Unlike other reactors in Generation IV reactors such as the gas-cooled fast reactors (GFR) and the lead-cooled fast reactors (LFR) , although the LFR and GFR can generate electricity and hydrogen , the power output efficiency is not as high as the VHTR .
Furthermore , the sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFR) and the supercritical-water cooled reactors (SCWR) are able to produce electricity only as their power output [5] .
Last but not least , in addition to hydrogen production , recycling of radioactive fuel in a fuel cycle helps to reduce the amount of nuclear waste compared to those produced by current reactors and generating high quantities of electricity makes the use of VHTR more economically in our daily life .
However , even if there are several advantages for the use of VHTR , a number of disadvantages are still present in Generation IV reactors .
For example , the high overall cost of nuclear reactors and the production of toxic waste are to be mentioned .
The construction of each nuclear plant can cost several billion dollars due to changing regulatory delays , safety scares and multiple subcontractors working on cost plus basis .
All these will lead to huge cost overrun for building a plant .
Moreover , after three year of use , the long-lived toxic radioactive wastes are produced and accumulated .
These radioactive materials cannot be burned compared to conventional reactors .
Instead , these materials are stored near the nuclear plant until it is moved to a permanent facility .
As a result , it is more likely to endanger human life and the environment once the toxic wastes are leaked out .
In conclusion , there are 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries which supply 15% of the world's electricity .
According to the chief economist of International Energy Agency (IEA) , "the world wide generating capacity of nuclear power plants will probably increase from about 370GW today to 520 GW in 2030" (The Economist , 2007) .
Most nuclear plants have longer lifespan of more than 40 years according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
Hence , if the plants can still perform well , it gets extra 20 years extension once 40-year plant licenses expired .
Therefore , these will lead to the high energy outputs which can cater for an increasing demand on the electricity consumption .
A speech given by Lewis Strauss , the head of America's Atomic Energy Commission , stated that "One day nuclear power would be too cheap to meter" [6] .
This goes to show that how great the potential of nuclear power .
Although there are some disadvantages present and the time for the earliest delivery of Generation IV still has years to go , they are just minority problems .
In order to cater for more electricity consumption in the future , there is a need to look for another source of energy , "Nuclear Power" .
With this in mind , more researches and development have to be carried out especially for VHTR system which has been described as a prototype for next generation nuclear plants [4] .
Therefore , I do agree with nuclear power is a new dawn for the next generation and the main focal point for research and development (R&D) should be focusing on VHTR .
Therefore , with the advantages offered by VHTR in terms of security , cost and performance , people should support the construction of Generation IV and further research and development funding are also required for VHTR to be developed .

After the catastrophe that happened at Chernobyl , Russia 1986 , the World start to concern more carefully about the safety and security of nuclear power reactors .
A majority of public have been opposing the development of nuclear plants around their living areas .
As a result , nuclear industry has stepped into the degradation , causing the world energy crisis .
However , nowadays the scientists have proved that with measured cautions , nuclear power could be used to supply alternated energy to the world as the fossil fuels would come to an end soon .
At the same times , there are many evidences show that nuclear power could be considered as the best suggestion to mitigate global warming .
This era is 'Nuclear Renaissance' , and the reasons for the renaissance of nuclear are due to the advanced technology and innovation of human to make nuclear power safer , cleaner with better cost effectiveness .
Hence , with the security systems , modern technology and intelligence of the manpower , I strongly believe that building of nuclear power plant should not be stopped .
First of all , public are against the proposal of building nuclear power plant to supply electrical energy as they are very concerned with safety of the plant .
Questions that come to their mind will be .
"What is going to happen to us if the nuclear plant exploded ?
" , "Do they contain the deadly radioactive particles ?" .
The Chernobyl disaster is one of the nuclear power plant accidents that remind people about how dangerous nuclear reaction can be .
But we have to look at other things like passenger aircrafts .
Accidents happened every now and then , and through these accidents , people learnt and things were improved to prevent the same accidents from happening once again .
For example , the windows of the planes used to have square shape in the past but engineer have changed all of them to round shape to improve the safety of airplanes .
Because of accidents and people found out the solutions to improve safety .
Similarly , new designs nuclear power reactors are there to reduce off-site radioactivity to the minimum if there is accident .
The latest nuclear power plant accidents happened in 1999 , which is more than 10 years ago .
In 10 years , technology is advancing rapidly .
Therefore , I believe that nuclear power plant is very much safer than it was in the past .
The second factor that concerns public is whether nuclear energy is the main contribution to the Global warming and causing climate change .
Researchers stated that at the rate of consumption , fossil fuel can only last for another thirty to forty years .
In deed , the time needed for fossil fuel to regenerate requires million of years under high pressure .
Due to the fact that we are consuming more fossil fuels , natural gas and destroying more trees , it leads to Global warming that caused by the amount of carbon dioxide trapping heat in the atmosphere and the depletion of ozone layers .
However , as evidenced by scientists , although nuclear energy still produce some greenhouse gas emissions associated with the life cycle of uranium , but this is significantly less than the emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels .
Moreover , nuclear power might be "carbon- zero" if the uranium could be utilize in more effective way .
Additionally , Nuclear power is cheap compare to fossil fuel and produces little pollutants compare to fossil fuel .
Therefore , nuclear power can be considered as the best solution as it produce amount of energy but produce little amount of waste .
Some people think that a nuclear power plant is expensive to build due to the advanced technology and the quality of the structures it requires .
In fact , comparing to coal fired and natural gas fire , though nuclear plant initially is expensive to build but it is less expensive to run and has more proven longer-term benefits .
There have been numerous improvements in construction methods in the last few decades and that is fully applicable to the construction of a nuclear power plant .
However some methods required early investment to secure the longevity and security of the plant in the long term .
For a country that does not yet use nuclear power , the introduction and development of nuclear power is a major undertaking .
It requires the country to build the necessary infrastructure so it can construct and operate a nuclear power plant (NPP) profitably in a safe , secure and technically sound manner .
The sustainability of climate , land , energy and water must be secured and managed so that a NPP can be operable profitably and securely throughout its entire life cycle .
In order to ease the worry of public about safety issues of nuclear power , scientists are working hard to come up with the next generation of nuclear reactors which excels in enhanced safety , cost-effectiveness and better performance .
Sodium Cooled Fast Nuclear Reactor (SFR) is chosen here as the model for fast nuclear reactor because of its significant benefits .
SFR has high percentage of the burn - up which means they can "breed" a higher percentage of the fuel than they consume roughly 70-80 percent , compared to 55 per cent for the current generation .
At the same time , SFR concept is significantly good at making full use of uranium effectively .
Beside , SFR has advantage in disposal requirement , in which it is designed to reduce the amount of actinide in order to well manage the high level waste .
Furthermore , another benefit that makes SFR concept a better choice is its safety features .
SFR has higher boiling point , meaning that it requires longer thermal response time , thus it will be a large margin to coolant boiling that minimize the probability of accidents happening at boiling phase .
Last but not least , with the innovative design structure and modern materials , SFR therefore has lower power plant capital cost with higher effective productivity .
In conclusion , I believe there is no reason to delay the developing of this new generation of nuclear reactor concept in order to serve the urgent need of energy all over the World .
From all of the above pros and cons of nuclear energy and nuclear power reactor , we realize that these issues involved developing of these modern techniques are not impossible to solve and why not to commit renewed effort and fresh innovations to get these nuclear power plant get up and going ?
The world energy crisis has already taken place , climate change has become the reality; more than six billions people have to deal with the shortage of food supply . . . As to all energy generation technology , there are advantage and disadvantages with nuclear power .
The world therefore cannot afford to ignore the potential source of low carbon energy provided by these fast nuclear reactors .
The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 in Ukraine was not the only major accident that gave devastating impact to Russia .
In September 2009 , another accident gave Russia a huge hit .
Russia's biggest hydroelectric power plant in Sayano-Shushenskaya had a big explosion accident .
75 workers were killed and one person was reported missing in the accident .
The top industrial safety official in Russia stated that human's negligence was the major factor in the devastation of the accident .
One part of an overstrained turbine unit which weighted 1 ,500 tons snapped off from its restraining bolts and flow 14 meters into the air , causing floods .
Due to flooding in the plant , short circuits crippled the plant and exploded .
It is said that the cost of repairing the damage would be over $1 .2 billion and the duration to recover the damage would take two years .
Accidents are events that involve unintended harms .
Could this hydroelectric power plant accident be prevented if the design of the plant was given more thought about safety ?
Many engineers and experts are debating whether psychology in design processes could prevent accidents from occurring .
Although some contend psychology used in designing can prevent accidents , there are some reasons and evidences to oppose the theory of psychology in design processes can prevent accidents .
Proponents of psychology in design processes claims that psychological thinking is very important in the design processes .
They stated that when engineers or designers design with human psychology in through , they could produce a design that can prevent accidents from taking place .
As Bernhard Wilpert pointed in his article on psychology and design processes (2007) , "a crucial problem of design is to match the designer's mental modal of the object or system to be designed with the mental model of the future user requirements" .
For example , in the case of the hydroelectric power plant accident , humans negligent the warning of the system .
If the system was design in a way that it automatically shuts down when there was a default in the system , the plant's operation would have been stopped and the accident would not have occurred .
Many studies from different accidents such as nuclear and chemical industry showed that between 20% and 50% of accidents are caused by design errors (B . Wilert , 2007) .
Therefore , the proponents think that psychology in design processes could be a solution for accident prevention .
However , this statement is in conclusive .
Accidents cannot be prevented .
Accidents can only be reduced .
Even when engineers and designers design with psychology , accidents tend to happens .
When systems or objects are developed using high technology , they are not purely safe .
People are the one who design safety into the systems .
Humans are not perfect in everything they do .
In the psychology and design processes article (B .Wlpert , 2007) the author has stated that engineers can make mistakes in their design as engineers are also humans .
Hence , it is not possible to prevent accidents .
But contentants pointed that accidents are unaccepted event that happens .
So , they are mainly due to human 'errors' .
If engineers can predict human's behavior , they will be able to design according to human's nature .
The Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (PHERP) is a technique used for works of Human Reliability Assessment (System Reliability Center , n .d) .
The purpose of THERP is to evaluate the probability of a human 'error' taking place throughout the completion of a job .
Predicting human actions during thee operation of object or system , designers and engineers can design corresponding to human actions .
For example , when a worker accidentally places his or her hand into a cutter , the worker will get hurt .
If the engineers and designers can predict that humans can be careless at work sometimes , they will design a cutter that can detect human's hand when placed inside and stop the operation immediately .
Hence engineers can produce better design with more safety if they predict human's behaviors .
Even though predicting human 'error' can help in design processes , but that cannot prevent accidents .
Engineers and designers cannot predict behavior s of every human .
During the prediction , engineers may predict human actions wrongly .
80% and more accidents are caused by human 'error' rather than fully machines or systems .
In the Sayano-Shushenskaya's hydroelectric power plant accident , the main factor that leads to the accident was human 'error' .
The system showed many warning signs about the failure in it .
The bolts that hold the turbines were 90% teared out .
Since the bolts were fatigued , the system was producing noise .
Although the system showed signs of damage , humans were negligent about the damage .
There had been three other major accidents excluding this accident since the construction of the plant .
The previous accidents in 1979 , 1985 and 1988 were caused by spring floods that overwhelmed the dam's capacity .
This shows that the design of the power plant was not stable for generating energy .
Therefore , during the psychological process of thinking , mistakes can occur which results in poor design and lead to accidents .
To close up the arguments , accidents are mistakes with bad consequences .
The Sayano-Shushenskaya's hydroelectric power plant accident would be avoided if the humans had not negligent the warning given by the system .
But psychology can only play a part in design processes to create a better design but not prevent accidents from occurring .
Humans can never work without making error .
With psychology , engineers and designers can design only to reduce human 'error' but cannot prevent human 'error' .
Therefore , accidents cannot be prevented but can be reduced by psychology in the design processes .
Some bad memories will never fade away , like the Challenger accident , which took place in January 28 , 1986 , killing all the 7 astronauts just 72 seconds after being launched into the sky (Challenger STS 51-L Accident , n .d .) .
The common explanation for this painful accident is that O-ring joint problem leads to the leakage of fuel and eventually results in the explosion of space shuttle .
(NASA-STS-51L , n .d) However , this technical failure is only the surface reason .
What causes the failure of the O-ring is due to the irresponsibility and ignorance of the person in charge .
Hence , by applying psychology to the design process , which means individuals involved in the design process can make commitments to their tasks and make decisions out of consideration , the chance of accident prevention might be largely enhanced .
To begin with , the leading person in the design process should consider the practicability of the whole system , and hence makes the pragmatic plan and approach .
In the case of Challenger accident , the management committee made an inaccessible schedules and 'modify the technical and procedural standard' for the engineers (Craig L . Howe) .
Without sufficient time given , how could those managers expect the high qualitative component parts of the space shuttle to be produced ?
Even though some of them would probably argue that they were not familiar with engineering process , they could not refuse to take the blame .
In this respect , the use of psychology during design process requires them to make a schedule based on practicability after consultations with engineers , which will help to guarantee each individual process of the system to operate well .

The second perspective to illustrate why psychology is an essential factor to avoid the occurrence of the accident is that engineers who produce numerous tiny component parts could minimize 'erroneous actions' by applying psychology in their design (Wilpert .B , 2006) .
For instance , because of the limited time , the engineers working for Challenger space shuttle failed to comply with the criteria of producing individual high qualitative parts of the space shuttle (R . P . Feynman , 1996) .
In order to finish their tasks promptly , engineers threw away their occupational ethic .
The basis of psychology is completing one's own task in high quality , yet this basic requirement is sometimes ignored by people , and consequently , extremely painful accident is triggered .
The contrary viewpoints tend to attribute the O-ring problem to a simply technical failure that the 'factual account' of the accident is "frozen , brittle O ring" which causes the leakage of fuel and induces the exploration of the space shuttle Challenger (D .Vaughan , 1996) .
However , it is just the surface cause of the accident .
The deep reason behind is the insufficient low-temperature testing of O-ring which conceals the potential risk from engineers .
It is not an excuse for them to quibble that they have no idea of the quality of O-ring because they have not collected sufficient data to prove that the O-ring cannot stand low temperature .
It is a problem of engineers' attitude that no one bothers to detect that 'apparent' problem .
Unfortunately , the launch date of the Challenger space shuttle was extremely cold and this error turned out to be fatal (McConnell , M , 1987) .
Apart from the engineering errors , psychology should also be taken into account with respect to safety issue .
The management committee of the Challenger space shuttle actually got a warning report about the high risk before the launch .
They were informed that the O-ring might fail to seal the fuel tank due to the low temperature .
However , in response to such a crucial warning report , they put it aside and left it to chance (The Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster , 2009) .
It was a totally irresponsible action .
Conceding that officials in NASA may have been used to high risk operation and there are certain times when the system needs to operate at high risk (Feynman , Richard Phillips ,1992) , the managers cannot straightaway ignore the problem just because the chance for the accident to take place is slim .
Their underestimation of the danger resulted in the Challenger accident directly .
If psychology could been used in their decision , if they could have thought more about their work which related to the safety of other people and the outcome of the entire program , if they really have had the sense of responsibility which results from the essence of their job , they would not rush their work and make irresponsible decision .
Thus psychology helps to evaluate the danger of the event correctly and avoid the accident to occur .
In sum , instead of technical shortcomings , the accounts of the Challenger disaster are largely due to the ignorance and irresponsibility of both the engineers and programme managers .
Conceding that all human beings may make mistake in the unfamiliar field , and certain constraints may affect people's actions and decisions , however , we cannot deny that the importance of psychology during the design process .
By applying psychology , we can avoid certain mindset and learn to be more responsible and considerate .
Therefore , psychology helps to prevent the engineering accident and design failure .

Owing to the public's concerns about the safe operation nuclear power , research and development , funding for nuclear power was rather minimal .
More recently , environmental concerns and rising energy demands are putting nuclear power back into the energy equation .
However , if nuclear power is to win the approval of the previously disapproving public , it will have to be more cost-effective , environmentally-friendly and almost void of security concerns .
Keeping this in mind the pioneer nations of nuclear power have come up with a few generation-IV reactor concepts (Butler , 2004) .
The earliest concept that is going to be introduced is the Sodium- Cooled fast reactor concept , which requires relatively new low pressure and temperature to operate and recycles its nuclear waste .
Examining the public's concerns with respect to the Sodium-Cooled fast reactor will give us a useful insight on the potential of nuclear power .
However , nuclear power would never be a major source of energy simply because its drawbacks far outweigh its advantages .
One of the most critical factors while considering the various power sources is cost .
The general public will only approve of a power source if it is cost-effective .
An obvious advantage of nuclear power is the massive amounts of energy it can generate .
For instance , a single nuclear plant can generate four times as much energy as a coal-powered plant in its lifetime (Max , 2009) .
Sodium-Cooled fast reactors are also able to recycle spent fuel rods .
Moreover , analysts have estimated Uranium to last us for at least another century (Leipoldt , 2007) .
Uranium is not so expensive to mine as its ores are found near the surface of the earth .
All these suggest that nuclear power is actually very energy-efficient and cost effective .

However , the capital needed to set up a nuclear plant is extremely high .
This can be attributed to a few factors .
Firstly , nuclear plants , according to the safety standards set by authorities , must have a 'cordon area' of at least 30km .
Setting aside such a vast amount of land just for one nuclear plant is clearly not feasible .
Secondly , machinery required in nuclear plants is extremely costly because it has to be constructed with high precision to prevent any form of nuclear leak .
Thirdly , substantial testing that needs to take place to prevent any accidents will also add to the escalating costs .
Governments under-insure nuclear plants to make it cost- effective so as to cater to the public .
Nuclear plants are indeed high-risk considering the huge capital outlay by the authorities .
Therefore , nuclear power , in terms of cost , is not exactly a viable option even though its very energy- efficient .
Another critical factor that needs to be considered is how environmentally- friendly the energy source is .
Although this factor does not involve the public , recent studies have shown that the public is increasingly aware of the environmental problems and are prepared to take measures to arrest the slide .
Nuclear power is usually lauded as the "environmentally-friendly" energy and rightly so too .
Nuclear energy does not emit toxic pollutants in the atmosphere nor does it emit combustion by-products like carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas that punctures our ozone-layer further , giving rise to global-warming .
Carbon dioxide is the reason for about half of the global warming experienced by Earth (Kallen , 2005) .
In comparison with burning fossil fuels , it has to be said that nuclear power is far more environmentally-friendly .
The final factor that we are considering is the safety of the public .
Firstly , it is almost impossible to build something that is perfectly safe .
The chance of a failure , although minute , is still present .
The consequences of any accident are vast .
If there is a leak , these radioactive substances can kill at high doses and cause cancer and birth defects at low doses .
Sodium-Cooled reactors recycle the nuclear waste so it is highly improbable that nuclear waste will end up in the wrong hands .
However , one can never be too sure .
The information on creating "dirty nuclear bombs" is readily available in the Internet and in several books too .
So there could be mass destruction if terrorists somehow get hold of uranium and decide to make nuclear bombs .
Finally , nuclear power might give rise to strained relation between nations .
For instance , if a country is utilizing nuclear power , neighbouring countries might view that country as a military threat .
Therefore , nuclear power , although very environmentally- friendly , invokes many security concerns amongst the public .
In conclusion , the public might be tempted to switch to nuclear energy because nuclear energy , like wind energy and light energy , is environmentally friendly and very energy-efficient .
However , nuclear power still raises many concerns with regards to cost and security .
Until these concerns are eradicated , other safer and cheaper sources of energy would be preferred ahead of nuclear power .

Nowadays , with the threat of green house effect and the increasing need for energy , people are urgently looking for new energy resources .
Nuclear power , as a powerful new energy , stands out with its high energy-generating potential and relatively low emission of green house gas , such as carbon dioxide .
However , considering the nuclear plant accidents happened in the past few decades , the public is very concerned about the security issues and high cost of nuclear plants .
Some people are even calling for a stop on the usage of nuclear power .
Arguments rise on whether we should continue researching on nuclear energy or not .
In my opinion , we should not stop the research and development on this powerful new energy resource .
Instead , we should believe that nuclear power has a bright future .
Some people may say that nuclear plants have very high risks .
They say that it is technologically impossible to build up a 100% secure nuclear plant .
Every nuclear plant must have a possibility to face operation failure; with the number of nuclear plants increases , the sum of the possibility increases as well .
If there is a nuclear leak or an exposure , the harmful radiation will kill a lot of people1 .
Their argument seems to be persuasive , but they forget the fact that every energy workspace has a chance to face failure .
According to Davis (2006) , the average death in coal industry in only one country , China , has reaches 8 ,000 per year , not to mention the death and injury rate all over the world2 .
Additionally , Cohen (2009) made a calculation to show that nuclear plant accidents were not serious and the probability of nuclear plant accidents was very low: only if there were 25 fuel melt-down per year , might nuclear power become as dangerous as coal burning , but the fuel melt-down rate was actually less than 0 .00005% .
Moreover , the Generation = 3 \* ROMAN III reactors which we are using now and the Generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors which are under research and test , use the design called ''defense in depth" .
Every reactor has several back-up systems .
If there was something wrong , the first back-up system would start to work to limit the harm .
If the first back-up system failed , another back-up system would take the place , etc .
Certainly , it is possible that all the back-up systems fail in the same accident , but the probability is extremely small3 .
Therefore , we should believe that modern science and technology can ensure the security of nuclear plants .
In addition , there are people worrying about the sustainability of nuclear power .
According to the theory , uranium is the necessary energy source , yet the quantity of the element uranium on the earth is very limited .
If we keep using the current technology , the supply of uranium may only last 30 to 60 years depending on the needs for energy1 .
However , this kind of calculation is not accurate .
It is because the heat efficiency in current nuclear plants is only 1% , which means 99% of the energy generated by nuclear plants is wasted4 , but Scientists have already found out ways to increase the heat efficiency .
In VHTR's prototype , the electricity generated is 50% more than the current nuclear plants5 .
Furthermore , a Chinese engineer , Wang Hongqing , has found out the technology to increase the heat efficiency from 1% to over 60%4 .
As a result , we can extend the life of nuclear power by at least several hundreds of years .
Another concern about nuclear power is that the radioactive waste is very hard to be dealt with .
The waste needs to be carefully kept away from people for several thousand years .
In addition , nuclear waste may become tools for terrorists , which is very dangerous .
However , one of the concepts of the Gen = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors , very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , can solve this problem .
In the design of VHTR system , the radioactive uranium and plutonium will run automatically into the recycle so that it can offer an enhanced waste minimization6 .
Therefore , there will be no need to worry about the nuclear waste reprocessing .
Furthermore , it is much easier for us to develop nuclear technology than explore other new energy resources .
People have already had a relatively mature technology on nuclear power .
We have known the theory and been aware of the process .
What should we do is to develop the technology other than spend much more time and money exploring a totally new field .
This turns out to be the truth .
Within a few years , people have come up with the concepts of the Gen = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors .
These concepts overcome many difficulties and make a lot of improvements which can make nuclear power "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation-resistant"5 .
In addition , the Gen = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors will achieve more than what we expect .
The new nuclear plants will not only generate huge amount of electricity , but also a considerable amount of hydrogen which is also a prosperous and useful green energy .
In conclusion , we should not be afraid of the failures or difficulties .
Instead , we need to try our best to overcome any difficulties and improve our technology .
We should have faith in ourselves and believe that nuclear power's new dawn is coming .
There are many engineering accidents happened in the past and now they are still not avoided .
Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion is one of the incidents occurred on 26 April 1986 .
This accident killed 30 people and the radioactive effect has caused 56 fatalities till the year of 2004 (WNA , 2009) .
The main cause of the most accidents is directed to operators' error .
It can be insufficient knowledge of operators , inadequate training of operators , poor design and poor communication among team members .
However , further investigations showed that these could be prevented at the initial stage which was at the design stage .
In the journal written by Wilpert (2007) , the use of psychology in the design process could help to prevent accidents from happening or at least minimize the damage from the accidents .
It is currently encouraged to all design process especially in engineering design to have psychology knowledge involved .
A design engineer is also a human , thus he/she may make mistakes at the design stage too .
This could be noticed from the design being corrected after an accident and even including the operation manual .
In Chernobyl nuclear plant , reactor unit 4 had a very high positive void coefficient which led to a rapid increase of power when there was steam generated (Chernobyl , n .d .) .
This was very dangerous when excess steam was produced; especially this system was not incorporated with good safety features .
After the incident occurred , the reactor was modified to have much lower positive void coefficient .
From this point , it showed that the reactor was an error design product .
Furthermore , the accident could have been prevented if designer had done it right at the beginning .
As Wilpert (2007) suggested , psychology , in fact , could help the design process to consider on how human mistakes could be prevented or at least reduced .
If the designer could have thought the fatal effects from the reactor explosion , he/she would have thought the possibility causes and conditions , thus the designer might not use such a high positive void coefficient and more appropriate safety features would be integrated .
Wilpert (2007) also mentioned that the most common problem encountered in everyday design product including engineering product is the different perspective between designer and user .
Designer usually thinks that user may know how to use the product by reading through the manual provided .
This is also experienced by design engineers .
They make assumption that operators would know how to handle the equipments when the process is offset , thus a potential safety features are not necessary .
On the other hand , operators assume that designers have set all the equipment in such a way that is easy and safe for operation .
In worse condition , alarms would be triggered and equipments would be shut down .
As a result , in most accidents , operators would be pointed as the main cause of the accident .
Insufficient knowledge and training of operators result in panic under offset condition and also violating the normal procedures .
It occurred in Chernobyl disaster where the operators shut down the cooling system and removed control rods in order to maintain the power level for carrying out the test .
When there was a surge of power , they tried to put back control rods , hoped that power level could be lowered .
In fact , it did not happen as expected; the power increased dramatically and explosion occurred .
When psychology is incorporated in design engineer's thoughts , this accident could be prevented .
Psychology could lead the design engineer to be aware of others either in physical or mental behaviour (Wagner , n .d .) .
Design engineer would try to see the situation from the perspective of operators .
As a result , easy-understood manual will be provided , more accurate safety systems would be installed and sufficient training and sharing session between design engineers and operators would be conducted to have common opinions instead of assumptions .
In fact , psychology had been used in the past for improving human behaviours by selecting , training and motivating the operators in industries .
However , this might have been avoided due to time constraints and financial limit which result in insufficient time for design engineers to analyse the design and looking for other cheaper materials for substitution .
As a result , one small mistake of a worker could lead to a huge damage to the plant and also to the surrounding environment especially for nuclear plant .
Therefore , nowadays there is an encouragement to have human scientists (psychologists) in the design team (Wilpert , 2007) .
Psychologist is not only a scientist seeking knowledge for others to use , but also a technologist who is actively involving in the planning and design man-operated system (Taylor , 1957) .
In other words , system design is an applied psychology because of its human reference; by converting design engineers to psychologists or at least having psychology knowledge may help in design process as they would take into account of human behavior .
A correct design at the beginning stage is very important to prevent accident .
Most of the accidents occurred because of human errors either done by operators or even designer at the design stage .
As design engineers and operators are human beings , psychology could have been integrated in the design process to analyse possible errors from the design and human behaviours .
Moreover , with psychology knowledge , a design engineer would be capable of predicting the situation under worse condition .
Hence , system would be incorporated with proper safety features to prevent accident .
With the introduction of the Generation IV reactors in 2001 , a fresh wave of debate on Nuclear Power was brought up .
The common topics like safety , security and cost and performance are once again discussed .
The goals of Generation IV reactors are set towards sustainability , economical viability , safety and reliability , resistance to proliferation risks and protection from external attacks (Cogeneration Technologies , 2002) .
With these goals , six new models are introduced (see Table 1) , of which Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) should be further developed comparative to the other .
The reasons being that VHTR addresses the worries of public against nuclear power , such as safety , pollution and cost and performance issues .
There is a need for our world to move towards nuclear energy due to three reasons .
Firstly , the tremendous increase in consumption of energy due to growing population and development of nations .
Secondly , the depletion of natural resources is at a much faster rate due fore mentioned reason .
Lastly , the increased concern for global warming in recent years .
With these three reasons , it is thus wise for us to move towards relying on nuclear power for energy and support it , especially with advance technology where Generation IV reactors are so well developed as shown below .
Currently there are only about 400 nuclear plants worldwide and one of the most important concerns that hinder the development of nuclear power is its safety problem .
Nuclear plant operates at extremely high temperatures and it relies heavily on coolants to reduce temperature .
Any malfunctioning of the cooling agent will have devastating consequences when the nuclear plant melts .
However , VHTR addresses this problem by using helium as its coolant , which can reach extremely low temperatures (Butler , 2004) .
As such , the temperature of the core is maintained at a low temperature to deter melting .
In addition , Helium itself is an inert gas , which will not react with the radioactive waste or substances in reactor .
This is much safer compared to Sodium-Cooled reactor , since Sodium is explosive in contact with air or water .
Therefore , VHTR is operating safer compared to other reactors .
However , one concern would be that Helium is a natural occurring element with limited quantity that would soon deplete pushing price higher (James , 1996) .
Hence the research and development of VHTR should also look into other alternatives so that the reactor can continue to function in the event of Helium's depletion .
VHTR is also an environmentally friendly plant as its main emissions are electricity and hydrogen , in fact , it does not produce any material waste as compared to other reactors .
Hence , it does not contribute to the worsening of Global Warming .
Hydrogen produced is recycled within the plant itself for further production and there is also a maximization of resources .
Therefore , VHTR makes a cleaner Nuclear Energy .
Although the VHTR is environmentally friendly , there is an unavoidable leakage of radioactive waste .
These effects are serious as it can cause extreme damage to the human body and environment .
Such wastes can affect the environment for as long as 100 decades .
For instance , the meltdown of the Three Mile reactor in USA has resulted in the land being inhabitable for more than 20 years (Butler , 2006) .
However , it is known that for VHTR , such waste will stay in the atmosphere for a few decades compared to the norm of about a millennium .
VHTR is thus a better reactor .
Apart from safety and environmental issues , Nuclear Energy should be encouraged due to its lower costs in the long run .
Although the initial startup cost of building a plant is high , the cost is spread over a larger consumption area .
For example , the world's largest nuclear plant can produce electricity to 16 million households , which is the equivalent of 16 ,000 largest wind turbines (Hans , 2006) .
Hence energy costs are reduced when spread over a larger consumption area , which is especially important in the light of rising oil prices .
A possible problem to lower energy costs could surface as the price for raw materials for Nuclear Energy increases .
Uranium , which is used to power Nuclear Plants , is a naturally occurring element .
Hence , it may deplete and that would push prices up .
At the moment , the price has increased by more than 3 times to US$168/kg (Sevior) .
The R&D group of VHTR must then look into this issue so that the benefits that Nuclear Plants bring do not end up being a liability .
In conclusion , I feel that the development of VHTR should not be hindered by the problems mentioned above .
Although there may be many valid concerns , VHTR is the best in safety and performance .
However we should not be complacent and continue to improve and foresee future problems that the VHTR may develop in the future , so that Nuclear Energy continues to be viable and safe .
Presently , they should look into the problem of cooling agents , as well as other alternatives for Uranium .
These reactors are likely to be relied on as a possible source of energy for at least the next two to three decades (James , 1996) .
Other than such technical problems we should also look into the possible human misuse in Nuclear Energy and take caution not to let any disaster happen .
Table 1(7)
For quite some time now , there has been concern among the pubic over the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
This has caused us to oppose new nuclear plant projects .
Our dependence on fossil fuels necessarily needs to reduce because of its depletion and possible exhaustion in the near future and also due to the harmful effects on the environment by using them .
This makes shifting to alternative sources of fuel inevitable .
Newer ideas and technological improvements are possible if the necessary funding is directed towards the research of nuclear power and technologies like them .
Since , nuclear power does not affect the environment as drastically as fossil fuels , if its waste is well managed , and provides much higher ration of power to the amount of fuel used , it is the most feasible fuel source available to us .
Of the various nuclear power plant technologies , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is the safest .
Implementing this reactor for power production is an achievable goal to set for a sooner transformation to nuclear power .
Since the VHTR uses helium as a coolant , it can go to temperatures of up to 10000C as compared the 3000C of the earlier reactors as the earlier reactors use high pressured water as their coolant .
Another fascinating fact is that the VHTR's waste goes back to its repository and that it can produce hydrogen from water due to its high working temperature .
The above mentioned facts distinguish the VHTR from the Generation III reactors and define reactors like the VHTR and the VHTR itself as a "model of the Generation IV reactors" (Clair , 2005) .
Even after these many safety features , as mentioned above , it is hard for lay men to get over the dreadful accidents that took place in the Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 .
Moreover , the possibility of being able to make nuclear warheads and other weaponry from the active plutonium created in the power plants coupled with the trouble of nuclear waste disposal has maintained the our dilemma .
This has setback the testing and case-based application of new nuclear technologies , though they actually can make a difference .
The first opposing factor is that , there have been accidents in many technologies that man has developed through time .
The Chernobyl and Three Mile Island incidents are no different from a normal technical error .
These errors are prone to happen in any technology with the level of complication as the nuclear technology .
But , it is to be noted that these errors are fatal and long lasting .
This has been taken into consideration always by scientists , but mistakes happen .
But in the Generation IV reactors safety is as important an issue as implementation of new technologies .
The VHTR , being "passively safe" (Hansen , 2008) , is self sustained in case of emergency by shutting itself down safely .
The present scientific advancements and engineering precision ensure the above mentioned safety feature of the VHTR .
There will be no more of nuclear spill , loss of human lives or even an injury for workers within the nuclear plant in case of in-plant emergency .

The second opposing factor is the problems that are anticipated if high grade plutonium is being produced .
In the conventional reprocessing method , uranium and plutonium are separated effectively .
This is costly and also gives manageable weapons grade plutonium as an outcome , which is not desired .
The new form of reprocessing adds more steps to the earlier process; "converting long-lived wastes to elements with shorter half-life periods" (Butler , 2004) .
This reduces storage time .
Along with the above , it also promises to "create plutonium spiked with heat-producing radioactive elements to make it too hot to handle" (Hansen , 2008) .
The third concern considered , is the nuclear waste disposal .
The above re-processing method actually converts the long lived isotopes to elements with lower half lives .
This is advantageous for waste management too .
These short lived elements need to be stored only for a few centuries compared to the three hundred or more centuries the earlier waste needed to be stored for  .
In VHTR however , since waste is sent back to the repository , there is absolutely for the waste recycling process .
The recycling is done only for the completely used uranium fuel  .
The above mentioned facts state that the newer technologies are much ahead of the older ones .
Accidents are sure to be a thing of the past .
There will not be the problem of terrorism due to stolen plutonium or induced accidents in nuclear power plants .
Moreover , there is a requirement of research in these technologies , as there is the risk of exhaustion and harmful effects due to the excessive use of fossil fuels .
Amongst the available technologies , the VHTR is the safest as mentioned above .
Thus , it is evident that by funding the research of VHTR and the technologies that VHTR needs , there can be a turnover in nuclear technologies .
This is the most feasible short term option open to the world .

Nuclear power plant technology started from 1950s .
Even though it developed very fast in the past decades , it is facing a big problem now that nuclear output is worldwide shrinking .
This is partially because of horror left by the disasters of 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , and of 1986 at Chernobyl , Ukraine (Butler , 2004) .
Now people are more concerned about the safety instead of the benefits of nuclear power .
Therefore they keep on object against nuclear technology .
In order to change the negative situation of nuclear power , in 2001 , the Generation IV International Forum( GIF) leaded a new starting of developing next generation nuclear energy systems which are " safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant" (Butler , 2004) .
There are six designs are believed to be the best prospects (see Table 1) .
Based on the goals for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is expected to be a better choice than other five reactors .
This essay will evaluate this new reactor focus on three aspects: safety , sustainability and economics .

First , VHTR has very good safety features .
But only from the table , Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) system seems to be the safest among the six reactors , because of its not very high temperature and low pressure .
Especially the primary system operates at essentially atmospheric pressure (Lineberry & Allen , 2004) .
There is another safety feature of SFR that a secondary sodium system is a buffer between the primary system's radioactive sodium and the power plant's energy conversion system .
It is true that these two safety features provide SFR operating safety , but it is still dangerous when core exposures or coolant does not work .
For VHTR , safety is definitely guaranteed because of its inherent safety characteristics which can cool itself down in the event of an emergency .
Since VHTR has refractory core , low power density , low excess reactivity uninsulated steel vessel , it is easy to remove passive decay heat from core through the natural processes of radiation , conduction and convection (McCreery & Condie , 2006) .
Therefore the VHTR's limit core temperatures are retained in the ceramic fuel particles without the necessity for operator Intervention .
Secondly , VHTR is environmental friendly and sustainable .
There is still some experts' stance on Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) System .
On one hand it can minimize the waste of fuels since it has a closed fuel cycle .
On the other hand , LFR has a long-life battery as the refueling interval usually is 15 to 20 years (Generation IV Nuclear Reactors , 2009) .
Nevertheless VHTR will be more sustainable than LFR as the Ultra-long life VHTR systems can be developed with minor actinides (MA) .
MA is a fuel component , which can help develop new fuel cycles and keep sustainability of a fuel source .
As a result , VHTR can keep on operation for long lifetime without intermediate refueling .
Furthermore the environmental impact of VHTR is positive , since both roust fuel and coolant (Helium) do not release significant radiation .
Last but not the least , VHTR is designed to be a highefficiency reactor , meaning that it can help to make great economic profit .
On the other hand , scientists support Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) because both its coolant and fuel can use same liquid salts to save materials .
And MSR operates in closed fuel cycle to avoid waste the fuel and coolant .
Unfortunately , MSR has a death-blow , the resulting corrosion of reactor components after long-term chemistry and handling of molten salt .
As mentioned that VHTR acts as high efficiency design , besides normal production of electricity it also supplies heat with core outlet temperature of 1000 Celsius (Forsberg , 2008) .
With the heat , it is efficient to process petrochemical industry or sea water desalination .
And the most important application is hydrogen production .
Since hydrogen is one of the clearest energy in the world and it is not easy to produce , the heat produced by VHTR can help to solve this big problem .
In addition , compared with conventional plants , VHTR also can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel (Butler , 2004) .
As a result , VHTR can provide a more economic energy to meet the demand of the world .
In general , it is valuable to research and develop VHTR to meet the goals of new generation in future , since it has significant advantages among the six Generation IV reactors .
First it has advanced safe design , which can automatically cool itself down when accident without additional operating system .
Secondly , VHTR has high sustainability and is also environmental friendly .
Last it provides a more efficient system , thus the economic benefits from it cannot be neglected .
Therefore , choosing VHTR to be a new energy supply is the best choice .
Two years ago on 1st August , 2007 , an accident that shocked the world happened .
The I-35W Mississippi River Bridge in the US state of Minnesota collapsed suddenly , "killing at least 7 people" .
There were at least 60 casualties and 50 vehicles thrown into the water .
(BBC News , 2007) .
The bridge was built in 1964 and officially opened to traffic in 1967 .
It consists of 8 lanes moving in two directions and is used by 140 ,000 cars a day (Minnesota Department of Transportation , 2007) .
The bridge "had been inspected annually since 1993" and "the last fracture critical inspection was in 2006" (Minnesota Department of Transportation , 2007) .
With regards to this incident , many might argue that the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
Psychology is defined as "the science of mind and behavior" (Psychology , n .d) .
Hence , supporters to the use of psychology might argue that the use of psychology during the design process means to improve the thought process and reinforce engineering ethics .
This might have reduced the chance of the accident happening .
However , to say that it would have prevented the whole accident , I would see it as too extreme .
Firstly , supporters to the use of psychology may argue that "a deficiency in engineering ethics is found to be one of the root causes of an engineering failure" (Department of Materials Science and Engineering , University of New York at Stony Brook , 2008) .
The use of psychology during the design process might be able to improve engineering ethnics , thus , reducing the chance of an engineering accident happening .
However , there are many other causes which might lead to an engineering accident .
Below are some statistical data on the causes of failure:
9) Others  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% (Department of Materials Science and Engineering , University of New York at Stony Brook , 2008)
For the above data , we can classify them under two categories of factors - psychology or non-psychology .
Base on the definition of psychology mentioned in paragraph 1 , Factors 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 and 8 can be classified under psychology and it adds up to 40% .
Supporters to the use of psychology might argue that this is a high percentage; hence the use of psychology in the design process would have prevented the accident .
However , this is not true .
Non-psychology factors add up to 60% which is more than psychology factors .
Moreover , the use of psychology during the design process will not reduce these 40% to 0% .
Therefore , we can see that the use of psychology might reduce the chance of an accident caused by engineering failure but would not prevent it .
Secondly , supporters to use of psychology may argue that the use of psychology in the design process will improve the thought process of an engineer , thus improving the design and safety of the product which could prevent accidents from happening .
However , I would like to make use of an analogy .
To say that the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident would be as good as saying that if you studied hard and memorised everything , you would be able to prevent mistakes during the exam .
However , we all know that this cannot be true .
By studying more , it only reduces the chance of making mistakes during exam but definitely not prevent it .
Similarly , the use of psychology might reduce the chance of engineers making mistakes in their design .
However , it does not mean that they will not make mistakes as they are still factors like human error which cannot be eliminated through the use of psychology .
In the article Psychology and design processes , the author mentioned that all human beings make mistakes , including engineers .
"Design engineers may make mistakes , too , namely in their designs" (Wilpert , 2007) .
Therefore , whether or not there is the use of psychology during the design process , it is inevitable that engineers make mistakes .
Hence , it is inevitable to prevent accidents from happening .
Lastly , many times in life after an incident has happened , be it serious or minor , the two words that are most commonly heard would be 'if only' .
However , no one can guarantee that the incident would not have happened even if more precautions had been undertaken .
Instead of thinking whether accidents of the past could have been prevented , why not think of how to greatly reduce the chance of future accidents happening ?
The use of psychology might be one direction to go towards .
However , no matter how safe the end product of an engineering design may be , unforeseen circumstances will still occur .
Hence , I believe that the use of psychology during the design process would not have prevented the accident .
In conclusion , I do not deny the fact that the use of psychology to improve engineering ethics and refine the thought process involved in the design stage helps in reducing the occurrence of accidents .
However , there are still many factors that cannot be eliminated through the use of psychology .
Therefore , I believe that the use of psychology during the design process would not have prevented the collapse of the Mississippi River Bridge on 1st August 2007 .

The supercritical water reactor is one type of generation IV reactors .
Till now , all the six types of generation IV reactor are under the research of Generation IV International Forum (GIF) , which consists of thirteen countries all over the world (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2002) .
As one of the most practical generation IV reactors , the supercritical water reactor has many advantages over the generation III reactors such as the higher efficiency .
However , there are still a lot of concerns mainly about the safety issue , the complicated configuration and the waste production .
But in my opinion , the supercritical water reactor is actually simpler , safer and has less nuclear waste compared to the generation III reactor which we widely use nowadays .
Many people may think that the generation IV reactor is much more complicated and expensive to build .
Furthermore , all of them use the quite new concept which is not practical at all (Butler , 2004) .
Actually , for the supercritical water reactor , it is not correct .
The supercritical water reactor is based on the light water reactor we use nowadays and becomes simpler in the configuration because that it uses the supercritical water as the moderator and the coolant (Mori , 2005) .
The supercritical water is the light water under the great pressure above its critical point .
In this condition , the steam of the light water will have the same density and can be mixed with the light water .
In the lighter water reactor , the light water will boiling in the core vessel so that it produce a lot steam as bubbles in the light water , so that the light water reactor needs a lot of equipments to control these bubbles such as steam generators , steam separators and dryers (Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) .
In the supercritical water reactor , all these components can be eliminated so that the supercritical water reactor can be much simpler and easier to build .

Another concern about the safety issue is very common .
The supercritical water reactor is working at much higher temperature(500 C) and pressure than the generation III reactor(Butler , 2004) .
It is a dangerous operating temperature in the concept of today .
In fact , due to the higher temperature and pressure , the reactor can , however , be safer .
At first , the whole concept of the supercritical water reactor is based on the light water reactor which has already used for years .
The technique is already mature .
The supercritical water is also used in different areas for a long time , so that the supercritical water reactor can be a practical innovation and it is very safe .
Secondly , as I mentioned above , the steam has the same density and can be mixed with the liquid , so that the whole moderator have the nearly same density everywhere .
It will be much easier to control the pure liquid compared to the liquid mixed with the bubbles .
Actually , these voids in the liquid are chaotic and can be very dangerous because that the liquid and the steam have totally different properties .
Lastly , the special supercritical water property also makes other procedures can be easily controlled such as cooling part (Magnus , 2006) .
The supercritical water reactor can be safer compared to the light water reactor .
There are still a lot of people worrying about the nuclear waste of the supercritical water reactor (U .S . Envioromental Protection Angency , 2004) .
Some of the reactors need to depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste which will separate the plutonium which can be used to make nuclear weapons .
Nevertheless , the supercritical water reactor will not depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste , thus it will not separate the plutonium (Butler , 2004) .
Besides , the supercritical water reactor is can also be developed with a fast neutron spectrum due to the neutron will be only partly moderated in the supercritical water .
Being a fast neutron reactor will split the long lived actinides , destroying the most long lived nuclear waste through nuclear transmutation , which will greatly reduce the nuclear waste it produces and increase the efficiency of the reactor (GIF , 2007) .
From these two points , we can see that the supercritical water reactor does well in dealing with the nuclear waste .
Although the supercritical water reactor is still under the research , it has already shown a lot of advantages .
It successfully resolves the public doubts about the safety , configuration and the waste production and gives us a bright and promising future of the nuclear power .
I believe that the generation IV reactor will break the energy source composition and bring us to a new age of nuclear power .

We are on the brink of time whereby the global warming will affect the earth severely if we don't act appropriately .
The world population is 6 .8 billion to the current date and is increasing rapidly (US Census Bureau , 2009) .
In order to provide electricity to the increasing population , governments around the world have to build more power plants to maintain undisrupted power supply to the cities .
U .S . EIA , Energy Information Administration , estimated that up to 65% of energy sources for the power generators come from oil and coal (Hong , 1994) .
These conventional power generators contribute to the increasing trend of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere , important factor for global warming .
In order to stoop global warming , we must reduce carbon dioxide production .
One alternative way will be the Nuclear power .
Nuclear energy is produced from the fission of uranium elements in the nuclear reactors which produce massive heat .
This intense heat can be converted into energy source and distributed as electricity .
There are some public concerns regarding the safety and security of nuclear plants .
But accidents occurred in the past were mainly because of lack of skilled workers and security (Major , 2008) .
In the new Generation IV reactors , the possibilities of accidents will be minimized by allowing the reactors to run at high temperatures up to 1000 degree Celsius (Butler , 2004) .
Among the six technologies mentioned , very high-temperature reactors concept has most potential to be a break-through in nuclear technology and therefore its research should be further supported and funded .
Oppositions concern that melt-down of nuclear reactors will occur in the long run .
They also point out that the operating temperature of current generation generators are high .
For example , in the Chernobyl accident , the reactor melted down and exploded because of overheating inside the cores of reactor .
The radioactive materials from the reactor was spread out to the surrounding areas which caused radiation poisoning and The main advantage of Very-High-Temperature-Reactor , VHTR , is that the reactor can operate in the extreme temperature up to 1000 degree Celsius (Generation IV , 2006) .
This is achieved by using Helium as a coolant instead of water .
Helium can withstand high temperature and it is inert gas so it won't react with other materials (VHTR , 2008) .
Other new technologies can only operate up to 600-800 degree Celsius (Butler , 2004) .
This fact makes the VHTR more thermally efficient than other types of reactors .
As it can withstand high temperature , melt-downs will not occur so frequently .
Therefore , it would be beneficial to concentrate our research into this VHTR technology .
Nuclear plants can reprocess waste products from reactors to get back up to 95% of raw materials to reuse .
Proponents claim that nuclear reprocessing will lead to serious complications such as nuclear race and terrorism .
It is because reprocessing can produce plutonium which is use in nuclear war-heads .
United States prohibits reprocessing and also encourages countries not to reprocess the waste materials (Butler , 2004) .
Reactor technologies such as Gas-Cooled and Molten Salt Reactors involve reprocessing which is not suitable with current regulations about plutonium .
So , researching into these technologies will raise conflicts among countries .
In the VHTR technology , waste directly goes to repository which involves no recycling or reprocessing .
Therefore , it clears the concerns of public as well as governments around the world .
The transportation sector alone will cause the demand of oil and fuel up by 78% at the year of 2025 (Butler , 2004) .
Therefore , we cannot solely depend on our fossil fuels for this problem .
There are alternative source of fuel in the market nowadays .
The most popular one is Fuel cell which is made from hydrogen .
Some technologies like Supercritical and Sodium-water-cooled reactors are unable to produce hydrogen .
On the other hand , VHTR technology has both electricity and hydrogen output .
While electricity can be used to power up houses , hydrogen can be converted into fuel cells which can power up automobiles and vehicles .
Fuel cells have theoretical efficiency of 80% compared to diesel which is only about 40% (Crea , 2004) .
Therefore , we can be rest-assured that future nuclear reactors like VHTR can meet the industrial demands and thus its research should be funded .
Among the six technologies described in Butler's Article , Very-High-Temperature-Reactor Technology best fits the requirements and expectations of nuclear technology .
The thermal efficiency is the most important element of VHTR compare to other technologies .
Combined with the non-reprocessing nature of this reactor , VHTR will become a choice of technology for engineers and governments to focus their attention to develop .
In addition , hydrogen power output of VHTR is an additional incentive that VHTR is worth researching .
In conclusion , VHTR has very promising path to be the generator of the future and we should channel our efforts to further develop and research the technology to be able to use broadly .
By 2030 , the world demand for energy is predicted to rise by about 50 percent and by 2050 , it will be doubled .
This prediction indicates that we need to find alternative source of energy in order to continue our daily life .
Clearly , it seems that the nuclear power is a good alternative .
However when we talk about nuclear , people will usually associate it with radiation , wastes and missiles .
Also public opposition was given as one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries .
With the increasing demand for energy and prices for fossil fuel , the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) comes out with the new concepts of the Generation IV nuclear reactors .
These reactors have the potential to provide safe base-load electric power with negligible pollutants (Hansen , 2008) .
Out of the six generation IV reactor concepts , I consider that the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of the best concepts for further development of nuclear reactor .
Opponents of the public of nuclear energy are worried about the safety of nuclear power in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl accident in 1986 .
Another issue is the problem of managing those radioactive wastes that are generated during the operation of nuclear reactors .
However , the generation IV reactors are able to burn existing prolonged nuclear waste , produce only a little amount of waste that will last for decades only (Hansen , 2008) .
These wastes are stored into a special concrete storage cylinder to prevent the radiation from leaking to the environment .
Besides that , the nuclear reactor design strategy of generation IV reactors for preventing accidents and mitigating their potential effects is defense in depth (Cohen , n .d) .
This will mean that there will always be a backup system to limit the harm done if something fails .
If that backup system should also fail , there will always be another back-up system to replace it .
In VHTR , helium is used as the coolant instead of water .
Since Helium is an inert gas , it will not chemically react with any material .
Furthermore , exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive , unlike most other possible coolants like water .
Opponents mention that the cost of building a nuclear plant will be very expensive due to the high capital costs and licensing uncertainties associated with the construction (Goswami & Kreith , 2008) .
Other costs include fuel cycle cost as well as waste management costs which result in higher electricity cost .
These costs do not include in other power generation technologies such as coal power station .
Yet the costs for nuclear power generation have been dropping significantly over the last decade .
The decline in the cost of electricity by nuclear energy is the result of decline in the cost of nuclear plant fuel , operations and maintenance , improved technology .
With increased research and development along with adoption of nuclear power generation by more countries , the cost will be reduced even further .
Lastly , the final argument made by the public is that there are many alternative cheap , clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and tidal .
Also it is possible to switch to using coal or natural gases to produce energy once fossil fuels depleted .
Yet these clean energy sources have their limitations too .
For instance , solar energy is produced when the sun is shining .
During the night or bad weather , the expensive solar equipment will be useless .
Also the amount of electric energy produced from this technology is far less than current power plants .
It is not feasible to build many solar or tidal powers all around the lands and seas .
On the other hand , Nuclear energy does not have all these limitations .
Fuel sources for it are virtually unlimited and could last much longer than fossil fuels .
Nuclear energy is also regarded as one of the clean energy available today as it doesn't produce any pollutants that contribute to environmental problems .
It is possible for nuclear to be the mainstream energy production when combined with other renewable energy such as solar power .
Nuclear energy also offers higher electric power efficiencies than the current power production .
Moreover due to VHTR's high operating temperature of above 1000 C , it offers the potential for cogeneration of electricity and hydrogen , alongside process heat applications ("Very-High-Temperature Reactor" , n .d) .
Generation IV nuclear reactor concepts offer significant enhancements in sustainability , safety and reliability and economics over currently energy production technologies .
VHTR is the better one among the six nuclear reactor concepts as VHTR allows for the cogeneration of both electricity and hydrogen .
Nevertheless , the high operating temperature and pressure and corrosive operating conditions of the VHTR require materials that surpass the limitations of current nuclear reactors (Generation IV Nuclear Reactor Comparisons , 2008) .
Therefore , great deal of further research and development is needed in order for it to be commercially deployed by 2030 .
As quoted by Patrick Moore , Greenpeace co-founder , "It is a big mistake if we lump nuclear medicine in with nuclear weapons .
In retrospect , is that because we were so focused on the destructive aspect of nuclear war and technology , we used to think that all nuclear were evil ."
No nuclear plants have been ordered in United State as a result of public's misconception that nuclear powers are highly vulnerable until recently , it is necessary , that people become more aware of the magnitude of climate change as a result of global warming phenomenon .
By general consensus , booming demand of electricity , increasing prices for coal and fuel have driven the development of nuclear power in recent years .
The availability of Uranium and the dwindling fossil fuels have made nuclear power more feasible as people want to maintain natural resources .
To keep up with globalization , we should seriously consider the study of Generation IV concept reactors , which promise higher efficiency of output as an alternative source of energy .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) , an international association that carry out research and development required to establish the performance and feasibility of the next generation nuclear reactors , have identified six nuclear systems employing different type of reactors , coolant , waste cycle technologies .
However , each reactor has its pros and cons in term of security , cost and performance .
Opponent proposed that nuclear powers are highly vulnerable as nuclear reactors have the probability of becoming terrorist target .
The incidents of core melt-down at Three Mile Island in March 1979 and the explosion and fire at Chernobyl in April cast a melancholy over the nuclear industry and it raised public fear of catastrophe .
In order to sway nuclear-adverse public , the Generation IV concept's reactors need to yield less radioactive waste at terrorist-proof facilities .
In term of security , reactors that do not reprocess nuclear waste are favored as plutonium waste , a key ingredient for developing advanced nuclear weapon , will not be generated .
To abstain nuclear proliferation , the other four reactors were eliminated , left with only two designs - very high temperature reactor (VHTR) and supercritical-water reactor (SCWR) , which would able to operate without having to reprocess and recycle plutonium waste .
Besides , Generation IV reactors employ nuclear materials , which are less suitable , or less prone to diversion for use in nuclear weapon .
For example , by increasing the radiological intensity of materials , it is hard for people to handle it without severely expose to radioactive if highly specialized shielding equipment is not used .
On the other hand , in term of performance , very high temperature reactors operate at temperature around 900 C , allowing more efficient conversion of heat electricity .
Besides , VHTR can be used to separate hydrogen from water thermodynamically at the operating range of temperature 700-900 C . By using fuel cell , hydrogen gas can be converted to electricity , replacing the uses of fuel or gasoline .
Statistics show that VHTR are able to yield 50% more electricity from the equivalent amount of fuel compared to conventional plants .
However , to function at such high temperature , helium gas , instead of water must be used as its coolant .
Inert helium gas provides another level of redundancy to the safety of the reactor as it acts as a non-reactive cooling medium .
These factors have combined and made the VHTR number one choice , outbidding the SCWR .
In term of cost , Generation IV reactors are designed to be economically viable .
The generating cost should not be too high but competitive as compared with other energy source .
On the other hands , the capital investment cost should be sufficiently low for developing nuclear system .
Some critics that VHTR's building cost are relatively expensive as compared to SCWR .
This is because the design of the cycle for SCWR is pretty simplistic as it does not require the use of jet pumps , pressurizes or dryers .
One of the greatest aspects about SCWR is the implausible small size of reactor itself , as compared as other reactors of Generation IV .
Nevertheless , some countries such as the United State and France prefers the VHTR rather the SCWR .
In spite of the fact that cost of building for VHTR is relatively higher , two products are generated for the price of one .
Besides , the VHTR deployment is earlier than most of the Generation IV reactors , which is aimed to be on the year of 2020 .
The United State energy bill would provide a sum of USD 1 .1 billion to build a research prototype at Idaho lab .
In short , VHTR is the best choice among the six Generation IV reactors .
In term of security , it produces no waste , especially plutonium , as waste goes directly into repository .
In term of cost , VHTR able to generate electricity and hydrogen for the price of one , which is estimated to be roughly $1 billion .
In term of performance , VHTR generates electricity at efficiency as high as 50% .
VHTR is likely to be the most advanced concept in terms of practical experience as Japan already operating a similar high temperature reactor at Oarai .
Nonetheless , VHTR faces material constrain as the materials use to design reactor must be able to withstand continued high temperature , intense bombardment in nuclear proliferation and corrosive reagents .
Therefore , it is ideal that GIF should start siphoning funds to conduct intensive researches on nuclear power plants .
Nuclear energy has always been shrouded in controversy .
The debate on whether nuclear power should be utilised is due to the highly unpredictable materials used to generate energy and its multiple safety issues .
It is widely regarded as a cheap alternative source of electricity to alleviate the pressures of fossil fuels depletive nature .
Two new ideas for reactors that can exploit the power of the nucleus are the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR)and the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) .
MSRs are generation IV reactors that use molten salts such as fluoride salts to prevent system overheating .
The salts are combined with fissile materials such as uranium in a mixture .
The MSR operates at a low temperature and pressure , and have efficient waste recycling methods .
The VHTR , however , uses helium as a coolant and operates at a high temperature and pressure , without any form of waste recycling .
As such , I am in favour of the MSR over the VHTR .
Though the VHTR possesses commendable qualities , the MSR is a better investment as a generation IV reactor .
First and foremost , the cost of building a VHTR is much cheaper than that of a MSR , it being 30% cheaper to build as compared to the MSR .
Though the costs incurred are higher for the MSR , it compensates by raising its efficiency .
At 1000 C , the MSR projects a yield of 60% while the VHTR only garners just over 50% in yield .
Moreover , the MSR saves fuel by reusing it .
It utilises Actinide Management (Pickard & Forsberg , 2002) that allows for efficient recycling of fissile fuel .
The VHTR , instead , uses a once-through fuel cycle that does not reuse waste material .
Fuel has to be replaced constantly .
With both recycled fuel and higher efficiency , the MSR saves cost making it cost saving in the long term .
Though changing the molten salts will come across as time consuming and uneconomical , technological advances in that area can further reduce cost by making it fully automated .
Secondly , the VHTR has high efficiency in converting heat to electricity .
As a result , the VHTR need not use liquid to gas exchangers , unlike the MSR .
However , heat is hard to contain and is easily lost to the environment .
The VHTR is a thermal reactor while the MSR is a fast reactor .
In a thermal reactor , fast neutrons are slowed down to produce heat .
In a fast reactor , it optimises the high speeds of the neutrons instead .
Since it would be practical to use the already fast speeds of the neutrons , slowing them down will produce a lot of heat in the VHTR .
The MSR , though it includes the liquid to gas exchanger , this generates $4 .5 mil per percentage increase in efficiency .
(AIAA , n .d)
Thirdly , the VHTR employs stringent security measures to combat intruders .
The whole perimeter is under 24 hour surveillance by armed guards .
Furthermore , in an event of a nuclear leak , they have a system distributing iodine pills to residents within a 10 mile radius .
Though these are impressive , the round-the-clock security cannot protect against attacks like crashes and the time taken to deliver the pills may be far too long to prevent much damage .
The MSR however , employs measures such that little or no fissile materials are emitted .
The MSR is highly protected from nuclear proliferation due to its clever waste recycling of fission materials .
It converts Uranium-233 into unusable fissile material by adding Thorium .
This cycle bypasses the stage where Plutonium-239 is produced .
(Andre , 2009) Instead it produces a variety of Plutonium isotopes that cannot be used to make nuclear weapons .
Without weapons grade plutonium in the purest form , it reduces the effectiveness of explosions .
U-233 is more radioactive compared to the conventional U-235 used today .
As a result , the usage of U-233 has also posed concerns to both staff working in the MSR .
More funding is needed to safeguard the staff handling fissile material .
U-233 also damages electronics , and thus , not feasible in a bomb .
However this additional safety cost incurred would be well spent if the threat of nuclear proliferation can be obliterated .
In conclusion , though the VHTR has admirable qualities , the MSR seems to be better in terms of efficiency and security of nuclear material .
In the long term , the MSR saves money by recycling its waste and is more efficient as compared to the VHTR .
Technological advances can make the MSR automated in certain sectors and prevent health issues to people working in the vicinity .
Using nuclear power is the harnessing of energy released from the nuclear fission of uranium atom .
This energy released is used to turn the turbines in the nuclear reactors and generate electricity from them .
There are new generations IV reactors which are proposed to provide better output and safer mechanism in operating them .
With this features taken into consideration , the thought of building the new generation IV reactors is getting more real .
However , the possibility of a core meltdown cannot be denied judging from the accidents like Three Miles Island and Chernobyl(Butler ,2004) .
Therefore , the concept of generation IV reactors should not receive further research and development funding due to three factors , security , cost and performance .
Scientists and engineers have created safety mechanisms which cause the reactors to cool themselves in the case of terrorist invasion(Butler ,2004) .This will mean that the efforts terrorists try to cause a deliberate accident will be futile .
Moreover , protective double fences are built around the perimeter of the nuclear reactors to prevent the terrorists from entering the premise .
Heightened security measures have been taken to ensure that the defence is not breached as well .
However , with the introduction of dual use technology , the supercritical-water-cooled reactors can be used as a possibility of military use of civilian nuclear power technology to make nuclear bombs .
Dual use technology refers to the making of nuclear bombs and the harnessing of energy from nuclear power .
After an intentional meltdown caused by the terrorists , the nuclear core will explode and radiation will be spread throughout the country .
As a result , people around the vicinity will suffer from cancer caused by the radiation( BMJ ,2005 ) .
In addition , nuclear waste can be sabotaged and used as radiological weapon if left unprotected .
Examples of this case include an incident in Russia in 1999 , where workers tried to sell five grams of radioactive material on the market .
Another incident was in 1993 where Russian workers were caught red-handed trying to sell five kilograms of enriched uranium(Information on Nuclear Smuggling Incidents ,n .d) .
When the concept of the super-critical-water-cooled reactors is introduced , it will be much cheaper to build compared to the other conventional ones .
It is cheaper because of the reactor's efficiency and simpler design which just uses water as a coolant and it is readily available(Butler ,2004) .
Moreover , the introduction of this concept will produce electricity that is as cheap as those produced by coal and gas .
However , the cost of building nuclear reactors has to be evaluated first before even starting to build them .
(Foulke and Burnett ,2005) .
It is expensive to build a new nuclear reactor , taking into consideration the area of land needed , the cost of buying the nuclear fuel for energy processing , the cost of the coolant and the cost of the construction materials .
In the U .S , sixty-three billion dollars is needed to build a new reactor and the maintenance and the operating costs are not included in it(O'Reilly ,2007) .
The money invested can be used to improve healthcare or even the harnessing of other forms of energy like solar energy to produce electricity .
The building of nuclear reactors is not necessary for smaller countries in Asia like Singapore .
This is because nuclear reactors have a safety zone buffer of thirty kilometres and Singapore has a radius less than that .
Therefore , the cost needed to build the nuclear reactors can be used for other uses .
The supercritical-water-cooled reactors run at temperatures which are higher than the normal nuclear reactors which means that more efficient conversion of heat to electricity(Butler ,2004) .
However , the performance of the nuclear reactor is dependent on the temperature of the reactor core .
This means that if the temperature of the day is higher than usual , the performance of the nuclear reactor will drop .
This is because the temperature of the reactor core is affected by external factors such as weather .
The performance also depends on how much electricity is output compared to the energy being needed to run the whole system .
For the supercritical-water-cooled reactors , very high pressure is needed to prevent the water coolant from boiling at temperatures up to five hundred degree Celsius(Butler ,2004) .
The stealing of nuclear waste raises a possibility of selling them on the market , causing a breakthrough in technology and more nuclear bombs to be made .
The cost of building a nuclear reactor is very expensive compared to the harnessing of other forms of energy .
The cost of the building does not include the cost of fuel , building materials and the cost of land needed to build the reactors .
With the increased in outside temperature , the performance of the nuclear reactors will drop as it is dependent on the temperature of the nuclear cores .
In conclusion , the supercritical-water-cooled reactors should not receive further research and development funding for it , the rise of terrorism and the making of nuclear bombs from nuclear waste make nuclear reactors a controversial issue .
Cries of terror and bloodcurdling screams filled the night air as the familiar dome shaped structure in the distance began to glow amber red .
In a flash , it was all over , all there was left was rubble .
All signs of life were obliterated and everything razed to ground zero .
This may just be a typical scenario in the event of a nuclear explosion .
The Chernobyl accident that happened in 1986 had caused people to resent the development of nuclear power .
Many antinuclear groups such as the Greenpeace organizations have sprung up overnight to rally against the development of nuclear power for the fear of the recurrence of such nuclear catastrophe .
To date , many countries spearheaded by the GIF (Generation 4 international forum) have already launched their plans to the construction of some generation 4 nuclear reactors on their native soil , with promises of a more efficient and cleaner reactor concept .
However , the large capital needed to even construct a single nuclear plant would mean that we should choose the best design among the six .
Needless to say , there are many factors that should be taken into consideration which would include safety , cost and performance .
A good nuclear reactor concept would be one which strikes a balance between cost and performance without compromising the safety aspects .
Firstly , what distinguishes the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) as compared to the other designs would be that it does not provides only energy , which can be converted to electricity , but hydrogen as a byproduct as well .
The hydrogen fuel can be useful in powerful cars in the near future when the natural fuel runs dry as oil depletion is rapidly increasing at an alarming rate of 5 percent per year(S Korpela , 2006) .
The designs of such vehicles are already underway by major car manufacturers such as Honda and are in the testing phases .
Critics may consider the use of hydrogen irrelevant to future society since there are already electric cars in place .
However , it is an undeniable fact that most people do still depend largely on fuel to run , imagine planes powered by electricity , though it may be possible in the near future , it may not generate the power equivalence of hydrogen fuel given the same storage space .
Moreover , electric cars require long periods of time to recharge compared to hydrogen .
Therefore , this reactor has multiple benefits apart from mere electricity output and may be a better choice to contemplate .
The next fact that VHTR outshines the other reactors in is safety .
Safety is highly regarded as one of the most important reasons in the decision of the final nuclear reactor concept .
In all aspects of nuclear technology , safety should be monitored regularly and stringent safety standards adhered to by all the generation IV nuclear plants .
However , the VHTR is passively safe , meaning there is no need for human intervention to ensure that the reactor shuts down properly in the event of emergencies .
The entire safety procedure is fully automated and hence will put the VHTR a notch above the rest of the nuclear reactor concepts .
Playing the devil's advocate , the VHTR operates at a scorching temperature of a thousand degrees centigrade which would be a major worry for the consequence would be unimaginable lest an accident occur .
Causes of accident range from human error to external sabotage , hence , being hard to control , it is impossible to tell when an accident would occur as it need not be caused by external proliferation but instead by the operators themselves .
Therefore , with the passive fail safe devices in place , operators need no longer worry about any protocol when the panic button is pressed but instead the system will take care of itself .
Though true to a large extent , many of the generation IV reactor concepts are eradicating the sources of error instead of trying to minimize the extent of the damage done should a tragedy befall .
Furthermore , the contingency plan for the VHTR is completely mechanical and the chances of a failure due to human arbitration drop to a minimal .
This demonstrates the superiority of the VHTR as compared to the other generation IV concepts .
In conclusion , the VHTR would be clearly a preferred choice as compared to the other reactors .
As all the reactors require capacious sums of funds to construct any of the generation VI nuclear plants we examine the overall performance and the safety aspects of the VHTR as compared to the other concepts .
The VHTR is a better choice due to its capability to generate hydrogen gas which can be used as fuel and due to its excellent fail-safe concept which may prevent an adversity should it arise .
More resources should be allocated to further research and develop Generation Four (GIV) nuclear power reactor as it can provide clean and safe energy at reasonable price .
Although nuclear power as a source of energy has its disadvantages , it must be noted that no single source of power supply is perfect .
Given the advancement in current and future technology , it makes sense to invest in GIV reactor in providing for our growing energy demand .
We should support research and development of GIV reactor as it provides safe and clean energy and its cost will be reduced with further advancement in technology .
Very few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades as the general public is extremely concern about its safe operation , especially after the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl which sent fear and created negative opinions on nuclear power among the public .
Despite the two major accidents , nuclear power is actually very safe .
Although 56 deaths had resulted from the Chernobyl accident , it is pale in comparison to the 5000 deaths annually due to coal mining activities (Moore , 2006) .
In fact , the Three Mile Island incident was a success story where radiation was contained safely within the containment vessel .
Furthermore , almost all nuclear related accidents were linked to human error which can be eliminated with the use of automation .
Besides eliminating human errors in operating a nuclear plant , the automatic system will mean that no operators will be endangered as all processes , including emergency procedures , will be done automatically .
In principle , the GIV reactors are "meltdown proof" with its multiple automatic backup systems .
And even in the case of an accident , it will be cooled down automatically (Butler , 2004) .
The Chernobyl was an accident waiting to happen , the early model of the Soviet reactor which had no containment vessels were no longer operating .
The safety performance of nuclear plant has improved through the years .
From about 2 safety-significant events reported per plant per year to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1990 , the number has improved to less than one tenth of that by 2000 (Lake , 2009) .
The automatic GIV reactor will definitely boost the safety standard of nuclear plant further .
Another concern from the public on nuclear power will be its cost .
Given a price tag of more than US$ 1billion dollars in building a nuclear plant (Benjamin , 2008) , some will argue that it is more economic to use fossil fuel or other forms of energy .
It is true that building a nuclear plant is expensive but with more research and development in it , the cost will be lowered in the near future with better design .
Although there are other promising renewable energy sources available , they are not fully reliable .
Energy such as wind and solar are unpredictable , they cannot fully replace big base-load plants such as coal and other fossil fuel .
While fossil fuel is expensive and suffers from price volatility , cost of nuclear power is relatively stable and low at around 2 cents (US$) per kilowatt-hour , comparable to those at gas-fired plants , as nuclear plants buy their uranium fuel at an agreed price three years in advance (Whitman , 2007) .
In addition , better technology will lower the unit cost of generating nuclear power .
For example , the US has not built any new nuclear plants for the last two decades , yet the amount of electricity produced from nuclear has increased by about 8% annually as the industry becoming more efficient (Lake) .
Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) , one of the concepts of GIV reactor , will be operating at around 1000 C instead of the 330 C in current model of reactors .
With higher operating temperature , efficiency of the plant will be increased .
Comparing to the conventional nuclear plant today , VHTR is expected to produce 50% more electricity (Butler) .
Besides safe and economic , nuclear power is also environmental friendly as it does not produce any greenhouse gases such as Carbon Dioxide in the case of fossil fuel burning plants .
The spent fuel rod used in nuclear power plant can be reprocessed and reused , this reduces the amount of nuclear waste that need to be stored permanently .
In summary , nuclear power is reliable , green and affordable .
Previous accident such as the Chernobyl is highly unlikely to reoccur given the current high standard of safety .
With the forecast that we will need 40% more electricity by 2030 (Whitman) , accepting the practical advantages of nuclear power is both environmentally and economically sensible .
Hence , we should support further research and development of GIV reactors .
Electricity is the most important source of energy in modern times .
In order to generate enough electricity for all the human beings , numerous tons of coal and barrels of oil are burnt every day .
However , according to energy statistics from the World Coal Institute , more than 66% of the electricity is generated from fossil fuels , namely coal , gas and oil .
An urgent problem confronting us nowadays is that most of the fossil fuels that are widely used will be exhausted in decades or few centuries .
Known economically workable oil deposits and coal deposits will be exhausted in 2050 and in 2158 respectively .
Besides , people have suffered a lot from global warming , acid rain and air pollution , which are all largely related to the consumption of fossil fuels in the electricity generation industry .
What was worse , electricity demand is increasing dramatically due to speeded economic development worldwide .
It is estimated that electricity demand will have doubled by 2030 .
Under such harsh circumstances , many energy experts strongly advise that we should approach other new energy sources , such as bio-energy , solar energy and wind energy .
Nuclear power is also a promising alternative that we should not overlook .
Till now nuclear scientists and engineers have already put forward the new six generation IV nuclear reactor concepts .
Molten salt reactor is one of them and it adopts a molten salt mixture as a coolant in its reactor core .
Here is an evaluation of the MSRs in terms of performance , safety , waste and cost , compared to traditional nuclear reactors .
In conclusion , it is quite reasonable for us to consider doing more research on and commercialise the molten salt reactor concept , as well as other types of generation IV reactors .
In retrospect to our history , when some new techniques were developed , they all had the priority .
It was and also is consensus that new technology means our future development .
As a cutting-edge technology , nuclear power should get more support and be on the way to prosperity .
The fossil fuels on the Earth are towards exhaustion soon , we have to take precautions before it is too late .
* Performance
Molten salt reactors adopt molten salt mixture as a primary coolant , instead of traditional molten sodium coolant .
This modification allows the reactor to run at higher temperatures , which means higher thermodynamic efficiency .
And there is no high pressure steam in the core either , thus the mechanical stress is reduced .
In many designs of MSRs , the nuclear fuel is dissolved in the molten salt itself .
As a result , the preparation of the ingredients , uranium or thorium , are simplified and reactor structure can be quite easy to handle .
* Safety
Unlike solid-fuel fast reactors , fast-spectrum MSRs have large negative temperature and void coefficients because as the temperature rises or voids are formed , the fuel is expelled from the reactor core .
This is a unique advantage of MSRs compared to traditional solid-fuel reactors (Charles W . Forsberg , 2007) .
[2] There is no high pressure steam in the core and the molten salt is of low pressure .
We won't worry about fire hazard or explosion hazard .
Thus the molten salt reactors are considered inherently safe because they are chemically stable .
They do not react rapidly with moisture or air because the fuel salt does not burn in air or water .
However , in traditional nuclear reactors or solid-fuel reactors , there is always boiling water or molten metal as coolant involved , which dramatically reduces their safety level .
Besides , since the nuclear fuel is often dissolved in the molten salt , in case an accident happened , most of radioactive materials would not be dispersed into the atmosphere and spread to the environment nearby .
And there is also a passively cooled storage which can secure the reactor by dumping the fuel to the cooled tanks if there is a leak .
* Waste
As is mentioned above , the molten salt reactors are operated at high temperatures and low pressure , thus utilization of the fuel is significant , which in turn means that there will be less waste produced during the process .
According to the modern design of a molten salt reactor , the fuel chosen is often thorium , which means the nuclear process in a molten salt reactor involves a thorium cycle .
The thorium fuel cycle can potentially burn all the actinides that generate most of the radioactive waste after use , compared to the traditional uranium-238 and plutonium cycle .
* Cost
Thorium is three times more abundant in nature compared to uranium and occurs mainly as 'fertile' .
[3] It is widely used as the fuel in MSRs , so this can commercially reduce the cost in terms of fuel source .
Thanks to its different operation that involves molten salt , a MSR eliminates the fuel enrichment and fuel fabrication , both of which are major expenses for traditional reactors .
Molten salt reactors can be built in small sizes , yet also operates very well .
The cost is reduced and business risks are not so high as those of the traditional reactors .
They are much easier to become commercially available .
On April 12 , 1981 , the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight , Columbia - the first space shuttle in the world successfully launched .
Unfortunately , after flying a total of 27 times , Space Shuttle Columbia died at a very young age during re-entry on February 1st , 2003 .
According to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB)'s final report , the direct cause of the accident is a breach in the heat shielding panels on the shuttle's left wing , which was caused by a suitcase-size piece of insulating foam's hitting with around 240m/s relative speed 81 .7 seconds after launch (Columbia Accident Investigation Board , 2003) .
The breach allowed the heated gases entered the initial structure and finally resulted in the disintegration .
Space Shuttle Columbia disaster is one of the most serious engineering accidents throughout the history .
It alerted and re-emphasized us how important the safety design is .
Meanwhile , safety in work systems is always a critical point of applied psychology and industrial efficiency (Munsterberg , 1913) .
Based on Collins COBUILD Advanced learner's English Dictionary , psychology is the scientific study of human mind and the reasons for people's behaviors (2006) .
Human beings' actions are involved in every major accident (Wilpert , 2006) .
Accordingly , there exists a controversy that whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident .
I believe the answer should be affirmative .
In the article "Psychology and design process" , Mr . Wilpert acknowledged that the social perception of psychology and the social science was the main reason why people cannot accept psychology as a useful method to improve the safety of systems in designing process (2006) .
Same as in the Columbia issue , a lot of people just focused on the physical cause of the accident and arbitrarily claimed that it was only the engineering errors that result in the final disaster .
It seems that the people above believe they can ensure the safety by just solving the existent problems .
However , I have to say that these people are so short-sighted that they did not find the fundamental solutions .
It is true that every time we can fix the known errors after the accident .
Nevertheless , it is just a kind of useless latter-wit .
On the contrary , with the help of psychology , we can actually analyze people's minds and behaviors in order to find and deal with any potential problems in time .
In the following paragraph , I will focus on two aspects to explain my viewpoints , viz .
Design of the Space Shuttle and problem solving decision .
Insulating foam is used for covering the External Tank in order to keep a relatively high temperature .
However , the foam is not that firm; the mechanisms can cause them to shed .
Moreover , it is ironic that this kind of imperfection was well known by NASA and caused shuttle damage on every prior flight .
It is true that everything in the world cannot be perfect .
Nonetheless , NASA management did not predict the serious consequence and wrongly thought it was an acceptable risk .
Even today , six years after the Columbia accident , NASA still do not solve the falling foam problem (Young , 2006) , and the officials still say there is no need for a heightened concern (Hays , 2009) .
If some psychologists can communicate with the management officials and teach them to think in a more critical way , the results would not be catastrophic .
Sometimes it is impossible to prevent problem occurring , but we can still solve the problem .
Once again , NASA disappointed us .
After the launch , engineers asked NASA management to visualize the damage many times , but NASA never responded and did not give any resolution since they did not believe the damage would be so severe .
This kind of psychological problem as being irresponsible is really unforgivable .
Even one board member Feynman questioned why the management was so confident in the machinery (1986) .
With the help of psychology , we can thoroughly improve the management system effects by solving official's psychological problems .
After all , to be more precise and realistic is the basic need to make problem solving decisions .
Tragedy had already happened , and we cannot change past .
However , we must learn something to prevent such things occurring again .
Psychology has the function to guide people to understand technological imperfections and give effective problem solving decision .
At least in the Columbia issue , I am very sure the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
As the mankind has entered the 21 century , the need for fuel has become increasingly pressing , which has exceeded the amount of fuel required in the past century by most 50 percent .
To solve the complex function of the world's need for more fuel , the solution lies in , as suggested by scientists and engineers worldwide , the generation IV nuclear reactors , which are capable of generating the power needed at a far more efficient rate compared to the contemporary power plants .
There are altogether six designs for the generation IV reactors while this essay will focus on one of them named very-high-temperature reactor or VHTR in short and expound on the reasons why it is worth all the researches and money put into it .
Generation IV reactors are designed to achieve certain goals , some of which involve generating clean and efficient energy , replacing fossil fuel and increasing resource utilization .
The VHTR is specially designed to achieve these goals because it can withstand core temperature as high as 1000 degrees , even the highest among all the generation IV reactors .
Having established some common understanding of the VHTR , there are basically three reasons why the VHTR should receive continuous funding and research .
First and the most concerned reason of all is that the VHTR guarantees a high degree of safety .
Being graphite-moderated and helium-cooled , it doesn't melt easily due to the extremely high melting point of graphite nor does it allow any corrosion of the chamber as helium is a very inert gas which is resistant to reactions that lead to corrosive substances .
This property should well fend off the critics using the meltdown accidents that happened at Three Mile Island and Ukraine , as the possibility of such accidents happening to a reactor able to function properly at 1000 degrees is insignificant .
Secondly , the VHTR produces energy in a very efficient manner .
The VHTR allows for more than 50% of more electricity to be produced from the same amount of fuel intake compared to the conventional reactors .
It burns up to 65% of uranium compared to only 5% for conventional reactors .
As the non-renewable resources are running out , the VHTR provides an excellent alternative solution to energy generation .
Thirdly , the VHTR produces a by-product , hydrogen gas , which is considered as another environmental-friendly source of energy .
At high temperature (700-900) , H2 is split from water and can be further utilized as fuel for transportation and factories .
This reduces burning of fossil fuels , like oil , which generates toxic gases .
This property , which can never be reached by the current reactors , serves to preserve the environment by replacing the contaminating fossil fuels using hydrogen gas .
Despite the fact that the VHTR brings tons of benefits to the mankind , there are certain negative facts which impede the officials from making up their minds on the funding .
The cost issue is certainly the most depressing thing among all .
For each nuclear reactor , an astounding amount of one billion has to be pumped into the construction .
As predicted , a generation IV reactor design is not to be realized before 2030 .
With some degree of uncertainty over the possibilities of putting a VHTR into operation , such a huge bill is difficult to be issued anytime soon .
Moreover , alternative solutions of fuel are not necessarily constrained by generation IV reactors as sources like solar power which require much less funding than the reactors are being intensely researched upon .
Hence the realization of VHTR is not as cost competitive as those alternatives .
Another problem is that the researches into the materials required by the containers and pipes are not going to produce useful results in the near future .
Due to the fact that the VHTR should withstand extremely high temperatures , the materials for the chamber must be ultra hard and corrosion resistant , many times better than those that we have already discovered .
These two problems , together with a few others , may disrupt further researches into and funding for the VHTR .
However , scientists and engineers worldwide have come together and discussed on the solutions to the problems .
As for reducing the cost of construction , the government can impose a carbon tax on the citizens and therefore use the tax revenue to fund the researches .
Moreover the cost of over-night construction can be cut off , which will save up a great deal of money .
There are more cost cutting plans to be made .
As for the materials , scientists have already found Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) alloys and fibre reinforced ceramic , which are very hard and corrosion resistant materials .
With this remarkable breakthrough , there will sure be more new materials to be discovered .
In conclusion , for the long term consideration , the VHTR is worth the researches into and money spent on it as it not only generates energy highly efficiently but produces a by-product which is also a source of clean energy .
The fact that the potential problems will be well dealt with should further strengthen people's belief in the VHTR .

From statistics , 20% to 50% of incidents , including failures , accidents and near-accidents , were caused by poor designs (Wilpert , 2007 , p . 296) and these figures were actually underestimated for two reasons .
The first being that single design errors tend not to cause mishaps because of the defense- in-depth designs in many installations of complex and high-hazard nature .
The second reason is simply because some design errors were picked up and corrected before any mishaps could happen .
However , in both cases , it was highly probable that there were occurrences of some form of failure due to poor design .
By incorporating psychology into engineering design processes , failures and incidents can be prevented , if not , minimized .
This essay will argue how the incorporation of psychology into design processes could have prevented the major engineering accident , in the case of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant mishap on March 28 , 1979 , which was a "snowball effect" , caused by a minor and simple fault .
First of all , opponents of this psychological approach towards engineering design insist that the faulty valve was the key factor and main cause of the incident , and that psychology could not have prevented it .
However , operators could have picked up this fault if the design of the instrument gave clear and proper signals .
In this case , the instruments that were used did not (U .S .NRC , 2009) .
Consequently , it resulted in a "Design Induced Human Error"(Nelson & Associates) , and this led to an aggravation of the situation .
It can be seen that if psychology was incorporated into the design of the instruments , the engineers of the instruments could have anticipated such a problem and included a device to alert the operators in a case when the valve and its related parts fail .
Secondly , opponents may also argue that this accident was caused by human error , because the operators failed to trace back the fault to the valve , leading to an aggravation to the point when emergency signals were shown .
In this event , operators picked up signals that caused confusion (U .S .NRC , 2009) .
Operators then made the best judgments and took the best actions based on whatever information they could obtain .
These judgments and actions were correct with respect to the information that was shown on the instruments .
Therefore , this is yet another "Design Induced Human Error" (Nelson & Associates) .
Once again , if psychology , in the form of cognitive ergonomics , had been implemented in the design process of the instruments to improve the human-machine interface , errors and misjudgments could have been reduced (Budnick & Michael , 2001) , and events like this would not have happened .
The final two arguments brought forth by the opponents may be the poor quality of machinery parts that led to the malfunction of the valve , and the inadequacies in the training of operators .
These arguments pointed out by the opponents are in actual fact very related to psychology and are factors part of Organizational Ergonomics (International Ergonomics Association , 2009) .
By looking at the system as a whole , that is , to include the managerial departments , we can see that if psychology was employed in the design and planning processes of how the plant is run , proper schedules for checks on machineries and also re-training can be planned .
By predicting such problems , measures can be taken before an accident can happen .
It is evident that psychology is able to reduce and also prevent errors by applying to both the micro and macro aspects of design processes of a system .
As we can see from the case of Three Mile Island , by anticipating problems that operators would face , the instruments could have been more accurate and reliable , which will then allow operators to remedy the fault straightaway .
In addition , by employing psychological approaches and methods , planners will be able to foresee problems that may arise .
The planners can then come up with appropriate schedules not only for regular checks on machineries , but also for retraining and refresher courses .
In conclusion , it is not uncommon for engineers and planners to commit mistakes and neglect what they think are not important .
Thus , by employing psychology , whether it is hiring a psychologist or just the employment of psychological approaches , problems that used to be unpredictable can be foreseen .
Improvements and enhancements can then be implemented pertaining to these problems and , as a result , lower the chances of accidents happening .
The nuclear reactor meltdown in Chernobyl in the year 1986 has became a dark age in the implementation of nuclear power .
Since then , nuclear power was often thought to be dangerous and therefore undermining the benefits that it can bring about .
In his article , Butler (2004) states six generation four reactor concepts including the sodium cooled fast reactor , which is much safer compared to older generations of nuclear reactors .
Therefore , technology can reduce the risks of nuclear power and therefore ensuring the safety of it .
Thus , the implementation of nuclear energy to generate electricity should be encouraged .
Firstly , the reactor meltdown accident in Chernobyl , 1986 has became a reason to prove that nuclear power is dangerous and should not be encouraged .
However , the accident occurred in the year 1986 and there has been no similar major accidents since then .
Thus , it can be observed that technological advancements can increase the safety of nuclear power .
Donald (2004) indicates that the accident in Chernobyl was allowed to happen because the reactor was not placed in a containment building , therefore allowing the nuclear radiation to be released into the atmosphere , causing huge losses in human lives .
Donald (2004) also states that the Chernobyl accident would not happen in other nuclear power plants as they are all placed in a containment building .
This is the main reason as to why the reactor meltdown accident in Three Mile Island did not cause any deaths or injuries .
Therefore , it can be shown that technology can be used to reduce the dangers of nuclear power .

Secondly , nuclear power plants were often thought to be much dangerous than other sources of electricity generation due to the unstable nuclear reactors .
For example , coal burning generators and hydroelectric power plants .
However , this is not true as advancements in technology has allowed nuclear power plants to be safer than any other types of power plants .
The sodium cooled fast nuclear reactor which Butler (2004) states , produces only electricity and no other outputs ,it also has a low operating temperature of 550 degrees Celsius and pressure compared to older generations of reactors .
Furthermore , other types of power plants produce harmful gases like carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide .
Donald (2004) also states that third generation nuclear reactors are already able to reduce possibility of a nuclear reactor meltdown from 1 in 20 ,000 to 1 in 800 ,000 .
Donald (2004) also states that there were more deaths in other types of electricity generation plants than nuclear power plants .
For example , hydroelectric power plants caused 110 times more deaths , coal 45 times and natural gases 45 times respectively .
NS & T (n .d) states that unlike fossil fuel or natural gases , uranium is mined and is in solid form , therefore it will not cause problems such as spillage during transportation , unlike the liquid fossil fuels and gaseous natural gases , which are considered as old -age forms of raw materials for generating electricity .
Thus , we can observe that technological advancements in nuclear power can allow it to be safer than other kinds of nuclear power plants .
Lastly , nuclear waste disposal are often thought to be as one of the most important reasons impeding the safety of nuclear power plants .
However , due to recent technological advancements , nuclear waste disposal has become much safer .
The sodium-cooled fast nuclear reactor which Butler (2004) lists can allow most of the nuclear wastes produced after the generation of electricity to be recycled for a large amount of times .
Therefore , reducing the amount of nuclear wastes produced and thus reducing the dangers of nuclear waste disposal .
Both Parta (n .d) and Donald (2004) have state in their articles that nuclear power produces small amount of nuclear waste , the size of an aspirin tablet per person's electricity consumption per year .
Therefore , due to the small amount of nuclear waste produced from nuclear power plants , and the ease of recycling the already small amount of nuclear waste due to technological advancements , nuclear waste disposal is much safer than before .
In conclusion , due to technology , misconceptions on the accident of Chernobyl can be cleared and future similar accidents can be prevented .
Furthermore , technology has allowed the generation of nuclear power to be much safer than other forms of power generation .
Moreover , the disposal of nuclear waste has become much safer due to technological advancements .
Thus , opposition of implementation of nuclear power should be reduced and nuclear power should be used as the new source of energy .

The Insider (2003) "At some time between 2010 and 2020 , the world's supply of oil and gas will fall below the level required to meet international demand ."
Oil and gas are currently important contribution to electricity in our everyday lives .
Unless we find alternative sources for oil and gas , our economy will most likely collapse the day we run out of them .
Nuclear power , an alternative source of electricity , could be the answer to this major problem .
According to a statistic by the "World Nuclear Association (2009)" , about 15% of the world's electricity generation comes from nuclear power .
Despite being the most prominent replacement for coal and fuel , nuclear reactors received strong opposition from the public masses .
The public's main concerns of nuclear reactors are the high cost of nuclear plants and nuclear research , the hazard that it poses and whether the nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases .
Nevertheless , further research and development funding is needed for generation IV reactor concept , namely the "Very-High Temperature" reactor .
As cited from Idaho National Laboratory (2009) , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor or "VHTR" is a helium-cooled reactor which is graphite-moderated , with a one time uranium fuel cycle .
It uses high core outlet temperatures that enable hydrogen and electricity production .
Firstly , detractors claimed that nuclear reactors and their corresponding researches cost lots of resources and money , so much that it is not economically worth taxpayer's money to build and research nuclear technologies .
According to statistics from "The Virtual Nuclear Tourist (2005)" , taking fuel , capital , operation , maintenance and waste related costs into considerations , coal cost 29 .1 $/Mw-hr while nuclear power cost 30 $/Mw-hr .
The difference in momentary value between conventional coal processing and nuclear power is not that big a difference .
Furthermore , "Very-High Temperature" reactors do not need to spend any money on waste recycling as all the waste goes directly to the repository .
This means that the cost of this technology is about the same , if not , lesser than conventional coal processing .
Gwyneth Cravens (2007) , Power to Save the World , New York: Knopf Publishing Group .
Secondly , opponents doubt the safety of using nuclear reactors and the possible hazards that it might pose .
Ever since the Chernobyl accident , many fear that history will repeat itself .
They are worried that the safety of their children will be at stake .
According to history , there have been only two major reactor accidents due to civil nuclear power , namely the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
As referred from the World Nuclear Association (2008) , these two accidents are the only two in the 12 ,700 reactor-years of commercial operation of in 32 countries .
Moreover , ever since the Chernobyl accident which happened in 1986 , the standards for safety in nuclear reactors have greatly increased .
Unlike the past , nuclear reactors now come with equipments that prevent operational disturbances which will in turn develop into problems .
In addition , sub systems are also implemented to detect problems and prevent significant radioactive releases .
All these new implementations come in all generation IV reactors , including the "Very-High Temperature Reactors" .
Thirdly , critics questioned if nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases and claimed that nuclear power will never be able to replace coals and fuel in the near future .
As stated , nuclear reactors are already generating about 15% of the world's electricity needs .
According to the World Nuclear Organization (2008) , a single average nuclear power reactor generates about 12 .4 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy .
Generation IV reactors , namely the VHTR , generates not only electricity , but also hydrogen .
Hydrogen is much needed in motor vehicle industries where future vehicles will most likely run on hydrogen fuels when coal and oil eventually runs out .
As stated in the book by Gwyneth Cravens (2007) "wind and solar power , while important , can meet only a fraction of the demand for electricity" .
When it comes to electricity generation , there are no other alternatives that come close to coals and fuels other than nuclear power .
Nuclear power will most probably be our main source of electricity generators once coal and fuel runs out .
It will be a better option to spend money on researching nuclear power prototypes now , rather than to wait till the epic scene where there is not enough electricity to go around to support the growth of the world .
Hence , it is of utmost important that research and development funding is provided for Very-High Temperature reactors .

Robotic surgery is the use of a mechanical device to assist surgery in place of a human being or in a human-like way .
Even though it is in its early stages , robotic surgery is set to revolutionize surgery .
Today's technology is focused on developing 'robot-assisted-surgery' but , gradually , robots are becoming more sophisticated and diverse .
One of such system is the Da Vinci Surgical System .
It is a system that enables surgeons to carry out operation with better precision .
The Da Vinci System has been used for a variety of surgical procedures including surgery for prostate cancer , hysterectomy and mitral valve repair .
Despite the many benefits such 'robot-assisted-surgery' brings , surgeons around the world are skeptical about how such technology can truly benefit mankind .
Many of the surgeons around the world are concerned with the inadequate training among practitioners when using the system .
Cases of lives loss have occurred due to the inadequate amount of practice with the new systems .
"The more you do , the better you're going to get ."
Said Dr . Kevin Zorn , chief of urology at Weiss Memorial Hospital at the University of Chicago (Debra , 2009) New and inexperienced surgeons can be subjected to rigorous training before using the system on their patients .
Dr . Kevin Zorn stated that it would take at least 20 attempts before one can become familiar enough to do the surgery safely .
(Debra , 2009) Robot-assisted-surgery can also be incorporated into the medical education system to expose new surgeons to such technology at an early stage to further reduce the issue of inadequate training .
As the system is still in its infancy stage , future improvements of such safety issues can be made to include technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) , where the system are allowed to correct errors done by the surgeon during the procedure .
One other concern will be the dent a surgical robot will have on the hospital's financial budget .
Most hospital does not have the budget to purchase equipments costing more than $500 ,000 .
Most claim that the cost of the machine (hefty at US$1 .5 million dollars) will result with patient being unable to afford the increase in surgical cost .
However , when expensive equipment is used more frequently , it becomes more economical .
Ash Tewari , Director of Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer-Urologic Oncology Outcomes at Brady Urology Foundation of the Department of Urology , says that sitting at the console , in a relaxed position , enables him to do more procedures than he could if he were standing upright over a patient .
(Charles , 2007) Also , as the use of the robotic system reduces the recovery time needed , the average stay of the patients is reduced to 3 to 4 days as compared to 7 days .
(Kristen , 2005) Therefore , the hospital will be able to handle more patients , reducing the cost needed from patients for the surgery .
According to the study , with proper experience in both techniques , there is no advantage in applying Da Vinci Surgical System .
(A .A , 2005) This raised issue of whether is there a need to move to a stage of incorporating robots into the operation theatre .
With uncertainties of whether the safety and cost will be resolved , are they worth the risk to adopt when there are no clear advantages in them ?
"Try to use chopsticks through a very small hole .
You're not going to be very good with them .
But if you have a robot that can project the dexterity of your hands through a small incision , then you can do complex things" , cited Dr . David Yuh , assistant professor of surgery in the division of cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore .
(Kristen , 2005) In comparison to traditional approaches , the robotic system will have greater surgical precision , increased range of motion , improved dexterity , enhanced visualization and improved access .
These will benefit patients in having less pain , less risk of infection , less blood loss , fewer transfusions , less scarring , faster recovery and a quicker return to normal daily activities .
(Intuitive Surgical , 2009) For example , most heart surgical procedures are done through the sternum , a flat bone of the rib cage .
This method of operation causes much distress and pain to the patient as compared to if it is done using the Minimal Invasive System (MIS) approach .
However , human limitations do not allow a smooth MIS procedure when it comes to heart operations .
This is where the improved dexterity the robot offers becomes handy .
Robotic surgical system will be the step medical authorities have to take for the better of mankind .
It should be evident that arguments regarding safety , cost , as well as better performance are addressed .
Instead of shunning away , we should learn to be receptive and reach for greater height in both the medical field as well as the robotics field .
"If you are looking at the future , it's hard to envision a hospital not offering robotics ," said Robert Glenning , chief financial officer at the Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey .

Experts have predicted that with the current ever-increasing usage of energy , the fossil fuels on Earth will be used up in the next fifty years .
Alternative forms of energy have to be developed to solve this issue .
Nuclear energy is one of the alternatives which can be used .
The very high temperature reactor (VHTR) is a Generation IV reactor concept which operates at around 900 to 1000 degree Celsius .
It has a higher efficiency than the conventional coal reactors .
However , there is much dispute over the usage of nuclear reactors .
Safety issues and costs are the main reasons for the public to oppose the usage of VHTR .
Even with these arguments , there is still a need to develop VHTR as a source of energy for the future .
Thesis
The public are afraid that the high temperatures in the nuclear reactors will be a major hazard for the people working in and those living near the reactors .
People fear that the high temperatures will increase the possibilities of having an explosion in the reactors .
VHTR uses helium , an inert and fireproof gas , as the coolant instead of water used by the conventional reactors .
Thus , it will not result in steam explosion , which can happen in reactors using water as a coolant .
In addition , VHTR is designed to work under high temperatures .
It has a reliable safety backup system whereby in case of machinery failures , the reactor will submissively fall to a safe energy level , without damaging the reactor vessels or the fuel spheres , allowing corrections to be made safely (MIT , 2003) .
Hence , this shows that safety precautions have been set to prevent accidents .
On the other hand , instead of being a threat , the high temperatures can be used to produce hydrogen , which can eventually be converted into electricity for the public , making VHTR more efficient compared to coal reactors and even some of the other Generation IV reactor concepts .
In short , the high temperatures will not become a threat to the public as safety measures are taken to prevent accidents; instead , the high temperatures can be used to improve the efficiency of VHTR .
The high initial start up costs is also a crucial factor in the opposition of VHTR .
According to Butler (2004) , it costs about US$1 billion dollars to build a nuclear reactor .
Hence , it has to have relatively lower operating costs to stay competitive with fossil fuel reactors .
In fact , VHTR can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with conventional reactors (Butler , 2004) .
Hence , being a much more efficient reactor , it lowers the operating and capital costs .
It is also stated that VHTR can generate electricity at prices that are comparable with coal and gas .
Furthermore , VHTR does not emit greenhouse gases .
Currently , global warming is one of the most serious issues in the world .
By cutting down on greenhouse gases emissions , it will eventually have a long term benefit for the public .
The risks of greenhouse effects should also be taken into consideration in the decision to use nuclear energy .
The high start up costs cannot outweigh the detrimental effects on the Earth by greenhouse gases .
Moreover , although in the short run , companies running VHTR may incur losses , in the long run , they will be able gain profits .
Therefore , high initial investments should not deter companies from setting up VHTR , as there will be long term gains for the public .
Finally , opponents of nuclear reactors fear that plutonium which can be found in nuclear waste will be used for terrorism .
Plutonium is an element which can be made into nuclear weapons; it is only available when the nuclear waste is reprocessed .
However , according to Butler (2004) , VHTR does not reprocess nuclear waste .
As a result , plutonium will not be separated out from the waste .
This can ease the fears of the public that terrorist will make nuclear reactors their potential target .
In brief , nuclear weapons cannot be made without plutonium; as a consequence , VHTR will less likely be a target for terrorist .
In conclusion , the arguments against the setting up of VHTR are debatable .
The adverse effects of global warming cannot outweigh the costs of setting up VHTR .
Furthermore , the accidents due to high temperatures can be prevented with sufficient safety measures in place .
Instead , the high temperatures can be used to increase efficiency of the reactor .
Fears of the use of plutonium to be made into nuclear weapons can also be eased as the nuclear waste in VHTR is not reprocessed; consequently , plutonium will not be separated out .
Therefore , further funding for the research and development of VHTR should be made available as VHTR will bring long term benefits to the public .
With the explosion of global population , the world is demanding more energy than ever .
Non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels will soon be depleted within decades and we need to find new sources of energy to sustain the global civilisation .
Current renewable sources such as solar power , wind power and hydroelectric power are not sufficient to keep up with the growing demands .
Hence nuclear power is becoming a more viable option as it produces consistent output of electricity in large amounts .
However , conventional fears and concerns from the public that radiation , risk of nuclear explosion and nuclear meltdown can have catastrophic impact on the environment and public health .
Furthermore , the consequences of it not so well-known and researched on yet as nuclear technology has not been around for a very long time .
But in reality , burning of fossil fuels for energy are damaging the environment and public health too , which may , to a certain extent , causes even more damage than a safe operating nuclear power plant .
Nuclear power is a feasible choice to meet the demands of the world energy needs as the output is highly efficient and consistent out of all the renewable sources , new generation nuclear reactors are safer and cheaper to operate and are more secure not just with the heavy fortification but also simplified fail-safe mechanisms which can automatically prevent disasters triggered by accident .
The cost of power generation by nuclear means is still higher as compared to that of fossil fuels .
And this in turn , leads to higher market prices for electricity generated by nuclear means .
But in the long run , nuclear power may even be cheaper .
One of the leading concept of generation IV reactor , Very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , uses advanced technology to increase the efficiency of electricity generation by 50% (Butler , 2004) .
This allows the reactor to lower the cost of production by producing 50% more electricity with the same amount of input , since nuclear reactors does not require consistent inputs of fuel frequently as compared to fossil fuel plants which requires constant inputs of fuels to burn .
The VHTR is designed to be a highly efficient system and is able to supply process heat to industries that require high-temperature , energy-intensive and non-electric processes (Idaho Laboratories , 2009) .
The VHTR concept is based on what is judged to be the minimal risk technology that will achieve commercial functional requirements to provide an economically competitive nuclear heat source and hydrogen production capability (Idaho Laboratories , 2009) .
This in turn saves energy that is needed to power these industries .
Conventional fears of catastrophic nuclear accidents can be put to rest with the new generation nuclear plants which use the latest technology to ensure maximum safety .
Nuclear power is safer with new technology that saves production cost .
New generation reactors are designed to be "meltdown proof" which cools themselves down in the event of an accident (Butler , 2004) .
It incorporates a simplified safety features without relying too much on sophisticated backup systems and competent personals , and thus any attempt to sabotage the facility will be in vain .
The best part of this is that all will be done without human intervention .
Hence the plant will be very safe even if an accident occurs .
The security of a nuclear installation is of utmost importance given the threats of sabotaging by terrorists .
All nuclear installations around the world are heavily fortified with security personnel and defence mechanisms , hence the nuclear plants will be safe and secure .
Concerns from the public regarding the implications of radiation exposure of an operating nuclear plant are all but unfounded as ironically , conventional fossil fuel plants emit more pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide which causes acid rain , carbon dioxide which causes global warming .
This in fact causes more damage to the environment than a safe operating nuclear plant which has no emissions as all radioactive fuels are kept in containers with thick lead walls to prevent any radiation leakage .
Statistics show that there are more deaths due to overexposure to these pollutants .
Apart from the Chernobyl accident , and subsequent major accidents , radiation released during normal operation have been found to be almost undetectable as compared to natural background radiation (Gabbard , n .d) .
In fact coal combustion produces carbon dioxide and other greenhouse and also sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides , which are harmful to human health , are responsible for acid rain .
And there is another shocking fact: releases from coal combustion contain naturally occurring radioactive substances such as uranium and thorium (Gabbard , n .d) .
All in all , nuclear power is not exactly more hazardous than conventional power plants given the newer generation of nuclear plants which promises maximum safety and security with enhanced efficiency .
With continual research and advancement of nuclear power technology , the nuclear reactors of the generations to come will be safer to operate , more efficient and are accident-safe due to more sophisticated automatic shutdown mechanisms .
Public concerns over safety and nuclear proliferation have retarded the growth of nuclear technology .
According to Butler (2004) , "the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine" have convinced the public that nuclear technology is extremely dangerous .
Besides , there were questions over proliferation of uranium and plutonium waste to generate Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) .
Moreover , renewable energy technologies such as wind , biomass , geothermal and solar energy have proven to be effective in achieving electricity production with small carbon footprints (MIT , 2009) .
However , on the other hand , the Generation IV International Forum envisions nuclear as the best alternative for coal and has proposed six best prospects for the reactors of the future , known as Generation IV reactors (Butler ,2004) .
Amongst all , the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) proves to be promising with advantages such as passive safety , flexibility , higher efficiency and non-proliferation of nuclear waste .
The VHTR should thus be accepted as the next generation of reactor and funds should be allocated for the research and development of the VHTR .
First of all , oppositions of nuclear technology have argued that nuclear power is unsafe due to its radioactive and explosive nature , and a leakage or accident is likely to cause severe damages and even deaths .TS In the context of VHTR , though explosive and radioactive in nature , it is able to prevent radioactive materials from escaping in the event of a leakage or accident .
This is commonly termed as passive safety design .
The VHTR uses helium as a coolant for the reaction and helium is extremely inert towards radioactive materials .
The core is composed of prismatic graphite , and has high heat capacity and structural stablility at high temperature and pressure .
This was demonstrated in a test conducted in Beijing when a prototype of VHTR reactor , HTR-10 , is able to shut down with no cooling gas (Next Big Future , 2008) .
However , there is still a possibility that human error might occur and in an event of a nuclear accident , consequences are detrimental to people living around the area .
This has been illustrated by the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accident .
Secondly , nuclear power is not as cost competitive as compared with coal and natural gas (MIT ,2009) .TS Based on a study conducted by the MIT , with reference to year 2007 , it is estimated that electricity generated by coal cost $0 .062 per kilowatt hour , and electricity generated by natural gases cost $0 .065 per kilowatt hour; electricity generated by nuclear power cost $0 .084 per kilowatt hour (MIT , 2009) .
Though expensive , VHTR is able to generate H2 which is useful as a non-polluting fuel to generate large amounts of energy .
Many countries are betting on H2 as the next generation of fuel and the VHTR complements the situation .
Thirdly , oppositions of nuclear energy have also questioned the performance of nuclear technology .TS According to Butler (2004) , the VHTR is able to squeeze out 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel comapred with conventional plants (Butler , 2004) .
In addition , the heat generated by VHTR can be applied to most of the industry fields and its gas turbine system can generate electricity at an efficiency of 50% .
This is 17% higher than existing nuclear plants with electricity output of 33% (Japan Atomic Energy Agency , no date) .
Thus , the VHTR offers a higher efficiency conversion of heat to electricity as compared to conventional power plants and perform better than existing nuclear plants .
Lastly , opponents argued that reprocessing of nuclear waste gives countries an excuse to proliferate raw materials for advanced nuclear weapons .TS Among the six design reactors as proposed by the GIF , the Supercritical- water-cooled Reactor (SCWR) and the VHTR are be able to operate without having to depend on the controversial processing of plutonium (Butler , 2004) .
This reduces the possibility of countries proliferating nuclear raw materials for WMD .
In conclusion , the VHTR offers good prospect to be the next generation of reactors .
The flexibility and higher efficiency of VHTR allow it to be competitive in the near future .
Furthermore , non-proliferation of plutonium through VHTR process reduces the production of WMD .
However , the threat of nuclear accidents still persist and it is up to our own engineers to further resolve this threat .
Thus , funds should be provided in this case to strengthen the passive safety design in VHTR reactors .
We live in an era of rapid development .
With the development of science and technologies , the demand for energy is keeping increasing .
Nowadays , power sources have become the focus of attention in the world .
In recent years , a new type of power source , nuclear power has sparked a heated controversy .
Some people think nations should cease doing further research and development funding for nuclear power because it will brings some serious problems on safety , security and costs .
However , as the matter of fact , the advantages of further development of nuclear power are more than the disadvantages , so further research and development of this power source should be supported .
First of all , opponents state that nuclear power has some safety problems .
First , they say that the generation IV actors are very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , which react in both high temperature and pressure .
It is very dangerous because nuclear reactors are very likely to explode under the condition of high temperature and pressure .
Second , the key element of the nuclear power Plutonium is a radioactive metal element , which would release large number of radiation in decay and reactions .
The radiation would do harm to human health in the long-term study .
Whereas , to the problem of high temperature and pressure , scientist put forward some corresponding improvements in generation IV reactors .
First , we take fluoride salts as the coolant for molten salts reactors in the reactions .
The fluoride salts are "thermodynamically stable (i .e . , they do not decompose upon heating)" and have the good effect of cooling CITATION WFo07 \l 2052 (W .Forsberh , Peterson , & Zhao , 2007) .
Moreover , comparing with other generation IV reactors like Gas-cooled fast reactors and Supercritical-water-cooled reactors , the pressure for molten salts reactors is low .
Furthermore , the molten salts reaction facilities are made of thick reinforced concrete .
Reinforced concrete has the characters of firmness and anti high temperature .
This kind of material can absorb radiation produced by the plutonium , so that the radiation will be greatly reduced .
Therefore , the high temperature and pressure in process and radioactivity of the element are not big problems to affect nuclear power research .
Besides the safety , some people also concern the security of nuclear power .
Since most reactions of generation IV reactors are waste recycling reactions , the main element Plutonium may be stolen in the process of recycling .
Plutonium is also can be used to make nuclear weapons , it is possible to be stolen by some terrorists .
Thus , it would be a big danger for the world .
However , to this concern , many nations and international institutes in the world have put many efforts on security enhancement and have made some achievements .
To instance , National Nuclear Security of U .S has the Defense Nuclear Security program which is "responsible for securing the nuclear weapons and components , and hundreds of tons of special nuclear material in all forms , shapes and sizes" CITATION Nuc09 \l 2052 (Nuclear Security) .
In the future , there will be greater development of the nuclear security system to protect against the waste stealing and nuclear terrorism .
In addition , opponents state that the high cost is also a problem of further research for nuclear power .
It is not only very costly to build a nuclear power plant , but also , the cost for waste recycling process is extremely big .
However , in fact , to do long-term perspective , nuclear power would be relatively less costly .
For example , there is a research to compare the cost of nuclear power and the cost of the most common power resource , coals .
Researchers point that taking 40 years as a period , even though nuclear power is more costly than coal power in the first 7 .5 years , it will be cost saving in the rest 32 .5 years CITATION Sol06 \l 2052 (Solbrig & Bnedict , 2006) .
Moreover , nuclear power can generate much more energy thaN the coal power and is more friendly to environment .
Hence , considering long-term interests , people should encourage further research for nuclear power .
In conclusion , further research and development funding for nuclear power should be supported .
In the further study , scientists and engineers would come up with the more solutions of the problems people concern in the safety , security and cost .
In the future , nuclear power would be an important power resource in the world .
As global warming is intruding our daily life , the public begins to keep an eye on the green house emission , which have increased 70 percent since 1994 compared to the pre-industrial times (GEN 4 international forum , 2008) .
In the international forum of nuclear energy system 2008 , the panel puts forward that nuclear energy is the option that provides "clean" energy which emits no green house gas .
On the other hand , with the concern of the natural resources shortage , more and more people are in favour of the nuclear energy because it kindles the hope of solving energy crisis .
It seems that nuclear energy points to the way to meet future energy demands without destroying the environment .
Nowadays the focus is turned to how to ensure the nuclear energy is safer , more economic-benefited and efficient than other energy choices .
Within the six methods of the fourth generation of nuclear energy reactor , some may argue that the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) should be applied considering its high efficiency and security .
This essay will focus on the view that Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) is the prior option to meet the safety and efficiency criteria after the comprehensive analysis .
First of all , safety is always the primary concern when introducing a newly developed technology .
The researchers who are in favour of VHTR argue that the resource of VHTR , helium - an inertia gas with low chemical activity is much safer than sodium , the coolant of SFR .
If the sodium leaks from the core then there could be a tremendous explosion .
This could be a serious threat to safety .
Although it is true that sodium is relatively active , there is an extra loop in the SFR producing process in order to prevent the accident (Carlsson , Tucek , &Wider , 2005) .
Moreover , there are several cycles in the process of SFR and each individual is segregated .
Therefore it is hardly that the reactor will leak out .
Besides the chemical behavior , the operating condition is another element responsible for the safety .
According to Carlsson , Tucek and Wider's conclusion (2005) , the probability of incurring the accident of losing coolant is proportional to the operating temperature and pressure .
VHTR requires quite high operating temperature at 1000 Celsius and pressure .
On the contrary , SFR is best performed under low pressure and only 350 to 500 Celsius degree (Butler , 2004) .
Hence the operating conditions make the SFR practically safe as a result of the low possibility of incurring the losing coolant accident .
Lastly , there is no separate plutonium generated in all processes of SFR , which is a highly radioactive and toxic element .
As a result , the proliferation can be controlled .
Apart from the safety of nuclear power , the high efficiency is another factor that prompts the researchers to promote SFR method .
The Department of Nuclear Energy of University of California , Berkeley (2009) , announced that the thermal efficiency of SFR could be upgraded to 47 percent resulting from the reheat and inter-cooling process design , which is a breakthrough in terms of the efficiency of energy conversion .
Unlike the VHTR , the SFR utilizes metallic fuel with neutron spectrum , which is capable of transmuting the raw materials to green energy efficiently .
Not only is the efficiency the breakthrough , but also the recycle of resource is very remarkable .
The recycle model of SFR is unique and the best among the six methods in the fourth generation .
As part of the waste of SFR can be re-utilized again as the resource of the reactor , the whole process acts like a self-supply system .
This quality can solve the resource shortage problem of the majority of energy supply methods .
Also , the recycle concept best explains the green technology .
The columnist Butler (2009) from Washington Times brings up the idea that the U .S . should give the green light for nuclear energy .
To support the idea , Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor is the ideal method representing the essence of nuclear energy , secured safety and high efficiency .
It is better to embrace the dawn of the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor instead of fearing the future it brings .
The world's energy is going towards depletion , and many countries are seeking other alternative energy sources .
To meet future energy needs , a framework in research for Generation IV nuclear energy systems have been agreed on by 10 countries , which later combine to form the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) to develop future-generation nuclear energy systems (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 1) .
Very-High-Temperature Reactor , also known as VHTR in abbreviation , is one of the six Generation IV reactors selected by GIF .
There are claims against building VHTR due to safety issues relating to materials .
Critics also claim that there are potential dangers in operating a reactor and disapprovals on high cost to build a VHTR .
Nevertheless , these arguments are not true and VHTR technology should be adopted as it is designed to benefit the society .
First of all , opponents who object in building VHTR claim that people are worried about the materials that need to withstand temperature up to 1000oC and high pressure (about 50 atm) .
This argument is not true as scientists and experts have done research on the materials needed to withstand the requirements currently .
Chen and some associating scientists (n .d .) had already done some investigations on X-ray absorption and synchrotron X-ray for analysis of VHTR- materials (The Applicability of Synchrotron X-ray Analyses for VHTR Materials , pp .
1-13) , while Bill Corwin (2003) mentioned that demonstrations had already been done to 900oC and above 1000 psi (approximately 68 atm) (Materials for Very-High-Temperature Reactor , p . 13) .
Shuwen "Eric" Wang (2005) also pointed out that a new coating material zirconium carbide has been found (p . 6) .
With the scientists' strong commitment and dedication and strong foundation in research , suitable materials will be expected to be found in due time .

People are worried about the potential dangers brought by operating the nuclear reactor; however , the design of VHTR has assured people the improvement in its original gas-cooled reactor's safety features .
Helium gas is introduced as a primary heat coolant because of its chemically unreactive properties (Shuwen "Eric" Wang , 2005 , p . 9) and has good thermal properties .
According to GIF (2008) , VHTR is recognized in terms of safety features of fuel and reactor .
Passive heat removal system is developed to simplify the operation of the reactor , which requires no short-term human intervention (Shuwen "Eric" Wang , 2005 , p . 9) .
In addition , Shuwen Wang (2005) also pointed out that "improved control rods and reserve shutdown systems are capable of terminating fission process to control reactivity" (Very High Temperature Reactor Safety Characteristics , p . 10) .
These affirmations hold true that potential dangers are minimized dramatically .
Lastly , although critics claimed that the cost is high to make this design to work in real life , we can get many benefits .
In fact , VHTR ranked the second in the lowest cost among all Gen IV reactors , consuming about $670M (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 52) .
This is the reason why most of the people prefer VHTR to other Generation IV reactors .
Water-cooled reactors today run at about 300oC .
On the contrary , VHTR runs at about temperature of 1000oC and thus allows more efficient conversion of heat to electricity (Butler , 2004) .
Butler (2004) mentioned that "VHTR is able to produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with conventional plants" (Nuclear power's new dawn , p . 238) .
In addition , over 2 million cubic meters hydrogen gas can be yielded per day (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 48) .
VHTR system is highly ranked in economics because of its high hydrogen production efficiency (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 22) .
From these evidences , we could say that operating VHTR will bring a lot of benefits to people in future .
In conclusion , arguments about insufficient materials , dangerous operation and not beneficial in building VHTR are not affirmed .
Hopefully , VHTR technology will be completely adopted because it brings benefits and advantages to the society .

Chernobyl nuclear accident is one of the most terrible disasters in the history of engineering development .
This accident happened on April 26 , 1986 , when the Number 4 reactor of the nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine exploded .
The result is that 300 Megacarriers of radioactive isotopes was injected into the atmosphere and millions of people died immediately or consequently .
More than twenty years have passed while an issue has always been controversial , which is whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident .
In other word , if we can clear all the human factors of the accident , would the accident be prevented ?
The people supporting this point of view argue that the design errors play important roles that lead to the accident and these errors can be removed with psychology to avoid the accident .
However , other people show the opposite opinion by saying that no matter how well psychology is involved to concern safety problems in design , the accident will always happen since human knowledge and experience are limited .
In my point of view , psychology can help prevent the accident .
The view that support the use of psychology could have prevented the accident shows that the design errors directly cause the accident and removing these errors would remove the accident .
As Wilpert (2007) states , safety of engineering design depends on three things , namely , effective process , production control and failure avoidance .
However , the Chernobyl reactor , reactor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalniy (RBMK) , was designed with problems of all these three aspects .
Firstly , in the RBMK reactor , the process of insertion of rods , which are to regulate the reaction speed , is inefficient and there is no fast rod for emergency .
It takes 20 seconds for a full insertion and this is too slow to prevent the core from running away when the reaction is under the unstable mode (Frot , 2001) .
Moreover , the rods are designed with graphite tip which , when first inserted , will increases the reactivity .
Secondly , the production control of RBMK is poor .
The core of the reactor is unstable at low power .
When the accident happened , the reactor was at a test of low power , working with only a quarter of full power .
Thirdly , the RBMK reactor has almost nothing to prepare for out coming gases .
Without either a system to filter exhaust neither gases nor a containment structure (Frot , 2001) , the release of radioactivity could quickly spread in all directions and causes more serious results .
As analyzed , by removing the errors above , the accident can be prevented .
Hence psychology should be functional for preventing the accident .
However , the opposite side announces that whatever we can do with psychology would not prevent the happening of the accident .
The main support of this point of view is that human knowledge and experiences are limited and we cannot avoid all the mistakes even if we have excellent psychology .
Twenty years ago , nuclear power engineering had just developed and engineers lacked experiences .
Moreover , the experiences and development may come from testing or even accidents .
The opposite side actually argues with not very concrete reasons since almost all the design errors that causes the Chernobyl accident are within human ability at that time .
First of all , this error had already been noted three years before the Chernobyl accident , but it was not removed by any designer (SFEN , 1996) .
Secondly , the instability of the reactor RBMK had already been known by the engineers at that time , but the warning did not change anything (Segodnio , 1993) .
For the third factor , the containment for leaking gases is not a complicated structure and what they should do is no more than investing some more money to build it .
For the facts mentioned above , we can conclude that the accident actually could be prevented if the designers gain good enough psychology that concern much for safety problems .
All in all , the use of psychology could play a role to prevent the happening of the Chernobyl accident .
How we wish that the designers of the Chernobyl reactor RBMK had gain good psychology , so that they would not use the unstable core , the ineffective control rods and the inflammable moderator , and would kindly design an enclosed containment for exhaust gases .
Nuclear power is nowadays universally acknowledged as a clean and economical energy source , and it is needed to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels which are limited due to geographical reasons and environmental concerns .
However , there were two serious reactor accidents in the history of civil nuclear power: Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 .
The latter one caused 31immmediate death and both spewed a heavy dose of radiation which has far-reaching negative effect on the ecosystem in vicinity .
Thus , to enhance safety , scientists and engineers are obligated to investigate into the incidents and find out the causes .
Like what Bernhard Wilpert once stated , it is never a single component failure that leads to accidents (Safety Science , 2007) .
One of the influential factors is the human error .
Targeting on this issue , the concept of "passive safety systems" has been proposed in the field of nuclear power .
Different from the active systems , theses passive ones require no operator intervention and merely rely on utilizing the gravity , natural convection (natural circulation) , materials' expansion on heating and other physical laws .
So far , although there have been several concerns raised on these systems , such as the understanding of their reliability , limited opportunity to manage events , etc . , they are reliable  , economical and safe to operate .
Opponents think reliability of passive safety systems are not that well understood compared with active safety systems .
However , this opinion should not be counted as a ground to refuse to apply these passive systems in nuclear power plants .
Active ones are widely understood and accepted because they have been used long enough to be observed and tested on .
Meanwhile their shortcomings are also exposed gradually in application to nuclear power plants .
That is why experts work more on substitutions , such as passive safety systems and a combination of both .
The design procedure of the new ones also experienced large amounts of trials and errors and they are more advanced than the previous ones .
When faced with doubts , passive safety systems will prove their reliability in the long run .
Another concern is that if a nuclear power plant has an entirely passive system , there is no or very limited opportunity to manage events or post the incident and perhaps operators will not be able to turn valves off remotely .
Nonetheless , director of reactor systems of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd . claimed that the design was robust and relying on gravity can possibly gain a ten-fold increase in safety than traditional pumps and valves (Mayson R . , 2002) .
Moreover , the objective of passive safety systems is to completely eliminated core degradation in the design (A .K .
Nayak , R .K . Sinha , 2007) which makes the reactions much reliable and back-up systems are set available to avoid totally reliance on only one kind of system .
Thus , the danger coefficient is greatly reduced .
Due to the fact that passive safety concept offers an opportunity to effect a large simplification (in the form of reduction of human intervention and external source of power) , costs on the construction of nuclear power plants are cut down significantly .
As in a virtuous circle , the saved capital can then be put into more research use and equipment maintenance .
Therefore , safety is ensured step by step .
In summary , passive safety concept rely more on forces of nature , and this approach increases the reliability and predictability of how the plants behave under various circumstances .
Even though the doubts and concerns following also deserve much attention from the scientists and engineers , application of passive safety systems is definitely reliable and economical .
To apply them not only can improve the safety issue , but also opens up bright prospects for nuclear power .

As a major controversy about spreading atomic technology in the world in generating electricity , public safety concerns have accompanied the development of nuclear energy since its birth .
The reasons for this centre round the issues of safe operation , radioactive wastes and nuclear weapons .
Since the Chernobyl accident has left a shameful scar on the history of nuclear power usage , it is understandable why some people think that living near to a nuclear power plant is equal to having a bomb buried in the back yard .
However , despite the catastrophic events caused by violating the safety regulations , nuclear plants are actually much safer compared with other coal-fired plants in both the senses of occupational fatalities and industrial accidents .
Referring to the Generation IV Reactors , apart from the double-walled container and the radiation-proof material that rap the whole reactor up , all the radioactive parts are physically submerged underwater to prevent any undetectable leakage .
Simultaneously , the highly sensitive and fast reacting monitoring system has also enabled engineers to handle all the emergencies before it is too late .
All these efforts made by engineers have contributed to ensure a far better safety record for nuclear power plants than any other means of generating electricity today , and definitely they will be safer tomorrow than today .
Another significant drawback , perhaps is the greatest problem which often associated with nuclear energy , is that of nuclear waste disposal .
In early days , rich countries like USA transported the potential danger to nations in Latin America through paying them for lands to bury its radioactive wastes .
Such an environmental unfriendly and inhuman approach soon begot fierce censure from the public voice for its selfishness .
The problem for today , however , is that "there is a huge information gap between specialists on the exposures from nuclear power and the public" (Ilan Lipper & Jon Stone .
(1998) .
Nuclear Energy & Society .
Retrieved September 28 , 2009 from www .umich .edu/~gs265/society/nuclear .htm) .
There is a huge misunderstanding that the radioactive waste is more dangerous than waste from other types of power system .
Byproducts like NOx and toxic metals in coal-fired power plants can also disrupt local ecology forever if they are not correctly dealt with .
In addition , as described in Nuclear Power's New Dawn , all the wastes and byproducts created by the generation IV reactor can be recycled to minimize its damage to both mankind and the environment , and the very-high-temperature reactor is even designed to achieve the goal of zero-emission !
Thanks to the advancing technology , combined with the fact that the average radiation we human received from peaceful nuclear fuel cycle is only 0 .1 percent of the inevitable exposure to natural radiation resources and building materials (Nuclear Energy & Society) , nuclear energy will definitely provide mankind with tremendous benefits that can never be achieved by other types of power .
One more major drawback of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is that it has allowed the production of nuclear weapons .
As Einstein has said before , "I don't know what weapon will people fight with in world war three , but I know that they will use stones and sticks in world war four" .
The destructive power of nuclear weapon has long been a threat to the entire human being .
As concerning the 911 disaster , terrorists may possibly target nuclear facilities or use radioactive materials for massive destruction .
From my perspective , in cases like these , it is not the double-edged nuclear technology to blame , but the hands that touch it .
This is an unavoidable dilemma for the advance of science and everyone has to accept the unforeseeable risks when they are enjoying the benefits .
Overall , nuclear energy holds bright prospect as a front edge technology that would allow us to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels , occupying less land yet generating more power .
However , in order for the industry to reach its full potential , we must find ways to address the problem of safe operation , waste disposal and security issues as well .
There is a rising demand for energy today .
With the concerns of global warming and depletion of conventional energy sources , investment in generation IV nuclear reactors seems to be a good alternative .
However , public opposition has been evident ever since Chernobyl and Three Mile incidents , which had exposed the potential danger of nuclear reactors (Butler , 2004) .
One of the G .IV reactors , Supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SWCR) listed in 'Nuclear energy's new dawn' (Butler , 2004) is safe , environmentally friendly , and low cost .
Therefore , despite the public concerns on safety , public health , and budget , I believe that one should support further research and development funding for generation IV nuclear reactors as it may be the energy source that prevents our planet from disaster such as catastrophic climate change .
Firstly , the SCWR is safe .
One would claim that there is no perfect machine in the world .
Therefore , a failure in nuclear system allows radioactive substances to escape from the nuclear reactor .
The consequence is devastating .
This can be seen in the Three Mile Island accident (1979) .
Moreover , plutonium from recycling of nuclear waste from nuclear reactors can be used to produce nuclear weapon (Butler , 2004) .
With these in mind , nuclear reactors pose great threat to humanity .
On the other hand , generation IV nuclear reactor is safe to operate as it can contain the radioactive material when accident occurs (Butler , 2004) .
Moreover , generation IV nuclear reactors are free from nuclear proliferation .
According to Gerald and George (2006) , the by-product , plutonium is difficult to be used as materials for making of nuclear weapons , and the nuclear technology in near future allows the plutonium to be unsuitable for making nuclear weapons .
Therefore , generation IV nuclear reactors such as SCWR are very safe for producing energy .
Secondly , nuclear energy is clean and helps in preventing global warming .
Critics argue that nuclear reactors generate nuclear pollution and can do little help in containing the amount green house gases .
According to an article , the environmentalists say that much of the green house gases come from the use of conventional energy source , which cannot be replaced by other sources at the moment (Nature , 2008) .
This is because nuclear plants are not able to generate energy at the same cost compare to conventional method .
However , nuclear energy is completely clean .
According to Butler (2004) , nuclear energy gives zero green house gases , and would help to ease energy demand and contain global warming if more intensive researches are carried out in this area .
Therefore , developed countries need to increase funding to accelerate the development of generation IV nuclear reactors to allow it to replace conventional energy sources such as coal and gases in the near future .
This trend can also be seen from countries around the world investing on nuclear research such as UK , France , and China (Butler , 2004)
Lastly , SCWR gives a low cost of production of energy .
The opposition of nuclear reactors criticize that nuclear energy is expensive due to the huge cost required in research and development .
They also argued that are alternative methods like solar and wind power can be implemented .
However , nuclear energy is in fact one of the least expensive energy sources .
According to Moore (2006) , in 2004 , the average cost of generating energy from nuclear reactor was comparable with conventional methods in the US .
Furthermore , advanced research will bring the cost down in the future .
According to Butler (2004) , S .C .W .R is cheap due to its simplistic design compare to generation III reactors .
Also , wind and solar power are intermittent and unpredictable .
They are unable to replace big base-load nuclear plants such as coal like generation IV nuclear reactors do .
Therefore , nuclear energy is the only viable substitutes .
In conclusion , we should increase funding for research and development for generation IV nuclear reactors .
Nuclear energy is the best substitution for coal and natural gas .
Current emissions of carbon dioxide from automobiles and industries are furiously contributing to global warming .
Nuclear energy would be able to clean the air and reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Furthermore , I believe that the generation IV nuclear reactors will be very safe as our technology is improving daily .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) was initiated in 2000 (World Nuclear Association , 2008) with the aim to build Generation IV nuclear reactors that can provide energy that is more efficient and environment friendly .
This will help to improve the standard of living in one country as unemployment and poverty have been a constant issue for many developing countries around the world .
Due to the high poverty rate and low funding from the government , electrical energy is not available in most parts of the country especially in the rural areas .
One example of a developing country is Kosovo in southeast Europe sharing borders with Serbia and Macedonia .
Statistics shows that in 2007 , the unemployment rate in Kosovo was at 40% with 37% of their population below poverty line (Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] , 2009) .
Therefore , developing countries should first handle unemployment and poverty in rural areas rather than provide huge funding to build Generation IV reactors .
It is understood that with the building of Generation IV nuclear reactors , it will generate a large amount of jobs like hard labour during construction phase and highly skilled engineers for day to day maintenance and operation .
Day to day operation jobs are the key to solve unemployment issue as it provide long term employment opportunity in the country .
However , this may not ease the problem of unemployment problem in a country like Kosovo with high unemployment rate .
As 16 .5% of Kosovo's population in the agriculture sector indicating that the locals are mainly of low education level (CIA , 2009) .
This will result to have more foreign highly skilled engineers being employed for the daily operation jobs .
Therefore , constructing Generation IV reactors will only benefit the country mostly in the hard labour work during construction phase that provide short term jobs between 3 to 5 years but not in a long run .
Poverty is often link with the problem of unemployment in one country .
Initial study indicates that with the high operating temperature of Generation IV reactors , it will generate hydrogen and electricity (Bulter , 2004) .
The hydrogen gas is believed to a future source of fuel which can be sold to other countries as another source of income .
However , the income will not be useful to the locals as it will not be directed to them .
Developing countries should provide long term and stable jobs for their people .
In this case , alternate source of energy like solar energy could be considered as the price of solar panels are on a decline (Solarbuzz , 2009) instead of spending billions of dollars building Generation IV reactors .
Solar energy is also environmental friendly like nuclear power and is free with the sunlight predicted to continue to radiate energy for another 5 billion years (Arnett , 2009) .
This will be a good solution as it provides stable job and also ensuring that energy is aplenty for a long time .
As the maintenance of a solar energy plant requires many low knowledge based technician , this will help to create long term jobs for the locals .
This in turn will help to ease the problem of poverty and unemployment in developing countries .
Developing countries should solve the problem of high unemployment rate and poverty within the country as priority rather than to build a generation IV reactor .
The initial cost of building a generation IV nuclear reactor is a multi billion dollars project .
Furthermore , the Generation IV reactors are still in the research stage (Bulter , 2004) which suggested that there are still plenty of questions and uncertainty that link to the safe operation before it can be consider complete .
Therefore , funding should be directed to other energy source like solar power where solar energy are environmental friendly and free (Energy Information Administration , n .d) .
This will create many low knowledge based job for the developing countries as the local citizens are not highly educated .
As building a nuclear reactor might result to have more foreigners to be employed than the locals as it is a high knowledge based job .

Nowadays , the energy problem gradually becomes a burning issue among the whole world .
Coal , oil , and other energy resources are less and less .
People start to fix their attention on nuclear energy .
In fact , nuclear energy now has been one of the main energy sources to generate electricity in many countries .
For instance , the United States now obtains about 20 percent of its electricity from 104 nuclear reactors .
The concept of new generation of nuclear reactorsgeneration IV , include these following six systems: gas-cooled fast reactors , lead- cooled fast reactors , molten salt reactors , sodium-cooled fast reactors , supercritical-water-cooled reactors , and very-high-temperature reactors .
All these six systems represent nowadays' nuclear energy advances in sustainability , economics , safety , reliability and proliferation-resistance .
Among all these reactors , the concept of supercritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) is the most suitable concept for funding and development .
The use of supercritical coolant would allow for a more compact design , since steam generators , dryers , circulation pumps and pressurizers would not be needed , hence achieving a better economy .
And it is also promised to have higher thermal efficienciesapproximately 45% versus the current 33% of light water reactors .
This system presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design .
Therefore , it is feasible to design such a kind of nuclear reactor .
However , SCWR faces some resistances .
Some people argue that its operation condition is highly required and there is potential hazard and worry of nuclear terrorism .
In spite of these opposing views , these problems can be solved through developed techniques and theories .
One of these opposing points is about its highly-required condition .
High temperature (510--550) and very high pressure (about 25 MPa) is required for SCWR .
This condition requires high-quality materials , and consequently , much money would be spent on research to find these materials .
Nevertheless , there indeed exist some advanced materials that can satisfy these requirements .
And many new successful studies are going on .
One of the ideal materials is the alloy MA956 .
It has excellent oxidation resistance up to 1370(2400) and significant creep strength up to its usually high melting point of 1482(2700) .
Thicker sections may be used up to 1370(2500) .
Corrosion-resistance is excellent for this material .
Therefore , material is no longer a problem .
Furthermore , SCWR is promised to supply low-cost electricity , and simpler design can minimize the cost , too .
Thus it is acceptable and worthy to spend some money on the further material research .
As we mention the simple design above , many people's common opposing view is that lacking some kinds of designs may cause some unexpected dangers , since the design is still on paper .
But we should have known that we do not just use water as coolant only this time in SCWR .
In fact , many generation III reactors , such as advanced pressurized water reactor (APWR) , advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) , economic simplified boiling water reactor (ESBWR) , involve water as coolant .
The design and structure of the reactor are quite similar , and therefore we are very experienced in the design .
This system , as I mentioned before , presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design .
The eliminated design like circulation pumps , steam generators and steam separators would not affect the safety factor at all , while the eliminated pressurizers and dryers may affect a little .
However , we can assume that experienced experts in this field can overcome such little obstacle .
Since nuclear waste separates out plutonium , which is a key ingredient of nuclear weapon , many people may be concerned about terrorists' attacks on nuclear power plant or accidental explosions .
Security enhancement has already been made since the day nuclear energy was born .
We improve these security devices day by day .
By now , these techniques are very advanced .
Scientists have added steps to lengthen stored time of waste .
In fact , there are fewer accidental explosions in recent years .
And of course we specially make security systems to minimize the nuclear radiation if the plant is attacked by terrorists .
Besides , defending systems are enhanced and increased when a plant is built .
To conclude , despite these opposing arguments , SCWR has an absolutely promising future for the nuclear energy .
Therefore , it should be encouraged in further research and development funding .
As fossil fuels are non-renewable natural resources , it is unwise to be too dependent on it as our main source of energy .
Being non-renewable , the price of fossil fuels would only get more expensive as time passes .
Moreover , as burning fossil fuels to generate energy releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere , it would be ideal to find a replacement source of energy as early as possible to lessen the global warming effect .
All these major factors have lead many countries to start looking for alternative sources of energy to replace the usage of fossil fuels .
One of these alternative sources would be using nuclear power .
Currently , nuclear power is rejected by the public due to its risk of operation , cost and performance .
However , the new developments of Generation IV reactors show promises as future source of energy .
In order for these new generations of reactors to take over as sources of energy , resources must be invested into it before these ideas can turn into reality .
Out of these Generation IV reactors , the VHTR seems to be the most ideal to be invested for development .
In order to fund the development of the VHTR , support of the public need to be gained through evaluation of its security , costs and performances .
One major concern of the public on nuclear power plants is the plutonium waste produced during reprocessing .
Plutonium is a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 240) However , VHTR is one of the few nuclear reactors that do not produce plutonium waste .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 239 , Para .3) Moreover , energy generation through VHTR does not produce greenhouse gases like the burning of fossil fuels , reducing global warming indirectly .
Therefore , public concerns on plutonium being produced to make advanced nuclear weapons would no longer be valid .
In order for the VHTR nuclear reactor to be ideal for commercial production of energy , a lot of research is needed .
The funds needed for this research would be very costly .
However , if there is no other new sources of energy , the increasing energy demand would make the cost of oil and coal much more expensive in the long run .
The energy demand from US transport alone will cause the nation's oil imports to soar by 78% by 2025 .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 239 , Para .1) Hence , by investing in the research of VHTR , there will be less reliance on oil and coal for energy , making the costs of energy usage more stable and affordable .
The most major concern of the public on nuclear power plants would be its safety .
Nuclear power plants are dangerous as any human errors could result in leakage of radioactive substances , damaging the environment as well as causing deaths .
From past experiences on nuclear power plants , memories of accidents of partial reactor meltdown in 1979 and explosion of reactor core in 1986 would only cause the public to be more sceptical towards them .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 238 , Para .4) In order to prevent history from repeating itself , the new generation of reactors would use simple and effective safety measures that do not depend on complicated systems .
They are designed to be human independent whenever an accident occurs .
With this safety feature , accidents due to human errors could be prevented and would no longer be an issue .
In addition , the VHTR uses materials that have low reactivity and high temperature endurance .
(wapedia , page 4 , Para 2) One example would be the usage of helium as the coolant which has no reactivity effects .
(wapedia , page 3 , Para 1) With all these aspects of safety taken into consideration , the public should be ensured that nuclear power plants would be a safe source of energy .
To sum it all up , the many concerns the public has on the past generations of nuclear reactors that lead to catastrophic accidents are addressed in VHTR .
The problem of plutonium waste being produced in past nuclear reactors is no longer present in VHTR .
The probability of human errors that lead to accidents are also largely reduced through human independent safety features .
Moreover , due to the rising cost of using fossil fuels , the cost of researching in VHTR has become more worthwhile in the long run .
Therefore , VHTR should be further researched and funded for a better tomorrow .
Due to the rising demand of energy and the need to solve the problems in the design of current reactor , generation IV reactor has been developed .
It is developed to improve the performance of previous generations of reactors .
The nuclear powers that produced from the generator can offset other primary fuels in many applications other than the production of electricity .
The new Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) concepts focus mainly on sustainable nuclear power , with very efficient resource use and so little wastage .
It has a very strong focus on (passive) safety .
The GFR system features a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium .
The reactor is helium-cooled with an outlet temperature of approximately 850  C . It uses a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency .
Several forms of fuel are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures .
The GFR's fast spectrum makes it feasible to utilize available fissile and fertile materials (including depleted uranium from enrichment plants) .
"This high flux level generally translates into a very high fission rate , and as a result the power density in a fast reactor core is usually very high , typically of the order of 300 MW/m3 , which is 3 to 4 times higher than in light water reactor (LWRs) ."
(Van Rooijen , 2009) .
Furthermore , through the combination of a fast neutron spectrum and full recycle of actinides , GFRs minimize the production of long-lived radioactive waste isotopes , and can be designed for minor actinide management from used up fuel .
Finck .P (2006) , Future of nuclear Energy and the role of Nuclear Data .
Peter Rullhusen , Nuclear Data Needs for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , the international workshop .
In common with other fast reactors , GFRs also have the exceptional potential , due to the hard neutron spectrum , as sustainable energy sources using the fissile materials , and could then minimize nuclear waste .
The design of GFR development strategy is to take full advantage of the Very High Temperature Reactor development (VHTR) .
The two reactor concepts use a common coolant (helium) and high temperature to maximize the thermal efficiency for electricity generation and enhance prospects for hydrogen generation .
The design of GFR is for no off-site radioactivity release and would require the efficiency , simplicity , robustness and reliability of systems and physical barriers .
However , high temperature of VHTR has limited the use of available metallic components for the heat utilization or power conversion systems .
When VHTR is at 950 C , the lifetime of available high temperature alloys will be reduced .
As a consequence , components being exposed to high temperatures may have to be replaced every 15-20 years if no better materials can be qualified .
In comparison , GFR require less visual inspection than VHTR since it produced relatively lesser heat .
Also , in building of the VHTR , there will only be countable choices of building materials that can be used since they must have the ability to withstand very high temperature .
Thus , the construction of VHTR reactor will definitely be more costly as compared to GFR .
Hence , it is relatively cheaper to build GFR than VHTR .
Moreover , GFR is more environmental friendly as it has an advanced recycling technology that reduces the number of waste as compare with the VHTR .
To ensure sustainable development without the compromise on environment , GFR has used nuclear power to provide energy .
Thus , it has greatly reduced the excessive production of carbon dioxide .
According to world nuclear association , "the cost of managing and disposing of nuclear power plant wastes is about 5% of the total cost of the electricity generated ."(2009) .
Thus , nuclear waste has not only occupied space , it costs even more to solve the problem .
In terms of it producing lesser waste , GFR has proved to be more outstanding than VHTR .

With the development of the post-modern society , more and more energy is required for its maintenance and growth .
The world seems to get relieved from the lack of energy source since the Generation IV reactors come out .
However , the newborn technology , Generation IV reactors needs to be improved before it can be applied to practical uses .
It is difficult to make a decision on whether there should be R&D funding for the development of Generation IV reactors .
Although there are many benefits we can gain from Generation IV reactors , we still have to face the high cost , the danger for nuclear weapons and the difficulty in preventing corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
In my opinion , there should not be R&D funding for the development of Generation IV reactors .
Firstly , compared to the high cost , the benefit from developing Generation IV reactors is insufficient .
Generally , the Generation IV reactors are known as more environmental friendly and can reduce the greenhouse effect .
However , when we consider the high cost to build and maintain the reactors , the Generation IV reactors are not so attractive .
Jim Green writes in Nuclear Weapons and 'Fourth Generation' Reactors: "Nuclear power could at most make a modest contribution to climate change abatement , mainly because it is used almost exclusively for electricity generation which accounts for about one-quarter of global greenhouse emissions .
Doubling global nuclear power output (at the expense of coal) would reduce greenhouse emissions by about 5% ."
However , the generation IV reactor that China is going to build will cost China 3 billion Yuan .
That is almost 450 million Dollars .
How much greenhouse effect can we reduce if we use theses money in other ways ?
In other words , if we compare the reduction of greenhouse effect with the cost of building the generation IV reactors , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
Generation IV reactors would cause nuclear danger .
When this technology is developed , many countries would say that the generation IV reactors will only be used for energy purposes .
However , the IFR will be able to produce enough Plutonium to make 1M nuclear weapons by 2075 (Frank Barnaby , 2009) .
Therefore , we should be discreet on such issue .
"We are at a crossroads .
Unless governments work together to safeguard nuclear energy supplies , the rise in unsecured nuclear technology will put us all in danger .
Without this , we are hurtling towards a state of nuclear anarchy where terrorists or rogue states have the ways and means of making nuclear weapons or 'dirty bombs' , the consequences of which are unimaginable ," says Barnaby .
This is a dangerous situation .
If the governments and military organizations cannot come up with strategy to deal with this problem , we cannot afford to set up the R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
The technology so far is not able to prevent corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
However , Generation IV reactors still need some container to hold the radioactive materials .
The main materials used in nuclear reactors are Ni alloys , stainless steels , Zr alloys , low alloyed steels , copper alloys and Ti .
Apart from Ti , each one of the main metallic materials listed above experiences at least one of the following types of corrosion: Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) , Irradiation-assisted Stress Corrosion Cracking (IASCC) , Environmentally Assisted Cracking (EAC) , Intergranular Attack (IGA) , Flow-assisted Corrosion (FAC) , General Corrosion (GC) , Ammonia Corrosion (AC) and Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion (MIC) (Francois Cattant , Didier Crusset and Damien Feron  ,2008) .
However , Ti is too expensive and thus makes it of high cost to build generation IV reactors .
In this case , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
Building generation IV reactors will cost much but only reduce a small amount of world's greenhouse effect .
Building generation IV reactors will leave us in nuclear-weapon-danger and terrorism-danger .
What is worse , the technology cannot prevent corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
In conclusion , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
As the search for a new source of clean energy is mounting due to the depletion of fossil fuels , nuclear energy comes into focus as one of the most reliable and efficient replacement alternative fuel .
Nuclear reactors are already generating 17% of the world's electricity (Butler , 2004 , p . 240) .
The latest and most efficient design of the Generation 4 nuclear is the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) .
Although there are numerous public concerns on the safety of nuclear reactors , VHTR's promising potentials and benefits in the aspect of security , cost and performance far outweighs the concerns .
The fear of terrorists invading nuclear plants and stealing radioactive compounds to make weapons of mass destruction is a major public concern .
Moreover , tragic nuclear accidents in the past , such as the ones in Chernobyl , Ukraine and Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , leave people in doubt over the safety of building new nuclear reactors .
However , VHTR combines the latest safety features into its design .
VHTR uses helium gas as its main coolant .
Helium is an inert gas and thus it does not react and become radioactive when exposed to radioactive compounds .
The core of VHTR is made of graphite , which provides further stability due to its high heat capacity and stability at a very high temperature .
Also , the development of Leak before Break method for gas cooled reactor will reduce the risk of leakage .
The method will test leak level based experimental data on break geometry and its associated flow rate (Billot & Barbier , 2004 , p . 8) .
Preventive measures such as spiking the radioactive waste with high heat and reducing the half life of the compound can further minimize terrorist threats and increase public safety .
The cost of building nuclear reactors are expensive and the public argues that too much money will be spend on the research of VHTR; 1 .1 billion to build and to test the prototype (Butler , 2004 , p . 239) .
While it may be true that the cost is relatively high compared to other form of alternative energy , VHTR is build to last 60 years (Baccaglini et al . , 2003 , p . 19) and thus in the long run the overall cost in building is fully compensated by its length of service .
Over its 60 years of service , VHTR would have generated massive amount of energy that is worth more than the cost of building it .
Since VHTR does not incur any waste recycling , VHTR eliminates the expensive cost of building extra facilities for proper storage and reprocessing of nuclear waste .
The hydrogen gas generated as by product can also be sold to hydrogen industry to power hydrogen fuel vehicles .
Some people may belief that the performance of nuclear reactors are generally low and inefficient .
They belief that the high heat energy generated is a waste of energy in itself .
However , VHTR provides the solution to this as VHTR operates at 1000 C , the highest temperature among the 6 new Generation 4 nuclear reactors .
The high temperature means VHTR has the best nuclear energy conversion to electricity .
In fact , VHTR generates up to 600M Watt of thermal power and should be 40% more efficient than do most reactors in the United States (Svoboda , June , 2009) .
VHTR , the only Generation 4 reactor with high enough temperature to help the electrolysis process forming useful hydrogen gas which can then be used as fuel source for hydrogen fuel cars .
This means that VHTR generates both electrical and hydrogen fuel as a clean the energy for the future .
Moreover , the high temperature also enables process heat applications industry such as glass , cement , iron and wood pulp manufacture .
VHTR also incorporates the indirect combined cycle design for electricity generation , enabling a common heat source to be used for electricity and hydrogen generation .
This new design also reduces complexity and minimizes risks of system failure (Gauthier et al . , 2004 , p . 9) .
Nuclear energy is the ultimate solution as a clean and renewable energy source to curb the escalating greenhouse effect and depletion of fossil fuels .
By and large , VHTR , as the new generation of nuclear reactor , with its high performance , enhanced safety design and cost effectiveness , promises to be the most reliable way to generate clean energy in the future .
For the past few decades up till now , nuclear power faces strong opposition from people worldwide .
This causes very few nuclear reactors to be constructed worldwide in recent years .
Nuclear power has its benefits , it is more environmental friendly as compared to renewable resources , we are in the midst of producing a nuclear hybrid reactor which is much cleaner and efficient than the current class IV reactors (Butler , 2004) and they are relatively safer than before .
I firmly believed that nuclear power should be pursued .
Nuclear power should be pursued , in recent years there is a leap in nuclear technology .
A hybrid nuclear reactor known as the International Thermal Nuclear Reactor (ITER) is currently being developed in France .
ITER has significant benefits over the current class IV reactors , it produces less nuclear waste and is more efficient in its production of electricity this could indirectly mean that cost of producing electricity with the use of the hybrid reactors will be much cheaper .
ITER produces neutron as its waste which could be burned up rapidly (Gerstner , 2009) .
While the class IV reactors , produces nuclear waste that contains plutonium and uranium , they incurred a high reprocessing cost and till have 4% of the original nuclear waste left over .
Almost all of the nuclear waste that could not be reprocessed are being buried in landfill sites that could take million of years to decompose and also contaminate the land rendering it useless for other purposes .
This cost of reprocessing nuclear waste makes up the bulk of the maintenance cost incurred .
The ITER could do without the need to reprocess its nuclear waste and therefore could bring the cost down of producing electricity .
Another more significant advantage is the performance of the ITER , being able to produce ten times the power as compared to previous versions .
The ITER utilizes a new technology to contain the nuclear material in a doughnut shaped ring surrounded by a strong magnetic to stabilize the nuclear material thus enhancing its stability and efficiency .
ITER is still at its infancy it make take another 20-30 years before the first plant could be commissioned in Europe .
Nuclear power should be pursued for its environmental friendliness when compared against other forms like coal and diesel power plants and also its improved track record in safety .
Nuclear power plants do not emit huge amounts of green house gases like carbon dioxide when compared against traditional coal power plants .
Since the earth is experiencing global at a rate never seen before , there is a more urgent need to look into ways which we could cut down on green house gases emissions .
The proposed alternative would be the use of nuclear power plants to generate electricity .
There has been no major incidents involving nuclear power plants since the Chernobyl incident in 1986 .
Nuclear power plants now follow a very strict set of operating procedures which prevents any accidents example leakage from happening .
They are heavily protected by security forces , this will deter any terrorist from attempting to hijack a nuclear plant .
The last reason why nuclear power should be pursued is that too renewable energy resources take up too much land meant for farming and forest .
Renewable resources like Biofuel are produced from maize .
The United states alone consumes up to 34 billion litres of biofuel annually satisfying 5% of the total energy demand , this require 19 million hectares of land to produce .
By 2022 the demand for biofuel will increase to 136 billion litres and 31 million hectares of land will be needed to produce this amount of biofuel .
Forest would be converted to farms for cultivating maize , worsening global warming and ruing habitats for wild animals .
Another feared outcome , would be since maize meant for biofuel could fetch a higher price more farmers will choose to sell their maize crop to producers of biofuel and not to market .
This could spike an increase in food prices driving more people towards poverty .
In conclusion , nuclear power should be pursued based on improved designs of nuclear reactors such as the ITER and for its environmental friendliness and to reduce global warming .
Throughout the long-standing history of humanity , the energy has played a crucial role in changing the civilization to the new level .
But the current requirement of continuous energy supplies have grown so rapidly that many countries focus on exploiting current resources , pushing ourselves to the verge of total depleted resources  .
Therefore , we are concentrating on searching new energy source which can probably replace current fossil fuels  .Although with many advantages like high efficiency , no carbon emission and so on , nuclear energy still meets with very strong public opposition , mainly due to memories of two horrible catastrophes in the past: Three Miles Island and Chernobyl  .
Otherwise , it is still questioned about other factors like building cost , performance compared to other rivals , for example , wind energy .
In facts , recently technology achievements have showed positive signals to one of the six concepts of generation IV reactor - Very High Temperature Reactor  , which should receive more supports in both research and development funding .
The most doubtful question still appears in public is about the safety design as well as security solution to against any attempt of terrorists or saboteurs .
Many assays have been made by engineers to create many unique features to tighten the safety .
The modular design approaching  , which has high level safety requirements  , is possible to keep the core in a safe condition if there is any coolant loss accident  , secure the radioactive releases in three layers of stout barriers , while it minimizes number of classified system to maintain the simplification .
These designs will prevent any try to cause accidents to reactor from outside .
On the other hand , the safety design factor come from endeavor to overcome currents difficulties: heat- resistant fuels and materials , high fuel burn-ups , and temperature control .
First , researches has showed the modified 9Cr1Mo steel could be chosen because it has a negligible creep domain in a high temperature range 400-500C  ,yet its precious mechanical properties has no significant change in estimated 60 years of operation under the radiation working environment .
Furthermore , a C-C composite has been selected to make control rod cladding working in high neutron flux and high temperature condition .
Otherwise , engineers has selected are two nickel base alloys , alloy 230 and alloy 617 to make the Intermediate Heat Exchange  .
They have been tested to operate at high temperature at the outlet core ( 850C)  , while they can keep mechanical properties , withstand corrosion in impure helium atmosphere and avoid nitride in mixture of helium and nitrogen atmosphere .
Second , many experimental works have been made to recover the TRISO fuel fabrication with UO2 covered by good quality TRISO , modified by replacing old SiC with new ZrC coating .
Accordingly the new fuel will improve performance drastically , reaching burn-up basis of 80GWd/tHM and withstand very high temperature ( 1600C) , yet without making any significant radionuclide release  .
It would not only enhance the efficiency but also raise the thermal margin under transient condition .
Besides , public's opinions also concern about the problem of performance , the cost and the environment affection if we accept this nuclear reactor .
It is obvious that the cost of one nuclear reactor is very high  , but if we apply it to this next generation reactor , it could be meaningless .
Since this one can operate in very high temperature  , with optimized designs and enhanced fuels , hence it can produce a massive amount of energy  .
Thus , government can easily lower the cost of electric energy retrieved , which make cost of nuclear energy competitive to the others  .Furthermore , safety design also eliminate the chance of leaking radiation , make nuclear reactor a absolutely clean energy .
It should be evident that all public opposition can be solved entirely by new technology and concept .
As a result , we can affirm that the concept of Very High Temperature Reactor should be a first priority in further researches and funding to quickly turn it into reality in near future .
Nuclear energy is an alternative source of energy which can be obtained from either nuclear fission (splitting up of two atoms) or nuclear fusion (combining two atoms) .
In both these reactions large amount of heat energy is released , which is harnessed and converted into electricity .
Although nuclear energy is said to be one of the most efficient means of producing electricity , public concern towards their safety has brought down the number of new reactors being constructed in many countries .
Nuclear incidents such as the one at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986 (where large amounts of radioactive material was released into the atmosphere , causing numerous deaths and genetic diseases) instigated fear of the possibility of such disasters occurring elsewhere .
The other problem faced is that of waste disposal , which needs to be carried out in a safe manner , so as not to pose a threat to the people as well as the environment .
The upcoming reactors , known as the Generation IV reactors , are of six types .
They are Gas cooled , Lead cooled , Molten salt , Fast sodium-cooled , Supercritical water-cooled and Very-high-temperature reactors .
The lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) consists of "afast neutronspectrum , moltenleadorlead-bismuth eutecticcoolant , and a closedfuel cycle" (Wikipedia) .
The technical features of LFR which offer a possibility for procuring "sustainability , safety and reliability , and economic goals are the use of Lead coolant and a long life" (INL , 2007) .
The modular "battery" system is designed in such a way that there is equal distribution between the electricity generated and the other products produced , like hydrogen and potable water .
The primary concern in the LFR is due to the possibility of leakage of the fuel "either from the reactor or the onsite spent fuel" (Union of Concerned Scientists , 2005) which can kill millions of people in a radius of around 500 miles and make the place uninhabitable for many years in the future .
The problems faced in relation to security are , adequate protection is not provided against the known terrorist capabilities the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) does not use force-on-force tests , without the NRC approval changes in the facilities in the nuclear reactor and procedures operated are being made by the nuclear reactor owners .
The cost of generation of nuclear power is comparable to the generation of electricity using coal as a fuel .
In terms of fuel costs , both the costs are almost equal , as the transportation of coal nullifies the cost of the uranium used in nuclear reactors in generating the same amount of electricity .
The capital costs are more in nuclear reactors due to the safety issue involved in construction , when compared to the construction of coal plants .
The maintenance and operation costs are higher in nuclear power plants due to labour , replacement of plant parts , license fees and local property taxes .
The waste related cost for coal is mainly due to ash , whereas in nuclear plants it is from the radioactive waste generated .
In conclusion , the generation IV reactors are more advantageous over the current reactors being used because of the benefits which include , the nuclear waste that lasts for a lesser time , increase in efficiency as more energy is generated from the same amount of fuel and the ability to reuse the spent fuel in generating electricity .
These Generation IV reactors look into four main advancements , namely enhanced safety , proliferation resistance , waste minimization and economic viability .
Safety issues , cost and security requirements along with the eventual depletion of the fossil fuels , thrones Nuclear Energy as the main source of power for the future .
Having being questioned and opposed for a long period , the nuclear power , with the arising of advanced generation IV concepts , once again finds its place to help cope with global energy shortage and many environmental issues .
The Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) is one of the most popular generation IV concepts of nuclear power .
Like the old nuclear reactors , the promotion of SWCR is opposed by some people because of security , environment , performance and cost issues .
However , with its unique advantages and the global demand of energy , it is reasonable and to some extent necessary to support further research funding of SWCR .
With the great destructions done by the explosion of some previous reactors , some people still oppose SWCR for concerning of security and environmental issues .
It is still remember that in 1979 at Three Mile Island , the reactor exploded and killed 31 at once and spewed radioactive across Europe .
But SWCR is much safer and reliable compared with the old reactors .
It would include simplified safety features that do not rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operatorsall are , in principle , 'melt down proof' of an accident with minimal , if any , human intervention (Butler , D . 2004) .
This suggests that any attempt to trigger an accident deliberately by simply switching off the coolant or power supply would be in vain .
Besides , it generates little waste and some of them can be recycled .
Actually it is much cleaner than many other forms of energy that emits too much green-house gas and various pollutions .
Some opponents may question the performance of SWCR .
They doubt that whether or not it is more efficient than other old reactors .
For this question , SWCR gives us a satisfactory answer .
The SWCR system is built on two technologies: Light Water Reactors and supercritical fossil-fired boilers .
It uses extremely high pressure to prevent water from boiling at temperature up to 500 .Thus the thermal efficiency is greatly improved , about 45% versus about 33% efficiency for current Light Water Reactors (Idaho National Laboratory: Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor) .
Although nuclear energy is an effective energy form , it is quite demanding in terms of technology and the cost may be not acceptable .
Some people may question that whether SWCR is good enough to be applied widely , especially in developing countries .
Actually SWCR is simple to design and built that largely lower its cost .
This is because it has a fast neutron spectrum to generate more power for the same size of reactor and it resembles traditional LWR fuel .
Hence Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor is applicable for more countries .
Some countries even consider building such kind of nuclear plants in large scales .
Indeed we can not deny that there exist some other problems about SWCR , some of which have not been completely solved yet .
For instance , opponents criticize that some materials are not easy to find and some waste are difficult to deal with .
But these should not be the reason for abandoning the development of this promising nuclear energy .
Even traditional energies have all kinds of problems that we can not avoid .
By contrast , SWCR has successfully brought down these side effects to quite an acceptable level .
If further funding of research can be devoted to optimizing SWCR , it will become more mature and we can gain a kind of promising energy for the long run .
Energy is an important driving force for the world .
Traditional energy can no longer undertake this mission .
It can not support sustainable development .
It is high time we attached enough significance to the promising nuclear energy like SWCR by funding its research and development to make it more palatable .
With the need for energy increasing rapidly nowadays , nuclear energy is drawing much more attention due to its huge power and non-emission of greenhouse gas .
To apply nuclear energy properly can greatly benefit human beings .
However , once there is any tiny error in the process of using nuclear , terrible disasters may happen .
In the history , there were cases such as the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion and the Three Mile Island accident , which were catastrophes caused by the misuse of nuclear power .
Thus , how to make use of nuclear energy safely and efficiently has become the core problem for modern society .
In 1950s and 1960s , the testing nuclear power plants were considered to use the first generation of nuclear reactors; in 1970s and 1980s , the standardized ones the second; in 1990s , the well-developed ones the third; the fourth generation refers to those under research and development .
(Wen , 2002)
To develop the fourth generation of nuclear plants aims to ensure the security of the application of nuclear energy , especially to protect nuclear plants from terrorism and incorrect operations which can lead to very serious results .
For instance , the careless operation and the designing flaw in Chernobyl gave rise to countless deaths and homelessness .
Furthermore , plants cannot grow there in tens of years , and milk is not allowed to produce there in over a hundred years .
In Nuclear Power's New Dawn , according to Declan Butler , there are six generation IV reactors concepts regarding coolant , temperature , pressure , waste recycling , power output , research needs , and the year to deliver .
(Butler , 2004) The supercritical-water-cooled reactor has more advantages than the other five .
Though some of the reactors have advantage on the output and pressure , among different coolants , water stands out financially and environmentally .
Metal sodium is also not expensive but not safe enough at the same time .
Sodium has a relatively low burning point and has to be stored in kerosene to avoid it from burning which is a hidden security problem .
Thus , the sodium-cooled fast reactor is a good choice but still a little inferior to the supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
Lead-bismuth and helium are both expensive and hard to acquire , which hinders the popularization of gas- cooled fast reactors , lead-cooled fast reactors and very-high-temperature reactors .
Though water is no better than fluoride salts as coolant , the decomposition of fluoride salts at high temperatures is a great threaten to the environment .
Fluorine or HCFCs are can pollute the air and cause damage to the ozone layer .
Moreover , it does not require clean and fresh water to be the coolant , so sea water or some used water can be recycled as coolant of the nuclear reactor .
Because of the above , water is the most suitable material to be the coolant of the generation IV reactors , so supercritical- water-cooled reactor is largely superior to the other five kinds in terms of coolant .
With present science and technology level , the nuclear power can be used by human beings for approximately 20 years .
The estimated year to deliver supercritical-water-cooled reactor is 2025 , and it is within the period that the nuclear energy on the earth can last .
In general , supercritical-water-cooled reactors exceed other five kinds of generation IV nuclear reactors on coolant to a large degree and could be developed in about 5 to 10 years which is relatively short and acceptable .
Hence , supercritical-water-cooled reactor can be considered a better kind among all generation IV nuclear reactors .
Current nuclear generation(II and III) has been applied into different areas to generate secure and inexpensive electric energy .
To further broaden the usage of nuclear power , the next generation of nucleargeneration IV is under discussion .
Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) belongs to one of the six generation IV reactors .
Compared with other reactors , VHTR has the privilege of high efficiency and high security .
Basic researches to establish the new nuclear energy system is taking progress , and inquiries and doubts are generated with regards to safety , feasibility and cost .
The concerns from public have been a main obstacle for further advancement in nuclear research .
These concerns are inevitable , however , not necessary after synthesizing all the aspects and having a better insights into it .
Safety issue has always been the most controversial focus on nuclear energy .
Proponents have argued about the safety factor .
Nuclear and radiation accidents have alerted the critics .
Due to the complexity of nuclear reactors , nuclear energy goes wrong easily .
This could result in significant harm to human body , as it has shown in Pennsylvania radioactive steam leak in 1979 .
(BBC , 2005) Safety should be guaranteed before proceeding .
The VHTR has proved to be greatly advanced in the safety aspect .
The combination with Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor system proves to be efficient in dissipating heat and preventing radioactivity leak .
The new generation plants are inherently very safe .
Safety is assured in the new system .

Another concern is that the technology is difficult to obtain .
The prior technology problem is to find heat-resistant materials to be applied at as high as 1000 degree C . Other issues incurred from high temperature in terms of coolants and accidents also need advancing .
The basic technology for VHTR extends from the former High Temperature Gas Reactors plants .
The technology research is being developed by several plant vendors and national laboratories , such as: PBMR , GT-HTR300C , ANTARES , NHDD , GT-MHR and NGNP in South Africa , Japan , France , Republic of Korea and the United States .
(GEN-4 , n .d .) .
The researches aim at solving the technology problem and implementing the technology by 2020 .
Technology is not a problem to be concerned with .
The third concern is the high cost of research in development of nuclear energy .
Critics doubts the profit of the billions of investment .
The fund for nuclear energy research keeps rising and shows non-profit in a short time .
However , after the implementation of nuclear energy around the world , the efficiency to generate electricity will be largely improved by about 50% .
By 2020 , the portion of nuclear power in electricity production will go up to 17% .
(NGNP , 2008) In the long run , the development of nuclear energy will solve energy and environment problems involving oil and gas .
Hence the future benefit is worth present input .
In conclusion , generation IV nuclear energy , especially VHTR has its enormous advantages in the future .
It provides solutions to many serious problems .
With the advent of the new generation of nuclear energy , people will make a different in the utilization of energy .

In Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries , around 80% of health care expenses are covered by public spending , mostly through subsidies to public hospitals .
That figure stands at 85% in Sweden and the United Kingdom , 81% in Japan .
However in the United States , the figure stands at 45% which is now grappling with a controversial reform plan to provide universal healthcare coverage .
As rising health issues and living costs emerge as a threat to social stability and economic growth , the government must manage public spending on the elderly effectively .
The benefits of economic growth would help to ensure the continuity of social benefits for the elderly by increasing the national income there will be surplus to spend more money on social needs of the nation .
Businesses will get help with rental and wage bills , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said .
The government will extend more loans to local companies and spend $600 million over the next two years on training workers .
The budget would most likely take an aggressive and long term approach to reduce costs , assist businesses and help Singaporeans overcome the current situation in order to be in the pink of economic health again .
Differing views on health insurance to be subsidised from current budgetary surpluses , and for the Government to finance more of its longer-term development expenditure by borrowing from its reserves so as to free up current revenues for social spending .
Social subsidies should be evaluated on their merits and the ability to sustain them without burdening future generations by borrowing from reserves .
We should not expand social subsidies simply because we are currently having a budget surplus .
Spending needs are growing in many areas , not forgetting social spending but we expect the government budget to be tight , therefore our challenge will be to manage the increase in social spending as our population ages , and focus subsidies on those most in need .
As our population ages  , the importance of public spending on the aged with regards to healthcare should be managed effectively without having to over spend or inadequately provided .
Social subsidiaries should be evaluated thus reduce unnecessary spending allowing the Government to finance more of its longer-term development expenditure which in turn brings about greater economic growth .
With economic growth , the financial burden will be lessen and allow more money for spending on social areas .

The world's population is growing older .
By 2050 , one-fifth of the population will be 60 years or older (United Nations , n .d .) .
To prepare for the growing demand of the ageing population , more government funding is required in providing better infrastructure and amenities for the elderly .
However , if public spending is not limited , the increased expenditure on the elderly will be at the cost of the country's development .
Thus , the public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development , which in turn can help to solve the problems of aging population .
Next , public spending should be channelled to the education sector , either to allow more people to get the chance to go to school or to improve the standard of education , and encourage research and development at tertiary levels and beyond .
With more educated citizens , there will be a more productive workforce (Ramphele " Rosovsky , 2000) .
In addition , as the standard of education increases , and more research and development is conducted , the likelihood of technological advancement would be higher .
Advancement in technology can improve the healthcare of the elderly , as more or better treatments for illnesses due to old aged are discovered .
Thus , public spending should be diverted to education sector and promoting research and development , which can improve the welfare of the elderly in both long and short run .
However , new or improved treatments arising from advancement in technology will incur a higher healthcare cost .
Furthermore , limiting public spending on the aged is not an easy task .
This is simply due to fact that setting a limit that is too low may result in some elderly not receiving adequate medical care and home care , and setting a limit that is too high may result in increased burden on government policies and on the working population in society .
Thus , the government needs to prevent the healthcare cost from escalatng too much and also how much funds should be set aside for the elderly .
The government can lower healthcare costs by providing the elderly with cheaper but adequate alternatives .
The Singapore government is expanding its step-down care sector , by increasing the number of community hospitals , nursing homes and home care , which can provide the elderly patients with sufficient care (Majid , 2009) .
The government should decide on the segment of the population that requires government aid in old age before calibrating the essential funds required for the elderly .
Elderly who are financially strapped and/or have no spouse or intermediate family members to take care of them should be taken care of by the government .
The government can identify this group of elderly by conducting means testing .
By adopting the use of means testing , it allows lower income patients to enjoy more subsidies than higher-income patients (Ministry of Health , 2009) .
The government should then carefully decide the necessary healthcare spending that has to be supported by the public sector , as excessive spending or spending that exceed the means of the government will lead to future generation having to pay higher tax , as the successor government is left with huge bill (Tan " .Ho , 2008) .
Population ageing is inevitable .
In this modern age , there is no doubt that up to date research and development on policies is imperative to identify problems that the elderly face .
It also contributes in the aspect of providing applicable solutions to ease the greying population which is gradually growing in society .
I wholeheartedly agree that research and development is the pathway to relieve the ageing process .
Research and development is also important to measure to what extent the government should provide sensible solutions in terms of expenditure to support medical requirements for the aged .
As mentioned , an ageing population has high demands for medications and social care services .
Through research and development , it is said that the government should support these demands .
However , a limit has to be established so that spending is not extravagant .
It is also vital that a perspective is set on the government not being the sole agent to relieve the ageing process .
Private practices in healthcare professionals , social care services and organizations for citizens also correspond to the aged .
In Singapore , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong implemented that healthcare system will be restructured for the ageing population .
For instance , he said one key step is to link up acute hospitals with community ones where patients can receive treatment at the acute hospital and then recuperate at the community hospital (Channel NewsAsia , 2009) .
It is undeniable that research and development is important to ease the greying population .
However some policies may not only bring positivity .
An extension in the working lives of the elderly , can bring negative effects .
The ageing population is often associated with poor health thus exerts low productivity .
It will also be harder for them to acquire new skills that can benefit some industries .
Besides that , some older workers cost more than younger workers due to the seniority payment system .
As a consequence , older workers are considered both vulnerable for dismissal , or to be targeted by companies wishing to make workforce reductions , and less able to find new jobs should they loose their current work (Bernard Casey , 1998) .
However , these negatives are outweighed when active ageing takes place as the new paradigm for the aged .
Older people are active contributors in this age-integrated society .
They can remain as active providers and beneficiaries of modernization .
Research and development plays is relatively important to determine the direction of an ageing population .
Deterioration of a greying population due to problems associated with it can be addressed via strategies formed from policies for the aged .
Active ageing as the new paradigm of ageing is the key to overcome healthcare challenges and other problems arise with the ageing population as well .
These challenges are not only the concern of the government .
Other sectors should collaborate to produce the best solutions to ease the ageing population .
Lastly , it is essential for continuity in research and development for policies to suit needs of the elderly .
In fact , the aging populations who do not have families or disabilities really need the helps from others .
When they are sick , because of they do not have families or their disabilities , they cannot take care of themselves .
Thus , the welfare programs will be the vital for them .
But this does not mean that the public should spend much to help them .
One of the reasons is those who without families and disabilities are just minority , the majority of the elderly have their own families and they will take care of their elderly .
Furthermore , because of Singapore is a country which influenced by the Confucius thinking and emphasized on the filial piety , the young generation know their obligation to take care of the elderly .
Thus , limit the public spending on the aging population and divert the money into other areas of the development of country will be a suitable and accessible proposal .
In conclusion , the public spending on the aging population should be limited and diverted to the economy area and the technology area of the development of the country .
Development in economy area can stabilize the condition of the country , increase the productivity and increase more government income which could be used for the elderly , while the development of technology area also can bring people healthier bodies .
Thus , diverting money to other areas of country's development will not just solve the problems of the aging population , but will also bring every person in the country a lot of benefits .
The senior citizens have contributed a lot in making what we enjoy today .
From Fighting for independent to paving the way for our generation today to live in comfort , their services are immeasurable .
It is therefore our duty to pay back what we have inherited from them .
Thus , public spending always included the spending on elderly .
Unfortunately , there are so many hue and cries in generation today that the public spending on the elderly should be limited for the sake of country's development .
However , I opine that the public spending on the aged should not be limited because not only the elderly will get the benefits from the spending but indirectly the society will get the benefits in any sphere .
Basing the argument on the fact that public spending on aged should not be limited , I am obliged to add that other areas of the country's development should not be neglect as well .
Although the tendency for public spending to be increasingly especially to elderly , it doesn't mean that other areas of the country's development have been taken for granted .
Government should plan carefully in public spending so that they won't face the problem that can't afford equity any other way such as education , security and economics .
I think this will be a fairer system instead of limited the public spending on elderly .
Fast aging population has increasingly become a serious problem especially for many developed countries .
One of the many causes of a fast aging population is that many people choose to have very few or even no children due to many discouraging factors such as the high cost of child maintenance .
Childcare costs in Singapore actually average $670 a month .
Hence , it has been reflected in the official statistic where the replacement rate in Singapore is only 1 .29 last year , way below the 2 .1 replacement rate for a population to maintain its current size in the long term (Li X . Y . , 2008) .
In addition , the elderly often incur higher costs in terms of healthcare and other miscellaneous needs .
Hence , with such demands from the aging population , it is imperative that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
However , taking care of the elderly should not be the sole responsibility of the government .
Every individual should try to play their part in dealing the problems of an aging population .
Therefore , other strategies should also be introduced to cope with the problem of aging population .
For example , the better-off should try to support their own elderly parents through ways such as giving them monthly allowance etc .
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore has also made a National Day Rally Speech this year to stress on filial obligation for parent maintenance .
In addition , the money spent on country's development in the area of education and economy can also help to solve the problems of an aging population .
For example , the economic growth of the country can help to ensure the continuation of welfare programs due to increased revenues of the country .
Education can also help to raise the awareness of the young as well as increasing their understanding of the need for them to play a part in dealing with the problems of an aging population .

Ageing population is a fact .
It is foremost a consequence of the "baby boom" - the rapid increase in birth rates and then its decline after the Second World War .1 This period of increased fertility lasted for thirty years and the number of people born in this era was unusually large .
Population ageing has also been intensified by increases in life expectancy at older ages because of education , improved healthcare , and technology .
Such demographic changes might bring about severe consequences , most importantly national budgets might be under pressure as growing number of elderly persons are supported fewer younger persons .
The debate now is whether the nation state should limit its public spending so that the saved resources can be utilised to other areas f the country's development .
In this brief essay I would strongly argue that yes , the state should indeed limit its spending and focus more on economic growth so as to not to discriminate against the elderly but rather to aid them in a more fruitful way which is beneficial for both generations .
I believe that economic growth has its "trickle down" effect and accompanies numerous positive externalities which would help the old even more efficient way than continuous increase in healthcare spending which restrains GDP growth .

Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
The rapid advancements in genetic research and technology over the last few decades have led to a host of important advances in the detection of genetic conditions and diseases .
These developments have also raised concerns whether a carrier of a known genetic risk have the duty to inform their relatives about their genetic test results .
According to the National Human Research Genome Institute (2009) , genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies alterations in a person's gene , chromosome or the level of key proteins coded for by specific genes .
An individual who only has one altered copy of a gene is known as a carrier .
Carriers will not be diagnosed with the disease but can pass on alteration to their children .
On one hand , some may believe that carriers do not have the responsibility to reveal their genetic test results to their relatives as discrimination and excess worrying may occur .
On the other hand , it is more logical to believe that carriers have the duty to inform their relatives regarding their tests results so that their relatives can make informed choices .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be compelled to reveal their genetic test results to their relatives .

Firstly , critics perceive that there is a risk of stigma and discrimination for the carrier's relatives , especially in access to employment and health insurance .
Sociologists note that relatives of carriers of known genetic risks may be denied application of health insurance policies or have to pay higher premiums since they are at higher risk of developing the disease (Health Plan One , n .d .) .
This is because insurance companies being mostly profit-orientated would predict any possible added costs and take pre-emptive actions to avoid these costs .
In addition , healthy and qualified relatives of carriers may be denied employment opportunities (American Medical Association , 1991) .
Employers may have the misguided belief that they have to pay more money in order to ensure the working environment is safe for these employees .
The consideration of medical leaves that these employees may take in future may deter the employers from engaging their services for fear of loss in efficiency at work and trouble in finding replacements .
As such , companies will not tend to employ individuals who have medical history of genetic diseases .
However , these arguments fail to consider the measurements in place to protect insurance and employability for relatives of carriers .
Paddock (2008) asserted that the enactment of laws such as the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act 2008 in the United States would prohibit insurance companies to reject policies due to genetic information and forbid companies to use genetic information for hiring decisions for individuals .
Moreover , a mathematical model to work out the extra mortality for individuals associated with higher risks of illnesses such as Hungtinton's disease will guide insurance companies to formulate reasonable amount of premiums (Watts , 1999) .
Hence , genetic information will not be used against family members when applying for an insurance policy or a job .
Secondly , detractors argue that genetic information of carriers will cause unnecessary worry for their family members , especially for multi- factorial diseases .
Medical professionals contend that these family members may experience psychological effects such as fear , anxiety and depression , affecting their lifestyle (Yap , 2005) .
Multi-factorial diseases such as coronary heart diseases may occur in isolation , with affected children born to unaffected parents .
Furthermore , the Mendelian pattern of inheritance is unclear even though there may be multiple cases in the same family (Lobo , 2008) .
As such , family members will be uncertain if the disease is present in the family line and fret about the medical conditions of their future generations .
Nonetheless , this argument ignores the possibility that counselling sessions can be provided for the family members .
Psychologists assert that some family members can consult genetic counsellors about their risk of contracting the disease , hence overcoming their fears (Adams , 2003) .
This measure is usually recommended for multi-factorial diseases as there is higher possibility of uncertainty in one's health .
Hence , worries of family members can be eliminated .
Lastly , carriers of a known genetic risk have the duty to inform their relatives as it would aid their relatives in decision makings .
Ethicists assert that these relatives will be alarmed .
They may perform the disease testing in which genetic results may allow them to make informed decisions especially during family planning .
Rosner (2009) argued that this is important for the Jewish community as it is illegal to abort a child during pregnancy .
With the acquisition of genetic test results , couples may consider adopting a child instead of pregnancy .
Also , couples will be mentally prepared for their child's future as early detection of diseases such as phenylketonuria in newborns can prevent death .
In all , carriers have the obligation to inform their family members their genetic test results since the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages .
In future , genetic testing may be more common and more people may feel the need to share their genetic results .

Genetic testing is the study of one's genes , chromosomes and protein to determine whether a person is prone to a certain kind of disease and whether the person is a carrier or not (Cancer .net , 2009) .
When a person is found to be a carrier though genetic testing , problem is arise as to whether the carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as a carrier will not get the disease but the carrier can pass the disease to his or her children (Frequently Asked Questions About Genetic Testing , 2009) .
In my view , a carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as firstly , there is a possibility that they might get the disease or they might be a carrier too and hence they have a right to know .
Secondly , the carrier can get moral support from the family member despite the fact that the carrier might face discrimination upon disclosure of results .
A carrier should tell his or her relatives as they might be in risk of getting the disease or being a carrier too (Lea , Williams and Donahue , 2005) .
This is because the carrier got the disease through his or her parent , and thus the carrier's siblings and the carrier's children might have also gotten the altered gene .
Hence it is important to inform the carrier's relatives so that they could go for the testing to check whether they are carriers or have inherited disposition to the disease .
If they were found to be carrier , they have the chance to choose to not to reproduce or even having mental preparation about their children's health in the future if they decided to do so .
After all , taking care of a child with disease is not an easy task .
They should consider whether they are prepared to look after the child if the child gets the disease as it is not only financially exhausting , but mentally as well .
If they were found to have the probability of getting the disease , they could then be more mentally prepared due to the early notice .
Thus by informing the relatives about the result , the family member can better plan their future and be mentally prepared for the worst .
Another reason why carrier should tell his or her relatives is because his or her relatives might be able to provide support to him .
After knowing that he or she is a carrier , he or she will have many worries and even guilt if his or her offspring has got the disease though him or her (Cancer .net , 2009) .
The carrier may also feel "imperfect" and have lower self esteem because of this situation .
During this period of time , support from relatives , which can help in coping with these negative feelings , is especially crucial to the carrier (Finucane , n .d .) .
After all , family member are the closest people to the carrier and only their support can make him or her feel better .
Hence a carrier should tell his or her relatives of the genetic test result .
Others might argue that by telling relatives about the result , he or she may face discrimination from the relatives .
This is supported by a survey conducted in 1997 which has identified more than 200 case of genetic discrimination out of 917 people who responded (Genetic Information and the Workplace , 1998) .
Some carriers might faced problems such as being isolated as if they have contagious disease; being talked behind their backs or even blamed for passing the disease when relatives are diagnosed positive (Finucane , n .d .) .
These situations will only make the carrier unhappier and hence choosing not to tell his or her relatives about the result .
However , the situations mentioned above happen rarely within the family .
Most of the discriminations are by the employers or the insurance companies .
This is proven by another survey which has stated that 550 people had been denied employment or insurance , not by family member , due to their genetic defect (Genetic Information and the Workplace , 1998) .
Hence by telling relatives about the result will not face discrimination .
It is only when the public get to know about it then will you face discrimination .
Furthermore , family member are the closest people to the carrier and if they do not support each other no one will .
Hence a carrier should tell his or her relatives of the genetic test result as discrimination by relatives is rare .
In conclusion , a carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as there is a possibility that they might get the disease or they might be a carrier too and the carrier can get support from them .
Although some might argue that by disclosure of the result , the carrier might face discrimination , this is generally not the case hence it should not prevent ones from telling the result .
With the advancement in medical technology , people can find out and understand the various causes of diseases .
In the past , people thought that diseases were mainly caused by natural calamities and bacteria or viral infections .
It is until recently that scientists and researchers have found out that by human's genes being the cause of certain diseases such as heart diseases , cancers and diabetics type 1 .
By making use of genetic testing to test individual's genes , one will be able to know whether he or she will develop genetic disease or carry any disease-causing genes .
Individuals who undergo such tests will find that the outcome of the tests not only affect them but also their family members .
This is because there may be a possibility that they will suffer from the genetic disease as well .
Hence , the individual faces a dilemma whether or not to reveal the test results to them as his family members may not accept the fact and will be adversely affected by the harsh reality .
Nevertheless , individuals should be obligated to inform his family members of the outcome of the genetic testing as by doing so will have benefits to both parties; such as providing support to each other and taking careful precautions to reduce risks of infection .
In face of a possibility of getting an incurable disease that will affect a person for life , it is important that family members can accompany and support him along the journey to fight against the illness .
Furthermore , family members will be more understanding to patients and help them financially , such as providing for their daily expenses and medical costs .
If patient's family members are not aware of his condition , he will suffer silently and it is more likely for him to be succumbed upon by the illness .
For example , a local celebrity , Chew Chor Meng who is suffering from Kennedy's disease , has revealed his to his family and the public of his genetic disease .
Instead of feeling pessimistic towards life and being discriminated by the public , he has received encouragement from the public and support from his family that has made him more resilient and optimistic in fighting against the disease .
Hence , individuals should be obligated to inform their relatives as it is beneficial for themselves to fight against genetic illnesses effectively .
Secondly , individuals should inform their relatives as it is their moral responsibility towards them .
As there is a saying that , "prevention is always better than cure;" Relatives who are informed earlier of the genetic results can take earlier health precautions to reduce the risks of infection or the severity of the effects of the disease (Varga & Sturm , 2008) .
For instance , they can change their decisions about their lifestyle such as changing bad eating habits , saving money for their future and exercise more frequently .
Even if they do not develop the genetic diseases , the precautions taken at an earlier stage of their lives will benefit them against other forms of illnesses that may not be caused by their genes .
Some may argue that individuals who have undergone genetic testing should not be obligated to inform their relatives for fear that they will lost their privacy and cause their relatives to suffer from emotional burden of feeling guilty and anxious whether they would suffer from the disease .
However , there have been laws set up to prevent discrimination against individuals who are suffering from genetic diseases .
For example , the United States Government has implemented the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to prevent individuals from discrimination at work and getting an insurance plan (Genetics and public policy center , 2009) .
Hence , with the governments' efforts to implement laws to protect individuals' interests , they should feel assured of their privacy .
Moreover , genetic counseling groups have been set up to help affected individuals and their family members to handle their emotional distress through counseling sessions (Norrgard , 2008) .With counseling , trained and professional counselors can provide good advice to individuals to help them make better decisions and to clear misconceptions of genetic testing .
Eventually , individuals and family members will be able to accept the fact and face it positively .
Hence , with a healthy mindset set in their minds , they are more likely to win the battle against their illnesses .
In conclusion , individuals should be obligated to inform their relatives of the genetic testing results as they can provide support for each other to overcome the illness more effectively .
If they do not do so , relatives who are kept in the dark may suffer more as they do not have the tendency to take earlier precautions to mitigate the effects of the illness .
Therefore , individuals should inform their loved ones of their situations so that they can help each other through the difficult times .
Many diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease , cystic fibrosis , Huntington's disease , dementia , Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer may be identified by genetic testing (Access excellence 2009) .
Even though genetic disease only shows a higher risk of developing the disease , it is very important and crucial as knowing the predisposition to these disease may help to reduce the risk of developing it by controlling one's lifestyle as environmental factors play important role as well  .
Thus , if tested positive with these genes , the individual should be obligated to tell his family members .
This is especially true for fatal diseases and diseases which is strongly connected to genes .
This is important to ensure early steps are taken to reduce the risk for him and his family to develop the disease .
In addition , he should also bring his family members along for genetic counseling so as to prevent unnecessary emotional disturbance due to misinterpretation of results  .
Firstly , it is beneficial for the individual to inform his family members about the result as his family may help to reduce emotional disturbance .
While genetic counselors may give advices so as to reduce the likelihood of developing the disease , family members may provide the individual with emotional support .
This is very crucial as emotional disturbance might lead to a higher chance of developing the disease .
Hence , it is better for the individual to share this information with the family members .
Some may argue that the information is the individual's privacy , thus it is up to him who to reveal it to .
However , it is the individual's responsibility to tell his family members regarding this .
This is because might be harmful for him to keep this as a secret as he might be emotionally disturbed by it .
According to a survey done on women regarding factor V Leiden (FVL) , 77% women were emotionally disturbed by genetic testing  .
When people are emotionally disturbed , they might not be able to think rationally thus this may be harmful to the individual's health as it may result in depression and unbalanced diet .
Some individuals do not want to reveal it to his family as he do not want his family to be worried .
However , not knowing the true reason that caused him to be emotionally affected will even cause his family to be more worried .
In addition , the family may consult genetic counselors to seek for advices so as to reduce emotional problems .
Secondly , the inherited genetic disease may affect not only the individual but his family too as they might also have the defective genes .
Diseases like Alzheimer and dementia do not show early physical symptoms .
Hence , by informing his family about the know genetic risk he has , he may encourage his family to go for genetic testing too .
This is beneficial as it helps to increase family's awareness and preparedness for such disease .
This may actually help to save lives .
If he is a carrier of a genetic disease , he might passed it to his offspring .
However , this may be prevented though In- Vitro Fertilization(IVF) method .
In IVF , only the embryo that does not have the defective genes will be implanted in the mother's womb .
Thus , the offspring will not have the defective genes hence lowering its possibility to develop the disease .
Others may argue that in the case of cancer , the presence of altered copy of the inherited gene account for only 5 to 10 percent of all cancers and the majority of people who develop breast cancer or colon cancer did not inherit such genes (Access excellence 2009) .
The presence of such genes only increases the risk of developing cancer and environmental factors play a much more important role .
Thus , there is no need for the individual to tell his family member about it as genes does not play an very important role .
Though it is true that environmental factors plays a more significant role , the presence of such genes in the case of breast cancer greatly increases the possibility of developing the disease .
Out of every 100 women who inherit a mutated gene related to breast cancer , as many as 60 will develop breast cancer by age 50; by age 70 , approximately 80 will develop breast cancer (learn .genetics 2009) .
Hence , by knowing this information at an early stage , early preventive measure can be taken to reduce the possibility of developing the breast cancer by controlling one's lifestyle .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic disease should be obligated to inform his family member about it both himself and his family will benefit from it .
Genetic testing is a type of testing which identifies changes in chromosomes , genes or proteins .
It is also a test that analyses and detects heritable disease-related genotypes , mutations , phenotypes or karyotypes .
There are some samples of genetic tests which are newborn screening , diagnostic testing , carrier testing , prenatal testing and others .
People who undergo the test will be notified for the results .
Some of them may show a positive result as a carrier of a known genetic .
If they knew about it , should they tell others especially their relatives ?
I believe that they should tell their relatives due to responsible , prevention and public issues .

In conclusion , the individual with the positive result in genetic testing which shows he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk should reveal due to responsible , prevention and public issues .
This reveal of the result can help many people include ourselves .
Therefore , we should not keep it as our secret .

Since the completion of the Human Genome Project , scientists have been making many breakthroughs in the study of genetics .
Genes that are responsible for inheritable diseases have since been identified .
Now , genetic testing is available as a way to detect the presence of such genes in patients .
While the results of such tests may cause much grief and unwarranted panic , should reasons such as this justify the nondisclosure to one's relatives of a genetic time-bomb which may be inherently inside them ?
Firstly , it is imperative that a carrier of a disease related to genetic disorder tell his or her relatives as soon as possible .
Some of these diseases are curable if treatments are sought early .
Such is the case for the genetic disorder Phenylketonuria which can be identified by genetic testing .
Infants who inherit this disorder will look perfectly normal during the first 6 months of their birth .
Failure to identify and treat Phenylketonuria in time however may result in mental illness at later stages of an infant's life .
(Schuett , 2008) There are some who think that the disclosure of a genetic testing result is unnecessary and they argue that it may bring immense grief and worry to their relatives .
However , without being warned of the possible risk of inheriting these diseases , they would probably not go for their own genetic testing and hence would run the risk of having a late treatment to a disease related to genetic disorder which may have catastrophic consequences .
Admittedly , there are bound to be repercussions arising from the disclosure of such information .
Inheritance(in terms of money and assets) that one will receive is one of the aspects that may be affected by the result of one's genetic testing result .
For instance , the less healthy child of a rich tycoon may be discriminated in a choice of a successor .
However , should such important information that may potentially save the lives of one's relatives be withheld due to these personal benefits ?
On the other hand , some are worried that revealing such information to the young may affect their psychological well-being(Living with , 2009) .
Nonetheless , with proper genetic counseling which is usually accompanied by genetic testing itself , parents may decide the best way to deal with this information .
In conclusion , the result of one's genetic testing may not only affect oneself , but others too .
If this crucial information is shared among relatives without self-interest , it may even save lives .
Although this disclosure may inevitably bring about discrimination in both the family and outside the family , it is certain that concerns with health should outweigh monetary benefits .
Moreover , efforts are made by the government to pass laws such as GINA to prevent genetic discrimination .
Hence , with proper guidance such as genetic counseling , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
"Blood is thicker than water" .
Indeed , if one possesses an allele that might develop into a crippling ailment , one should not remain silent as family members can help to share the burden (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
This may also lower the risk of developing stress-induced illnesses such as cancer as well (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
Relatives prone to the disease can also take necessary precautions to prevent the illness from developing (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
Yet , not everyone might have freedom to do so , fearing that family members might not be able to accept the news .
However , such decisions only have short-term benefits and fail to consider the bigger picture such as situations which one's family eventually discovers one's secret .
Certainly , that may cause an even bigger heartbreak (Pelletier , 2005) .
Hence , one should be obligated to break the news early to their relatives .
Earlier disclosure of such information allows the family to provide emotional support when one needs it most .
Initially , upon receiving the test results , individuals might exhibit a multitude of reactions ranging from depression to anxiety to anger (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
This is the time where family support is most essential for one as members can help to share the problem and advise how one should handle the problem .
However , there are cases which one may not have the liberty to share the information with the family due to the unstable condition of another member .
One may also resort to this in order not to further burden their loved one .
However , doing this may result in bigger repercussions when the family member involved finds out and is overwhelmed by the news (Pelletier , 2005) .
Hence , it is essential that one should notify one's family .
Besides being able to receive family support , letting others know is also a form of relieving unnecessary stress .
Conversely , keeping such important secrets to oneself , in the long run it might actually develop into stress which may exacerbate their current condition and trigger certain stress-induced illnesses such as cancer to develop (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
Critics however may feel that individuals may get discriminated even within family which may be a source of stress for one (Wolff , 1996) .
Consequently , a disadvantageous situation is created instead of a beneficial one .
Nonetheless , not all families are unloving .
Hence more often than not , one should be frank with one's family and not withhold any results from the genetic test .
Early disclosure also allows relatives to take early precautions (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) and prevent themselves from succumbing to the disease as well .
An example would be one's family shifting from their usual unhealthy diet to a healthier one .
As such , one's family may be 'empowered' (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) to make apt decisions which reduce the risk of developing the illness .
However , even though the disclosure empowers one's relatives take precaution measures , it might end up causing an increased anxiety among family members (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
In spite of this , some form of prevention may be better than none at all .
As the saying goes , "prevention is better than cure" .
Thus , it is crucial that one should tell their family .
There are certain disorders that exist such that they would have adverse effects on the health of individuals .
Genetic testing is then carried out to determine if a person carries genes for certain inherited disorders .
Of course , if the disorder is treatable , one would not worry so much about the consequences .
However , if the disorder turns out to be non-treatable , the ethical issue as to whether the carrier of the known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives arises .
Privacy and discrimination supports the fact that the carrier should not be obliged to disclose the information to his relatives .
Firstly , a carrier should not be obligated to disclose information to his relatives as he has the individual rights as a patient to privacy .
Privacy plays a very important role in a person's life as it "helps individuals maintain autonomy and individuality" (Privacilla .org , February 12 2001) .
Everyone has his own rights to decide whether their personal information should be revealed to third parties .
Without privacy , the person would feel violated as he does not have the right to withhold his information of his disorder .
Therefore , the carrier should not feel obliged to reveal his disorder .
Secondly , discrimination from the relatives affects the carrier's decision in revealing his condition .
One might never know how the relatives would react upon knowing the condition of the carrier .
The reactions can be extreme , either keeping a distance away from him or sharing the pain together with the carrier .
For example , some relatives would have the thinking that the genetic risk of the carrier would bring about bad reputation to them and they would start to distant themselves and try to lose all contact from him .
Discrimination has been found to have harmful effects on people such as a high risk depression .
It is already bad for a carrier to have a genetic risk , it would be much worse if depression strikes him .
Thus a carrier should not be obligated in telling his relatives about his genetic risk .
In conclusion , it is the social and emotional aspects that affect the carrier's decision on whether or not he should make known his genetic risk to his family members .
Time is also an important factor just like the phrase "the right time" goes .
Thus , a carrier should not be obligated to tell his relatives about his genetic risk .
The controversy of whether carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives has been highly debated within the bioethics community (Mehlman , 2009) .
Individuals may choose not to reveal their positive test results to their relatives after taking the test , as they fear that their family will not be able to cope with the pressure since they are potentially at risk as well (Haidle , 2005) .
However , revealing the results may have some positive effects to both individuals and their family psychologically and physically (Chang & Haber , 2007) .
In addition , families can also help in reducing the risk of the next generation .
Therefore , I agree that carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their family .

Secondly , by telling their family their results , their family will tend to be more health conscious since they will understand that they are potentially at risk too .
In some cases , maintaining a balanced lifestyle can reduce the risk of getting the disorder as well (Rahman , 2009) .
If the results are not told , families that have a higher risk may not alter their lifestyle to prevent the genetic disorder that might be prevented .
In addition , if only one parent has a genetic disorder , the offspring will have a fifty percent chance of getting (Mehlman , 1999) .
This means that there's a fair chance to prevent the potential disorder .
By not telling this important information about the family having a risk of getting the same disorder , it's like denying the right to life .
According to the United Nations' "Right to life" , Article 10 , "States Parties reaffirm that every human being has the inherent right to life and shall take all necessary measures to ensure its effective enjoyment ."
(United Nations , 1948) .
Denying that piece of information about the well being of the family may become a violation to the right to life .
Opponents may argue that individuals should not be obliged to tell their family as this will save them a lot of pressure and stress .
Indeed , knowing that one has a higher risk of a genetic disorder is stressful and painful , however , through appropriate counseling and leading a healthy lifestyle , the chance of not getting the disorder is relatively high (Haidle , 2005) .
Therefore , for the physical well being of the whole family , it is best to let the family know the condition .
Lastly , by telling the results , families can reduce the chances of the next generation from getting the genetic disorder .
Methods like assisted reproductive technology (ART) can be used to ensure only unaffected embryos were allowed to develop to term (Norrgard , 2008) .
In this way , the chances of the next generation of getting the same genetic disorder will be significantly reduced .
Without revealing the results , the family may not be aware of the potential genetic condition .
Despite this benefit , opponents may argue that some disorder might not affect the rest of the family , so it is not necessary to inform the relatives (Mehlman , 1999) .
However , if carriers of genetic disorder , such as HIV , do not tell their family , their family , especially their spouse may have a potential risk of infection unknowingly .
Thus , carriers should at least tell their spouse their condition , so that the family as well as the next generation can be protected .
To conclude , revealing of the positive results is essential to help not only the carriers , but also their family psychologically and physically .
In addition , they can prevent the next generation from getting the same disorder as well .
Though the decision is made ultimately by the individuals , I think that it is necessary for them to inform their family .

Share The Results Of Your Genetic Tests With Your Kids - You'll Feel Better .
Scientific Blogging [Internet] [cited 2009 Oct 28] Available from: http://www .scientificblogging .com/news_articles/share_results_your_genetic_t ests_your_kids_youll_feel_better
In recent years of the 21st century , a vast majority of people has arrived at a similar cognitional conjunction of the general idea of genetic testing , which is extensively portrayed as an effective technique to identify crime suspects or catastrophe victims in various popular "crime scene investigation" television programmes .
However , the varieties and significance of genetic testing are well understated .
Genetic testing has become an increasingly adopted form of medical checkup through means of diagnosing an individual's vulnerabilities to inherited diseases upon detection of genes and chromosomes mutation (Guttmacher , 2009) .
If confirmed as the carrier of a particular genetic mutation or having increased risk of developing an inherited disease , those unfortunate subjects are not only instantaneously overwhelmed by negative emotions but also subjected to distress and burdensome in considering the consequences of their health conditions on their family members .
Various ethical and social complications arise from the differential opts of those inflicted subjects , to tell or not tell their families or relatives about the positive results of the genetic diagnosis .
Considering the genetically affected individual's need of additional care and companion as well as the early detection of similar inherited disorder amongst their blood relatives , an individual of known genetic risk ought to disclose the results of genetic testing to their close relatives .
As accepting the occurrence or increased risk of developing genetic disorders is rather emotionally burdensome , affected patients should reveal the truth to their family members who are able to provide additional care and companion .
Emotional outcomes after predictive genetic testing such as increased measures of anxiety , anger , depression , guilt and redemptive adjustments are psychologically destructive (Davies , Donnai , MacLeod , McAllister , Nicholls & Payne , 2007) .
Moreover , scientific researches provide substantial evidences showing that the frequency of catastrophic outcomes such as suicide , attempted suicide and psychiatric hospitalization are significantly higher amongst those receiving Huntington's disease predictive-testing results (Almqvist , Bloch , Brinkman , Craufurd & Hayden , 1999) .
The devastative psychological effects on risk-prone individuals can be reduced if family members show moral support and intensive care .
In fact , the risk and severity of certain adult onset genetic disorders can be alleviated by preventative measures and treatments .
With the company and cooperation of family members , constructive lifestyle modification such as adopting healthy diet , exercising as well as reducing alcohol and cigarette consumption can be easily implemented .
Thus , revealing one's genetic condition to family members are proven to be an anecdote to sufferings from psychological pressures more beneficiary as compared to concealing the truth .
In addition , to inform family and relatives of one self's unfavourable genetic conditions is an act of responsibility and care by which similar genetic testing can be executed for early detection and treatments .
As the terminology implies , genetically inherited diseases are caused by gene or chromosomes abnormality received from antecedents and passed on to following generations .
The possibilities of other family members and blood relatives carrying similar gene mutation are relatively higher when a family history of the particular genetic disorder is detected .
The likelihood of the family members and relatives to definitively develop similar genetic disease is hard to estimate due to the influences of different inheritance conditions such as autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive (Joaquina , 2009) .
Moreover , a healthy person not showing any corresponding symptoms of the genetic disease might be the carrier of gene mutation , which might bring about equivalent harmfulness to successive offspring .
Hence , alerting these potential disease carriers is essential such that similar genetic testing can be done , either to rule out any possibilities of carrying that particular DNA mutation or to detect the chances of developing the genetic disorder and apply treatments or preventative measures as early as possible .
All in all , carriers have to consider beyond personal concerns and fulfil obligations to inform family members and relatives about their genetic disorders for early detection , prevention and cure .
In conclusion , all genetic test participants carrying genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the test results to their family and relatives .
After knowing the health conditions of the affected individuals , their family members are able to show extra concern and cooperation in adopting healthier lifestyles , thus relieving their emotional distress and reducing the risk of them committing catastrophic behaviours .
Besides that , family members and close relatives of the affected individual will benefit greatly by participating in similar genetic testing and detecting the genetic disorder as soon as possible for early treatment .
Hence , it is undeniably crucial for carriers of genetic diseases to treat the disclosure of genetic test results to their family members and relatives as an obligation to fulfil .

Knowledge is power , but how true the saying is when applied to the context of genetic testing is debatable .
Genetic testing is the process of direct examination of a person's DNA molecule .
Even though it does not guarantee a 100 percent accuracy (Breast Cancer Organization) , it is still used in fields like forensic investigations whereby a person's identity could be determined through the test .
It is also utilized in medical diagnosis to reveal any genetic disorders (Human Genome Project) by basing one's genes against a healthy standard of gene pool to spot for any forms of mutations .
However , the choice of revealing the result to only the patient or to third parties is an issue that is arguable .
Ultimately though , I believe that the patient should have the final say as to whether the results should be made known .
First and foremost , genetic testing is by no means cheap .
Its cost range from hundreds to thousands of dollars in accordance to the number and size of genes tested (Human Genome Project) .
As such , the person has to fork out huge amounts of money to procure this knowledge and it would thus only be ethical that he or she be allowed to make the choice of broadcasting the results .
As much as some may argue that money does not buy everything , such tests results are akin to a paid product and it would not make sense if it were to be shared with others without the buyer's consent .
More importantly , failing to keep the results of genetic testing strictly private may give rise to physical and mental detriments (Norrgard , 2008) .
In the former case , a person's quality of life may take a hit as a result of making the outcome of the test known to others .
In view of potential discrimination against the person's disease by others , he or she may have to contemplate revamping his or her lifestyle totally .
For example , a professional soccer player predicted to have spinal muscular atrophy , a disease that causes one to lose muscle tissues over time , may be discriminated against by his team as he will most probably be seen as a liability rather than an asset .
He may no longer be considered a worthwhile investment and be passed over during team selections and such .
In the worst case , he may have to give up soccer altogether so as to allow for effective treatment of his disease .
On the latter , adverse mental effects may take its toll on a person too .
It is often said that the mind is greater than the body , hence it would not be a surprise if these detriments are more devastating towards a person's mental health .
Consider the case of the soccer player as mentioned earlier in which he is discriminated against .
He may be forced to retire from the sport entirely which may lead to him losing his livelihood .
Many professional soccer players train from a tender age to adulthood and hence , by denying the disease-afflicted person his avenue of income and his passion in life would only serve to strain his mental health .
Sometimes though , keeping mum may not be an ideal choice for there may be a genuine need to disclose the results of genetic testing to people other than the individual .
For instance , the test results of a rape case ought to be made known so that a criminal can be justifiably prosecuted .
The particular rape case of Biurny Peguero by William McCaffrey exemplifies this need well (Baron , 2009) .
In it , McCaffrey was convicted of rape even though there was no concrete evidence from the genetic testing of the swap samples that suggest so .
Fortunately , his lawyer was successful in his application for the district attorney office to release the results of the test after 2 years and a new test showed that the genetic sample lacked a Y chromosome and hence proved that the rape case was a fluke fabricated by Peguero , which she later confessed .
Although this incident underlines the importance of revealing such test results , it is under these rare circumstances that revealing the results becomes a feasible idea .
So where does one draw the line between a good and a bad idea with regards to disclosing such intimate information ?
Tentatively , there is no clear cut verdict but general scenarios suggest that the decision to reveal the genetic test result should lie solely with the individual due to the private nature of such testing and the devastating consequences that will ensue should the genetic test results be exposed without the person's consent .

In recent years , there has been an increasing trend of individuals coming forward to request for genetic testing .
Genetic testing is a form of medical examination that determines whether an individual is at risk or diagnosed to have any inherited genetic disorders or has the potential to pass it on to the next generation (MedlinePlus , 2009) .
Genetic testing includes gene tests , chromosomal tests and biochemical tests that identify result abnormalities or alterations .
If the individual does not have the final say in revealing the test results of a positive genetic disorder , there will be a breach of patient confidentiality when the individual has earlier on requested not to reveal the results and may cause even further distraught and strain within the family , even if the individual will reveal to the loved ones at a later timing .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing , since the individual will be the one answerable and holding sole responsibility in the repercussion of informing or withholding the results outcome .
Firstly , an individual will face genetic discrimination if the individual does not have the final say in revealing a positive result of genetic disorder test .
Genetic discrimination occurs when an external party gains access to an individual's health records or when one is honest in declaring one's health condition .
For instance , an insurance company will refuse to provide any insurance coverage for an individual who may have had been tested positive of a genetic disorder or has a high probability of acquiring a genetic disorder , since the insurance company finds it a loss to make a payout to an 'already or potentially-sick' individual .
Furthermore , employers will be judgmental in hiring or firing a 'sick' employee .
In America , a new federal law referred to as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008 , to prevent discrimination from insurance companies and employers (National Human Genome Research Institute , 2009) .
Genetic discrimination will not take place if the individual had the final say in revealing the result of such testing , as the individual had withheld the information and life would go on as per normal until the disease presents its signs and symptoms .
When the individual is discovered for having a genetic disorder and not declaring the status beforehand , the individual will bear all the consequences , which includes genetic discrimination since the individual had the choice to weigh on the pros and cons of the matter before the individual made a decision on keeping the condition to himself .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing .
Secondly , if the individual requesting genetic testing does not have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing , the individual will have problems with his loved ones , such as stress within the family and strained family relationships (FamilyDoctor .org , 2005) .
For example , if the family of the individual finds out through the family physician instead of the individual's self , the family will be upset since the individual chose to hide the information .
Even if the individual chooses to tell the family at a later timing for the benefit of not wanting to worry his loved ones , the family will on the other hand feel that it was irresponsible of the individual not to share his/her burden with the family , since the family had to find out the truth from another party .
This could be prevented if the individual concerned broke the news to his family members so that they can discuss as a family .
As such , it is up to the individual's discretion in revealing the genetic test results .
Arguments put forth in individuals should not be the one having the final say in revealing the genetic test result are weak .
Some have said the individuals who request for the genetic testing are deceiving others if they do not reveal the positive genetic test result .
However , even if the genetic test result was positive , it does not infer that the individual has defective genes but it is just that the individual is at a higher risk of acquiring the disease (Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
Furthermore , there will be an infringement of privacy and confidentiality if the individual requests not to reveal the result but yet divulged , since it is one's own choice that ought to be respected .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing not only to avoid genetic discrimination in society but also to promote family relations .
Firstly , as mentioned above , it is not against the law to withhold genetic results from third parties .
In a democratic world , it is the individual's rights to choose if he wants to reveal the testing results .
Domestically , our very own constitution has stated very clearly that "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law ."
(Singapore Constitution 1999) .
Even the most powerful democratic nation in the world , the United States of America has also stated very clearly in her constitution that "all men are created equal" and "with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life , liberty and happiness .
"(American Constitution) Most notably , the word 'liberty' appeared in both Constitutions .
One of the definitions for liberty is the "freedom from obligation ," which clearly meant that it is perfectly legal for the individual to withhold his genetic tests' results from third parties , and thus is under no obligation to disclose his results .
Secondly , it is within the personal rights of the individual to withhold the information .
All people under the state laws are entitled to freedom the freedom of speech , and most importantly the freedom to decide and choose for himself .
It is an "inalienable right" of all citizens of democratic countries .
Therefore , it is within the individual's empowerment to decide if he wants to reveal the results of his genetic test to his relatives , which clearly implies that he is under no obligation to reveal his genetic test results to his relatives .
However , even if it is within the individual's legal and personal rights not to reveal the tests' results , it is still a moral responsibility to do so .
The individual has the responsibility to inform the closest around him of this genetic problem .
As genetic problems , such as Parkinson's disease is hereditary , it will be good to prepare the carrier's family psychologically .
This can allow or prompt the rest of the family to go for similar test to determine if they have developed the same genetic disorders .
Early detection allows the carrier to undergo treatment earlier when the genetic problem is still at its infant stage , and thus the problem will be easier to control as compared to its latter stage .
Furthermore , direct relatives of the individual can also plan for their own future , with the knowledge that whatever future plans that they might have , they have to put into account of the genetic disorder .
For example , if a couple wants to have a baby , and either the father or the mother is a carrier of certain genetic problems , they would consider the probabilities of the unborn child being born with the same deficiency .
Thus it is absolutely vital morally for the affected individual to inform his relatives of his genetic disorder , so as to prepare his relatives psychologically , medically and financially .
Thus the carrier is not only being responsible to himself , but also to his relatives and even future generations .
However , critics might want to argue that his relatives will alienate him , and thus making the individual feel isolated and uncared for .
I believe that despite risking alienation , the moral responsibility in telling his relatives of the problem is more important than the former as it will give his relatives adequate warning about the potential risk that might affect them too .
In conclusion , I believe that the individual is not obligated to inform his or her relatives about his genetic problems , either legally or be it personal rights .
However , he still must have the moral responsibility to inform his relatives about his genetic disorders so as to prepare the latter psychologically , medically and financially .
Firstly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives is because of their right to know .
They should know that they are vulnerable to the risk of family disease which can be inherited .
This allow them to have mental preparation about what will possibly happen and to react to the risk .
In addition , knowing of their genetic risk will help them in making some important decisions and plans such as whether to have children or not .
The right of relatives or families to know the genetic test results can be seen in a WHO report on medical genetic issues (http://www .who .int) , which address family members have a moral obligation to share genetic information with each another , and thus they can choose whether to be tested themselves .
Secondly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives is due to there is possibility to save their lives .
If the relatives are known of their possible risk in genetic disease , they can perform genetic test for themselves .
In case the test results are positive , they will be able to receive medical treatment to reduce risk .
In some circumstances , it is able to cure a genetic disease in early stage .
This allows the relatives of a genetic disease patient , or even the patient itself , to recover fully from the disease .
For instance , according to US national institute of health (http://www .accessexcellence .org) , when tumors of colon cancer are caught early , the chances for survival are the greatest and this prevent thousands of cancer death a year .
In conclusion , a carrier of known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives due to their right to know about the risk and possibility to save their lives .
With effective implementation of laws to protect genetic disease patients , they should always be encouraged and prompted to reveal the genetic test results to his or her relatives so that they could benefit from the testing equally .
Genetic testing enables the discovery of possible genetic disorders present in the individual .
The information on the genetic disorder is important to the relatives as they may be implicated .
Although this information might cause family members to suffer emotionally and psychologically , it also allows them to be more aware of possible problems that may arise in the future .
I strongly feel that the individual carrying genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives as it is a matter of personal responsibility to inform relatives of the implications and thus allow them to be aware of the possible solutions or related important information .
In conclusion , the individuals carrying genetic risk should be obligated to inform their family members as they should be responsible and fair to their family members and not depriving the members from taking early measures against the disease .
Furthermore , they should not be concerned about the negative effects about revealing the results as there are professionals in the fields who are available to aid in the problem .
However , individuals' decisions can be influenced by the fear of developing an inherited genetic disorder and the negative genetic results as a result of avoiding close relationships with their family members (Procter 2002) .
Therefore , individuals should have ethical obligation to reveal the truth of result to their relatives so that they can be treated effectively or prevented if detected with disease such as cancer .
Secondly , the limitation of genetic tests such as the social issue has been taken into account of whether to reveal the genetic results to their relatives .
Norrgard (2008) argues that the concern of the family members is the social problem of the identification of an inherited disease gene in a family .
Furthermore , Norrgard (2008) also points out that the revealing of genetic information will cause the family members to be discriminated by the insurance company and employers and families who have the risk of developing an inherited disease or disorder .
However , the Federal law has implemented the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to prevent individuals from being discriminated by the insurance company and employment (Norrgard 2008) .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives since they are being protected by law and deterred the risk of developing disease with preventive measures .
In conclusion , it is the responsibility and decision-making of individuals to inform their family members upon deciding the benefits and limitations of the genetic result .
Advancement in science , especially in the field of genetic and biomedical research , has made genetic testing possible for people to test for diseases which relate to hereditary links .
Genetic testing , a testing that looks at a person's genetic makes up , is able to confirm diagnosis of individuals who are at risk of certain genetic disorders like the Huntington's disease , {cystic fibrosis , Tay-Sachs disease , breast cancer and so}[HYPERLINK: http://www .nature .com/scitable/topicpage/Diagnosing-Down-Syndrome-Cystic-Fibrosis-Tay-Sachs-646] forth .
Despite the fact that genetic testing helps to improve one's life , it is always surrounded by moral and ethical issues that includes family-related ethical dilemma when a potential carrier of a genetic disorder is tested to be a positive result .
However , since family history always serves as a guide for genetic testing as passing the mutated genes within the family is of high possibility , results of genetic testing would have implications in the individual who tested it , and as well as the family members .
Hence , carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives once the genetic test has been conducted and the results are known .
An important reason why a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the testing result to relevant third party is that it would help early detection of genetic diseases within the family members .
This would then lead to necessary treatment to save lives .
In the case of breast cancer , recent studies show that women who suffer from breast cancer would have an increased likelihood of a sister to get the same disease (EverythingAboutBreastCancer , 2009) .
American Cancer Society (2005) also reveals that 5%-10% of the breast cancer patients inherit the mutated genes of BRCA1 and BRCA2 from their first degree relatives .
Since there is no symptom of such disease in the early and most treatable stage , revealing of testing result by the carrier would alert the relevant third party to undergo similar testing and receive necessary treatments if it is a positive result .
Some may argue that third party should have done regular check up to monitor personal health condition instead of starting to do so when there is a carrier in the family .
However , self-examine has low accuracy in detection of breast cancer while other method like mammography is only meant for women who age 40 years old and above (georgiahealthinfo .gov , n .d .) .
This might be relatively inefficient in term of early detection of the disease as female at young age would also be exposed to the risk of getting breast cancer .

Another relevant point is that obligation to reveal the testing result to the relatives does play a part in helping them to make important life decisions .
Genetic result is also desired by the relatives and potential mate if the carrier is carrying mutated gene that can cause death .
For instance , Huntington's disease is a fatal autosomal dominant disease , which is caused by the death of neurons in certain regions of the brain .
Carriers of such disease should reveal the testing results to the relatives so that the latter can do proper family planning to avoid passing the defective genes to the next generation .
"Families saw the disease destroy their loved ones' ability to feel , think , and move" (MedicineNet .com , n .d . , p .3) indicates the consequence of this incurable genetic disorder that is passed on within the family , if the carrier is not obligated to reveal the testing results .
Admittedly , confidentiality of the genetic testing results is a personal matter .
However , Burton (2009) may be accurate in saying that patient's confidentiality should come second to the prevention of disease in others .
It is also worth noting that revealing a genetic testing result to the relevant third party would eventually help the carrier to seek more advices to choose the best medical decisions .
Georgetown University Hospital (n .d) provides an example of a successful patient , Evan , who fought against cancer via chemotherapy , with the moral support and empathy from his family members .
In fact , carriers of certain genetic diseases do not necessarily exhibit the characteristics controlled by defective genes .
For example , if the genetic disease is related to X-linked genes , only males are affected while females remain as carriers of the disease , unless it concerns the autosomal recessive genes (wrongdiagnosis .com , n .d .) .
Being a carrier of a genetic disease is quite common as Guggino and Stanton (2006) note that one in 20 Caucasians carries the gene for cystic fibrosis .
Hence , there might be carriers of the same genetic disorder within the same family who can share experiences to help the carrier to understand his or her condition better if the carrier is obligated to reveal the testing result .
In conclusion , carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the results to the relevant third party as it benefits both the carrier and his or her family members .
Obligation to reveal the results would help the family members in early detection of the genetic disorder which is followed by treatment , make important life decisions and facilitate the carriers to choose the best medical decisions .

With the advent of advancements in medicine and technology over the recent years , the power of medicine in influencing human procreation has strengthened especially in the area of genetic testing .
Genetic testing is a technique to examine genes or markers near the genes , chromosomes and proteins to test the signs of a disease or disorder in DNA .
Test samples are usually taken from a person's blood , body fluids or tissues .
Genetic testing provides us with information that if someone has a symptom; shows whether a person is a carrier for a genetic disease; help expectant parents know whether an unborn child will have a genetic disease etc (Access Excellence @ National Health Museum) .
The definition of a genetic carrier is a person that has inherited a genetic trait or mutation but does not show the symptoms of the disease (Wikipedia) .
There are many types of genetic diseases such as the Down Syndrome , Huntington's disease , cystic fibrosis , hemophilia A , and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer .
However , genetic testing has raises numerous ethical issues; one of them concerning consent and confidentiality of the tested individual identified to be a carrier of a known genetic risk .
Although it is the individual's right to choose not to disclose their genetic information to his or her relatives , in my opinion , he or she is obligated and responsible to disclose the said genetic information for several reasons .
Firstly , it is important for a carrier of a known genetic risk to disclose his or her genetic information to family members as the latter may be at risk of having the same genetic disorder .
Whether an individual with the genetic disease choose to disclose the genetic information to the family members depends on how they gauge the risks and benefits of revealing the truth , their sense of responsibility towards them and most importantly how it affects them (Agatha & Angst 2009) .
It is understood that individuals who carry the disease do not wish to reveal his or her genetic results due to privacy issues or fear that their family members are not ready to accept it .
However , by not sharing the information , they are posing a danger to their family members potentially at risk of carrying the disease .
For example , strenuous exercise can cause sudden death in people with genetic diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Agatha &Angst 2009) .
It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait therefore it is high possibility that if an individual tested positive , his or her siblings would has one in two chance of carrying the same genetic mutation .
Thus , it is obligate to notify relatives so that early recognition and treatment of the disease , if present , can be done .

To share one's genetic results to relatives also in a way protect their own safety at work or any other situations .
This is so as in some workplaces , such as factories or laboratories that deal with chemical substances , will increase the susceptibility to the toxic or carcinogenic effects of environmental agents of a person having genetic disorders (Andre & Velasquez , 2008 ) .
For example , individuals who carry the sickle cell trait may increase the risk of sickle cell anaemia if exposed to carbon monoxide or cyanide .
Also , for those people who are carriers of thalassemia when exposed to lead or benzene , it is hazardous to their health and causes adverse effects .
By revealing their genetic testing results to their relatives , their family members will be able to help them take note of what he or she should avoid and assess the occupational risks at their workplace .
Thus , an individual with known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives to protect themselves from potential dangerous environments and ensure their personal safety .
However , some argue that individual right to consent , privacy and confidentiality are important and it is the individual's decision whether to disclose personal genetic results to relatives or otherwise .
There is also a legal requirement , the privacy rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 that the health care providers have to respect and protect patients' privacy of health information (Agatha & Angst 2009) .
However , this legal requirement is decided on a case-to- case basis as there are situations that a clinician may consider necessary intervention; that is , notifying their family members for some life- threatening cases .
For example , individuals with mutations that predispose them to malignant hyperthermia may die if they were under the use of certain surgical anaesthesia (Agatha & Angst 2009) .
Hence , it is important to notify relatives to let them know the risk and they could seek early treatment to prevent the risk and danger .
In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives to protect his or her family's health as well as protecting his or hers' own safety .

Nowadays , as scientific advances are no longer a norm , our understanding of genes and how they affect our health and cause diseases has deepened .
A diagnostic test capable of identifying diseases causing genes known as genetic testing was developed along with our knowledge on gene .
Just like property rights , the result of genetic testing should belong to the owner .
Individuals who undergo the test should therefore have the rights to decide whether the result should be disclosed to a third party since public access to the result can yield undesirable consequences .
The disclosure of genetic test result , particularly a result that shows a person has a risk of getting a certain diseases or disorder will lead to social discrimination during employment and during purchase of insurance .
Therefore , an individual should not be obliged to notify a third party , even his relatives , about his test result .
Furthermore , according to the Universal declaration of Human Rights , an individual holds the rights to decide what he wants to do with the result .
In addition , there are three vulnerable groups of people in our society that requires protection if they were to undergo genetic testing .
They are the children , adolescents and mentally impaired .
Firstly , the discovery of a policy holder's test result , which showed that he might have a risk for certain disease , may prompt the insurance company to increase the price of the premium the policy holder has to pay in order to be fair to other policies holder .
Although in this way , it seemed fair to the rest of the society , the individual having the risk is being discriminated against .
Furthermore , by allowing access to the test result , it can cause problems in the workplace .
Employers have the tendency to employ the people with little or possibly no health problems .
A genetic result could place a potential employee at a disadvantage by suggesting risk of getting a disease or disorder .
In 2005 , Eddy Curry from the Chicago Bulls refused a genetic test to find out whether he was susceptible to heart ailment .
By doing so , he was traded by the team to the New York Knicks .
(Harmon , 2008) Secondly , the society has to accept the fact that all humans have basic human rights .
According to the Universal Declaration of Human rights , "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , or to attacks upon his honour and reputation ."
If the carrier of a genetic risk should decide not to tell his relatives or a third party about the outcome , he should not be compelled further to as this violets his rights a living .
Moreover , Professor Lim Pin recommends that the results from the test should only be used to advantage an individual or his family in prevention and management of disease .
He agreed that informed consent from the owner of the test result should be sought before disclosure is allowed .
Thirdly , there are three special categories of people in our society that need considerations .
The children , adolescents and mentally impaired that undergo genetic testing will not know how to handle their results .
As they are young and handicap , they might be immature to know the consequences after they reveal their results of genetic testing .
Then , in this case , should they be obliged to tell their relatives or the public ?
The possible unduly stress and social stigmatism that they could face might prove difficult for them to handle at such tender age .
In the United States , even though there is Americans with Disabilities Act protecting them from social discrimination , no one can guarantee that all employers followed the law .
Even if an employee with known risk for disease is allowed to continue working , he will come under stress and possible discrimination by his colleagues .
Initially , he only has the risk of getting a health problem but now with psychological stress , he could get depression instead .
Either way , letting the employer know the test result is not benefitting the individual .
Critics might argue that since genetic test result only show the risk of getting a particular disease or disorder , it does not necessary imply the individual has them and therefore , they should share the test result with their relatives to allow them to seek early prevention .
However , they failed to consider his relatives' reactions towards him just like how people react to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients .
In conclusion , individual should not feel obligated to disclose their genetic test result .
In fact , they should have all the rights to decide what to do with it because the repercussions that arose from the act of revealing are very serious .
Thus , individual should decide what is best for him .

Medical related technology has improved to a stage in which genetic disorders can be predicted via genetic testing .
It is a technique to examine the DNA molecule (building blocks of genes) for several purposes such as predicting or diagnosing inheritable genetic disorders , prenatal or newborn screening and to aid in forensic science .
For an inheritable genetic disease , the carrier refers to the person who has the gene related to the disease , but the disease may not necessarily be expressed in his or her but it may be manifested in their offsprings .
Although genetic testing is made possible , the after effect of knowing and dealing with the disease is another issue .
Thus , a dilemma arises in whether the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier should be obligated to do so as this will aid in family planning , garnering support from family and also to prompt other relatives to test whether they are at risk too .
Firstly , family planning is imperative to a carrier as he or she may pass down the undesirable gene to the children .
This means that the child have to bear with the possibility of the onset of the disease and subsequent repercussion if the genetic disease is confirmed .
Therefore , a carrier should inform the spouse of the genetic disorder so that they can discuss and plan whether or not to take the risk of having a child .
Some may argue that it is not necessary for the carrier to inform the spouse as even if the child is tested positive for the genetic disease while still in the womb , measures such as abortion can be taken .
However , from the ethical point of view , it is inhuman to terminate a life , and this event can be prevented if there is proper family planning .
Thus , a carrier should be obligated to tell his or her spouse so as to prevent subsequent tension and ordeal in the family .
Secondly , a well-informed relative of the carrier's genetic disease is crucial as they can provide support towards the carrier .
If carriers of the genetic disease who are not mentally strong decided to keep mum about their genetic disease , they may lead an anxious and depressed life (Gilbar , 2007) .The situation is aggravated if they have children as they may feel guilty of the possibility of passing down the disease .
Hence , by letting the relatives know about the genetic risk , they can offer moral support such as giving words of encouragement , paying more attention to the carriers and assuring them that it is not their fault that they have the undesirable gene .
Hence , the support garnered from family members may boost the carriers' self-esteem and motivational level , knowing that they don't have to walk this journey alone .
Thus , it is crucial for the carrier to inform his or her relatives about their genetic risk so as to get the required support to help them through .
Thirdly , family members who are aware of the genetic risk of the carrier may consider going for the genetic test themselves so as to avoid or delay the onset of disease if it is possible .
For instance , diabetes can be due to genetic causes and one way to prevent or delay the onset of this genetic risk is to lead a healthy lifestyle which excludes excessive intake of sugar .
Hence , the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives so that they may also be aware of their genetic risk of the disease .
Critics may argue that the cost of conducting genetic testing is not justifiable and may not be accurate .
However , accuracy of the test can be improved through the passage of time as technology nowadays is more sophisticated .
Moreover , should the high cost of the testing compromise one's health or life ?
In conclusion , even though a carrier of a known genetic risk has the right to disclose his or her condition , the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages .
Proper family planning , encouragement from relatives and the awareness of the genetic risk in their family are crucial and therefore the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies changes in chromosomes and genes and the results can determine a person's chance of developing or passing on inherited disorders like Huntington's disease and cancer .
However , the results of the test can stir up much controversy in whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his family .
Although there is an ethical obligation to disclose the results to one's family so that constructive life changes can be made , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
Furthermore , the disclosure can cause negative social consequences such as potential discrimination .
In my opinion , since the decision of an individual to undergo genetic testing is voluntary , they have already had the "final say" to decide whether they want their potential disorders to be revealed hence , the individual should not have the final say only after the test as long as they have signed the agreement under well informed circumstances and that the disclosure is only made to relevant third parties .
One argument to obligate is that family members have their rights to information about themselves and their loved ones .
With the information one gains from testing , one can make constructive life changes .
Many genetic disorders worsen over time and have long-term health consequences thus the disclosure of the results for an inherited disease is beneficial for early treatment and prevention of the disorder to save lives .
In the case of incurable diseases , knowing one's condition could influence many family planning decisions and other life choices .
One can decide whether to have children of his own and risk passing the gene on to his children or consider using technology to assist selective reproduction .
Also , decisions like the retirement age and the amount of savings for the future can be made when they are better informed .
When family members are aware of the truth , at risk family members can be notified early and others can provide support for the carrier to overcome the difficulties he will be facing in the fight against his disorder .
The disclosure is thus not only beneficial to the third parties but also the carrier himself .
However , individuals may choose not to reveal the results due to fear of the negative social consequences associated with the disorder .
The results of genetic testing may open doors for potential discrimination in terms of job opportunities and insurances .
An employer might not want to keep an employee who is likely to be diagnosed with some disorder .
Similarly , a person who is known to have a high risk for a genetic condition may have difficulty obtaining insurance because he or she is likely to run up medical bills that would be costly to the insurance company .
The obligation to make known the results of genetic testing will thus be a disincentive for people to even undergo genetic testing to help themselves .
As we cannot control our genes , it is unfair to discriminate against a person's genetic predispositions .
A federal measure , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) , was signed into law in the United States , to provide protections against genetic discrimination (Norrgard 2008) .
Insurance companies were prevented from charging higher rates to customers based on genetic information and from collecting genetic data or requiring applicants to undergo genetic testing .
With the legislation being law , the carriers should feel safer to share the test results .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should be obligated to make known the results to relevant third parties for the benefits of both the carrier and the people around him .
Hopefully , with the recent passage of GINA in the U .S . , discrimination of inheritable carriers can be removed and people will feel comfortable working with genetic counselors who can provide information about the pros and cons of the genetic test and discuss the social and emotional aspects of testing to undergo genetic tests and disclose the results that contribute to better management of health care and life choices .
Motion: "Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?"
YES .
With medical technology advances today , genetic testing have been commonly used to detect any disorders or diseases that is present in our genes .
It is a method where the person's DNA is taken and isolated to test for the presence of any defects or a specific genes that could cause any future onset of disorders or diseases (Genetic testing , n .d .) .
Since the test involves genes and in general , every human has it , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , genetic testing helps to prevent further spread of diseases in the family lineage .
In family lineage , family members and relatives are related .
If the carrier is known to have a genetic risk , there may be a chance where other family members or relatives get that disorder or disease which may be found in their genes .
When they go for the testing , they are able to know if they are positive or negative for the presence of the specific defective gene .
This will then help other family members or relatives to plan ahead of their future generation .
For example , they are able to plan whether to start a family , the location and type of house to buy (in an area with family , an abundance of nursing homes , close to a specialized medical center , easily modifiable for a person with disabilities) , health , life and disability insurance , financial arrangements (wills and trusts , paying off debts) and et cetera (Drellishak R . , May 25 , 2003) .
Hence , the carrier should tell his or her relatives in order for them to make future plans and have a good family life .
Secondly , genetic testing allows oneself to be prepared upon knowing that a relative of theirs has a genetic risk .
This will allows them to take precautious and preventive measures about their health condition .
Some diseases that can be detected by genetic testing like Marfan syndrome - a connective tissue disorder causing long limbs and heart defects (Haldeman- Englert , C . , May 15 , 2008) can be controlled and treated .
When the other family members or relatives have an early detection of such diseases like Marfan syndrome , they are able to take preventive measures early like consulting a doctor , take medications that could slow down the heart rate in order to prevent stress on the aorta and avoid having sports in prevention of injuring the heart (Haldeman-Englert , C . , May 15 , 2008) .
Lastly , genetic testing promotes in developing a support group system .
This is where a positive carrier of a specific genetic risk knows that they are not alone and they could give provide referrals for respite care , medical and hospice services , tips for care-giving and et cetera (Drellishak R . , May 25 , 2003) .
So , when other family members or relatives is tested positive for the disorder or disease , at least they know that they are not alone and they could rely on the support group for any advices or any moral or emotional support from them .
In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives so that to prevent further spread of the genetic disorder , to take early preventive measures and to give moral support to those who have the same genetic risk .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
The results of a genetic test can determine an individual's possibility of developing a genetic disorder or confirm a suspected genetic disease .
This has brought about many controversial issues on ethical , social and legal concerns surrounding the use of genetic testing .
While some argue that under certain circumstances , the non-disclosure of relevant genetic information brings harms to the individual and a third party , it in fact helps to protect an individual's right to confidentiality , safeguard against discrimination and reduce psychological stress .
Hence , the individual undergoing genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results of such genetic testing .
There are three implications of genetic testing .
Firstly , genetic testing protects an individual's right to confidentiality .
An individual has the right of keeping his or her genetic test result confidential , and without granting consent of the individual , the test result should not be disclosed .
Admittedly , genetic testing raises legal issue , however , an individual who tested positive for a genetic disease has to decide whether to make known the results of genetic testing to relevant third parties such as family members or relatives who have the possibility of passing on the similar disease .
Regardless of the individual's right to confidentiality , the test results are disclosed under certain circumstances such as the non- disclosure of relevant genetic test results brings harms to the individual and also the third parties (Lee , 2005) .
Thus , the risks of non-disclosure override the risks of breaching confidentiality .
Secondly , genetic testing safeguards against discrimination .
In the United States , federal law Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) has passed on to protect the individuals at risk for genetic diseases from facing discrimination by insurance companies and employers based on the results obtained from genetic testing (Public Law , 2008) .
Under this act , it prohibits employers from making unfavourable employment decisions and prohibits insurance companies from reducing insurance coverage .
Although some argue that genetic testing raises social issue , these individuals may face discrimination from employers , insurance providers and society .
It is more difficult for these individuals in applying for job employments and life and health insurance coverage .
As a result , they feel socially stigmatised .
Thirdly , genetic testing reduces the amount of psychological stress .
Although some argue that genetic testing raises ethical issue , the individual faced a lot of psychological stress such as anxiety , fear and guilt when undergoing the process of genetic testing .
The individual is in ethical dilemma of whether sharing the genetic test results within the families .
However , family members who are unaffected by the genetic disease may feel guilty and this condition is known as survivor guilt .
To reduce the amount of psychological stress , physicians should arrange post-test genetic counselling for patients .
In conclusion , the decision in disclosing the results of genetic testing should solely be made by the individual at risk for genetic disorder .
The non-disclosure of genetic information protects an individual's right to confidentiality , safeguards against discrimination and reduces the amount of psychological stress .
Increasing medical cases of genetic disorders are in pace with the development of technology nowadays .
Daily exposure to strong UV radiations by sunlight and chemical substances or carcinogens will definitely have great impacts on human health .
Genetic disorder is considered as one of the severe medicinal consequences due to either those environmental factors or genetic factors by preceding generations .
According to National Cancer Institute (n .d .) in the United States , genetic testing is a DNA analysis done to disclose the increased risk of development of a certain disease or disorder caused by genetic mutation .
Although genetic testing has remarkably improved our life , it still gives rise to many controversial issues , especially in ethical concerns .
If ones have unfortunately been verified positive results in their genetic test , this would more or less place them in ethical dilemma , whether they should reveal the results to their family members .
Anyhow , as a member in the family , it is obligated to tell the genetic test results to own relatives .
First of all , sharing information and test result with family can reduce potential disease and even cancer risk among the relatives .
Most hereditary diseases are inherited in autosomal dominant genes which imply that close kin like parents , siblings and children will have 50 percent chances suffering from those diseases ("Sharing Genetic Test Results" , 2009) .
For instance , women from family with hereditary breast cancer should undergo genetic test or counselling to estimate the expectancy of getting it .
This would rather reduce the chance of getting the cancer if preventative measures have been taken earlier .
Moreover , early detection can lead to a lower risk of disease .
Some carriers of genetic diseases object to tell their genetic test results as they think that such disclosure would not help in curing those disorders .
Nonetheless , carriers of genetic diseases are perfectly healthy and their children may only inherit the diseases ("Genetic Disorders" , 2009) .
Thus , revealing genetic test results to relatives is critical to draw their attention on the hereditary diseases .
Subsequently , they might choose to go for genetic tests .
As a result , the chances of suffering from those inherited disorders can be lowered .
At the same time , different curable and controlled treatments can also be carried out for certain diseases , for examples , Adenosine deaminase deficiency and asthma .

All in all , individuals have the rights to conceal their genetic test results in order to protect own privacy .
Federal Privacy Commissioner , Crompton (2002 , para .
3) pointed out that "the right balance" between willingness of patients and concerns of their relatives has to be taken into consideration as disclosure of health information is rather thorny .
In addition to the importance of sharing genetic test results to reduce disease risk and practise family planning , support but not discrimination by family is the foremost form of assistance to those are tested positive for genetic diseases during their illness .
Hence , individuals who carry genetic diseases are obligated to disclose their test results among their relatives .

Genetic testing is whereby an individual's gene is tested for abnormalities , susceptibility for diseases or any genetic disorder that can lead to either physical or mental problems , including both .
It is beneficial as it points out the underlying genetic condition of an individual who is prone to a particular genetic disorder , giving the individual the opportunity to seek treatment before the genetic disease comes into effect (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
Since the affected individual shares similar gene within the family , he or she is obligated to let his or relatives know about the genetic condition .
Although it can affect the rest of the family and relatives , as having to know one's genetic condition can bring about genetic discrimination such as denied insurance coverage , loss of employment , it basically prepares them psychologically for the future and there are certain regulations implemented to help those who are genetically discriminated .
Firstly , it may help prevent the individual from encountering a situation where he is denied of insurance coverage when the health insurer finds out the affected individual could prone to a one or more genetic disease due to family history .
Such cases happen due to the health insurer is bent on making money , with no care on whether the person is in ill health(Townsend , 1997) .
There are policies such as in Britain , which insurance companies should adhere to , where any genetic screening is not a prerequisite in the application and obtaining insurance .
Even if it is to be declared , there will not be a change in premium charges as compared to those who declared who has a family history but has not gone for genetic tests .
Thereby , it can help ensure that the affected person is able to be under insurance coverage , providing some security especially financial security including for the family members .
Secondly , having one genetic condition assessed , it gives the affected individual the freedom of making an informed choice concerning the type of job or employment that he or she can undertake , with the inclusion of one's safety and health .
This helps the individual to avoid certain occupations that might increase the risk of having to be ill health or end up in a life threatening situation during one's course of work (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
An example would the Huntington's disease , a neurological disorder where loss of motor control is one of the symptoms , if a particular employee in a construction yard has such a disease , not only it poses high risk to himself but also to the other employees (Mclean , 2008) .
However , although having the knowledge of one's susceptibility to a particular disorder may cost the employee's his or her job employment , so as to reduce costs and improve efficiency for the employer , there are regulations to help such employees .
In the United Kingdom , there is the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 which helps to ensure fairness on the employee's part after a genetic screening .
Thirdly ,by letting the family members and relatives made known of an individual genetic risk a particular disorder such as Huntington's Disease , it made them aware that such a genetic disease runs within the family .
Although it can affect the family drastically , it is better to be prepared rather than be caught on by surprise .
This is because when one is aware of it especially the parents , they can seek treatment even before the genetic disorder comes into effect , thus leading to little or no drastic change in one's lifestyle .
An example would be neonatal screening for sickle cell disease , when an affected child is diagnosed with this disease at an early stage , it can reduce childhood mortality and morbidity (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
Although the knowledge that there is a chance that the relatives themselves or their future children can have the same genetic disorder can cost them higher insurance premiums or even deny them of insurance coverage , there are regulations which can help them from being discriminated .
In America , there is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) which helps provide protection for those who have undergone genetic testing and are at risk for certain genetic disorder (Norrgard , 2008) .
In short , when the relatives of the individual who is tested positive for a certain genetic disease , may have raised fears such as unable to obtain insurance or loss of job , it does not necessarily mean that it will happen as there are policies and regulations implemented to help those who are genetically discriminated .
However , most of all , it helps create more awareness which can play a major role such as making a more informed family planning or how much money to be put aside for a better retirement (Norrgard , 2008) .
In this twenty-first century , health care has improved more drastically than ever , with the help of advanced technology that made diagnosis and treatment of diseases feasible and convenient .
Nowadays , genetic testing is becoming more and more prevalent to those who can afford and the diagnostic result can determine any possible genetic illness that an individual might suffer or carry .
Genetic testing basically uses laboratorial techniques to examine the genes of an individual and identify any inheritable disease like Huntington's disease present .
Thus , individuals with such genetic disease but do not suffer from it are called carriers as they can pass it on to their future generations .
However , there are some ethical and social issues regarding to whether family of the carrier should inform his or her relatives .
Although these issues are inevitable , the carrier should ultimately obligated to reveal the genetic test results to the family members as the benefits of it would outweigh any other problems .
Firstly , disclosure of genetic test results to family members can reduce the risk of danger of the genetic disorder by treating it early and before any effects of the illness starts kick in .
Treatable genetic disease like hemophilia which causes excessive bleeding in damaged tissues and occurs usually in the beginning of adulthood .
This could be treated via injection of recombinant factor VIII concentrate into the veins within an hour when excessive bleeding starts .
(Gene Reviews) Hence , this is crucial to save a hemophiliac from over bleeding especially if he or she is unaware of such condition .
In other words , knowing the risks of the genetic disorder can allow preventive medical treatment to reduce the risks of danger to the affected individual .
Furthermore , a change in lifestyle can also reduce possible effects of genetic disease like homocytinuria which is the genetic disorder of collagen through a therapeutic diet .
(Connective Tissue Disorder Site) Thus , it has become a personal responsibility of the carrier to inform the family members of such risk in order for early medical intervention to save the lives of his or her loved ones .
However , opponents of this position may argue that genetic testing does not provide a definite prediction on the individual's health .
This is because this method only gives the probability of contracting the disorder and many might not even suffer any effect of the gene disorder .
(Human Genome Project Information) Therefore , disclosing genetic test result to family members would only cause unnecessary anxiety to them , which can greatly affect their quality of life .
On the other hand , proponents can argue that life should not be gambled with and especially when it involves with the loved ones .
Hence , it is not ethically wrong to inform relatives of the carrier about the possible risk and the decision to whether they should undergo similar genetic testing would then be up to them .
In conclusion , the disclosure of genetic disorder of the carrier to the relatives can be very beneficial to their welfare as they can take preventive medical intervention and also decide whether to bear a child who might suffer the similar effects .
Although genetic testing is not always definite in predicting illnesses , no one would ever know if the genetic disease might occur and early prevention can ultimately saves the individual's life .
Therefore , genetic counseling is very crucial for mediating such dilemma that a carrier might face as the experts can give professional advice on the advantages and disadvantages .
More importantly , the consequences of a genetic test on an individual should be made known to him or her before making such decision .
Genetic research and testing have advanced tremendously in recent years with tools such as the Genome Project (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
As such , genetic testing is becoming more readily accessible for people to have their genes tested for any indication of greater risk of developing any diseases (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
If an individual discover after a genetic test that he has a high risk of developing certain disease , it would mean that his family member who share similar genes may be at risk as well (Forrest K , 2003) .
Not only it is his responsibility to share his genetic testing results with his family (Forrest K , 2003) , informing his family members will give them a chance for early detection of the disease as well as to make necessary family planning (Agatha M , Denise B and Kathleen A , 2009) .
Hence , carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his family members his genetic testing result .
Firstly , it is the responsibility of the carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his family member of their increased likelihood of having the same genetic risk (Forrest K , 2003) .
Since all the family members share similar genes and DNA , the discovery of any members with a genetic risk of certain disease means that the rest of the family members are likely to have the same risk too (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
Being in the same family , it is one's responsibility to taking care of each other's well-being (Forrest K , 2003) .
Critics of this point claim that there is a need to protect family members from the troubling information and that some of the family members may not be able to cope emotionally if revealed that they may be at high risk of a genetic disease (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
However , these concerns can be addressed by counseling as well as moral support from family members and the medical benefits that the family members can get from the information justifies the need to reveal the information to them (Forrest K , 2003) .
Hence , to fulfill the responsibility as a member of the family , carrier of genetic risk should tell his relatives his genetic test result .
Secondly , sharing of the fact that one has a greater risk of genetic disease will encourage his relatives to go for genetic testing (Forrest K , 2003) .
The relatives can make an informed decision as to whether they want to have a genetic testing done themselves .
If they are tested with the same increased genetic risk , it will allow them to have early preventive medical treatment (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
The family members can also then consider family planning based on the severity of the disease and the likelihood of passing the disease to the next generation (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
Opponents of this position argue that the family members may hastily undergo a genetic test on receiving the negative news without careful consideration of the possible discrimination that they may face after the genetic test (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
Admittedly , it is true that one may face discrimination at work and from insurance companies after a genetic test (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
However , with the setting up of legislative law by governments , such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in the United States , the risk of discrimination at work or from insurance companies will be kept to a minimum (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
Thus , genetic risk carrier should not hesitate to tell his relatives so that they can benefit from the information medically .
In conclusion , revealing of the genetic test result by the carrier of genetic risk is not only his responsibility to his family members; it also allows his relatives to have a chance of early detection of the disease and possible treatment as a result .
No doubt that this may bring emotional stress to the relatives , but if managed properly , the medical benefits that the relatives can get from the information outweigh this initial risk .
Therefore , carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his family members his genetic testing result .
Genetic Testing grants us the ability to determine an individual's paternity and his chances of getting a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome .
There are three forms of genetic testing - Gene tests , chromosomal test and biochemical test .
Since Genetic testing is voluntary , the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results .
This is because there are many social and emotional aspects with regards to genetic testing .
Revealing an individual's genetic makeup and results without their consent can also lead to an infringement of human rights and privacy .
Also , these individuals may face discriminations from family members and also from the society , such as their employers and insurance companies .
Therefore , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives to prevent such genetic testing results from being passed on to other third parties without consent .
An individual is not obligated to reveal the results of genetic testing to third parties due to the infringement of privacy and human rights .
Like medical records , results of genetic testing should be kept confidential and they should not be disclosed without permission (Mehlman1999) .
Since genetic testing requested by an individual involves the use of own genetic makeup , it is therefore against human rights to reveal the genetic testing results without their contest .
Every individual should be given the right to decide whether to disclose the genetic testing results to their relatives by weighing the advantages and disadvantages on their own .
This is based on the fact that everyone is unique and they have different background and personal constraints to take into considerations when deciding whether to reveal their genetic testing results .
Thus , the carrier of a known genetic risk is not obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Another reason such why genetic testing results should not be revealed to relatives is because other third parties may have the chance to get hold of these results and use them against the individuals .
There are many controversies on the fairness in the use of genetic information by other third parties such as insurers , employers , adoption agencies , schools , military and courts .
It is not fair for insurers to deny insurance or raise premiums base for individuals that have positive results from genetic testing (Mehlman1999) .
Andre and Velasquez mentioned that being a carrier for a genetic disorder does not mean that the individuals will get the disorder for sure .
Therefore , it is justified for the carriers to buy insurance so that they can get a sufficient amount of coverage as compensation for any mishap that may or may not happen .
Raising premium for such individuals is seen as taking advantage of them .
Also , employers may stereotype these individuals as non-productive and inefficient workers and choose not to hire them (Weiss 1999) .
Therefore , the carriers of genetic disorder should not be obligated to reveal the results to anyone to prevent from having to face discriminations at societal level .
Proponents in favour for the revealing of results argue that revealing the results to third parties such as relatives can aid in emotional support .
Relatives can provide necessary help to the carriers by providing more care and concern .
This is necessary because carriers of genetic disorders undergo tremendous stress and it would be great if there is someone close to be there with them to face all kinds of problems .
Furthermore , revealing the results to the relatives can encourage them to be more health conscious and also to remind that to take go for frequent checkups since they might run the risk of having the same disorder too (Weiss 1999) .
However , this does not apply to all individuals and there is a possibility that they may even face discriminations from their own family members and relatives .
Some may feel that the individuals are likely to be a burden to them and may start to shun or keep away from them , causing them to feel even more upset or depressed .
Therefore , the final decision on whether to reveal the genetic testing results should lie in the hands of the carriers themselves .
In conclusion , the revealing of genetic testing results may bring more problems than solutions to the individual and therefore they should be given the final say in whether to reveal the results .
Many problems such as discrimination and psychological stigmatisation attributed from the release of genetic testing should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to reveal the genetic testing results as they can worsen an individual's health condition .
Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell 3rd parties ?
Genetic testing is a medical test which looks at the DNA makeup of an individual .
The advantages of genetic testing include diagnosis of current or future diseases , prevention or early treatment and reduced disease risk in future generations (American Association for Clinical Chemistry [AACC] , 2009; Riper , 2005) .
Some possible disadvantages include anxiety , stress and strained family relationships (AACC , 2009; Riper , 2005) .
After an individual has undergone genetic testing , is it necessary for him to share his test results with 3rd parties (someone other than his doctor) ?
While sharing can improve workplace safety and family health , it may also lead to genetic discrimination or unnecessary stress for both the patient and his family (Nuffield Council on Bioethics [NCB] , 1993; Sobel and Bursztajn , 2000) .
However , there are antidiscrimination laws and stressed individuals can seek genetic counseling (AACC , 2009; Human Genome Management Information System [HGMIS] , 2008) .
Hence , an individual should be obligated to tell 3rd parties his genetic test results .

Firstly , sharing of genetic test results benefits the individual with regards to working environment .
Some work environments may increase disease risk in individuals with a particular genetic makeup .
For example , individuals with the genetic disorder , alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency have higher risk of getting related diseases when exposed to smoky environments (NCB , 1993) .
Thus , employers can have alternative work arrangements for these at-risk employees .
Opponents of this position argue that revelation of genetic test results to 3rd parties will cause individuals to face genetic discrimination .
Sobel & Bursztajn (2000) reported that the American Management Associated did a survey on this and results showed that 7% of employers use employee's genetic information for employing and job advancement decisions .
For instance , an employer fired an office worker with a genetic disease due to not wanting to cover her high treatment costs under the company's health care benefits for workers (Sobel & Bursztajn , 2000) .
However , there are antidiscrimination laws (Sobel & Bursztajn , 2000) .
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was signed into law by President George W . Bush on May 2008 (HGMIS , 2008) .
GINA forbids genetic discrimination by employers and health insurers (HGMIS , 2008) .
Therefore , revelation of genetic test results to others , benefits the individual .
Secondly , sharing of genetic test results can improve family health .
When an individual is identified to have a gene mutation associated with a disease , his family and relatives may also have that gene mutation .
His direct family has 50 percent chance of having the same mutation while his extended family has 25 percent chance of having the same mutation (Norrgard , 2008) .
Hence , that individual should inform his family and relatives so as to advise them to take genetic testing .
If his family or relatives are found to have the same gene mutation , early treatment or preventive measures can be taken .
Critics argue that genetic information may cause negative emotional and psychological effects on family and relatives (AACC , 2009) .
However , genetic counseling is available , to help them cope with their psychological problems (AACC , 2009) .
Thus , the revelation of one's genetic test results to family and relatives , benefits them .
In conclusion , an individual should reveal his genetic test results to 3rd parties as it improves workplace safety and family health .
Sharing of genetic results not only benefits himself , but also his family and relatives .
If one loves his family , one should let them know his genetic test results .

Genetic Testing and the Family .
Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health , 50(3) , 227-233 .
As science develops rapidly , genetic testing , one of the most advanced technology , has become a common component of medical care .
According to the definition from BIO (Biotechnology Industry Organization) , genetic testing is "the analysis of an individual's genetic material" (2009) .
This new technology can help to identify genetic disease .
However , the controversy is that if the individual who carries a genetic risk should tell their relatives the results of genetic testing .
Some emphasize the significance of personal privacy , and show the concern of genetic discrimination .
However , because the whole family shares the same set of genes , they have the right to know the result of the genetic test .
For the carriers , telling the result to their families is not only showing their responsibility to the family and society , but also the best way to ensure they get the best care .
Firstly , it is their responsibility to tell the relatives the result of the genetic test .
According to the article Genetic testing is all in the family by Jeffery P . Kahn , Director of Centre for Bioethics , University of Minnesota , the family has the right to know the result of the genetic test of any member in the family .
Since the whole family shares the same set of genes , the information the individual provides through the genetic testing may have just as much meaning for the family as for him or herself (Kahn , 2000) .
Therefore , these results should be told , no matter they are good or bad .
However , some may claim that the individuals have the right to protect their privacy (Kahn , 2000) , and like other private information , genetic information should be protected properly , and people have the final say whether to reveal it to others .
However , here there is something more important than privacy .
Genetic disorder only can be treated if those carriers of a known genetic risk decide to reveal their genetic result .
Moreover , we can only protect our children from inherited disease if we know whether there is a genetic risk .
As a result , the carriers of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives .
Secondly , it ensures that those carriers of genetic risk get the best care from family and society if they are willing to tell the test results .
As we all know , genetic disorder is not contagious and there is no risk for those people who want to offer help .
However , sometimes when there is high pressure , like knowing they are having genetic disorder , the individuals cannot make decisions properly , while their family and professional can take good care of them and make the best decision for them (Forrest et al . , 2007) .
Someone may claim that other people's decision may lead potential dangers for the person concerned (Forrest et al . , 2007) , since we are not them and cannot know exactly what they need .
However , as known to all , a group with several professionals will have more knowledge and experience than the individual , and the family members of the carriers will selflessly take care of them .
Therefore it is better for the carriers to tell their relatives the test results .
To draw a conclusion , for the carriers of genetic risk , it is better to tell the genetic test results to their relatives because it is an action not only showing their responsibility to the family and society , but also ensuring that they can get the best care .
Nowadays , as the technology of genetic testing has been well-developed , people who are at risk of genetic disorder may request for such testing to determine their health condition .
To some extent , the results of genetic testing can help people to detect certain disease and take measures to reduce the risk .
However , the abuse of the results may cause many issues .
Revealing the results of individual genetic testing without individual's permission may lead to invasion of privacy and social discrimination .
Hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
An important reason why individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing is because people have the right to protect their privacy .
The decision of informing family members the results should be a personal choice .
Because the results of genetic testing not only affect the person who takes the test but also relate to his family members , sometimes people may encounter dilemmas .
Individuals may make different decision depending on their situations .
For example , after undergoing genetic testing , people may find out that their siblings also have the same genetic disorder with themselves .
However , informing them may result in huge changes in their life decisions .
Thus , whether to tell them the results or not is a cautious decision that should be made by individuals (Norrgard 2008) .
Some may suggest that it is an ethical responsibility for people who are found to have genetic disorder to inform the results to their family members .
However , since currently there is no legislation forcing people to do so , the results should be treated as privacy and should be protected (Norrgard 2008) .
Another reason is that the misuses of genetic testing results may cause social discrimination .
If the results of individual genetic testing are revealed to employers and insurance companies , employers may not hire people who are diagnosed by with certain disease .
Likewise , insurance companies may also refuse to serve people who have high risk of some disease (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
Opponents may argue that law can be used as a mean to protect against genetic discrimination .
They cited that a number of laws have been enacted to prohibit insurance companies from collecting information of genetic testing and using them to discriminate against people (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
However , this approach is not effective .
Firstly , most laws only restrict types of genetic information , but they do not ensure that people will be fairly charged if they reveal genetic testing results (Norrgard 2008) .
Secondly , laws still have limitation of prohibiting employers from refusing people who have genetic disorder (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
Hence , using legal power to limit discrimination is incomplete .
To conclude , since genetic testing results are people's privacy and revealing them may cause social discrimination , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Oxford Dictionary defines genetic testing as the sequencing of human DNA in order to discover genetic differences , anomalies , or mutations that may prove pathological .
One of the many ethical issues associated with genetic testing involves the question of whether a known carrier of a genetic condition is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
While the individual has no legal or professional obligation to inform his relatives , he nevertheless has a very strong moral obligation to do so as his relatives who may have inherited the condition can take action to improve the prognosis as well as prepare themselves mentally and socially , not revealing this information can be interpreted as negligence on the part of the carrier , and telling his relatives will allow them to anticipate lifestyle changes to accommodate his condition as well as readies them for possible financial strain that may be brought about .
First of all , it is a known fact that genetic conditions may be hereditary and thus indirectly involves the relatives of the carrier as well , putting the carrier's relatives at a possible risk having the condition as well .
The carrier is at least morally obligated to inform his relatives from an altruistic point of view .
In the event that one of the carrier's relatives discover that he is affected by the disorder , preventive measures can be taken in anticipation of the disease and in the event that the disease is incurable , palliative steps can be planned .
An example of prevention would be an individual affected by the BRCA gene undergoing a mastectomy which would reduce the chances of developing breast cancer from 85% to 1% (http://www .medscape .com/viewarticle/573060) .
Beyond telling them , the decision to undergo genetic testing is purely up to the relatives themselves .
While some might say that there is no point of knowing if a disease has no cure , knowing has its benefits as it not only prepares the individual in the physical aspects of the disease but also the psychological aspects .
In the event that a relative tests positive for a genetic condition , it is not only the physical aspects of the diseases that must be considered , but also the psychosocial aspects of the disease .
Having known that he is at risk of a genetic condition , an individual will be able to anticipate the possibility that he might be afflicted with the disease and mentally prepare for that possibility .
He will be able to work towards acceptance of the fact that he might have the condition and be able to adapt easily to it in the event that the condition manifests; as opposed to the condition striking suddenly without prior warning .
Furthermore , he will be able to also mentally prepare for any stigma or discrimination that he may face in society as it has been shown that identifying patients in need of psychosocial support will enhance effect on well being (Mind and cancer: does psychosocial intervention improve survival and psychological well- being ?) .
Although some people prefer to be carefree and prefer not to know at all as they cite the fact that knowing will make them anxious and stressed , the onus is on them to go for the genetic testing to determine any abnormalities .
If ignorance is their choice , it is their right to go along with it .
While the obligation for a carrier to tell his relatives may be considered as a breach of privacy , not telling them at all is tantamount to negligence , especially if the genetic condition is known to be hereditary .
It is only responsible to inform someone if there is a possibility that their life may be severely affected because of a disease .
If you knew there was a murderer in your neighbor's house , would you not inform them ?
In the perspective of a carrier's relative , most people would definitely want to be informed if they are at an increased risk of having a genetic condition .
Undoubtedly , for some genetic risks , there will be a stronger case for the duty to warn relatives about it especially in serious conditions like breast cancer (BRCA-1) and Huntington's Disease (On warning families about genetic risk: the ghost of Tarasoff) While there is an issue of a not having confidentiality on the matter , at least the carrier can sleep well at night knowing that he has fulfilled his responsibility .
It must also be noted that several genetic conditions are highly debilitating and will inevitably have a huge impact on family members , who are usually the main care givers physically as well as socially .
If this is the case , family members have a right to know what to expect of the disease and to what extent they will have to adjust their lives to accommodate the carrier .
In this sense , the carrier is thus obliged to inform his family members of his genetic test in order for his family members to prepare for a possible change in lifestyle .
It will also allow the family to assess the extent of the disease and make preparations in the event that they are unable to accommodate the carrier such as sending the carrier to a nursing home or employing a full-time nurse to assist in care giving .
This is opposed to have the disease suddenly dropped on them like a bombshell which would cause severe disruption in their lives .
For example , it is shown that the majority of people with Alzheimer's disease are cared for in the home , which may affect the work situation of the caregivers , their own health , and their finances (http://family .jrank .org/pages/70/Alzheimer-s-Disease- Impact-on-Family .html) .
A negative point to this is that family members may view the carrier as a burden even before the condition manifests and this may be a source of tension in the family .
Nevertheless , it should be pointed out that it is better to be safe and sorry as in this case , the burden has a strong potential to manifest and it would be better to sort out any misgivings before the condition strikes rather than after .
Finally , the financial effect of the disease on the carrier and his relatives must also be considered in the ethical reasoning of this argument as the financial aspects of a disease may be far reaching especially for families in the low income group .
This especially applies more to certain diseases like diabetes mellitus or cancer in which the cost of treatment puts a severe strain on the finances of a family .
A carrier is thus obliged to tell his family members in order for them to start thinking ahead by starting initiatives like saving plans or taking up more jobs .
The family will also be able to start looking for avenues of financial assistance even before the disease strikes .
To emphasize this point , studies have shown that economic hardship requires households to make difficult decisions between care and basic living expenses , which at times compromises necessary treatments and health care (economic hardship requires households to make difficult decisions between care and basic living expenses , which at times compromises necessary treatments and health care) .
While some might argue that there is little that people in the low income groups can do to prepare for this and it might simply cause unnecessary stress for them; it must be pointed out that it is even more important for this group of people to plan ahead for the future as they will very likely lack sufficient resources to deal with it when the problem surfaces .
Considering all the points put forth above , I would very much think that there is a strong moral obligation for a carrier of a genetic defect has to tell his relatives about the results of his genetic test .
Allowing them to know will serve as a warning for them to take preventive measure or prepare for the worst as well as readying family members for the possibility that the condition associated with the genetic abnormality may one day surface .
Despite the arguments of privacy of the individual , feelings of helplessness , possible family tension and increasing the level of stress within a family , I still feel that the moral obligation to let the carrier's relatives know far outweighs these points .
Ultimately , it must be recognized that the carrier of a genetic abnormality is only obliged to tell his relatives; subsequent action taken beyond that is out of the scope of the obligation of the carrier .
The advancement in science and technology has enabled the determination of genetic risk of disease development by means of genetic testing .
Although it is an improvement in the scientific world in view of combating diseases , ethical dilemma is born in the communication of genetic risk in families .
Some have suggested that the issue is related to privacy concern and the disclosure of genetic information may cause anxiety , guilt , depression and other disadvantages in both individuals and their relatives (Norrgard , 2008) .
However the importance of the moral obligation individuals have for their family and the consequences for family planning and personal health of at-risk relatives should not be neglected .
In fact the potential for harm to uninformed relatives outweighs the individual's right to confidentiality and therefore the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Forrest and her team stated that "the responsibility of disseminating genetic information to family members lies largely with the individual" (Forrest , Delatycki , Skene , Aitken , 2007 , para .2) .
Individuals may possess duty of care and/or moral obligations to communicate the potential genetic risk to relatives .
According to a documented research done by Clarke , Richards , and Kerzin-Storrar , among the 40 ,000 clients attending genetics clinics over a 1-year period world-wide , only 65 were reported as non- disclosure cases a frequency of non-disclosure that was shown to be less than 1% of all genetics consults .
(Clarke , Richards , Kerzin-Storrar , 2005) Indeed , the moral obligation of individuals to their family and relatives is a compelling argument supported by "kinship bonds and an assumed desire to protect family members from harm" (Forrest et al , 2007) .
Some have argued that individuals may not disclose genetic information because they prefer not to contact relatives personally (Consent and Confidentiality in Genetic Practice: Guidance on Genetic Testing and Sharing Genetic Information , 2005) , and they are embarrassed about reporting bad news (Wertz , 2003) , or they are unable to communicate directly with family members (Ethical Aspects of Human Genetic Testing: An Information Paper , 2000) .
Nevertheless , one can seek assistance from genetic health professionals to address the above problems by "having the genetic health professionals to communicate the genetic information to family members at the client's request" (Forrest et al , 2007) .

Sermijn had done a research involving family relatives who revealed a lack of understanding and awareness that a genetic risk was present in their family (Sermijn et al , 2004) .
However this may not be a reason for individuals to withhold genetic information from their relatives .
UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics states that "both individuals and family members have responsibilities to be willing to give and receive genetic information" (Forrest et al , 2007 , p614) .
Effective communication strategies can be employed to achieve a positive outcome of communication by assessing the vulnerability and receptivity of family relatives .
This can be achieved through personal understanding or advices given by genetic health professionals (Gaff , 2007) .
In summary , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives because the sense of responsibility to inform the relatives with crucial genetic information outweighs concern about affecting the individual by imparting "bad" or potentially unwelcome news .
Potential harm to uninformed family relatives has to be considered although the disclosure may not be smooth due to lack of understanding by relatives .
Fortunately the latter can be solved by seeking the help of genetic health professionals who can provide effective communication strategies to help produce a positive outcome of communication .

Gene is the basic heredity unit in all living organism its properties concerns families and kinship of all humans .
It is the study of how characteristics are passed down through generations .
The ability to identify more genes which are related to specific disorders increases dramatically as the genetic technology develops vigorously in this modern time .
It allows new possibilities of genetic testing and more to come (Clarke & Parsons , 1997) .
In the case of diseases that have an onset in adulthood , such as Huntington's disease , people can get themselves tested before symptoms develop to discover the likelihood of getting the disorder .
Some of those who receive positive testing result , despite the shock and the devastating situation that they face , will consider the interests of other family members and inform their relatives of the existence of this genetic risk in the family .
But not all patients will have the moral obligation to do .
Thus , there is a need for carrier of a known genetic risk to be legally obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Carriers of known genetic risks should be obligated to tell their relatives because it prevents severe harm such as loss of lives .
If they are being alerted of such condition , they will be able to seek possible treatments and receive warnings to avoid detrimental environment stimuli .
For example , malignant hyperthermia syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder where life-threatening condition will be triggered by regular anesthesia .
Prior warning of a carrier can actually prevent unexpected death of blood relatives during their surgeries (Andrews , 1994) .
Moreover , information of genetic risk from a carrier will serve as guidance in his or her relatives' reproductive decision makings .
After knowing of possible genetic condition , one may think twice before deciding to conceive a child .
The rate of abortion upon learning of fetus defection will then decrease , hence preventing meaningless loss of lives .
Likewise , obligation of carrier to tell his or her relatives allows those who indeed will suffer from dormant genetic diseases or are suffering from genetic condition to plan their lives ahead .
They will tend to avoid passing on the undesirable condition to their children , hence they may seek proper guidance through counseling before consider to conceive a child .
For example , Huntington's disease's symptoms normally only appear when one is approaching his or her middle age .
Knowing of this dormant genetic disease earlier certainly allows the patients to make decision whether to build a family or not to , or for those who already have their own families - whether to conceive children or not to because there is a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to the offspring for each pregnancy .
In addition , informed relatives who then find out their genetic condition - whether they are a carrier or sufferer of that particular genetic disease or not , are given a chance to secure financial schemes for future use .
Furthermore , their family members are granted the time to equip themselves with the knowledge and ability to take care of said patients for an extended period of time in future .
Undoubtedly , privacy advocates criticizes that such enforced obligation violates an individual's autonomy .
They argue that for family interest to outweigh one's autonomy is unethical because there may be cases where relatives use one's genetic disorder information to their own advantages , rendering said individual to material loss and mishap social status .
For example , a woman can easily claim custody of her children from her formal husband who has Huntington's disease , by asserting he will not have the ability to take care of their children in near future .
While it is true that the extreme circumstances mentioned do exist in the society , one must agree that relatives have their reserved rights too , to know about the presence of genetic risk within the family because no one has exclusive rights over his or her genes as they are shared among the family .
Spouses too have the rights to know when it comes to making a family just as he or she has equal rights over the children .
Indeed , powerful protection has always been given to autonomy , privacy and confidentiality .
However , these ethics can be breached when the action has an essential purpose , such as safeguarding others from harm , which unquestionably outweighs those said principles (Andrews , 1994) .
The absolute priority that they possess should be balanced by awareness of averting medical harm to fellow humans (Wang , 2001) .
Therefore , carrier of known genetic risk should be legally obligated to inform relatives , not just morally responsible to do that .
In conclusion , legal obligation of carriers with known genetic risk to tell their relatives should be implemented as it bring about advantages such as preventing loss of lives and reducing uncertainties in potential patients' futures .
Firstly , based on the context of confidentiality and privacy , individuals' right to privacy ought to maintain confidentiality of the genetic makeup .
If one has no control over who can gain information of the individual , it can lead to potentially serious consequences .
Byravan ,S .
and Matlaw ,J(2005) emphasized that individual genetic information gained from testing should be subjected to confidentiality and protected from harm that might result from improper disclosure or use of the information .
One may perceive privacy as an overrated right . . .
Thirdly , upon providing genetic material , individuals lose control over who can access results .
Consequently , when someone shows the predisposition to genetic disorder , it exposes one to the possibility of stigmatisation and discrimination when the genetic information is made accessible to others .
Byravan .S and Matlaw .J (2005) highlighted that the cost-conscious employers might make adverse employment decisions based on a person's predispositions .
They might also be turned down job promotions .
Due to profit-wise considerations , one's privilege to different schemes of insurance converge might be limited .
One might even be excluded from health insurance coverage when one's gene status shows flaw .
As such , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is implemented to prevent health insurers and employers to discriminate against a person's genetic predispositions (Allison , 2008) .
One may argue that following the safeguards established , it should be able to hinder away the needless worries .
However , Norrgard ,K (2008) pointed out that current regulations lack adequate enforcement mechanism .
Assurances of protection is more difficult to come by , after all , the decisions made are still largely dependent on the subjective perception of the society .
In conclusion , the decision of examinee to have their results of genetic testing disclosed or to refuse them should be voluntary and should not be interfered with .
The loss of privacy and the potential social discrimination involved are still the main concerns of the public .
Genetic information should be disclosed without the patient's authorization only when necessary to protect third parties from harm or when disclosure is compelled by law . . . . .
There has been an ongoing debate on whether doctors should reveal the results of genetic tests to others besides the individuals who have underwent the tests without their acknowledgement (Lynch , 2008) , (Ostrom , 1997) and (Tanner , 2004) .
Genetic testing can confirm one's ancestry , paternity and the risk of them developing a disease or passing on the genetic disease to their offspring (Lynch , 2008) .
It would benefit others , as relatives of the individual known to be a carrier of the disease might be at-risk of developing the disease as well (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Conversely , some people feel that it is an invasion of privacy (Tanner , 2004) and that others may abuse the information (Ostrom , 1997) .
Discrimination may also occur (The Associated Press , 2008) and insurance premiums for individuals and their relatives might increase if insurance companies know that the have a high risk of developing certain hereditary diseases .
Hence individuals should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of their genetic tests to their relatives .
It is without a doubt beneficial to inform relatives that they might be at risk of developing a hereditary disease when individual's genetic tests turn out to be positive (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Relatives may choose to go for a genetic test to determine their status by checking for the particular mutation known to increase the risk of developing a particular disease (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Should they test positive for the particular mutation , preventive measures and cost-effective treatments could be carried out to reduce the risk of developing the disease (The Changes in Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO) , 2005) but not every person with the mutation would develop the disease eventually .
On the flipside , some people cannot come to terms with the fact that they might have a higher chance of developing a disease compared to other people .
They might have very negative thoughts like anger , fear that they would develop the disease in the near future or if they have children , they might feel guilty about passing the mutation to their children (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Hence , individuals should have the final decision on whether they want to reveal the results of their genetic test to their relatives , especially if they know that their relatives would be unable to cope with the news .
Another issue now is that individual's privacy is not respected as insurance companies without their consent show their results to relatives .
Insurance companies might have gotten hold of individual's positive genetic tests without their consent to show their relatives why their insurance premiums were jerked up (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) or to explain why their bid to get insured was rejected (Ostrom , 1997) .
Then again , if relatives know that a genetic disease is hereditary and went for a genetic test to prove that they do not have the mutation that would put them at a higher risk of developing the disease , they would be able to get insured earlier (Ostrom , 1997) .
Although there are regulations to prevent insurers from discriminating people with a higher chance of getting certain genetic diseases The Changes in Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO) , 2005) , it might lead to higher insurance premium for everyone .
Hence , the results of individual's genetic test should not be revealed to others unless individuals choose to as the information could be abused and their relatives would most likely be affected .
In conclusion , I believe that the privacy of individuals should be respected .
This is because the emotional stability of the relatives in question has to be taken into consideration , as not every person in the family would develop the disease even if there have a particular mutation that puts them at a higher risk of developing the disease .
Also , relatives might be discriminated besides individuals should others like insurance companies know that the disease is hereditary .
Hence , it should be up to individuals to disclose the results of the genetic tests to their relatives if they choose to .

The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Genetic testing is a specific medical test to look out for a particular part of the genes .
It is often used to diagnose inherited diseases and to determine a child's genetic parents .
With the main focus on fine tuning its processes to increase its accuracy , ethical issues have not been well addressed .
Ethical issue such as whether an individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results remains shady .
Many argue that they should not have the final say as it benefits the general public as a whole .
In fact , by knowing the results , it might create unnecessary fear among people .
Not only that , the society might in turn discriminate the individual with an undesired result .
Furthermore , it is morally wrong to reveal the results without the individual's consent as it intrudes one's privacy .
Therefore , individuals should have the final say in revealing the results of their genetic test .
First and foremost , revealing the genetic test results without one's consent is an invasion of privacy .
Some might argue that the results benefit the whole population as it might be useful an already statistically- scarce medical research .
However , it is disrespectful to the individual since it is the individual who decides to undertake this genetic test in the first place .
Moreover , having the final say in disclosing the results does not mean not revealing the results at all .
One may initially find it hard to accept the reality and may decide to reveal the results at a later stage when ready .
In this case , that individual still can aid in the medical research .
Secondly , by revealing the results without the individual's final say might cause unnecessary stress to others especially to their relatives .
An individual might chose not to reveal the outcome of the test as it might create anxiety on their loved ones .
This in turn would create unnecessary stress and might affect the way they lead their lives .
With this , some might argue that this will impose more strain on the individual who is already facing the stress from reality , and therefore , revealing the results might unburden him or her .
However , there are genetic counselors trained in this field to address any concerns , and thus there is no need to reveal the results without the individual's final say .
Thirdly , by knowing the results of the genetic test on the individuals might cause discriminations against them .
As our genes are not controlled by us , it will be unfair to discriminate individuals based on their genetic makeup (Norrgard , 2008) .
For example , a 30 year old employee who is as competent as any other staff , was recently genetically tested positive for Huntington's disease .
Individuals with Huntington's disease develop their symptoms such as uncontrolled movements and mental declination only at an average age of 35-44 years old .
Knowing that the employee could not remain committed to the company in the next 5-10 years , the employer decides to retrench that employee .
As such , the employee's potential will be hindered as he or she would still be able to work normally until the symptoms set in 5-10 years from now .
This not only hinder one's potential , it will also affect the way the individual walk his or her remaining path of life .
Similarly , a health insurance company might deny an individual from having an insurance plan or might charge them at a higher rate if such results are disclosed to them .
Some might argue that this is necessary to prevent people from benefitting off from those insurance companies .
However , we must not forget the fact that we have no control on our genetic make-up .
As such it is not because that they want to benefit off from these companies , it is more of what they have to do in order to survive financially .
Besides , the very purpose of health insurance companies is to provide healthcare and to ensure the well-being of the people .
As important as it is to increase the accuracy of genetic testing , individuals should have the final say in revealing the results .
By doing so , we can respect each other's privacy , minimize unnecessary stress on others as well as to eliminate discrimination against the already unfortunate individuals .
Genetic testing is a technique used to test for genetic disorder .
In genetic testing , patient's DNA is being tested for mutation and patient's DNA is obtained from his/her blood sample .
Reasons why people should go for genetic testing are to find out genetic diseases in babies and to find out whether a person carry a mutated gene might pass it on to their children .
Although some may argue that a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives about it , due to privacy concern issue , different emotional reactions of relatives or parents .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , revealing of genetic testing results raises an issue of privacy concern .
This is because there is a possibility that those individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases are being backstabbed by someone they know .
Individuals who found out that their genes were mutated have an increase risk in developing cancer or diseases .
For example , an employer would not want to retain or hire employees that have a likelihood of developing cancer or diseases as employees' health and working ability will be affected once they develop cancer .
Similarly , individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases will have difficulties in obtaining insurances as individuals are likely to increase medical bills once they develop cancer or diseases .
Costs of their bills will be very high for insurance company .
Furthermore , it is unfair to discriminate individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases as they themselves cannot control their own genes .
(Norrgard , 2008)
There is an argument stating that revealing of individuals' genetic test result will benefit individuals' relative or parents .
This is because individuals' relative or parents can go for genetic testing and check whether they had inherited any mutated gene(s) or not .
If individuals' relative or parents had inherited any mutated gene(s) , they can undergo preventive health measures .
Although revealing of individuals' genetic test result will benefit individuals' relative or parents , not much preventive measures can be done to delay or lower the risk of individuals' relative or parents from developing cancer or diseases .
Therefore , there is not a need to reveal individuals' genetic test result as individuals can ask their parents or relative to undergo genetic testing without revealing their result .
(Lee , 2005)
In conclusion , revealing of genetic testing results will affect individuals .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives due to privacy concern issue , negative emotional reactions of relatives or parents .
The human genome project began in 1990 , was an ambitious project with the aim of sequencing the 3 billion human DNA and identifying the genes present in these DNA .1 It is no doubt that this project is one of the most successful achievements in the field of biotechnology .
The information gathered enables one to know how the genetic makeup of human correlate to a particular cause of disease .1 However the availability of such test has brought about other ethical issues like , should the results be announced to the carrier of known genetic risk to his relatives .
I believe this is an issue of personal privacy and rights , the carrier should not have any obligation to inform anyone unless he wishes to do so .
A Carrier With a Known Genetic Risk Should Tell His or Her Relatives
Genetic testing is a testing that can check some genetic disorder or disease such as {Hemophilia}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Hemophilia] , Huntington's disease and Marfan Syndrome , which means that this kind of disease has certain possibility to be inherited to the next generation .
There is controversy whether a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Considering the preparation for the future of his or her relatives , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about the disease or disorder .
Firstly , it is a general knowledge that until present , all kinds of genetic disease have no definite cure .
It seems to be doing no benefit by revealing the existence of the genetic disease to the carrier's relatives .
However , it can raise the awareness of the carrier's relatives when they plan to give birth to the next generation .
If they know that their family tends to have such disease , they can have another genetic testing to verify their own condition .
This can actually prevent an unfortunate baby that would affect their entire life to be born .
Somehow , privacy is what people concern of the most when discussing this topic .
I could not agree more with the fact that the carrier's privacy is sacrificed when he or she reveal off the testing result .
Nevertheless , family members should have the right to know the genetic information as they are genetically related to each other , which means that they are in the same risk also .
Therefore , the result of the testing should be told to the carrier's relatives .
In conclusion , the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives the result of genetic testing their benefit and of course the carrier's own benefit .
Respond to the question above , supporting your argument with concrete examples .
Genetic testing is a type of medical test that is used to find changes in genes , chromosomes and protein (Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
It has been used for years to identify genetic diseases in humans .
When the result of the test is positive , once who have a genetic risk will receive appropriate treatments .
However , whether a carrier of such disease is obligated to tell his or her relatives has become a great concern since a last few years .
Although it is the right of the individual requesting genetic to decide to reveal the result or not (Scientific American , 2008) , relatives of a carrier also have the right to be warned against any genetic risk and to received necessary treatment .
Genetic disorders are caused by the mutation of a gene (Letsou , 2009)  .When a normal gene is mutated , its stability will no longer be maintained .
This will lead to some diseases , depends on which gene is mutated .
Since disorders can be passed over from parents to a child , the relatives of a carrier , obviously , have a higher chance to carry the same disorder .
Thus , they should be informed about the risk of having disorders .
Being aware of it , they may choose to go through some genetic tests to check whether the disorder presents (Scientific American , 2008) .
If the result is positive , then they will receive necessary treatments .
Although we haven't found how to cure many of such diseases yet , if it is detected soon , the life of the patient can be lengthened .
Some people can claim that knowing that we are having a high risk of having , for example , a type of cancer while we may not have it can make people more anxious (Cancer .net , 2009)  .
In fact , the reactions of people with disorders are different (Cancer .net , 2009) thus we may not be diagnosed to have a cancer since we were young but it may present when we are at the middle age .
Knowing more about a risk of having a disease may help people to be more aware of its phenomenon , as well as more concern on their health (Cancer .net , 2009) .
They may have medical check-up more frequently and if there is any disorder that can threaten their life , it will be identified soon and it is always better when we can control a disease when it hasn't become worse .
At least the effect of the disorder can be reduced .
This may lengthen the life of the carrier or even more , save it .

Since the relatives of a carrier of disorders , especially his or her family , have a higher risk , they have a right to know about it (Cancer .net , 2009) .
This will protect not only the relatives but also other people .
It is because genetic disorder not only affect the health of carriers but also their life .
For example , a person who is diagnosed to have a serious disorder in a gene , which may lead to a rare disease , will have to think very carefully before getting married since his or her children can also have this disease also .
Moreover , genetic disorders usually have a great influence in carrier's health .
It may decrease the working capability of the carrier , or some hidden disease can become worse if the carrier works too much , or lives in an extremely polluted place .
While children whose parents are diagnosed to have a genetic disease can very possibly to have it(Genetic Home Reference , 2009) , they should be inform so that I can make suitable decision in choosing job , participating in hard activities and so on .
Many genetic disorders such as cancers will lead to serious consequences if the carrier does not have a healthy lifestyle to protect himself .
Otherwise since the disorder is not serious , then the carrier can live a normal life .
Although there is a concern that a positive test with a particular genetic disease can decrease the chance of the candidate in getting a job (Fisher , 2009) since companies always want employees that can work as hard as they want , laws are passed in order to protect the victims of disorder(Fisher , 2009) .
Furthermore , whenever a person received a positive test on a particular genetic disorder , he will choose the job that can not destroy his health or make the disorder worse .
Moreover , carriers of disorders can receive supports from their relatives , especially from their family if they let them know about the diagnosis .
When a teenager is diagnosed to have a serious genetic disorder , she must tell her parents , since the doctor need the permission of her family before giving her any treatment .
It is said that parents may feel guilty because their may pass dangerous disorder over their children (Cancer , 2009) .
However , when a carrier's family know well about her health condition , she will receive more care , which is better for her in keeping her health in a good condition .
Furthermore , telling relatives the results also help the carriers .
They will receive more encouragement , as well as other helps in money , medicine and so on (Croft , 2009) .
This makes carriers feel better even if the disease is serious , thus they have an internal strength to struggle with it .
Hence also help to increase the success rate of the treatment because when the patients really think of overcoming the disease , the process will go easily .
In conclusion ,because it is a right of humans to know about the risk they are having , the carriers of disorders must tell his or her relatives about it .
It not only protects their relatives but also help them in fighting the diseases .

"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Over the years , genetic testing has been increasing used in clarifying a diagnosis for more targeted treatments and allowing families to avoid having children with devastating diseases .
However , may also be a precarious tool capable of invading an individual's privacy and breaching confidentiality , thus , having a significantly negative impact on future public health .
In addition , abuse of genetic testing information may result in employment discrimination .
Therefore , individual should have the final say whether to reveal the results of their own genetic testing .
Firstly , privacy is important in maintaining individuals' autonomy and individuality as individuals define themselves by deciding how much personal information to disclose (Privacilla , 2001) .
Similarly , privacy also relates to the individuals' power over genetic information confidentiality .
Moreover , genetic information is protected in several ways; Common Law Principles , Statutory protection in the Data Protect Act 1984 , Doctor's professional codes of practice and contracts of healthcare providers' employment .
According to these documents , anyone including all healthcare providers has no right to disclose individuals' genetic information to a third party without the individual's consent .
However , genetic information of an individual susceptible to a particular genetic disease inevitably concerns family members who usually also share the same set of genes .
Hence , advocates may argue that if an individual holds the final say , yet chooses to withhold the information from their family members , this could have serious implications on the other family members susceptible to a particular disease .
On the other hand , if the individual chooses to freely release such information to family members who may not be susceptible , could cause undue anxiety .
Admittedly , the imbalance control can result in negative consequences , but one can also adopt the view that a responsible person would wish to communicate relevant information to their family members who are interested in that information , and a responsible person is interested in that information , particularly where it may have a significance in future decisions that they might hold .
Supporting this notion , evidences from a government case study suggests that individual withholding genetic information from people , who may need to know , is not a common occurrence .
In addition , desirability of sharing information with family members is also emphasized through counseling and doctor's persuading , but not made a condition as it does not supersede the individual's right to privacy .
Furthermore , it is false that family members are not protected , because the court passes on laws to reveal an individuals' genetic information .
This however , is judged on a case by case basis , and is only approved if an individual's decision causes potential damage rather than mere inconvenience and if the reason for refusal to give permission has evidences of malice .
Most importantly , confidence and trust can also be shattered if doctors fail to respect confidentiality .
In the long run , public health might be affected as doctors are discredited as a source of education and patients do not come forward .
Therefore , individual should still have the final say because the interest of the family members does not supersede individuals' privacy and there is an assumed responsibility of individual to share relevant information , but even without doing so , family members would still be protected by the laws .
Also , breaching patients' confidentiality has significantly negative impact on future public health .
Secondly , the disclosure of individuals' genetic information to employers may result in employment discrimination .
Competition in market forces and drive for economic efficiency can invoke employers to exploit the genetic information as opportunities to reduce cost and improve work efficiency .
Employers would prefer to hire a "healthy worker" because they have a lower frequency of being absent through illness which translates to lower cost in work impairments , hiring temporary replacements and fewer precautions to be taken to deal with health and safety risks .
Moreover , genetic information can also deny a person with late onset of the disease of a particular job , for example a person with Huntington's disease , being healthy most of his or her life time .
Though some employers claimed that knowing individuals' genetic information can help them to take specific measures to protect individuals at risk of occupational diseases , it might not be feasible to the financial status of a company if such measures were to incur huge sums of money .
The overriding truth is that employers would inevitably be more concerned about the company's profitability .
In fact , disclosure of genetic information has no benefits to people at risk of non- occupational diseases , but serves to reduce their chances of employment .
Moreover , there is currently no legal protection against genetic discrimination in most parts of the world .
Therefore , individual should still hold the right and freedom to the final say because of possible employment discrimination as they have no legal protections .
In conclusion , individual should have the final say in revealing their own genetic testing results .
It is an assumed that individuals should be responsible in sharing relevant information with their family member after counseling .
However , if their actions can result in a direct effect or harm on a third party the court may pass on laws to override such privacy .
Disclosure of genetic information can discredit doctors as a source of education and may deteriorate the public health system .
Also , individual is susceptible to possible employment discrimination as currently they have no legal protections .

Firstly , individuals might not be ready to disclose their genetic testing results to their family members as they feel that their privacy is invaded (A .M , 2009) .
They are still not mentally prepared to disclose the information as they think that they might get discriminated by their relatives .
For example , a person who has a risk of getting an inherited disease might not be able to inherit his family business for fear that he will not be able to withstand the tough job requirements .
Hence , if they are not mentally and emotionally prepared to disclose such information , they should be given the right of not telling their relatives about it .
However , critics argue that there are counseling sessions set up to help individuals understand their personal risk or the risk for other family members (Adams , 2003) .
Seeking third parties' opinion is not very useful as they might not fully understand the situation that individuals are in and often , they make wrong judgments .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic disease should not be obligated to tell his relatives due to invasion of privacy .
Secondly , individuals have the desire to protect family members from troubling information .
This is because not everyone in the family will get the disease and disclosing such information to family members might cause unnecessary anxiety in the family .
For example , a parent might not want to tell their children that she has a certain inherited disease as she is guilty about passing the mutated genes to her children .
However , critics argue that family members should have the right to know if they are at risk of getting the disease .
Since they are in the same family tree , the relatives should have the right to know the probability of contracting this inherited disease .
This helps them to make informed choices about their health and maybe seek treatment before the disease bloom .
Nonetheless , disclosure to family members may not respect their right of not to know .
The carrier's family members might not want to know about the genetic risk and hence , disclosing such information might cause them to be anxious and panicky .
These are unnecessary since the probability of getting the inherited disease given that a family member has the disease is relatively low .
This is because one might not get the mutated genes .
Hence , genetic testing results should not be known to the family members to protect them .
Lastly , letting third parties such as relatives know about the genetic testing results may post strains in family relationships .
Genetic testing creates tension within the family because the results can reveal information about other family members in addition to the person who is tested (What are the risks and limitations of genetic testing , 2009) .
This means that personal health information is known to everyone in the family tree including those relatives that one is not close to .
Hence , one might not feel secured to disclose their genetic testing results to their family members .
Admittedly , letting family members know about the genetic risk might cause families to be even more united and they will have a better understanding about their inherited genes .
However , this is only the minority .
Majority of the people are still discriminated by their family members as relatives would look at them from a different angle .
Hence , genetic testing results should not be known to the family members to prevent relationships from turning sour .
In conclusion , genetic testing results should not be made known to third parties such as family members .
Although many people may say that these results should be made known to family members to inform them about the chances of contracting the inherited disease , problems like invasion of privacy , protecting family members from troubling information as well as posting strains in family relationships still outweigh the benefits .
Hence , I disagree that a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives .
Genetic testing is a scientific process that studies changes in chromosomes , genes or proteins .
In order to confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder depends on the results of the genetic test .
As there are ethical , legal and social concerns with revealing the results of such testing , the decision lies in the carrier of the known genetic risk .
Thus , the individual should not be obligated to tell his relatives .
Firstly , one of the implications in revealing the results to our relatives is the threat of facing genetic discrimination when the information is leaked out (Norrgard , 2008) .
Employers and insurance companies may make use of the information about genetic tests while ignoring the issue of privacy and confidentiality .
For example , if an employer discovers that the chance that an employee is diagnosed with Huntington's disease is high , the employer may not retain the employee .
As a result , individuals may be discriminated against by employers or be denied needed and deserved insurance coverage .
This is extremely unfair to an individual by discriminating against his genetic predispositions because we cannot control our genes .
Hence , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform his relatives for fear of information being leaked out , which can lead to potential discrimination .
Secondly , an implication in revealing the results leads to the threat of eugenics (Devore , 1992) .
Childbearing decisions are based on genetic information , thus adding social or political pressure on people .
Reproduction is encouraged between those presumed to have inheritable desirable traits while those have genetic defects are discouraged to reproduce .
For example , if you discovered that you had inherited the Huntington's disease mutation , you would decide not to have children of your own so as not to risk passing the gene on to your children .
In addition , relatives may encourage women carrying foetuses with genetic abnormalities to go for abortion .
Thus , these women may develop feelings of guilt and depression and affect their well-being .
Therefore , the carrier should not be obligated to tell our relatives about the genetic risk .
Lastly , it is a violation of basic human rights when the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to inform his relatives (Jones , 2005) .
The individual has privacy right to decide if he wants others to know of his genetic condition .
For example , if the individual feels that he will be strongly stigmatized and marginalized or once his relatives know of his genetic condition , they will treat him differently or abandon him as he is "tarnished" by a deadly gene , he may not want his relatives to know of his genetic condition , for fear of information being circulated .
In other words , by making it an obligation to inform his relatives , it is an intrusion of his right to privacy .
On the other hand , critics argue that by revealing results of the carrier of known genetic risk to his relatives , this will benefit the relatives' health and well-being greatly .
Preventive measures can be taken before symptoms of the inherited disorder develop (Lee , 2005) .
However , this is based on the assumption that people are optimistic and they will undergo treatments upon knowing that the disorder is treatable .
But what about disorders for which no preventive measures or treatments are available ?
Most people will despair and are reluctant to undergo treatments .
Moreover , some people tend to worry too much about their genetic disorder and this may ultimately lead to depression .
After all , revealing the results to his relatives may not be useful .
In addition , some critics argue that revealing results to relatives will help them to make informed choices about their future .
For example , if the carrier of a known genetic risk has borne the burden of having a strong family history of genetic disorder for years may feel relieved when he receives a positive test result .
By revealing the results to his relatives , they no longer have to live with uncertainty about their future and their children's future .
In this way , they can plan for their future and for those couples who want to have children of their own may think twice (Lee , 2005) .
However , I beg to differ .
By revealing results to relatives , those with children may feel a sense of guilt as they are worried that they could have pass the genetic disorder to their children .
Thus , this adds stress to the relatives and is not beneficial by revealing the results .
In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives as this is an intrusion of privacy and they will be faced with the threats of genetic discrimination and eugenics .
By revealing the results , these implications greatly outweigh the benefit of improving health and well-being of others .
The individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing
Over recent years , genetic tests have grown in number , accuracy and availability .
They have been touted by many as the first step in the dawning of a new age of diagnostic and curative medicine , a step on the road to widespread and effective gene therapy for a large number of conditions (Victorian , 2009) .
It has also brought about some ethical and moral issues surrounding it .
Some people state that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
But actually , they have spoken too high of the human rationality .
Here , I disagree with these people and want to assert that individual should not have the right to reveal the result .
And my stand is based on two reasons: 1 .
Genetic testing would bring negative psychological effects to other people who may not want to know the results; 2 .The revealing of the results would cause discrimination and unfairness in the society .
As you can see , for disorders that are preventable or treatable , most people agree that genetic testing makes sense .
But for diseases with no preventative measures , would you want to know if you were affected or not ?
Many adult-onset genetic disorders are progressive and have long-term health consequences .
Thus , when a person is at risk for such a disorder , he or she may consider undergoing genetic testing .
When the consequences of the specific disorder in question are treatable , most people would agree that genetic testing makes sense .
But what about disorders for which no preventative measures or treatments are available ?
Just like the Huntington's Disease , there is currently no treatment for this disease , nor is there anything an affected person can do to prevent the inevitable onset of symptoms (Scitable , 2009) .
Once you got some negative information about your genes as regards to these kinds of incurable diseases , the only thing you can do is just wait to die .
During the rest of your life , you would really suffer a lot , not only physically , but also mentally .
You tend to be desperate about your life .
And you will be a buffer of both your family and the society .
Furthermore , once you know that you are a carrier of the negative genes , you tend to worry about your descendants .
There is a great chance that they are also carriers of these kinds of negative genes .
Then you would feel guilty about this and fall into a deep depression .
So individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing since it would cause serious psychological effect on people who do not want to know the results .
On a larger scale , the negative psychological effect brought by the genetic testing
would be the discrimination in the society .
This kind of discrimination mainly regards to the unfairness on insurance coverage and employment .
For the insurance companies , in order to avoid bankrupt , they would reduce or just cancel their coverage on the genetic problems .
For the employment institutions , in order to keep high efficiencies on the output , they would reject employees with genetic problems .
And for a normal society , that would be quite unfair .
Arguments proposed by people who stand up to the point that individuals deserve the right to stimulate the genetic info are faulty .
For instance , they might argue that people should have the right or the freedom to control their privacy such as the genetic testing results .
But as we can see , the freedom is not an absolute item .
If there is a great probability that freedom does harm to the society , it should definitely be banned .
Also people might argue that for disorders in genes that are preventable or treatable , it will be good for individuals to have access to their genetic info .
But these people put too much belief on the genetic technology .
In fact , most genetic problems are untreatable .
Once people get this kind of problems , the only thing they can do is wait to die .
Thirdly , people may also argue that , for a society , in order to obtain the optimal benefits , it has to reject people who get genetic problems .
But this will definitely arouse serious moral problems in the society , which would buffer the development of the society .
In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing since that would bring about serious problems , such as individual depression and social discrimination .
Genetic testing is a technology which screens and examines the genes of a person to check whether he has a specific genetic disorders or diseases which are not able to be detected using common medical procedures .
This technology is one of modern technologies and has many effects in human life .
Genetic testing gives information for people to know their health conditions but this testing raises concerns about the ethical and psychological issues whether an individual taking the genetic testing must reveal the result to third parties such as family , employers and friends because the result can be stressful .
However , I agree that one must not disclose the result because the result not only concerns the individual life but also his family .
First , the result affects the future of one family as the genetic disorder can be inherited to the next generation and in event that some members of the family have this genetic disorder too .
One has to reveal the result to one's family and spouse for them to know .
Therefore , the family can discuss and find the best solution for this matter .
After knowing the result , a couple should find ways to treat the disease before they are giving birth to a child because the child has big possibility to have the gene which is dangerous for the future of the child (Otto 2007) .
The parents can initially prepare the right treatment and provide proper diets for their infants .
Moreover , some of these genetic diseases are contagious and this endangers the whole family and the people around the one who has the disease .
In a worse case , if some members of a family have these genetic diseases , they should find solutions or treatments to cure them or at least prevent the disease to spread .
These cases assure one should reveal the result to one's family .
Third , the test result has great effect in one's career life and one is obliged to tell the employer about the result .
Many employers want to know the health condition of their workers because they do not want to have a disease spread over places in their offices and they want to ensure the safety of their workers .
By knowing that a worker has genetic disorder , the employer will provide the worker another job which has less contact with other workers or which has the most suitable environment condition for the worker .
For example , for a worker who has genetic disorder on his skins should not work in an area that has radiation .
Otto (2007) notes that many employers have obliged people to take genetic testing first before they are hired .
Some argue that a genetic elimination in choosing worker is discrimination because this is an action of limiting one's right to work (Andre and Velasquez 2009) .
However , the genetic testing is to ensure the safety of all workers .
The worker who has genes disease can be not ne hired but this for the life of people around him .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
Once a test has been conducted and the results are known , however , a new family related ethical dilemma is born: Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
Respond to the question above , supporting your argument with concrete examples .
By being able to make decisions to undergo genetic testing , individuals here refers to mature and thinking people .
Since genetic testing is to determine if a person has genetic disorder (Goh , 2003) , people usually undergo such test because they are at risk for a disorder .
Family medical history , onset of symptoms and an increasing number of people in the community being confirmed of it are the reasons that lead to an individual being deemed at risk .
In considering these three factors , I feel that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to reveal the results to his or her relatives .
Firstly , if the risk is due to family medical history such as haemophilia and Huntington's disease (NIH) , then by revealing it to relatives , more people will know that they could be at risk too .
Being aware of the likelihood of having of having such disorder , more people will seek for confirmation through testing as well .
Thus , when a carrier of a known genetic risk discloses the results with his or her relatives , more people will be able to take precautionary measures if tested positive .
Disorders like haemophilia and Huntington's disease are dangerous if attention is not paid to them .
Moreover , relatives will then know what is suitable for the carrier and provide appropriate care and concern .
Although many believe that admitting to a disorder will give rise to discrimination and strained relationship , they failed to consider that relatives appreciate the trust .
The return care and concern from them will further improve their kinship .
The second type of disorder is the multifactorial and polygenic disorder .
Genes inherited play a role in such a disorder too but lifestyle and the environment are influential factors as well (Richard , 2003) .
Heart diseases and diabetes are categorised under this type of disorder .
Again , disorders of such type puts lives at stake and therefore carriers should be obligated to convey the results of the genetic test to his relatives .
The last type of genetic disorder can be hereditary but ironically , it can also not be .
When the number of people in the community getting a similar disorder is increasing , a person can be at risk too .
The classic example of this kind of disorder is the sickle-cell anaemia .
It is a disorder whereby the red blood cells of the carrier change their shape from round to sickle shape (William , 2006) .
This is especially obvious in places where malaria is prevalent .
Their genes mutated to adapt to the environment better .
It was thought that such disorder is a response by the body to adapt to the environment because carrier will be immune to malaria .
However , sickle-cell anaemia causes shorter life expectancy and intermittent pain (William , 2006) .
If carriers are responsible and share their testing results , people can come together to weed out the problem by say eradicating malaria .
In this way , less people will suffer .
To conclude , we have seen that disclosure of test results to a carrier's relatives is outright compulsory .
This obligation will save lives and better the living environment and lifestyle of many people .
We should be responsible and with these values and beliefs , there is no dilemma because subjecting to discrimination and other social problems are insignificant when compared to matters of live and death and health of the general public .

Rapid development in genetic field has made genetic testing a potential method to be used in healthcare improvement .
Genetic testing is carried out mainly for diagnosis confirmation , prediction for heritable-disorder diseases and to identify carrier of disorder without physical symptom (National Human Genome Institute , 2008) .
Sharing of test positive result with relatives is necessary as it is the relatives' rights to know about it .
It also alerts them for early detection and treatment .
Indirectly , it could help in medical research development and make treatment for currently untreatable disease possible .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , genetic information could be extremely personal to an individual (Canadian Cystic Fibrosis foundation , 2000) .
Confidentiality of such information should be protected so that one's privacy could be respected .
However , genetic information comes in two kinds .
The first one is the mutation in a family while the latter is one's own genetic status .
(Skene , n .d .) .
It is alright for not sharing own's genetic status but sharing of mutation in family with blood relatives is essential as it affects the blood relatives as well .
He or she has the rights to know about it .
Moreover , best clinical practice required family history to assess the usefulness of genetic testing (Parker and Lucassen , n .d .) .
Hence , there is no reason why one could benefit from the family history but omitted the relatives' rights to have such benefits as well .
Genetic discrimination by health insurers and employers could be one of the main hinders that stop people from sharing their genetic information with blood relatives (National Human Genome Institute , 2008) .
This could be protected once President Bush had signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (The white House , 2008) .

Lastly , revealing the positive test result might increase the number of people going for genetic testing .
This indirectly increase the possibility of people signing consent to take part in the research for the genetic related disease .
With such , improved or new treatment is possible for genetic related diseases and could possibly benefit the carrier or even the family members .
In conclusion , revealing of genetic information to the relatives did not seem to be of great disadvantages to an individual but could be of great advantages to the blood relatives .
Besides the rights to know , most importantly is the possibility of early detection and treatment for the blood relatives .
Development of new treatment for currently untreatable diseases is also possible .
Therefore a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .

Genetic testing is not a new term in this modern era .
People can predict the probability of developing some genetic diseases with this technological advancement .
({http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting}[HYPERLINK: http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting])This is undoubtedly contribute to the prevention of treatable diseases .
However , it would appear that patients are not the only people who are interested in the outcome of the testing .
Many third parties also show a great interest in the result especially the patient's family members .
Family members have to know the result so that they can receive early treatment and have early financial and psychological preparation .
Thus , I strongly agree that a carrier of a known disease risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Firstly , the patients are obligated to tell their relatives about the result as the result will invariably affect them to some extent .
For example , if the result showed that the patient is a carrier of a genetic disease , there is a great possibility that the family members are also have the same disease .
So it is crucial to let the family members know the results so that they can receive treatment earlier .
Permanent and irreversible damages can be prevented if treatment or therapy is initiated in the early stage of the disease .
(http://www .ndsu .nodak .edu/instruct/m cclean/plsc431/students98/saha .htm)Patients would sometimes choose not to reveal the result to avoid discrimination among family members .
However , saving the family members lives is more important if compare to self-esteem .
Secondly , patients are responsible to tell their relatives especially the family members about the outcome of genetic test so that they can have early financial and psychological preparations .
Treatments for diseases are always costly .
Family members have to plan their budget earlier so that they can afford to take on the treatments fee .
Besides that , it is also important for the relatives to have psychological preparation earlier so that they are managed handle their stresses during the period of treatments .
(http://www3 .inter {science .wiley .com/journal/112684945/abstract ?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0}[HYPERLINK: http://www3 .interscience .wiley .com/journal/112684945/abstract ?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0]) Patients refuse to disclose the result as they thought they can prevent their relatives from sadness .
It is true that relatives are often in deep grief when knowing one of their relative is suffering from illness .
However , early notification can let them have enough time to have psychological preparation so that they would not feel so unprepared or unready when the patients' condition get worsen .
In conclusion , the patients should obligated to inform their relatives about genetic testing results to enable them to receive early treatment and have early financial and psychological preparation .
Genetic testing , by definition , may be done for various reasons , including the diagnosis of a genetic disease in an individual , the identification of future disease risks to individual , unborn children or the prediction of drug responses (MedicineNet , 2002) .
Conditions such as cystic fibrosis , heart disease , Down's syndrome and epilepsy are strongly influenced by genes (Hunt & Odle , 2004) .
Due to the possibility that it may occur or recur in various family members and relatives , an ethical dilemma as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk has the obligation to tell his or her relatives arises .
In order to make an informed socially responsible decision , an individual should examine both sides of this controversy according to his or her context by weighing both the positive and negative economic , social and psychological impacts it may bring about .
Ideally , owing to the beneficial impacts , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives when the risk is familial , significantly critical , and when options are available to prevent harm .
A carrier of a known genetic risk has an ethical duty to warn his or her relatives .
According to Alford (1999) , some genetic conditions may go unnoticed while others may be devitalising .
Some genetic diseases are congenital and others may not be manifest until later in life .
Some genetic diseases can be affected by diet and environment .
Advancements in genetic science have resulted in new discoveries in diagnosing , treating or preventing diseases (Shaw , 1995) .
Prevention is always better than cure .
In general , if at risk relatives can anticipate the disease , measures may be taken to prevent the diseases .
For instance , relatives with genetic obesity may choose to undergo lifestyle changes such as opting for calorie restriction diet and regular exercise .
Furthermore , the ability to predict familial diseases such as a certain type of cancer at a young age may allow for possible successful treatment or cure , extension of life expectancy and improvement in quality of life .
In this way , the sharing of information improves the welfare of mankind .

Moreover , having learnt about a personal genetic risk , it is thought by some theorists , for example , Wilson (2000) , Baker , Schuette and Uhlmann (1998) that the approach to deal with results of genetic testing involves not only medical , surgical and educational intervention , but also provision of social and emotional support , hence a carrier of known genetic risk should tell his or her close relatives about it .
Some may argue that there should be no obligations to tell a relative about one's condition as a genetic condition is not contagious like some viral or bacterial infections (Hubbard & Wald , 1999) .
Consequently , some may think that informing relatives about their conditions is not necessary and thus are not in favour of the idea .
However , genetic diseases may impact every phase of the human life cycle (Alford , 1999) .
Even though there may be an initial delay in acceptance , and unnecessary worry , eventual acceptance by family , friends and relatives often corresponds to ongoing effective and supportive encouragement and motivation which may have beneficial impacts on their health .
A carrier of a known genetic risk who takes an active approach in informing his or her relatives is in fact showing respect for the relative's autonomy .
Choosing not to inform one's relatives is in fact interfering with the patient's right and opportunity to consider the problem , select diagnostic and management options .
Studies have shown that the primary reason accounting for the unwillingness to communicate genetic test results to a relative is that the relative's opinion , attitude and reaction is unknown (Barsevick , Montgomery , Ruth , Ross , Egleston , Bingler , Malick , Miller , Cescon , & Daly , 2008) .
In addition , the opinion of World Health Organization (2009) is that choosing not to inform is a well-intentioned decision which do not to add extra problems and unduly distress to others .
However , these arguments put forth in support of not informing the relative are faulty .
By not informing about the risks his or her relative may face , the tendency of the carrier to shift from beneficence to paternalism has in fact taken away the ability of the relative to choose for herself (Kultgen , 1995) .
For example , some genetic diseases such as "Al antitrypsin deficiency" undeniably involve the family (Torgny & Wilcke , 1998) .
As Torgny and Wilcke states , information can allow a relative who has considerably increased risk of a disease from smoking to make her own decisions about smoking and take precautions when deciding on a career which are needful to have a positive impact on her future .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives as communication of genetic test results can bring about improved management and well-being of carriers and their families , resolution of concerns , possible reduction in disease occurrence , as well as effective prevention , treatments and even cures .
In general , the benefits of knowing the potential risk far outweigh the adverse consequences of not knowing .
Therefore , sharing of information between relatives should be encouraged .

Genetic testing has been made possible with the advances of technology in the medical field .
It has increased in numbers , capabilities and preciseness over the recent years (Goh , 2005) .
Potential individuals who are at risk of developing a genetic disorder or disease normally undergo for genetic testing .
Genetic testing may uncover the underlying mutation in genes which causes the genetic disorder .
Thus , genetic testing can be beneficial to affected patients and their relatives .
It helps in early detection of genetic disorders that are inherited in families and family planning .
Genetic testing has also resulted in the rise of privacy , confidentiality and ethical issues in our society despite the benefits gained (Young & Leonard , 1999) .
However , it has been known that genetic testing may detect mutation in genes and hence , genetic counselling can be given to relatives of affected patients .
Therefore , affected individuals should let their relatives know about their genetic testing results .
One of the reasons why affected individuals should let their relatives know about their genetic disorders is for early detection purposes (Goh , 2005) .
An early detection of genetic disorders can be obtained by genetic testing in order for further and early treatments to be conducted .
For example , genetic testing enables patients and their relatives who are at risk of developing genetic disorders but show no symptoms at the beginning , to predict the chances of them inheriting the genetic disorders (Goh , 2005) .
The predisposition of the relatives of affected patients towards the genetic disorders can also be predicted .
When a genetic disorder that runs through a certain family is known , the extent of the genetic disorder can be obtained (Goh , 2005) .
Genetic information is not confined to one person but it could be related to more than one person such as tested patients' relatives .
This enables healthcare professionals to know the extent of the genetic mutation in the genes and hence , provide advice or genetic counselling to patients and their relatives .
However , this has also resulted in a raise of privacy and confidentiality concerns .
The revelation of genetically tested patients' results may lead to discrimination by society (Mehlman , 1999) .
There is no guarantee that relatives of genetically tested patients will keep the genetic results information to themselves .
This information can be spread verbally , be it accidental or intentional without the consent of the tested patient .
However , there are laws that protect genetically patients from genetic discrimination by society that have been imposed (Bombard , 2007) .
These laws have been implemented in the United States and many other countries (Bombard , 2007) .
Genetic discrimination can be reduced with the existing of these laws as legal actions can be taken against those who discriminate .
Hence , genetic testing results should be revealed to family members for early detection purposes .
Besides that , relatives of genetically tested patients should know about their genetic testing results so that a proper family planning (Anonymous , 1999) .
Family planning is essential as it serves as a platform to briefly set up a guideline for future purposes .
This might enable individuals and their families to decide on how they would like their lifestyle to be and set fertility judgements (Anonymous , 1999) .
For example , pregnant women have the option of deciding on whether to go for prenatal examinations or not to see if their new-borns would suffer from any genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease and Down's Syndrome .
This may prevent the future generation from inheriting the mutated genes or become carriers of the genetic disorders .
Ethical issues have been raised despite this advantage .
This is because no one has the rights to give his or her consent regarding the decision on whether to undergo for the prenatal examinations or not (Anonymous , 1999) .
Embryos , foetuses and new-borns do not hold the responsibility in making this decision and they are unable to make it by themselves .
This leaves the decision into their parents' hands .
However , medical advances have made in-vitro fertilisation possible nowadays .
If an embryo has a mutated gene after undergoing in-vitro fertilisation , this embryo can be discarded before being implanted in the uterus (Anonymous , 1999) .
This may prevent the diseases from being passed down to the future generation .
The risk of the future generation in inheriting genetic diseases can also be reduced .
Thus , revelations of genetic testing results to family members are essential in family planning .
In conclusion , we can see that genetically tested results revealed by patients to their family members do bring advantages .
It can help in early detection and family planning .
Besides that , moral support and encouragement which are vital can be gained from family members .
This is important as genetically tested patients may have emotional and psychological problems as a consequence of undergoing genetic testing .
These problems may not be cured by taking medications .
Therefore , family members play a very important role in supporting them .

In today's medical world , many health concerns raised by people have been taken care of by the perpetual advancement in technology .
One of the innumerable concerns is genetic disorder , which is an illness caused by abnormalities in genes or chromosomes .
This concern brought about the inauguration of genetic testing a medical test to determine if a particular disease is stimulated by the abnormality .
An issue raised here is that one's decision to reveal the test results to one's relatives has chained to even more concerns .
Revealing the results could assist one's relatives in preparing for constructive life changes and allow researchers to find a cure for a particular genetic disorder .
Admittedly , it could result in negative social consequences .
Nevertheless , revealing the test results benefits more people than hiding it .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , the revelation of a known genetic risk to one's relatives allows them to prepare for constructive changes in their lives .
One such change would be to make new decisions for family planning .
Due to the lack of treatment strategies of some genetic disorders , a carrier might have a short lifespan .
Therefore , it is both essential to plan for an early retirement or to start a family .
A carrier could devise a financial plan so that one would have sufficient monetary resources to support oneself even after an early retirement .
One main objection to starting a family is that the affected genes or chromosomes might be passed on to the children .
This , however , can be prevented using an expensive technology , Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) such as pre-implantation of genetic diagnosis whereby "only unaffected embryos are allowed to develop to term" (Norrgard , 2008) .
Thus , a carrier could still start a family without passing the genetic disorder to the children .
Furthermore , this could lead to another constructive change for the carrier's relatives .
For relatives who are planning to have children , they must either be financially prepared for ART as well as the future medical bills , or choose not to have children .
As for those who already have children , they must also be financially prepared .
On top of that , they would have to choose the right time to convey to their children that they might be carriers of a certain genetic disorder .
These changes and preparations cannot be achieved overnight , and therefore , revealing a known genetic risk to one's relatives is necessary .
Secondly , by divulging one's genetic risk to one's relatives , the chances of researchers finding a cure for that risk would be higher .
As genetic disorders only happen to a minority , there would not be many encounters and so the chances of a researcher being able to inquire into these disorders would be considerably low .
This was further lowered by opponents who are against the revelation of genetic results due to intrusion of privacy .
However , it did not occur to them that the revelation of results could increase the chances of medical researchers finding a remedy to the disorders .
Moreover , there would be a possibility that a known genetic risk could be brought to an end and subsequent generations would not have to suffer .
Therefore , only when one tells a known genetic risk to one's relatives , would there be a chance for medical researchers to find a cure for it , and eventually saving many lives from genetic disorders .
One main concern about the revelation of genetic risk to one's relatives is the negative social consequences .
When an employee is diagnosed to have certain genetic disorders , the employer may not want to retain the employee .
This is because the carrier would have to follow up on their medical appointments and as a result , the efficiency and productivity of the company would be adversely affected .
Furthermore , due to the need for regular health checkup , the carrier would not be allowed to purchase insurance as the insurance company would be footing the carrier's medical bills .
However , these acts of genetic discrimination could be prevented by a law called the Privacy Rule , which is enforced by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in April 2003 (Norrgard , 2008) .
This rule helps to keep individual's medical information confidential .
Therefore , whether one has genetic disorders or not , one would not have to face the negative social consequences .
Hence , a carrier can have a peace mind revealing genetic test results to one's relatives .
In conclusion , the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to reveal the results to one's relatives could assist them in adapting to changes in their lives and allow researchers to find a cure for a particular genetic disorder .
Furthermore , the negative social consequences faced by the carrier have been minimized by law .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing has developed enough and it is getting popular nowadays all around the world .
Genetic testing is actually the genetic diagnosis of inheritable diseases which caused by an abnormality in an individual's genome .
For instance Huntington's disease is caused by X- linked disorder , Cystic fibrosis is caused by autosomal recessive disorder and some common disease such as coronary heart disease , diabetes are caused polygenic mutation (Holland ,S , 2003) .
In addition , this testing also can be used to determine a child's biological father or a person's ancestry .
Examples of genetic tests are newborn screening , diagnostic testing , carrier testing , prenatal testing and few more .
Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems , carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the results to their relatives .
Firstly , it is important to reveal the result if a couple is planning to get married and one of them has any inheritable diseases .
This is because they have high possibilities of passing on mutated gene to their children .
Even though some are healthy carriers and not affected by the diseases fully because of the single copy of the dominant genotype , they have 50% chance of passing the recessive gene to their generation .
If a person did not disclose the result , a child with genetic disabilities may born and then lead to problems in the family .
For example , the partner may feel betrayed and end the relationship for concealing the truth .
Here the family relation will be affected and who is going to share responsibility of taking care of the poor child ?
The child will be left out and will be in an unpleasant atmosphere .
On the other hand , if the partner knows about this person's genetic condition earlier , they will plan well before getting married since they are in love and care about each other .
They may opt to adopt a child rather than giving birth to a genetically impaired child .
Hence , it is advisable to disclose the genetic testing result in order to prevent risks of diseases to future generation .
The second case is where the couple finding about their genetic condition after their marriage .
It will lead mental trauma and extreme depression if they hide the genetic testing result from their spouse .
Every day he has to face his spouse with guilty face and suffer in silence .
When the spouse gets to know about his health condition , it will be too late and will end the relationship since sincerity will be a big question .
In even extreme cases , if the child is born , it will be burden for them to take care of him .
Then the child's life will be greatly affected .
In contrast , they still can be happy with adopted children if the result is known .
Proponents of this claim argue that , disclosure of such results will destroy the dream of having own family .
However , it is not ethical to pass on their defective genes to their offspring in order to fulfill the dream of having own family .
Who will take care of the child when they are not around ?
If they are someone to take care , will they do it sincerely ?
Therefore , the carrier of a known genetic disease should be forced to reveal the result to his spouse since loyalty and sincerity are the basic factors that holding a marriage tightly and the relationship can be maintained .
Finally , the third case is about the couple knowing about the genetic disorder after having children .
They should tell about their health condition to prevent their future offspring to have defective genes .
Since this genetic testing begins with an affected family member , it provides the best opportunity to identify relative who may be at risk for a life- threatening condition .
Thus they will be undergo testing and treatment for that specific disease as soon as possible .
Critics of this position may argue that disclosure brings with it the potential for loss of privacy .
Is privacy is more important the health condition and welfare of your spouse and children ?
It is so obvious that , they did not realize that the health condition of the beloved family members is far more important rather than concerning about the intrusion of privacy .
Hence , carrier of genetic disease must be obligated to tell the genetic testing result since the welfare of family members can be improved .
In conclusion , a carrier of genetic disorder must be obligated to reveal the genetic testing results to his relatives .
By doing so , genetic risks to future generation can be prevented , family relation can be maintained and at-risk relatives with abnormalities can begin treatment for their genetic disorders .
If an individual is failed to do so , family relation may comes to an end and undergoes mental trauma and depression .
Humans have always wanted to be the perfect being on top of nature's hierarchy .
We also desire to have the ability to predict our own well-being .
Presently , with advances in medical technology , we are able to predict what is happening to our own body .
The procedure called genetic testing .
Genetic testing is the testing of the human genes to know whether there are mutations or defects in the genes (Genetic Research and Genetic Testing , 2005) .
With this technology , we can detect the problem within ourselves early and tackle it .
The issue is that after an individual undergo genetic testing and unfortunately found out that there are problems within him or herself , is the individual obligated to tell his or her family members ?
With the information that the individual acquired through genetic testing , he or she can share with the family members so that they can tackle the problems head on .
They can prepare themselves for medical problems that they may have and make informed choices on the course of action .
Hence a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , a carrier should inform his or her family as this will prepare the family for the possible outcome of them having the mutated genes .
This is a good move as the family now can prepare themselves to undergo the same genetic testing to know the possibility of them carrying the mutated or defective genes same as the carrier .
The genetic testing is just a mean to know whether someone has the disease but it does not mean they will acquire the disease hundred percent (Goh , L . , M . , D . , 2005) .
This only serves as a predictive mean .
On the other hand , the other family members can also know what are the other underlying problems that they may encounter in the future as the genetic testing will not only detect the carrier's risk genes but also other problems that he or she may have in the future .
With these ease in information acquired it will help the family members to prepare and face the potential problems in the future .
Secondly , a carrier should inform his or her family as the family members have the ability to make an informed choice for their actions towards the problem .
If the carrier has a possibility of having heart disease , the rest of the family members may take steps to counter that predictive disease (Genetic Research and Genetic Testing , 2005) .
The family members can alter their activities and eating habits in order to combat having heart disease .
However the risk genes carrier may argue that to tell the information to his or her family member is a violation towards his or her autonomy .
This is private information that need not be shared with everyone .
This information may cause hysteric reaction in the community explain more .
Other than that the risk genes carriers may be discriminated (Ostrom , M . , C . , 1997) .
With these concerns in mind , the individual may not agree to tell the family members the information they acquired through genetic testing .
But by withholding the information , the risk genes carrier is doing harm to not only himself but to his or her family members .
Without telling the family members , the individual might be suffering in silence and no support are given by the family members .
On the other hand if the risk genes carrier never informs the family members , the family members may suffer the same fate and this in turn will have a domino effect on the family lineage .
Therefore the to be obliged to tell the family members is act of beneficence as the risk gene carrier is doing good in informing the family of the possible medical problems that they may face .
In conclusion , it is very important for the risk genes carrier to inform the family members as he or she may help the family members to avoid huge medical problems which may be avoided if only he or she inform them .
Therefore the risk gene carrier should be obliged to tell the family members if he or she has genetic risk within them .
As science and technology progressed , we could now detect the presence of any genetic disorder in individual through genetic testing .
The purpose of genetic testing is to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins which are associated with inherited disorders .
However , one biggest problem that arises is whether the individual , who had undergone the genetic test , be obligated to inform his family members/relatives the results .
I believe that the individual is obligated to tell his family members/relatives the test result as it is ethical for the individual to inform them and they can seek early medical assistance if needed .
The psychological and emotional issues like feeling guilty and anxiety that arises from this issue can be minimized by going for counseling .
Firstly , family members/relatives deserve a right to know what kind of genetic disorder they might have inherited from the individual or running in their family line .
Thus , it is ethical for the individual to inform them .
This is important for parents who are doing family planning , as it help them to know whether an unborn child will have a genetic condition .
In this example , a pregnant relative seeking genetic counseling and his geneticist requires information about the individual in order to give her the most accurate information whether her new-born has any risk of genetic disorder .
If the individual declined her request as he wished that the information about his genetic status to be confidential , her new-born could be in high risk of getting the genetic disorder (Elizabeth A . V . , Amy C .S . , 2008 , Nov 07) .
Secondly , acquisition of genetic information of carrier by his/her relatives can help reduce the possibility of getting the disease .
For example , the genetic disorder is colon cancer; they can seek out for medical advices and treatment while it is at early stage .
If the disease has not developed , steps like making changes to their health habits can be taken which might lower their chance of getting the disease (National Human Genome Research Institute , 2009 , Aug 14) .
Thus , this information can help them in making informed choices about their future .
Critics have also raised the psychological and emotional issues that the individual and his relatives may experience after he tells them the genetic test result .
His relatives might blame him for 'passing' the genetic disorder to them , causing the individual to feel guilty .
However , being the carrier , he too is a victim of this genetic disorder which was probably passed down from his parents .
In addition , his relatives will understand better by going for counseling that everyone carries gene mutations that can lead to disease , and no one has control over what they pass on to their children (Elizabeth A . V . , Amy C .S . , 2008 , Nov 07) .
Relatives of the individual will also face a great deal of anxiety that they may have the genetic disorder .
However , they can choose not to be told of the test result in the first place or go for a genetic testing to confirm whether they have the genetic disorder .
If the genetic test result shows that the genetic disorder is not present in them , it can provide them a sense of relief .
Furthermore , they could also undergo counseling to help them manage their emotions better (Genetic Interest Group , 1998) .
In conclusion , I believe that the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his relatives .
It is ethnically right for the individual to inform his relatives and the relatives after knowing that they may have the genetic disorder can seek out medical assistances to reduce the occurrence/severity of the disease .
The psychological and emotional issues can be minimized by going for counseling as they will understand the genetic disorder and manage their emotions better .
Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
Genetic testing is a scientific method that is used to determine a person's chance of developing an inherited disease .
Every person carries copies of genes that were passed down from their parents .
There is a high chance for a genetic disease carrier to pass down defected genes to the next generation .
The defected genes may or may not develop into a disease .
A defected genes carrier can only determine whether he or she have a genetic disease by running a genetic test .
Since genetic disease runs in the family , a genetic disease carrier's family members and relatives will have high chance of developing the same inherited disease .
There is a higher chance of curing a genetic disease if it is detected early .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should warn their family members and relatives about the genetic risk .
Some of the genetic diseases could be cured if it is detected early .
Research by Kloosterman (2009) , shows that common antibiotic treatment has the ability to cure genetic diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis , a type of genetic lung disease .
From the Georgina Advocate news (2007) , "Emily Gough , who died last year of Cystic Fibrosis , was seen with her father , Glenn , and sister , Jessica , who is now battling the same disease" .
In this article , the Gough family is battling against a genetic lung disease .
(Slykhuis , 2007) Unfortunately , Emily Gough and her father died because they did not detect the disease early enough to cure it .
Such tragic incident will re-occur if a carrier of a known genetic risk were to hide his or her condition from his or her family members and relatives .
Proper plans for the future could be made if a carrier knows in advance that he or she has a genetic disease .
Oregon National Primate Research Center successfully came up with a technique that could stop future generations from inheriting genetic diseases from their parents .
(Henderson , 2009) If a carrier of a genetic risk were to hide his or her condition , the genetic disease will continue to run in the family line , passing down to future generations .
Proper financial plans could be made if a person were to know early if he or she has a genetic disease and avoid impending financial crisis if he or she is able borrow money or apply for financial help earlier .
A possible excuse people choose to hide their affliction is because they are afraid of the discrimination they would face from their family members and relatives .
After all , the burden of carrying a genetic disease is not something that one would want to make known to others .
Perhaps a better reason for people to keep the problem to themselves is because they are not aware that genetic diseases are not isolated to just themselves .
This is a case of ignorance in which is not at all bliss .
There is no good reason for a genetic disease carrier to hide his or her condition from his or her family members or relatives if the person is aware of the implication of the genetic disorder .
This is a question of morality .
A person who understands his role and responsibility as part of a family would not want to see his future generation be it his own , or his immediate families' to suffer from genetic diseases that could otherwise have been prevented if he had discussed his condition .
The reasons to inform out weigh the reasons not to , hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing
First of all , one's private life is a main perspective of protecting human rights .
According to the definition of private life provided by the European Convention on Human Rights , it "includes the right to be protected from the unwanted publication or disclosure of intimate personal information" CITATION Eth06 \l 1033 ( Ethics in genetic research and practice , 2006) .
As mentioned before , the experiment unit oneself is the most influenced one by this genetic testing , so he or she should decide whether to tell anyone else or merely conceal from others .
Imagine that the top-secret information is released regardless of how the individual feels .
The rule of protecting human rights is violated .
Thus the individual should have the final say .
Secondly , the result might be misused against the individual if the choice is left to other sides .
Once the information that a normal employee is likely to be diagnosed with some rare gene-related diseases , the employer might be reluctant to keep the hiring relationship because he has to consider the duration of the employee's commitment may be disturbed by sudden illnesses .
Possible breakups might take place before marriage simply due to the fiance's comparatively higher chance to pass the so-called "bad" gene to the next generation .
Hence it is decided by the individual who takes the genetic testing how to deal with the result .
Opponents may address the equal human rights of the individual's family .
It cannot be denied that they also have the right to know if their genes also possess lurking variables that can cause diseases .
This topic is discussing whether the individual has the final say , instead of whether the individual can hide the truth from others .
A normal person will probably choose the best solution for his or her family .
The cases of concealing caused by selfishness can be decreased by improving the education of moral values .
If the decision is leaved to others , the chance of perfect equality is also questionable .
What is more , people may be reluctant to undergo testing for that they cannot decide by their own .
Then the purpose of this advanced technology cannot be realized .
To conclude , the individual requesting human rights should have the final say in whether to say the result or not , considering protected human rights .

Genetics plays the role in every disease .
Genetic testing informs individuals and family of their genetic status; this knowledge may enable them to take adaptive measures against a genetic disease (Jacobs & Deatrick , 1999) , if the disease is treatable .
One is morally obligated to inform the relatives of the genetic test results since family members generally inherit the same set of genetic codes from their parents .
Firstly , informing relatives allows them to take preventive measures against diseases .
Having the same parents can mean that certain disease can run within the family and they are morally obligated to warn their relatives of the possible hazards that may trigger disease , For example , to prevent relatives from eating fava beans when one is detected to have G6PD deficiency .
One can even educate relatives of the preventive measures of certain diseases .
For example , to educate relatives to eat less fatty meals when their genes predispose too weak blood vessels integrity that are prone to rupture .
However , some argued that genetic testing can potentially unravel family secrets; namely adoptions and illegitimate child (Doukas & Berg , 2001) .
But such issues can be solved since we can select results to be in terms of potential disease , instead of paternity testing .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives for the betterment of the relatives to take preventive measures and also be equipped with related knowledge to save their own lives .
The advent of genetic testing has created a scientific breakthrough in identifying risk factors for disease .
The increasing awareness of the usefulness of genetic testing has prompted many to undergo such testing .
However , genetic testing result may not only concern the tested individual themselves but also their family members as they share the same genetic make-up and are equally at risk of contracting a certain disease (Genetic testing helps cancer survivors fight for their loved ones , 2007) .
This has sparked many debates on the obligation of an individual to share the test result with genetic relatives .
While the common consensus is that every individual should have the final decision on whether to reveal the result to others , a decision made not to reveal the result to relatives may have it consequences .
In addition , withholding the result may also have a negative effect on the individual psychologically .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , individual who have undergone genetic testing , should be obligated inform his or her relatives of the genetic testing result as they may also be equally at risk .
By informing relatives of the result , they are able make necessary lifestyle and dietary changes in order to reduce the risk of getting the disease (Genetic testing helps cancer survivors fight for their loved ones , 2007) .
This also allows family members to step up their preventive measures against the diseases by undergoing regular medical screening .
Furthermore , they can be subjected to early treatment should they get diagnosed with the disease (Babowice , 2008) .
Such early treatment will greatly increase the prospects of recovery as it will prevent the disease from developing further and causing more complication .
Some may argue that it is the individual's right as to whether to reveal the result to others as the genetic test result belongs to him or her .
Therefore , they should have the final say as to whether to share it with others and should not be obligated to do so .
However , the reticence of one's genetic test result would mean that family members are unaware of the possible danger to their health .
Furthermore , it may be too late to be treated should the disease be discovered at a later stage .
Thus , the possibility of preventing harm to others should never be jeopardised over one's privacy .
A research conducted by the United States' National Institute of Health , has shown that 98% of the respondents share their test results with their family members and 82 .2% of them did that to inform them of their medical risk (Stoffel , Ford , Mercado , Punglia , Kohlmann , Conrad , Blanco , Shannon , Powell , Gruber , Terdiman , Chung , Syngal , 2008) .
This research result is a testimony that majority of those who went for genetic testing acknowledge that by sharing their genetic result with their family members , something can be done to reduce the risk of contracting a disease .
Another reason as to why an individual should be obligated to inform the genetic test result to his or her relatives is so that they may be able to receive emotional support from the family (Newstaff , 2009) .
Many a time , a tested individual chose not to share such result with their loved one so as not to add unnecessary distress and anxiety to them .
However , bottling up their feeling will only aggravate their problem as it will have an adverse psychological effect on them .
By sharing such information with family members , individuals may share their problems and worries with them .
On top of that , they may lighten the burden off their shoulder .
According to a research conducted by Georgetown University Medical Centre , those who disclosed their genetic test results to their family members are much contented with their decision than those who did not (Newstaff , 2009) .
Many have also shared their views that informing the test result to their family members had led to a better communication relationship .
Critics argue that genetic testing result is not fully accurate and by informing relatives regarding the result , it will impose unnecessary psychological burden to the family .
This may result in family members responding negatively to the news and thus , straining the ties between the tested individual and his or her family members .
Therefore , contrary to gaining emotional support from family members , individual may instead be subjected to further psychological damage .
As this may be true , the argument is not entirely valid .
Research conducted by Angela Bradbury , an oncologist at Chase Fox , has shown that such worries are uncalled for (Newstaff , 2009) .
Only a small portion of the respondents have reported to receive negative responses from their family members .
Many have given feedback that their relatives have handled the news well and have taken a pragmatic approach to the situation .
Counseling will also be provided by physicians not only to the individual but also his or her family members (Stoffel et al . , 2008) .
This will make it easier for family members to come to term with the situation and to handle it appropriately .
Critics also fail to acknowledge that it is part of the "social responsibility" on the part of the tested individual to inform genetic relatives of a hereditary condition and the sharing of financial , emotional and psychological burdens among family members .
It is undeniable that an individual have the final say as to whether to reveal his or her genetic test result .
However , one should always remember that choosing not to do so will only further implicate more problems to oneself as well as to others .
Disclosure of such information to relatives will instead bring about many benefits .
Thus , carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
The new millennium brought about promising medical advancements that have positive impacts on human's lives .
Remarkable breakthroughs , particularly in the field of genetics , allow humans to better understand the cause of diseases , so as to formulate cure or preventive drugs that can be tailored to individual idiosyncrasies .
This is made possible through a series of genetic tests on an individual .
Genetic testing is the detection of abnormalities in the human genomes , to indentify presence of genetic disorder and to assess the possible risk of developing genetic disorder in the future .
Some examples of such genetic disorders include single gene defects , multifactorial problems and teratogenic problems (Weill Medical College of Cornell University 2003) .
Though the benefits of genetic testing are numerous , individuals are forced to face an ethical dilemma of whether they are obligated to reveal the results to their relatives .
In my opinion , I believe that individuals should be obligated to reveal such information to their relatives .
Proponents who felt that individuals should be obligated to reveal genetic test results asserted that these individuals will have a more open communication relationship with their families .
This is coherent to a study done by Gerogetown university medical center on mothers who shared their cancer genetic test results with children .
The research findings shows that mothers who chose to disclose the results are generally satisfied with their decision because they are able to receive the necessary support and understanding from families (Karen 2009) .
Individuals are able to reduce the huge mental burden imposed on them by sharing it with families , which in certain cases can be overwhelming .
This can lead to better mental health and well-being of the individuals .
Though families will be distraught by the results , accepting the fact and supporting each other in the course might lead to a stronger relationship within the family .
Moreover , disclosing the results to their immediate families will better prepare them for any unforeseen circumstances , financially and mentally .
Thus the revealing of genetic results can reduce the mental burden of an individual and bring about better communication and understanding with his or her relatives .
Another point that supports the need of revealing such results to the individual's relatives is to allow early detection of inheritable diseases that his or her relatives might be prone to .
The cancer of the large intestine , which is an inherited disorder , has subtle early stage symptoms that can progress almost undetected till the terminal stages .
When individuals chose to reveal such information to their relatives , relatives will be able to undergo aggressive and constant monitoring of the colon growth which can prevent the disease into becoming fatal (Burt and Jasperson 2008) .
Such early prevention and cure to fatal diseases are only possible if relatives are notified beforehand , and that responsibility lies on the individual who underwent genetic testing .
Such information will also allow family members and relatives to make more fully informed choices regarding their future , including decisions on marriage and career , as well as lifestyle habits .
Thus individual of known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal test results to relatives because it brings awareness concerning the risk of inheriting the disease to the foreground , not only to the person tested , but for his or her relatives as well .
Arguments brought forward by opponents claimed that the personal rights of the individual are being violated .
This is a bias claim because it failed to consider at-risk relatives' rights to know about the test results .
Relatives have the rights to be informed of the results because they are prone to inheriting the same disease or disorder which can be fatal if discovered too late .
When individuals chose not to reveal the results , it is mainly because of the following reasons: the fear of discrimination , fear of being a burden to the family or not wanting to worry their families .
This is a selfish thinking and is an illogical way of avoiding the problem .
The failure of disclosure of genetics test results frequently cause relatives to be enraged and upset , and this had lead to numerous lawsuits against the genetics provider , as they felt that it should be these genetic providers' responsibilities to inform them , but in fact is the responsibility of the person being tested (Falk , J . M , Dugan , B . R . & O'Riordan , A . M . 2002) .
Thus detrimental effects on both parties can be seen due to the failure of disclosing genetic test results to relatives .
In conclusion , individuals should be obligated to reveal such information to their relatives because it is a personal responsibility , and can lead to improvement of their well-being .
Moreover , relatives should also be informed about the potential dangers of inheriting such disorders so that they are able to make choices and decisions that can change their future for the better .
Through technological advancement and intense scientific research , genetics strives to be one of the most lucrative and beneficial medical sectors .
Through genetic testing , an individual would be able to detect if there are any genetic imperfections and disorders .
It also provides an insight to the chances of developing terminal illnesses .
Such genetic risks have a high percentage chance of appearing in the family thus the question lies if the information be revealed by the carrier to his or her relatives for the bigger picture , or to be kept to him or herself .
The carrier of a known genetic risk should to tell his or her relatives to inform them of the health implications , to gain emotional support and to adhere to the ethical and legal obligations .
Firstly , the carrier should inform his or her relatives of the health implications that the genetic test results would affect them .
Most genetic disorders have a high percentage possibility of inheritance and also due to genetic similarities , appear in family members .
Thus family members should be informed so that precautionary measures could be taken by them to prepare for the possibility of the illness in the future .
The relatives could go for regular monitoring of their health conditions .
Furthermore , relatives could go for their own testing to ascertain their chances to the genetic disorder as an individual .
With the testing the relatives could make adjustments to their lifestyle to lower the risk and also to prepare case of ever developing the illness (Sturm , Varga 2008) .
It can be argued that the carrier might be causing unnecessary worrying to his or her relatives as the accuracy of genetic test results varies and also dependent on various factors (Goh , 2003) .
Yet with the knowledge of the existence of such risk , the relatives can better prepare for themselves both physically and emotionally so as to be able to recover or overcome the stress if the genetic disorder turning into a medical condition .
Secondly , by telling his or her relatives , the carrier would be able to gain emotional support and understanding to overcome such trying times .
After knowing the results , the carrier might be in distraught and lost over what to do for the future .
In such situation , the care and concern of the family members are crucial in helping reduce the stress .
This is even more so if the genetic testing showed the possibility of the other family members and relatives may also have the genetic disorder .
The family would be able to understand each other and provide the comfort that they are overcoming the problem together .
With regards to the health conditions , having family and relative support also help in taking care of each other physically should medical conditions develop .
Some may be concerned that relatives might reject the risks and in turn discriminate the carrier for his or her genetic disorder especially if the developed illness is communicable .
Yet we could not undermine the power of family bonds and the support they can give .
The situation of discrimination is subjective and does not amount to a general trend in family relationships .
Lastly , the carrier is required to conform to the ethical and legal obligations in which genetic testing results is needed to be revealed in certain situations .
The American Society of Clinical Oncology concurs that disclosure may be permitted if the carrier refuse to disclose the information; the disease caused by the disorder is highly probable to occur , serious , yet preventable and treatable or with early monitoring could reduce its risk .
(Lee 2005) .
With that the medical personnel would disclose the information to the relatives in view of the medical concerns that may arise .
It is also ethical to inform the relatives so that he or she can minimize the emotional trauma inflicted to the relatives if they would to find out that the genetic disorder previously unidentified had turning into an illness .
This is especially so since they are part of the family and not strangers .
In conclusion the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives for the benefit of their future .
The carrier should inform them of the health implications , to gain emotional support and to adhere to the ethical and legal obligations .
It is true that the decision of revelation lies with the carrier which means that more care should be taken when making a decision with the benefit of the relatives in mind .
Genetic testing is a process in which a one's DNA or an {embryo}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/embryo]'s {DNA}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/DNA] is abstracted and examined for the existence of particular {genes}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/genes] or deficiency that could signify the future attack of certain disease .
When an individual is tested positive as a carrier of a particular known genetic risk , such as 1 antitrypsin deficiency- where an insignificant adjustment in the style of living can prevent one from an "early death" (Wilcke 1998) , or Huntington's disease-where there is no approach to change the consequences of the result (Wilcke 1998) , he or she will be in a state of dilemma- should he or she be obliged to inform his or her family members ?
Some suggested that when one's relatives are informed of the result , it can cause additional anxiety on the relatives concerned and invade on their lives , thus the positive result should not be disclosed to one's relatives .
However , by informing ones' relatives of the result not only allow them to escape from early deaths through small adjustments in their lifestyles but also ensure the safety of third parties .
Thus , the reveal of the result to relatives has effectuated significant advantages .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , when the relatives of a carrier of a known genetic risk are informed of the positive test result , the chance of early deaths of the relatives is minimised .
This is because certain genetic diseases may be accentuated by external factors .
When an individual is made known to the external factors , he or she can make adjustments to his or her daily lifestyle .
Consequently , the chance of an early death due to the genetic disease is reduced since one is not exposed to the decisive risk factor .
For instance , one is tested positive for 1 antitrypsin deficiency- a genetic disease in which smoking is the decisive risk factor (Wilcke 1998) .
When the carrier informed his or her relatives of the positive result , the relatives can restrain themselves from smoking .
This not only minimises the chance of them developing the disease but more importantly reduces the chance of dying early .
Secondly , the reveal of the result to relatives ensures the safety of third parties .
When one is tested positive for genetic diseases which can cause one to expose others to danger , one should reveal the result to his or her relatives .
This is because one's relative could be in professions such as train conductor , air traffic controller and airline pilot (Wachbroit 1996) .
These relatives might have a condition that would hamper their job performance in such a way as to expose other people to danger (Wachbroit 1996) .
For example , one is tested positive for Huntington's disease- a disease that causes rampant movements .
When one's relative is in a particular profession such as airline pilot and the relative is not informed of the positive result , he or she will continue in his or her profession .
However , the relative might not be able to control his or her movements while on the midst of controlling the aeroplane due to the Huntington's disease .
This may cause a disastrous accident which results in the death of many passengers .
Meanwhile , this disastrous accident may be prevented if the relative is informed of the result by the carrier .
This is because the relative may go for genetic testing and if one is confirmed to have the disease , he or she will not continue in his or her profession and thus will not expose others to danger .
Hence , the reveal of the testing result ensures the safety of third parties .
It has been claimed that the disclosure of the testing result can create unnecessary distress on the relatives concerned and may invade radically on their lives .
However , the relatives might have significant effects if they are not informed of the result .
This is because they might make themselves vulnerable to the decisive risk determinants of any particular genetic disease (Wilcke 1998) .
If they are informed of the result , they might avoid the risk of developing the disease .
Thus , the consequences of being informed of the result are more preferable than staying in ignorance .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives as it not only allows them to escape from early deaths through changes in their lifestyles but also contributes to the safety of third parties .
Genetic testing is a medical test , using blood or tissue from a patient that can definitively determine if a mutation in the genome of the patient is causing a specific disease (Norrgard , 2008) .
The testing reveals many types of diseases and disorders such as Huntington's disease , cancer and Down syndrome .
The decision to undergo genetic testing is actually a personal choice as it is influenced by factors such as family history and having the risk for a disorder .
The result of the test is an important matter as it affects the life of the individual and their family .
Family members play important roles such as supportive and caregiver role and patient advocate role .
Due to these , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members because the family members play a supportive and caregiver role (Mahowald , McKusick , Scheuerle and Aspinwall , 2001) .
An individual being diagnosed to be a carrier of a genetic risk will be definitely lost and depressed .
In this case , family members are important to provide mental supports to the patient .
The support given will be a great pushed for the patient to look forward and face the reality bravely .
Besides , family members also help patient to think through all relevant medical options which are the best for the patient (Mahowald et al . , 2001) .
In addition , family members play a caregiver role as well .
They provide care and company the patient all along the way for them to accept the fact as a carrier of the disorder .
Through the support and care provided by family members , patients could accept the genetic risk eventually .
Thus , a carrier of the genetic risk should tell his or her family members .
Other than that , the patient should tell the result of the test to their family members because family members act as patient advocate role (Mahowald et al . , 2001) .
This will benefit the patient as the family members will think all sort of ways to ensure patient receives all necessary care .
They will question the health care team and try to get more information for the patient .
These help the patient to decide the best treatment for them .
For example , a patient that has cancer can undergo several treatments to control the spread of the cancerous cells .
In this case , family members who have the information of the treatment can help the patient to decide the best treatment for the patient .
Conversely , if the patient has not tell the family members the result of the genetic test , the patient will be definitely in lost and irrational in making decision .
Therefore , a carrier of genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members .
Opponents may argue that a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives due to the principles of confidentiality and privacy (Norrgard , 2008) .
They claimed that a carrier should have the rights to keep the result .
This is because the carrier thinks that revealing the result of the test will affect the life of the whole family .
It will create tension for the family .
However , the family members have the rights to know the result .
Since some of the genetic diseases and disorders are hereditary , therefore there are potential risks for the family members to inherit the disease .
The result should be revealed to them in order to be faired to them .
They have the rights to prevent and ensure their safety .
Besides , carriers themselves will be in an unstable emotion condition upon knowing the result .
They are unable to make decision rationally .
Thus , the result should be told to their relatives .
Hence , the relatives can make rational decision for the patient and this probably what the patient needs the most .
In conclusion , relatives play an instrumental role to help the patient in facing the genetic disease .
They support , care and advocate the patient .
The issue of privacy should be put aside since the benefits of the patient are on priority .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing can be classified as a medical test that detects changes in the genes , chromosomes or proteins .
The testing is usually done to find changes related with inherited diseases or disorders .
({http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting}[HYPERLINK: http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting] ) Some of the diseases that can be detected are Huntington disease , Thalassemia , Cystic fibrosis and Alzheimer disease .
Results from a genetic testing can help to ascertain the percentage of chances of a person developing or passing on a genetic disease .
Genetic testing is done voluntary by a person and often , the question "should a person who is found to be a carrier of genetic disorder through the genetic testing tell his or her family" arises when it comes to releasing the results of the test .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic disease should be obligated to tell his or her family members .
One should be obligated to reveal his or her own genetic test's results to his family members as the results can help in family planning .
A person who is thinking of marrying , should let his partner know that he has genetic problem as the other party is going to spend the rest of her life with him and it will be unfair to keep her in the dark .
Not only that , those who are already married should also reveal the results to his spouse so that they can come up with a plan for their family like how many children they want and whether they want to take the risk of having a child  .
Taking care of children with serious genetic disorder is not an easy task , and as such , a couple should inform each other of their genetic problem first and try to discuss the consequences and think of a solution together instead of keeping it a secret .
However , critics may say that it is not necessary to inform his spouse about his condition as sometimes the baby will not inherit the disease and even if the baby do inherit the disorder , abortion can still be done while the foetus is still inside the mother's womb .
However , this is not an ethical thing to do and inhuman to terminate a life .
It will be much more better if they have discuss and plan earlier and thus a desperate measure such as abortion need not be made .
Besides that , a carrier of a known genetic problem should be obligated to tell his family members so that the chances of treating or at least improving his disease will be much more higher .
This is because , when his family members know that he is suffering from a genetic problem , they will try all means to help him to improve his condition .
A person will usually feel depress and even suffers emotional breakdown when he knows that he suffers from a certain disease what more if it is a disease inherited from his parents , thus when his family knows about his condition , they can persuade , paying more attention to him and even encourage him to go for treatment and not to give up .
Not only that , maybe his family members have wider contacts than him and can recommend alternative medicine or a specialist doctor which in turn can increase his chance to recover .
However , there has also been some suggestions that the carrier of a certain genetic disease who knows it through genetic testing should not be obligated to tell his family members as he will be discriminated and sometimes even be treated as an outcast in his family .
Nevertheless , he should be mentally prepared and thinks positively as eventually his family members will surely accept him as blood is always thicker than water .
In conclusion , a person should be obligated to reveal his genetic testing's results as it has more advantages in doing so than disadvantages as encouragement from his family and family planning is crucial to a person with genetic disorder .
What will be this world if people are capable of viewing their genetic testing results as easily as ordering a dinner in a restaurant ?
Nowadays , there is a new type of technology , named genetic testing , which is designed to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders (Genetic testing , 2009) .
With the help of genetic test , people are able to find or rule out some suspected genetic problems and will be clear about the risks of developing or passing on a genetic disorder .
However , if individual are allowed to have the final say in revealing the results of such testing , although it has many benefits , its disadvantages still outweigh these advantages overwhelmingly .
That is to say , letting people possess the right to view such testing results is potentially harmful to our community .
Hence , people should not have the final say in whether to reveal the result of genetic tests .
This essay will concentrate on two aspects to illustrate the reasons: side effects of the genetic testing on families and society (Nicholson , 2007) .
Firstly , as for the family aspect , genetic testing may create tension among family members (Genetic testing , 2009) .
It is because one person's result will have deep effects on others' due to their kinship .
For example , if a parent or a child knows that he gets a kind of genetic disorder , then their children or parents may worry about not only his health but also themselves' all the time .
This brings about a lot of trouble to the whole family and affects the family harmony .
Besides , if a baby is diagnosed some genetic problems , some parents may abandon their child due to the endless treatments and high-priced medical cost instead of hoping to cure their child and trying their best .
Hence , if the results of genetic testing are allowed to reveal to individuals , such phenomena will happen more frequently than before and it will make a difference on society .
Then as for the social aspects , genetic testing may also be sensational (Nicholson , 2007) .
For instance , if the employers know the genetic testing results of their potential employees , they will intend to hire those who are much healthier than others .
Otherwise , their employees may ask for a sick leave from time to time , which will affect the normal operations of the companies .
Besides , if an insurance agent knows the results of a particular customer , then salesmen will try to avoid offering insurance service to one who has some kind of genetic disorder .
Instead , they will spare no effort to sell insurance to the healthy population .
In a word , genetic testing may lead to a genetic discrimination in employment and insurance industry (Genetic testing , 2009) .
Moreover , even if people know their results of genetic testing , usually they are able to do very little nothings .
It is because genetic testing cannot predict how severely one person will be affected by the disordered genes .
What is can do is only detecting whether there are any genetic problems .
Also , for most kinds of the genetic disorders , the medical technology nowadays is not capable of curing them (What is genetic testing ?
n .d .) .
Therefore , personally viewing of the results of genetic testing will cause a lot of problems to society .
Actually , whether individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results of such testing is a heated controversy in society today .
While the genetic testing can assist people in predicting and ruling out some genetic disorders and problems which are hard to be find in daily life , it will still bring about some difficult problems to human beings to some extent .
Hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Advancements in medical science have led to an increase in the number of people undergoing genetic testing .
They go through medical tests to detect changes in their genes , thus identifying the possibility of them or their related-family member developing a inherited disorder (Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
As such , a controversy occurs as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
The test results obtained from genetic testing will have ethical and social issues .
Thus , an individual of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his/her relatives .
Firstly , there are ethical implications involved .
It would be morally wrong not to inform an identifiable individual of having a possibility of developing genetic disease .
For instance , a parent with high blood pressure may affect the child to inherit the disease .
Researchers have shown that his/her child will have a 35 percent to 65 percent chance of inheriting it (Edelson , 2009) .
Thus , the parent should warn the child of this possibility .
The child can take precaution on his/her diet and exercise regularly to reduce the risk of having high blood pressure .
On the other hand , some may question on the accuracy of genetic testing , and the unnecessary worries it might bring to an individual .
However , prevention is always better than cure and with additional caution , worries will be eliminated .
Secondly , social issues will also occur .
The genetic disease may spread among the community if an individual is unaware of a possible genetic disorder developing in him/her .
In the case of Huntington's disease , the related family member will have a 50 percent possibility of having the disease (Norrgard , 2008a) .
If so unfortunately the related family member were to develop the disease and carry on with giving birth , his/her child will in turn have a 50 percent chance of having the disease .
When this cycle carries on , it will create a social problem as the disease has now been spread into the society .
Thus , the individual should be obligated to inform his/her relatives to avoid such situation .
On the contrary , others may feel that the individual will be discriminated due to his/her disease .
However , there are laws which protect the individual from discrimination (Norrgard , 2008b) .
This can give the individual a sense of assurance that they have equal chances (in looking for a job) as compared to others .
There are those who feel that an individual of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform his/her relatives as genetic results is private and of high confidentiality (HOPES , 2002) .
While it is true that genetic test result are confidential , in the case where another life is at risk , we should be more considerate and help save another life .
In conclusion , an individual of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his/her relatives as both ethical and social implications will occur .
Surveillance technology such as RFID technology is used for the purpose of monitoring changes , behaviour , activities and keeping track of mainly humans and sometimes , animals .
RFID technology has been around for more than 10 years and it is used by different bodies or organizations (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Thus , it is not something uncommon among our society as it is incorporated in many applications of our daily lives such as tracking people and animals .
The acronym RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification and it is widely used in different industries .
We may rely too much on RFID technology that it may take a toll on some of us .
This has resulted in the raise of privacy and ethical issues within our society .
However , it has been known that RFID technology brings benefits to various elements of our lives and it helps in solving problems that we may encounter while handling different tasks and even correct human errors .
Hence , RFID technology such as human implants and RFID tags should be used to monitor people .
One of the vital advantages of the use of RFID technology is that it can boost the security level effectively in a few areas within certain proximity (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Safety and security is the primary concern when it comes to managing a business .
For example , RFID tags are widely used in jewellery stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
Merchandises in the respective stores are tagged with RFID tags and RFID readers will be placed at the checkout counters (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Once an RFID tagged item is brought out via an RFID reader , it will trigger the alarm and security guards will be alerted upon hearing the alarm .
Thus , this decreases the chances of thefts .
Besides that , RFID tags come in various shapes and sizes and the information contained in the RFID tags are not easily duplicated (Ramdasi , 2009) .
This increases the security level and efficacy of the surveillance systems in a particular area that incorporates the RFID technology .
Besides that , RFID technology is also important in the healthcare industry as it can save lives (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
Dull and monotonous procedures can be removed or reduced and patients would not feel trapped or isolated and be more carefree (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
For example , patients are tagged with RFID wristbands that contain information about their health conditions , medications , drug allergies and microchips that enable healthcare professionals to monitor the patients (RFID Applications in Healthcare , 2006) .
If any of the patients experience any difficulties such as breathlessness , nurses will be able to track the patient and immediately attend to him or her .
This saves time and can potentially save a life .
Since RFID automates procedures such as protecting the patients from danger , it reduces the amount of personal contacts between patients and nurses (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
Information on patients' diseases and surgeries can also be obtained from the RFID wristbands .
Reports can be accessed by the healthcare professionals such as the doctors and nurses without a hassle .
Further medical treatments can be conducted if another doctor reads the reports .
However , there are arguments that are against the use of RFID technology in monitoring and tracking people and animals despite the benefits gained .
One of the arguments that have been brought up is the difficulty in reading the information provided by the RFID tags incorporated in liquids and metal products (Pandey , 2009) .
These substances may reflect the radio waves which make the information hard to read .
The RFID tags also have to be placed in proper positions , taking into account its angles and alignment in order to obtain a proper reading .
This can be quite a hassle and it requires a lot of concentration .
However , RFID tags are usually placed in an area with optimum frequency which enables the RFID readers to obtain the information contained in the tags correctly .
Active RFID tags which are tags that use batteries to increase the range of frequency of a system can be used to solve this problem .
Hence , the use of RFID technology would still be effective and beneficial to us .
In conclusion , we can see that the use of RFID technology does bring important advantages to our society .
Therefore , the use of RFID technology should be promoted and enhanced .
RFID technology provides a better security than other surveillance gadgets such as CCTV and reduces thefts in our society .
Besides that , monitoring of animals is made easy because of the versatility of the RFID tags .
Therefore , if we would like to minimise our workload , save time , ensure that we live in a safer environment and save lives , RFID technology should be used to carry out these intentions .
A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag is a small microchip designed for identification of the object it is attached to .
It is capable of transmitting many stored digital information to receivers via radio waves and has many applications in consumers' products (Cormode 2006) .
However , privacy issues arise when the same technology is used for tracking of human (Cormode 2006) .
When RFID and other surveillance technology are used to track children movement , we are not only invading the children privacy but also undermining their dignity (Anonymous 2005) .
Usage of RFID implants in the medical field to store patients' medical data has also been linked to increased possibility of developing cancer (Gutierrez 2008) .
With such detrimental effects on health and on human rights of privacy , usage of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
First of all , when RFID is used to tag and track a person , the privacy of the person being tracked is compromised .
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation ."
With RFID , private information of the individual other than his location can be picked up by anyone with a radio receiver and the individual with the RFID will not know who is taking the information and what private information is being stolen (Cormode 2006) .
The information may be misused for consumer profiling by the company collecting all these personal information (Cormode 2006) .
Advocates of RFID argue that the technology will prevent terrorist from entering the nation by reducing forgery of passport (US Department of Homeland Security) .
However , the United Sates Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that the ability of RFID to counter forgery comes from its use of encrypted digital data storage and not from its radio transmission capability .
The DHS also added that other forms of digital data storage technology such as contact chips can provide the same function against passport forgery while preventing invasion of human privacy .
Thus , RFID should not be used to track people since it infringe into human privacy .

Secondly , an article on Electronic Privacy Information Center (Anonymous 2005) highlighted that using RFID to track children movement and location not only invades their privacy but can also be very detrimental to their dignity .
The article also compared tagging our children with RFID with tagging of products in markets or tagging of livestock in farms .
From this comparison , it shows that the dignity of children is being affected by the usage of RFID to track them .
Opponents to this position argue that RFID can be used to locate the child position in the event of a kidnap (Lane 2003) .
However , Lane (2003) argues that due to the limited range of RFID , it will not serve the purpose of locating the kidnapped child well .
On top of that , Lane (2003) also pointed out that these surveillance technologies may give the children and parents a false sense of security .
Instead of teaching their children the importance of personal safety and the danger of wandering off with strangers , parents may end up relying too much on these technologies for the safety of their children .
Hence , RFID should not be used for tracking of children .
Lastly , usage of RFID implant to track patients and to store medical information of cognitive decline individual have been linked to an increased risk of developing skin cancer in areas near the implant (Gutierrez 2008) .
Although the RFID implant aids in getting medical information from these individual with lower intellect , the increase risk of cancer greatly outweighs this benefit .
Thus , usage of RFID implants for tracking of patients or for storing of medical records should be banned .
In conclusion , usage of RFID or other surveillance technology to track people not only infringe human rights of privacy and undermine the dignity of our children , it also poses a serious health issue in the case of a RFID implant .
As such , RFID or other surveillance technology to track people should be banned .

With the maturity of surveillance technology , a myriad of surveillance technologies is now widely utilized for administration , security purpose and public welfare , etc .
However , individuals of course would feel very uncomfortable when noticing a surveillance camera on an ATM machine or even in workplace .
A seemingly unavoidable debate thus arises .
Surveillance technology mainly involves the invention and application of informative , accurate and reliable modern equipment monitoring the behaviours , activities , or other changing information , usually in a clandestine manner .
Surveillance was conducted by the governments for national and social security issues underground at the very beginning  .
However , surveillance equipment has become usual and developed into various types .
The vast and most frequent surveillance is on the internet , the presumed free space .
(Daffier , Whitfield , 2008))For instance , the information awareness office , NSA , FBI in U .S . all have unauthorised access to all the data and traffic on the internet .
Billions are spent every year to develop , purchase , maintain and implement the surveillance system to intercept and analyze online information .
The tapping of telephone line by government organisations for monitor citizens and collecting miscellaneous information is also widespread in almost every country .
Another common surveillance system is that of the surveillance cameras hidden in public areas such as streets , hotels , hospital , shopping mall , bank etc , for administrative purposes or financial security .
RFID tapping is the use of small devices implanted in human body or product to identify and locate , which is already applied in some company to monitor their workers while on the job  .
Some criticize ferociously that such mass surveillance is the step towards the totalitarian world described in Jorge Orwell's 1984 .They fear the fictional Orwellian may even become true , which will be a disaster for human beings .
Some are just annoyed by this blatant way the governments work which they equal to that of treating prisoners .
Numerous civil right groups and privacy groups oppose and regard it as a severe violation of the tight of privacy and freedom .
The supporters believe that surveillance system is indispensible in indentifying and capturing terrorists and criminals , which is for public welfare  .It's also effective for administrative purpose .
They argue that in the today's context that terrorist can make use of computer software to access to others' information nowadays , why cannot governments on the behalf of the whole country .
They also point out governments didn't abuse the information at their hand since they are also monitored by people  .Additionally , surveillance create everyone a feeling of being watched , so they become self-policing , which can decrease criminal rate and save administrative expenditure( Michel Foucault ,1979)  .
Technology always evolves whatever human's interference is in the sense that every previous attempt of halting the development of technology in history proved futile .
We should exploit the technology to the most for the welfare of the whole community .
In the case of surveillance technology , we should concentrate on how to use it appropriately .
Surveillance technology usage should not be all simply banned because of its flaws , but to be regulated and optimized to serve us better in today's context .
Technological advancement has led to the invention of several surveillance technologies .
One such example is Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology .
The use of such technology has made it possible to track people and their activities through their belongings without their knowledge .
This has brought about many debates on the ethical and moral issues surrounding the use of the device (Anonymous , 2005) .
While opponents of RFID suggest that the use of RFID bring benefits such as convenience and protection to patients and children , others view it as a form of security threat and intrusion of privacy (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
The use of RFID can also cause the growth of tumors if chips are implanted into the human body (Anti-chip .com , n .d) .
Thus , the use of RFID should be banned as the consequences it brings outweigh the few benefits that it provides .
Firstly , the use of RFID to track people has raised concerns on privacy issues as they are tracked without their knowledge (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Their whereabouts and activities can be constantly monitored and information shared .
It can be argued that the use of RFID tags to check on patients with Alzheimer's conditions and children may be a form of protection .
For instance , in 2006 , Verichip , the manufacturer of RFID chips for human attempted to chip 200 Alzheimer's patients from Chattanooga , Tennessee to test the effectiveness of the product (Antichip .com , n .d) .
However , this has raised a series of heated debate as it is not ethical to chip cognitively impaired individuals who are unable to give informed consent (Antichip .com , n .d) .
Hence , the use of RFID should be banned as it invades the privacy of people .
Lewan , T . (2007 , September 8) .
Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumors .
Retrieved September 6 , 2009 , from http://www .washingtonpost .com/wp-dyn/ content/article/ 2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf .html
Secondly , the use of RFID to track people may provide a false sense of security (Hook , 2005) .
RFID tags can be incorporated in one's belongings such as passports and identification cards to track and identify people .
This may increase cases of skimming on personal information .
Opponents of RFID may debated that encryption can be used to limit the access of information to unauthorized people (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Furthermore , it can be argued that RFID technology would reduce delay at checkpoints and entrances which in turn improve efficiency and speed (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Nevertheless , experiments by security research firm Riscure have shown that the encrypted passport can be intercepted and excessive information is revealed to an unauthorized person , which may promote identity theft (Hasbrouck , 2006) .
Therefore , RFID should be banned as the device is flawed .
Lastly , implanting RFID chips in human can be a potential health risk .
A series of studies has shown that chip implants had induced malignant tumors in some lab mice and rats (Lewan , 2007) .
This shows that implanting chips in human may cause cancer .
However , leading cancer specialists reviewed that animal test results do not necessarily apply to humans (Lewan , 2007) .
Moreover , Verichip Corp insists that the chips are safe and has been implanted in millions of domestic pets without major problem (Lewan , 2007) .
Nevertheless , implanting RFID in human body should be banned before any cause of detrimental health effect to the individuals .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it can be a security threat and it intrudes the privacy of people .
Implanting RFID chips may also result in cancer .
The disadvantages of the use of RFID outweigh the benefits .

Surveillance technology systems are mechanisms , which can identify , monitor and track movements and data .
Research laboratories envision tools that could identify and track just about every person , anywhere -- and sound alarms when the systems encounter hazardous objects or chemical compounds .
Together these developments herald a high-tech surveillance society that is beyond previous generation imagination-- one in which virtually every advance brings benefits as well as intrusions .
However since the benefits reaped from surveillance technology overpowers the inconvenience it results in , surveillance technology should indeed be used to track people .
Surveillance technology should be used to track people to ensure national security by preventing crime .
Ever since this technology has become immensely sophisticated , real benefits have been achieved in the development of surveillance technology systems .
The most common type of surveillance technology is the security cameras .
Take for instance , the pinhole cameras in most banks machines .
These devices play a part in deterring potential criminals from carrying out their nefarious activities knowing that their images are caught on tape and maybe used for capture and prosecution .
In addition , this technology also complements the work of security personnel and thus provides added protection against sneaky terrorist attacks .
This is evident in the Singapore MRT stations that are equipped with the 24-hour camera surveillance .
Furthermore surveillance technology helps to combat threats .
This is proven during the introduction of the newly-developed Infrared Fever Screening System (IFSS) which is a useful contribution in national effort against SARS .
Some may argue that surveillance technology should not be used to track people as it may have substantial implications in privacy .
Privacy usually refers to the interest that individuals have in sustaining a personal space free from interference by other people and organizations .
It is acknowledged that the usage of surveillance technology seems to invade and violate the right to privacy .
People often think of privacy as some kind of right .
However , the concept of this right is a problematic way to define as it is very easy to get confused between legal rights on one hand and natural or moral rights on the other .
One may claim it is his right to stay in a country that is safe whereas the other may claim that it is their right not to want the practice of surveillance technology .
In such situations , it is impossible for both parties to have their rights .
One will have to give up the right to absolute privacy to reap the benefits of the rights to feel safe and secure .
Besides having absolute privacy is just an ideal .
The practice of surveillance technology is necessary for the benefit of majority as it adopted to improve our quality of life .
It will be denying more people rights if surveillance is not practiced .
For now , the public seems to find that trade-off acceptable .
Furthermore scientists around the world have intensified efforts to perfect the art of surveillance , hoping to catch villains before they strike .
This will assure public that it is worth it to allow the technology to invade in their privacy .
In conclusion , although each uptick in protection will typically come at the cost of more intrusion into the privacy of ordinary people , surveillance technology has come up with the best possible inventions to assure that this trade-off will be worth it .
Rather than not doing anything to deal with the problems we have , the implementation of such technologies should be allowed for the benefits of majority .
Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people
There are numbers of technologies by which identity of all kinds of material can be tracked .
Some advance surveillance technology like GPS and RFID can even track people's location and health status by using a tiny tag and a reader .
However , disputation rises as the issue comes to tracking of human being .
In my opinion , these surveillance technologies should not be used to track people .
First and foremost , privacy comes into our mind when we mention of being tracked all the time .
No one would like to have a pair of eyes watching him anytime or anywhere , leaving him an uncomfortable feeling .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) has clearly stated out that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights .
Everyone should have their own rights to move freely without being monitored .
Secondly , the importance or urge to use surveillance technology to track people is subtle .
Some may argue that these technologies can keep people from danger by tracking their health status especially in some working places with high radioactive level , track someone's location in case he's kidnapped .
Workers can still have medical check regularly to ensure they are healthy as health problems wouldn't come in a sudden , it must accumulate over time .
Furthermore for parents fearing of the chance of their children being kidnapped , it's unfortunate that through electromagnetic isolation , they won't be able to track their children also .
Moreover , the children may get hurt if the kidnappers decide to remove the tag or chip implanted under the children's skin .
Besides that , the confidentiality of such data transmitted between a tag or chip and device is questionable .
Someone who has the device and the way to encrypt the code can actually have access to these data .
It's a horrible scene if someone is tracked by a person who doesn't have the authority .
Even though high security level can be developed , there will always be loopholes .
The best way to prevent the leakage of personal data is not to use it .
Last but not least , a report released by The {American Medical Association}[HYPERLINK: http://www .ama-assn .org/] (AMA) indicated that RFID devices may present physical risks to the patient .
Though they are removable , their small size allows them to migrate under the skin , making them potentially difficult to extract .
The report went on to add this warning: "RFID tags may cause electromagnetic interference , which may interfere with electrosurgical devices and defibrillators .
Finally , it has not been determined whether RFID tags might affect the efficacy of pharmaceuticals ."
In conclusion , due to the privacy , unimportance of using these technologies , confidentiality of data and health threat , surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people
Over the years as technology advances , the improvement in surveillance technology such as Radio-frequency identification (RFID) and surveillance cameras has brought about the increase in usage of such technology .
Surveillance technology refers to the technology developed for observers to keep track of activities done by the observed .
Such technology is widely used on human beings in the 21st century for social , political or economical purposes .
Despite the long-running controversy over whether such technology should be used to track people due to human rights issues , it is evident that the advantages outweigh the negative impacts .
Therefore , I do not agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID is useful in maintaining security in the country .
The use of RFID at immigration borders and checkpoints enables a country to identify suspected terrorists and keep away unwelcomed immigrants who may post a threat to the welfare of the country and her people .
( HYPERLINK "http://www .dhs .gov" http://www .dhs .gov) This will in turn help to improve and safeguard safety in the country and indirectly help in the economical aspect .
Therefore , this form of tracking of people should not be avoided .
In addition , the use of surveillance technology such as surveillance cameras to track people is believed to aid in the reduction of crime rate in the country , which will be beneficial to the society .
With the presence of surveillance cameras , potential criminals will thus think twice before they act .
This may hence deter crimes from happening .
Even though it may not be an ideal and effective way to curb criminal offenses , it can on the other hand allow authorities to work more efficiently when an incident occur .
{(Shah Alam , 2007)}[HYPERLINK: http://malaysiacrimewatch .lokety .com/closed-circuit-television-cameras-to-fight-crime-in-selangor/] The use of surveillance technology to track people , under such circumstances , has once again proved to be useful and thus should not be stopped from using it .
Despite the positive impacts of the usage of surveillance technology to track people , there are many arguments pertaining to how surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
One of the main issues will be the concern of intrusion of human rights .
When companies first started introducing the implantation of RFID chips into the body of their employees , protests were raised by both related and unrelated parties because they felt that it is clearly a violation of the privacy of one .
The workers claimed that it is a way of bereaving them from human rights when their motions are being watched around the clock .
Christian critics even claimed that such acts will lead to apocalypse as stated in the bible .
(Lewan , 2007) However , such arguments regarding religious issues and human rights are unpractical because there is no substantial evident to prove that implantation of microchips is going to lead to the end of the world , and the argument of violation of human rights is made weak with the definition of human rights being ambiguous .
Conversely , the purpose of implanting RFID chips into the employees is clear- to deny access of employees into restricted and highly confidential areas .
The concern is that should interests of the company override the right of human beings .
Therefore in this case , it is difficult to determine whether surveillance technology should or should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , with the positive impacts outweighing the negative consequences of using surveillance technology to track people , I will not agree to the statement that such technology should not be used to track people .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID (Radio frequency identification) to track people should be banned .
Technological advances in the recent century have led to many improved methods to trace people .
Surveillance technology is widely known to do observations from a certain distance by means of electronic devices .
Technologies such as Radio-frequency identification (RFID) are used for the sole purpose of tracking people as well as products using radio waves (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Most people might think that this new form of technology will be very beneficial to mankind as it ensures easy identification .
However , the increasing usage of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it indirectly intrudes human privacy , leads to many security issues pertaining to the usage of RFID technology and questions the cost efficiency of RFID tags (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
RFID technology should be barred as this form of surveillance technology is still not considered totally safe for consumers .
One of the most serious threats is data theft .
As RFID tags are made to contain information , there is a very high probability of data theft by well hidden RFID scanners (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Moreover , these RFID scanners are very cheap in comparison to a RFID tag .
This will eventually lead to the problem of data ownership and the information unique to an individual might be made known to other people (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Another issue is the possibility of data corruption .
As RFID tags are rewritable and if they are not security locked , there exists a potential for pranksters to change the data on the tags with false information (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
On the contrary , some people might think that using shielding techniques on RFID tags is already an effective protection mechanism against data theft and data corruption (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Although it is true that aluminium shielding can prevent hackers to steal one's data to a certain extent , it also makes transmission more difficult and might not be completely effective in preventing it (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Further research needs to be done to make the shielding techniques safer for consumers .
Therefore , RFID technology should be banned for the safety of consumers .
RFID technology should also be excluded as surveillance technology to track people as it is rather costly (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Each RFID reader is worth at least a thousand dollar (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Those companies which have decided to use RFID technology to keep track of its workers or products have to purchase thousands of RFID readers to cover all their workplaces and factories (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
In addition , each RFID tag is rather expensive hence it is not practical to be used in large quantity to identify both people and products (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Due to the impracticality of RFID technology , RFID technology should not be used to track people .
Though the use of RFID technology has its merits such as crime prevention , it should still be barred because the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people not only infiltrate one's privacy; it is also not cost effective and likely to result in data theft and data loss .
Surveillance technology such as RFID to track people plays a crucial role in preventing the criminal activities as well as monitoring threats .
RFID tags can be inserted into the wristbands which can be worn by the parolees or the prisoners and cannot to be removed .
According to Taipei Times newspaper , it was claimed that the sexual assault parolees should wear the RFID tags in order to trace their whereabouts (Chang , 2006) .
During the releasing period on probation of the prisoners , there will be cases that the parolees will escape and flee to the bent so that the law enforcers could not find them .
Thus , attaching RFID tags on them can easily track them .
If they intend to run away , the police can get to know their locations and arrest them at once .
Apart from the RFID tags , GPS can be applied to investigate the criminal activities such as murder cases , robbery and serious corruption (Michael and Rose , 2007) .
Undeniable , surveillance technology to track people will lead to loss of privacy .
However , protecting the privacy in this situation is not more important than letting the offenders to violate the laws and threaten our lives .
In addition , there is another advantage of surveillance technology on protecting and tracking the children's movements .
As we know , parents nowadays always worry about their children .
However , living in the hustle and bustle of city life , many parents utilize their time to work harder to climb up the social ladder rather than supervise their kids' movements .
Hence , RFID technology is indeed a good method to help the parents to keep an eye on their children's whereabouts .
RFID tags are introduced to be sewn into children's attires or set in their wristband to track their positions and activities (Gautam , 2006) .
The importance of this surveillance technology is that it can make sure of the children's safety so that the parents can work at ease .
Although most of the children today have mobile phones , it is also possible that their mobile phones are lost or they are having difficulties to pick up their phones such as kidnapping .
If the children are being kidnapped , with the surveillance technology of RFID , the parents can track their locations .
If the children try to play truant or involving in unhealthy activities , the parents can supervise them as well .
Children have their freedom to enjoy their lives but monitoring and supervising them is also essential to ensure their safety .
Parents can talk to the children precisely why there is a need to track their movements .
In conclusion , surveillance technology's advantages outweigh its disadvantages .
Surveillance technology should be used in a correct way to improve human's life and not to lead to dehumanization .
So , I do not agree that there should be a ban in using surveillance technology to track people .
Firstly , surveillance technology may threaten personal security by enabling identity thieves , stalkers and other criminals to commit "contactless" crimes against victims who won't immediately know they've been violated (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) .
Recently , Americans are told to use Radio- Frequency Identification or RFID-embedded identity documents when they are travelling between countries such as the United States , Canada , Mexico , Bermuda and the Carribean (Lewan , 2009) .
In February 2005 , when the State Department (US) asked for public comment on the implementation of RFID in passport booklets , of the 2 ,335 comments received , 98 .5 percent were negative , with 86 percent expressing security or privacy concerns , the department reported in an October 2005 notice in the Federal Register (Lewan , 2009) .
Indeed , the fear of losing security is a distressing concern among the society .
Secondly , surveillance technology poses a risk to personal privacy and healthcare .
"Tracking devices such as online behavioural tracking systems can be used to target vulnerable consumers for high-price loans , bogus health cures and other potentially harmful products and services ," said Susan Grant , director of Consumer Protection at Consumer Federation of America (Consumer Watchdog , 2009 , para .9) .
Nowadays electronic information from consumers is "collected , compiled and sold" (Consumer Watchdog , 2009 , para .2) without reasonable safeguards and therefore poses a threat to the exposure of private matters of consumers that may lead to abuse of such information for unethical benefits or intentions .
Some may argue that such tracking systems can be beneficial especially in providing security measurement and protection , for example the implantation of tiny radio tracking beacons in children (Gargano , Gilmore , Pace , Weinstein , 1997) .
This measure is to be seen as an effort to protect the children in case of child murder or kidnapping are to occur (Gargano et al . , 1997) .
However , the motivation for the beacons may change on the part of the parents as the children grow older and begin to learn to protect themselves .
Parents who insist their teens in wearing radio beacons may cause the teens (those who oppose) to refuse the requirement and subsequently select other unpleasant options , including trying to remove the (implanted) beacon themselves (Petersen , 2001) .
As a result , this is how teens' privacy and growth are affected negatively when parents applied tracking devices on them .
Julie Petersen , author of Understanding of Surveillance Technologies (2001 , p5-48) , stated this comment in her book , "Researching this book has given me concerns that we may be moving into a not-too-distant future in which newborn infants are implanted with radio tracking devices , without their knowledge or consent , to 'ensure their safety' from wandering or kidnapping .
These actions may be well-intentioned initially but may subsequently be used to curtail freedom of choice and movement during their teenage years and beyond ."
Unfortunately the use of surveillance technology in tracking people may have higher probability in affecting a person's social well-being as well as intruding his privacy even when it may be well- intentioned at first .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology for the purpose of tracking people should be banned as it not only received negative response from the public community because of its potential threat to personal security , it may also intrude one's privacy and may jeopardize one's personal healthcare and social well-being .
As a type of surveillance technology , Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been widely used in our lives .
The use of RFID to track people is drawing increasing attention and has caused many conflicts .
Advocators suggest that using RFID to conduct social control and suspects tracking can benefit the whole society .
However , RFID is in fact not as ideal as they think .
On the contrary , it raises serious problems on invasion of privacy and health issues .
Hence , using RFID to track people should be banned .
An important reason why the use of RFID to track people should be banned is because the abuse of RFID risks the invasion of privacy .
On one hand , some tracking are conducted without people's awareness and permission .
For instance , in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart store , RFID tags were hidden in Procter & Gamble Lipfinity lipstick on shelves without declaration .
When customers interacted with the lipsticks , they were not aware that they were being observed by the Procter & Gamble executives (Albrecht and McIntyre 2004) .
Likewise , many companies use RFID tagged product to track consumers' behaviors and collect information without their knowledge and consent , which seriously invades consumers' privacy .
On the other hand , although in some cases people are informed , they are still under the risk of losing privacy .
It is because within a certain distance , anyone who has the reading device is able to read RFID tags .
Thus , besides the real tracking conductors , criminals can also take advantages of RFID to achieve their criminal intent .
A security expert Bruce Schneier said that "When RFID chips are embedded in your ID cards , your clothes , your possessions , you are effectively broadcasting who you are to anyone within range .
The level of surveillance possible , not only by the government but by corporations and criminals as well , will be unprecedented .
There simply will be no place to hide" (Sieberg D 2006) .
In short , since the abuse of RFID to track people leads to the invasion of human privacy , its use should be banned .
Another concern about using RFID to track people is the health problems .
Research has shown that implantable RFID chips caused cancer in animal and they may also cause cancer in humans .
In addition , research also showed that the {inflammation}[HYPERLINK: http://www .naturalnews .com/inflammation .html] caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object can increase the instance of tumor development (Jean 2007) .
Concerning these health issues , it is immoral to ask people implant RFID chips and meanwhile let them take the risk of having disease .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
In conclusion , using RFID to track people not only raises the possibilities of privacy invasion , but also causes health problems .
Instead of benefitting from it , people bear many fear and risk of it .
Thus , although using RFID to conduct tracking may be helpful in some aspects , compared with the disadvantages of it , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
Lastly is the prominent impact in civil society .
If RFID chip is implanted to all members of society , it will give out a lot of advantages such as we can track missing people , missing family members .
Even more , we can track and identify the lost casualties in airplane accidents and natural disasters faster , effectively and efficiently so that more casualties can still be found in living condition .
Some party may argue about the privacy matter of the use of this technology .
In this case , privacy matter can be assured by applying password , encrypter or decoder in the next generation of RFID devices .
It is just the same case with the use of bank account and ATM card pin which has been broadly trusted by all of bank customer .
Another issue concerning the medical safety aspect of implanting the chip in human body may state that RFID tags may cause electromagnetic interference which may interfere with electrosurgerical devices and defibrillators .
However , the American Medical Association report mentioned that it has not been determined whether RFID tags may affect the efficacy of pharmaceuticals .
Furthermore , this report also stated that RFID tags could promote the frequent access for the patient to their medical information and increase the continuity and coordination of care which resulting reduction many kind of medical error like adverse drugs event .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID and GPS to track people should not be banned since the advantageous is much greater than the disadvantageous in many sites of human life such as economy aspect by increasing the level of working efficiency and broaden exploration area , civil security aspect by lowering the level of criminal cases , military aspect by facilitating in tracing the kidnapped soldier , civil society aspect by helping the family to search the missing family members , improving the efficiency in searching and identifying the casualties of mass accidents or natural disasters  , and facilitating the more frequent access of medical information for the patients .
The use of surveillance technology started as early as 1969 , where cameras were installed in the New York City Municipal Building (Roberts , 2005) .
It helps to "identify , monitor and track movements and data ."
(Bogonikolos , 1999) .
The usage of this technology has also brought about many controversies on privacy as a basic human right , the lack of control over who can view the information of those who are being tagged , and lastly , the psychological impact it has on the individual and the society .
In my point of view , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people to a large extent .
First of all , there is insufficient control over the people who have access to the surveillance technology .
For example , anyone with a RFID sensor will be able to read and/or detect an individual who has the RFID tag implanted inside him (Sieberg , 2006) .
People with access to surveillance technology can use their access to find out sensitive information about others for immoral use .
Though some may argue that surveillance technology is important for national security , it can also cause a threat to national security .
This is due to the fact that anyone , including criminals and hackers , can gain access to the nation's confidential information , hence threatening the nation's livelihood .

Is RFID tracking you ?

The use of RFID to track people should not be banned
Nowadays there is a fierce debate over the use human implant Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to track people .
Some people say that the use of RFID invades people's privacy; others maintain that the use of RFID can bring us a lot of benefits .
In my point of view , the use of RFID should not be banned with the following reasons .
Firstly , it is undeniable that RFID is very useful in daily life .
RFID is more efficient and convenient in tracking early released criminals than other surveillance technology as it simplifies the locating process .
In addition , with this technology , parents can easily find their lost children and doctors can easily find elderly people who suffer from degenerative brain conditions CITATION Dav06 \l 2052 (Wood , 2006) .
Hence , it is not necessary to ban the use of RFID which can bring us so much convenience .
To sum up , RFID is a useful technology and like each technology , it has its pros and cons .
The question lies in the appropriate use of RFID .
Since RFID has so many advantages that bring us efficiency and convenience , and the negative effects RFID might bring about such as invasion of privacy could be offset , the use of RFID should not be banned .
In today's world , surveillance technology has been deployed for various purposes .
One of the most debated usages of this technology is to monitor and track people via the surveillance camera and the RFID (radio-frequency identification) .
Critics have argued that this has inevitably denied the individuals their rights to privacy (Stanley and Steinhardt 2003) , and thus should not be used to track people .
However , the benefits of surveillance should not be downplayed .
This essay shall elaborate on how surveillance technology will ensure one's safety and also on its contribution to the overall improvements in healthcare services for the population by monitoring them .
The security of a country and the safety of its citizens have always been the top priority of every government .
Memories of the terrorist attacks happened around the world will always serve as a stark reminder to everyone that a lapse in security will result in heavy casualties .
One of the ways to prevent these from happening is to make use of surveillance technology such as surveillance camera and the RFID .
Surveillance cameras installed at strategic areas will ensure that suspicious characters could be filtered out by the security personnel for checks while RFID tags on prisoners would ensure that they do not escape (Swedberg 2005) and pose a danger to the public .
As one would remember , the escape of the terrorist Mas Selamat in Singapore had threatened the security of the city and the neighbouring countries .
Deployment of large number of troops to capture him was futile until he was arrested by the Malaysian police one year later .
If a RFID tag had been used , the terrorist would not be able to escape easily .
Although one may argued that terrorist attacks still occur even with the use of surveillance camera , one should also note that the recordings would enable the police to identify the terrorists after the attack and conduct a swift operation to arrest them (Quek 2008) before they could plan and carry out their next mission .
Besides that , having security cameras around would always serve as deterrence to potential criminals (Quek 2008) .
Thus , surveillance technology should be deployed to monitor people , especially the terrorists .

Khaw: Treat hospital bed shortage with care .
[Internet][cited 2009 October 2] .
Available from: http://www .channelnewsasia .com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/278291/1/ .ht ml
In Singapore , hospital bed shortages have been a perennial problem for the government .
The high occupancy rate would mean that more healthcare professionals are needed to look after the patients .
In order to improve the overall efficiency of the medical team , Tan Tock Seng Hospital has rolled out RFID in 2007 to monitor more than 1 ,200 patients (Friedlos 2009) .
The benefits of RFID includes locating the patients easily for tests and administering of medicine , and a lower response time of the housekeeping department in clearing the bed once a patient is discharged , which will then reduce an individual's waiting time for a bed (Friedlos 2009) .
This surveillance technology has allowed the healthcare professionals to perform their jobs efficiently and improve the well-being of the patients .
However , as the population continues to age , elderly who are not seriously ill might have to be discharged and nursed their injuries or illnesses at home or in a nursing home (Tan 2007) .
In order not to compromise their health , RFID should be utilized to monitor them (Broache 2007) .
This will not only ensure that they are being looked after by a dedicated healthcare team but it will also alleviate the problem of bed shortages .
Hence , the usage of surveillance technology to track people should not be prohibited .
Critics have long been condemning the use of surveillance technology on humans .
Their disapprovals for such technology grow stronger over the years since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre on 11th September 2001 .
They believed that many countries have increased unnecessary surveillance on the pretext of monitoring the terrorists (Stanley and Steinhardt 2003) .
This has caused the loss of individuals' privacy .
I must admit that erosion of rights to privacy has happened .
However , one must weigh the importance between privacy and security before denouncing the efforts by the governments on surveillance .
As mentioned in the previous paragraph , the surveillance camera could enable the police to identify the terrorists easily after the attack and arrest them .
A good example would be the apprehension of terrorists behind the London bombing with the help of surveillance technology (Quek 2008) .
Hence , surveillance technology should not be ruled out completely .
In conclusion , although the individuals' rights to privacy have been eroded with the increased surveillance , we should continue the usage of the technology because the security of a country and the safety of its citizens are always of utmost importance to everyone .
Besides that , deployment of RFID could benefit the aging population by ensuring that everyone is being looked after by medical professionals without overstretching the whole healthcare facilities .
Hence , surveillance technology should be allowed to track people .

Coming up: smart CCTV ? .

Since the explosion of technology during the last few decades , there has been a new method to track people , which is surveillance technology .
However , whether using of this technology to track people is acceptable or not has always been a big concern .
People who think that surveillance technology should not be used to track people claim that it invade the privacy right of people .
However , surveillance technology , if is used appropriately , can benefit our life so much that it should not be banned .
Firstly , one undeniable advantage of surveillance technology is it might help us to protect people and their belongings .
Simple systems such as cameras or voice recording can be used to observe shopping malls , buildings and other public places .
It might help to maintain the security of those places as well as find out if there is any robber or thief , thus may reduce the crime rate (The Economist print edition , 2008) .
Cameras are usually used in high security or restricted access workplaces to protect these places .
Moreover , police can also use surveillance technology to track potential criminals , for instance , to supervise a person who was imprisoned in the past for a short time to ensure that he won't commit a crime again .
Surveillance technology helps us much in follow dangerous criminals such as gangsters , mafia chief .
Although people who oppose the use of this technology may claim that it would be years before they can pick a terrorist out of a crowd (Yang , 2005) , some intelligent system now can learn the context in which behavior is probably threatening (The Economist print edition , 2008) .
Hence , we may easily filter the suspects and more concentrate on their acts to know if they are really criminals .
Furthermore , busy parents can use simple surveillance devices to keep an eye on their children .
A small tag or camera will give parents information about their children every period of time , thus they know that they are safe .
It also prevents children from being kidnapped or be injured in accidents because their parents would know immediately whenever they are in danger .
Hospitals may apply surveillance system to observe patients (Anonymous , 2004) .
Since doctors and nurses are not able to be with patients all the time , cameras and other surveillance devices will record their condition and alert when it become worse .
Obviously , the feeling of being tracked will make people feel uncomfortable but the safety of us is more precious .
For instance , if you get lost or have a serious accident that you can not call for help , your friends and family could not find you quickly if they do not know your place .
In this situation , surveillance technology is needed , as GPS has been used for years to find lost people .
Furthermore , new surveillance devices are very sophisticated that users won't feel that they are followed .
Thirdly , the use of surveillance technology can make our life more convenient .
Tags and chips implanted in human's body can be use as smart identity cards .
When a person gets off a plane , he goes through a special door , and then the custom-house officer will know all the necessary information of him immediately .
This will save our time as we do not have to spend hours waiting to check-in or check-out .
In some cities , combinations of biometrics and surveillance for access control or checking time and attendance have been used recently (Yang , 2005) .
It not only used for the purpose of security but for the convenient of residents since they do not have to use keys or worry about thieves .
However , there is a concern that implant chips can hurt people and lead to some unexpected consequences .
Actually , not all type of surveillance use this method since we can use cards , cameras and other modern devices instead .
In case we have to use implant chips , it will be designed and made carefully that it will not hurt the users .
Another worry in the use of this technology that whenever a hacker can get in the system , users are threatened as their personal information can be revealed (Zetter , 2009) .
However , systems are made to be able to prevent hackers as well as store the information safely .
The privacy of tracked people will be maintained as long as possible .
In conclusion , surveillance technology benefits our life in many ways that we should not ban it .
Though the consequence that people will be tracked seems unacceptable , the safe and convenience in life for humans is more important .
As long as we use it appropriately , surveillance technology will not have bad influences in our life but make it better .
Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people (e .g .
human implants and RFID tags on people or products) .
Nowadays surveillance technology is growing at a rapid speed and surveillance equipments can be found in many common places such as supermarkets , schools and airport terminal .
Surveillance technology is actually used to monitor and keep track of an individual's activities , behavior and data .
People are actually being observed from a distance by these surveillance technology equipments such as CCTV cameras and GPS tracking devices or being tracked by the means of microchip , a RFID device which using radio waves .
It has been proven that surveillance technology can be beneficial to mankind in terms of deterring crimes and terrorism , monitoring employees and improving patient's welfare .
Thus , surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be banned .
First of all , surveillance technology should be used as it helps in eradicate crimes and to identify the faces of terror from a miles away .
This surveillance technology equipments are installed in buses , common places or schools and with the constant video monitoring , detailed evidence of any suspicious movement or criminal activity can be assessed .
Moreover , an individual is less likely to commit a crime if he knows that he is being watched .
If potential criminals aware of this fact ,there is a high possibility that crimes can be greatly deterred .
In addition , this surveillance technology protect a country's safety and security from terrorist attacks .
For instance ," as a direct result of the September 11 terrorist attacks , United States government and law enforcement officials have implemented surveillance technologies to deter future terrorist attacks(Jim ,2009) .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be used since it put criminals and terrorists away and protect the society .
Furthermore , employees in working places can be monitored by means of surveillance technology and it have plenty of advantages .
Implementing this technology properly can help improve security in working places .
Examples of devices that used are entrance and exit cameras , internal and outdoor cameras and cash register and counter cameras (Bill ,2006) .
The presence of surveillance cameras can prevent thefts in the company because employees are less likely to steal company products as they fully aware that they are being watched by unblinking cameras which can provide evidences .
However , opponents of surveillance technology argues that it invades an individual's privacy .
They did not realize that with a clear understanding of where and how security cameras can be installed , potential privacy intrusion can be avoided (Lynn ,2006) .
Hence , surveillance tools must be used in every working places to improve the security and as well as the employee's good behavior .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people since it helps in deterring crimes and terrorism , monitoring employees and improving welfare of patients .
If surveillance technology is banned , safety of the society and the country's security will be under a big threat .
Criminals and terrorists tend to commit more crimes since they are not being watched and there is no concrete evidence to put them behind the bars .
Thus , to ensure our continued freedom , surveillance technology must be commonly used  .
Surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
With the help of surveillance technology , crime rate can be reduced and prevented .
For instance , the installment of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) in the multi-storey parking lots of a building will enable the security guards to monitor the situation and to pick up on suspicious behavior .
Hence , the officers on duty can take immediate action to prevent a crime from happening .
Detractors from my point of view will argue that too much money has been pumped in to the installation of CCTV and doubt the effectiveness of it (Privacy International , 1997) .
However , in a recent study conducted in Hartlepool , United Kingdom , it was shown that crime rate has reduced by 26% from 2004-2007 after installing CCTV at certain areas (SaferHartlepool , 2009) .
Thus , surveillance technology can enhance security and therefore should not be banned .
Another reason this technology should not be banned is the improvement it will bring about in the healthcare sector .
For instance , it can be used to monitor and locate patients in the hospital .
The movement of patients can be tracked and signal will be sent out in an emergency (Kanellos , 2004) .
Thus , prompt action can be taken to prevent undesirable events from happening .
Some may argue that implanting RFID chip may cause physical side effect .
However , according to Applied Digital , a leading provider of identification and security technology , an estimated 1000 chips had been implanted in humans with no harmful physical side effects (Kanellos , 2004) .
Thus , the use of RFID can benefit us in the healthcare sector by bringing about assurance in knowing that patients are well tracked and monitored .
Biometrics is used to identify a person based on his physical or behavioral traits .
This can be done by analyzing finger prints , recognizing facial features and scanning of iris .
Hence , biometrics which is part of surveillance technology can be used for authentication purposes (Smith , 2009) as for instance , the biometric passport which can be used to prevent thefts identity and also to conduct automatic immigration clearances .
Critics of this objection claim that our security will be at risk as the embedded secret codes can be cloned and thus allowing the hackers to enter the country illegally .
While it is true that such an event may occur , but with the advancement of technology and tighter regulations , this problem can be rectified .
Therefore , the use of biometrics passport will not only increase efficiency but also enhance security at the same time .
All in all , surveillance technology can help to improve the welfare of society by offering a tool for crime prevention , improving the healthcare system and also identifying of a person .
Hence , with the myriad advantages it can bring us , surveillance technology should not be banned .
Surveillance technologies have been around us all the while .
However , it was only after the September 11 incident that people are now paying more attention towards surveillance technologies and the issues involved .
To keep surveillance is to keep watch on someone , some group , or something .
There are various ways that surveillance can be carried out , such as through security cameras that we commonly know as closed-circuit television (CCTV) , 'Echelon' global signal eavesdropping system that the United States' National Security Agency uses , and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags .
While these technologies should be continued for tracking of people , we should approach these technologies cautiously and with the proper restrictions to prevent misuse if necessary .
Surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people because of the convenience it can bring about .
RFID tags are paper thin and thumbnail size computer chips that emit radiowaves for communication .
It can read as well as withhold biometric information such as fingerprint and photograph of the individual .
When this technology is embedded into passports , it can even record travel history .
Using these new passports could cut short the time spent for identity verification and recording when crossing the borders .
This will improve the efficiency of custom clearing process , thus saving time for travelers and improving the overall image of the country .
Surveillance technology can be a form of deterrence for potential criminals , or as a form of evidence when a crime is committed .
Drivers will be more conscious of their speed limits when speed cameras are around; shoplifters will think twice before committing when there are various security cameras in the shopping mall .
This has always been the primary means of crime deterrence to maintain a safe and secure society .
When deterrence failed , surveillance cameras would have captured the crime process , thus providing undeniable evidence that could be used to identify and convict the offender (Long , 2008) .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track people as it is not only a way to deter crimes , but also to ensure justice .
Some might argue that using surveillance cameras to record evidence is already in itself proving that the "presence of cameras had absolutely zero deterrence value" (Long , 2008) as the criminal still commits the crime even with the knowledge of being watched .
However , we have to understand that there is no certainty in deterrence .
In fact , crime rates would probably be a lot higher if there are totally no surveillance cameras around .
There are others who feel that there is an invasion of privacy when there is unquestioned tracking of people .
Individuals seem to have lost the right to decide whether they want to be monitored .
Phone calls could be tapped; and even along the common streets of orchard road , there are surveillance cameras lurking around .
There seems be a loss of personal space for individuals .
Furthermore , identity theft has been proven to occur easily for RFID technology (Expanding RFID Use Raises Privacy Concerns , 2009) where the signals can be read at a distance away from the subject , without proper consent .
Even with further encryption security , this has been proven to be easily overcome .
Thus , sensitive information of individuals could be lost unknowingly , and the idea of 'personal space' is slowly becoming obscure .
There are benefits that surveillance technologies could bring us .
In fact , it probably plays quite an integral part in our society .
This is shown by how common it is within an individual's everyday life .
In the process , there seems to be a loss of personal privacy .
However , the benefits of using surveillance technology outweigh the limitations as they could be improved with advancement in technology in the future .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people should be continued .
Surveillance technologies have become increasing popular in recent years .
Types of surveillance technologies include Cameras (CCTV) , Face- Recognition , Biometrics , RFID (radio-frequency identification) and even Cookies in web browsers (Jeffrey A 2009) .
There is no denying that surveillance technologies that are extremely useful with wide ranges of uses from monitoring traffic to the detection and prevention of crime (Jeffrey A 2009) .
However , the use of surveillance technologies to track people without prior consent will deny the person of privacy which he or she is entitled to .
Therefore surveillance technology should not be used to track people useless with prior permission .
Examples on how tracking people can compromise privacy can be drawn from the surveillance technology , RFID .
One of the most common uses of RFID is for inventory management .
Positive uses of RFID in inventory management include tracking items with toxic substances , tracking manufactured products through the supply chain and tracking pharmaceuticals to point of sale to ensure proper handling through the supply chain (Alan RP 2005) .
However , the main concern is when the product reaches the consumer .
There are three possible situations where privacy could be compromised , which are the pre-sale stage , during the sales transaction and post-sale stage .
In the pre-sale stage , when a RFID tagged item is examined by a customer , the store can monitor customers' actions .
Profiling and monitoring can then be used to track individuals and their choice of products (Alan RP 2005) .
Although this may just be the store trying to use of RFID systems to try to increase sales , it violates the personal privacy of the customer (Alan RP 2005) .
One example would be the company Prada , which uses RFID systems in dressing rooms to suggest accessories (Alan RP 2005) .
When the sales transaction takes place , the store can permanently store all personal information about the customer , including credit cards and telephone numbers and associate it with the specific item (Alan RP 2005) .
These information could then be used for many purposes like marketing activities and personal profiling based on past purchases (Alan RP 2005) .
Post-sales monitoring using RFID also poses a threat to privacy .
The RFID tags used remains attached on items even after they are purchased , which could subsequently be read when they encounter an RFID transceiver anywhere (Alan RP 2005) .
With the information , it is possible to identify the person as well as personal information such as shopping records and credit history (Alan RP 2005) .
Invasive custom marketing activities could be developed through reading of tagged items and in the worst case scenario , individual movements could be tracked by just being in possession of the items (Alan RP 2005) .
However , it does not mean that the use of RFID for tracking people will compromise privacy .
There is currently a program called NEXUS which allows U .S . and Canadian citizens to register their fingerprints , photo , and other personal data and , if approved , receive a card with an RFID tag (Alan RP 2005) .
When individuals wish to travel between the U .S . and Canada , the RFID tag allows them to be cleared though inspection in less than five seconds (Alan RP 2005) .
Not only is it convenience , because the individual already gave prior permission , it is not consider to be a breach of privacy .
In conclusion , as useful as surveillance technologies such as RFID may be , unless prior permission is given by the individual , they should not be used to track people as it is considered a breach of privacy .
With the development of science and technology , human beings are capable of tracking products , animals or even other people by using RFID (Radio-frequency identification) .
This has sparked a heated controversy (RFID-everything on RIFD , 2005) whether the surveillance , especially RFID , should be banned or not .
Although many people argue that RFID violates human rights and may raise the illegal tracking of RFID tags (RFID-everything on RIFD , 2005) , its advantages still outweigh disadvantages overwhelmingly , as RFID can not only protect human beings' possessions and security , but also enhance the efficiency of business' operation period .
Therefore , surveillance technology should not be banned in our community .
There are three main aspects that RFID will benefit human beings .
Firstly , it will contribute to ensuring the security of society , like "airport security , airline security and cruise ship security" (Greene , 2004) .
It is because RFID is able to efficiently detect terrorists and criminals who hide drugs in their bodies , all objects made by mental , all explosive devices and so on .
In this way , public's benefits are protected as much as possible .
Besides , in school , RFID can assist officers in checking people who enter and leave school so that they are capable of taking students' attendance and ensuring no unauthorized people come in simultaneously .
Hence , RFID makes great contribution to our society .
The second advantage of RFID is that it may save operation costs and gain more profits for companies .
For example , analysts from Sanford C . Bernstein (Radio Frequency Identification Technology , n .d .) say that the world's biggest retailer , Wal-Mart , saves as much as 8 .35 billion dollars per year by applying RFID in its physical counts of inventory .
It is because RFID helps to reduce Wal-Mart's operation period overwhelmingly .
It takes only five minutes to finish the job which human beings need more than one day to do .
Therefore , RFID is a good assistant for companies , as well as our society .
However , those who disagree with the use of RFID express their concerns about the illicit tracking of RFID tags (Radio-Frequency Identification , 2008) .
Admittedly , such actions may result in the abuse of tracking people and products by some hackers or criminals for bad purposes .
Nevertheless , the advantages of surveillance technology still outweigh its side effects .
For instance , it can help police to find missing people and pets; to trace phone calls and locate the places of potential criminals; and to secure the safety of each country by applying it for the passports and airports in order to prevent stowaways and criminals from both coming in and going out (Radio-Frequency Identification , 2008) .
Moreover , if government enhances the degree of secrecy of the surveillance technology , these people with evil thoughts may have a hard time to approach it .
As a result , the abuse of surveillance technology may not be a big issue .
In conclusion , the surveillance technology , RFID , should not be banned as it is able to benefit our society significantly , not only on the economics aspect , but also the human beings' security .
Therefore , surveillance , such as RFID , should be used in people's daily life .

RFID is an advanced technology using electrical objects implanting on products , animals , and even human for the purpose of surveillance through radio waves .
It has been applied widely to many areas: passport , transport payments , animal surveillance , product tracking in companies , and even human tracking .
However , the aspects of human are always controversial topics for many years .
People argue that the use of RFID for tracking people should be banned , and in my perspective , I totally agree with that statement .
The first obvious reason for banning the use of RFID to track people is the privacy .
Since human is different from animals , as well as unemotional objects , they have some basic human rights .
The most important right is the right for keeping some privacy .
The use of RFID is effective for animal tracking , but it "seems to cross a line when technology that's used for inventory management or keeping track of pets is then placed in human beings" (Sieberg ,2006) .
When using RFID for surveillance for finding crime , for instance , the official authorities you have to look at lots of sensitive and even intimate information .
The individual , aware or not aware of this using , will have his serious loss of privacy .
The second reason is the degree of security of using RFID for tracking people .
Although in a government system , the information obtained from RFID is kept , there is still a chance for hackers to read the card information and exploit the human's medical status or steal the personal identities , for example .
Through this , the hackers can assault the individual's life , or more seriously , exploit those information to assault the government and military systems .
This places our society in extreme danger .
Finally , though some may argue that RFID is a scientific progress , and we should not hinder it , the use of RFID on human may make RFID a useless , or even dangerous , technology .
Let's remind us of inventing nuclear weapons and creating wars everywhere .
Is that a real scientific progress ?
In conclusion , I advocate the ban of RFID to track people .
Using RFID is like a double knife .
It is advantageous , but do not go too far , or it will kill ourselves .
The word 'Surveillance' originally came from France where it means 'to watch over' in French .
Surveillance technology has a history dated back as early as 1965 , where the first closed circuit television (CCTV) was used in the police force in the United States in public places (Roberts , 2005) .
The definition of surveillance technology is the ongoing monitoring of people or information to detect changes in trends or distribution to initiate investigative or control measures (The Joint Comission , 2006) .
The two most common and effective types of surveillance today is the global positioning system (GPS) and the radio frequency identification (RFID) .
The benefits of surveillance technology conspicuously outweigh the concerns about human privacy issues that are so often brought up by human rights bodies and the law (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
This is because this intelligent technology aids in crime prevention , social control and threat monitoring .
Surveillance technology helps prevent crime .
The presentation of crime across the media for the past 30 years via television news , drama series , reality televisions , etc . , has indicated that crime is a feature of modern life , and the government cannot protect the public by itself (Knepper , Doak , & Shapland , 2009) .
It is therefore important to allow surveillance technology to work hand-in-hand with the police force to overcome criminal puzzles without the redundant concerns over human privacy .
For example , GPS 24/7 continuous real-time tracking of and individual , and is considered several times more powerful than the traditional visual surveillance often exercised by the police force (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
According to FOXNews .com on the 21st Of May , 2006 , the authorities can now track dangerous sex offenders with GPS without keeping them in prison at taxpayer's expenses , even after serving their time .
In 1999 , the murder case of Valiree by William 'Brad' Jackson was solved with concrete evidence when the police force obtained a warrant to install a GPS transmitter on his truck and successfully tracked his movement to certain places which led to the discovery of the victim's body .
While there are opponents raising the issue of invasion of privacy towards an individual and also the trustworthiness of the law enforcement personnel to act appropriately , justification can be done by the effectiveness of surveillance technology in bringing justice (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
It would be absurd to compromise the credibility of tracking and bringing a criminal case into light just to preserve the basic individual right to privacy .

Surveillance technology also aids social control .
RFID-tagging in certain commercial products has been widely practiced in the retail stores in the United States , namely Wal-Mart , for the purpose of convenient inventory tracking .
Also , RFID chips are being implanted or tagged onto products to monitor the habits of consumers .
The tracking of a consumer who makes regular purchase of a certain product can be identified and it can be deduced whether the amount of purchase over a period of time is within an acceptable range or at a threatening level .
This type of use of RFID is called 'item-level' , which may raise consumer privacy concerns .
RFID- tagging is able to track consumer behavior , which is digitally recorded for only the company's use and also other parties upon valid requests , such as affiliated companies and even to the federal government (Hariton , Lawford , & Palihapitiya , 2006) .
For example , excessive purchase of cigarettes may explain the cause of certain health hazard such as respiratory disease of a consumer .
Quick access to the lifestyle of a patient helps in effective diagnosis of the patient's diseases in the future .
Furthermore , surveillance technology can assist in monitoring potential threats .
In a more specific context , monitoring is crucial to suppress transnational crime .
Strict measures have been taken to detect and anticipate any potential terrorist attack .
Since the 9/11 incident , the United States has been keen to negotiate treaties with foreign countries on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA): a body which ensures individuals cannot evade prosecution simply because the evidence of prosecution is located abroad (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
With the speed and accuracy of GPS to track any suspects related to terrorism and crime , it is crucial to identify any formidable plans or plots before disaster strikes , something which could save lives and properties .
So what are the moral and ethical issues behind surveillance practice ?
We cannot estimate the power of data accessibility , and this greatly challenges the established basic individual right to privacy .
The balance between personal privacy and national security lies on a fine line (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
However , the importance of the latter often outweighs the sacrifice of individual interest , with conditions that surveillance is done within the expectations of the people .
For instance , a person should not expect full privacy in public places such as the streets or a shopping place .
In conclusion , surveillance technology to track people should not be banned due to the benefits it bestows: such as the prevention of crime , detection of danger , as well as the monitoring social behavior .
With every advent of technology , there are always cons trailing the pros that it brings .
We should seek credible solutions for issues which arise instead of prohibiting an intelligent invention of mankind .
Intelligence can never be confined; banning can therefore never stop intelligence .

The history of video surveillance -- from VCR's to eyes in the sky .
Retrieved October 1 , 2009 , from http://www .video- surveillance-guide .com/history-of-video-surveillance .htm .
Over the years , surveillance technology has advanced drastically and it has slowly integrate into our daily life where video cameras can be commonly seen monitoring us in shopping centre , workplaces and residential areas .
The monitoring of one's movements and activities is introduced to ensure our safety and prevent crimes .
However it has also raised concerns that we are monitored just like criminal .
Thus , it violates one's privacy and hinders one's freedom .
This also indicates a loss in mutual trust within individuals .
In addition , surveillance technology that appears beneficial in protecting our safety actually has limitations in crime detection and prevention .
Therefore , since the disadvantages of surveillance technology outweigh its benefits , it should not be use to track people .
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology threatens our human right of privacy .
Surveillance technology allow others to monitor our daily activities and record these data in the form of CCTV (closed-circuit television) images , communication records and content enabling them to have access to our personal information .
(Ball , K . , Lyon , D . , Wood , D .M . , Norris , C . & Raab , C . 2006) .
This information can be misused by individuals with ill intention , using it to manipulate us for their own benefit .
In addition , according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 12 , it states that "no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence" (United Nations , 2009) .
Thus , since surveillance technology infringes our privacy , it should not be used to track people .
Secondly , surveillance technology breaks social relationship and family bonds due to the loss of trust .
For instance , some employers would install surveillance monitors in their workplaces to track the activities of their employee (Ball , K . & et al .
2006) .
This would subject the employees to constant fear of committing mistakes if they are aware that they had been monitored , it could diminish their moral which in return affect their productivity and efficiency at work .
Furthermore , parents would resort in using webcams and GPS systems to check on their children' activities (Ball , K . & et al .
2006) instead of trying to communicate with their children to understand the friends they mixed with and to find out their whereabouts .
This monitoring action causes a loss of mutual trust between the parent and child which is a foundation to build a strong family bond .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it creates suspicion between individuals causing the loss of trust .
(Ball , K . & et al .
2006) .
On the other hand , supporters of surveillance technology state that surveillance technology plays an important role in crime detection and prevention thus maintaining the country's security and prevent terrorist attacks .
However , in reality surveillance technology is inefficient in crime detection and prevention providing minimal protection for us .
Surveillance technology usually only focuses on tracking down criminals after the crime was committed and the damage was done .
For instance , a Metropolitan Police report stated that only one crime was solved by the 1000 CCTV cameras placed across London revealing that CCTV has minimum effectiveness but contributes to massive expenses .
(BBC News , 2009) .
Hence , since surveillance technology is ineffective in crime detection and prevention , it should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , it is evident that the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it not only threatens one's privacy inhibiting them from exercising freedom but the use of surveillance technology also poses unknown potential health hazards in individuals .
In addition , it creates suspicion in individuals causing them to loss mutual trust for one another resulting in breaking of social relationship and family bonds .
Nevertheless , surveillance technology has limited efficiency in crime prevention hence it should not be use to track people since it fails to protect us .
Surveillance technology refers to the use of technology to monitor the behaviors or actions of people , usually in a surreptitious way .
Our most familiar types of such technology include cameras , computers , biometric or aerial surveillances .
As technology progresses , the rate of use of radio- frequency identification (RFID) , which is the use of a tag applied to livestock or people for the purpose of tracking or identification , has skyrocketed in many areas , ranging from government , hospitals to schools .
As an unavoidable consequence , it raises ethical issue , which states that such penetrating technology has invaded people's privacy because more and more personal habits and behaviors are monitored without permission .
However , I think that the use of such technology could be justified if the benefits it brings to the public outweigh the harms it brings to the individual .
It is demonstrated in hospitals , crimes and workplace .
Hence , the surveillance technology such as RFID should be used .
Firstly , the surveillance technology can be used in hospitals to monitor movements of its patients in case of emergency .
In conjunction with a video surveillance system to cover different regions of the hospital , it can track the patients' movements any time at any corners of the hospital .
When the subject enters a restricted area or has an emergency , the hospital can immediately know the whereabouts of the subject .
For example , in 2003 , a scenario of applying an RFID based tracking system during the SARS outbreak was demonstrated in two Singapore hospitals .
During the trial , the movement of people in the hospitals can be recorded (Adi T , September 2006) .
Thus , in this case , it is undisputable that the surveillance technology should be used to track people .
The most controversial issue about the use of surveillance technology would be ethical issue regarding people's privacy , which is strongly demonstrated in workplace privacy .
RFIDs in the workplace are attached to employees' identification cards or clothes so that the employer can track their movements any time .
For instance , RFID tags are placed in 80000 employee uniforms at the Star City Casino in Sydney Australia (Gruber , J .) .
Some people say that the install of such technology reduces the employees to robots , deprived their individuality to only-working-machines so as to achieve maximum productivity .
The employers monitor every movement of the employees during the break or even after hours .
This has intruded employees' privacy and thus should not be used .
However , I beg to argue that such RFID tags are only used within the workplace during the working time and when employees work in their positions , the company's privacy outweighs the individual privacy .
With RFID tags , the employers can combine the data together and better study the workplace pattern so as to improve efficiency .
Tagging employees can also reduce human errors and measure time .
The employees should sacrifice such individual privacy during the office time and cooperate with employers to make greater achievements for the workplace .
As a result , I think that the surveillance technology should be used .
In conclusion , I think the surveillance technology should be used as its benefits outweigh its harms .
It is useful in tracking patients in hospitals , criminals after they committed crimes and employees in workplace .
The individual privacy should be put aside when the benefit of public plays a more important role .
Surveillance technology such as RFID(radio-frequency identification) , GPS(Global Positioning System) and security cameras are used to monitor the action of public .
After the September 11 attack , the use of such technology has become more prevalent so as to increase security level (Vedo Soft 2006) .
It is also used to monitor those who require special attention such as Alzheimer's patients to ensure that they receive appropriate and quick medication during emergency .
Thus , on a whole , its advantages clearly outweigh its disadvantages such as individual's privacy .
Hence , it should be used appropriately to track people .
Firstly , using surveillance technology for crime prevention is far more important than individual privacy .
The presence of security cameras in public places helps to reduce crime rates as criminal fear that their actions will be recorded .
This will make the public feel safer .
According to park officials of Balboa park in San Diego , California , nine months after the installation of surveillance system , the crime rates has been reduced in all aspects and more people visits the park as they feel more secured (Nieto 1997) .
In Singapore , the Safety and Security Watch Group (SSWG) Scheme was introduced in 2006 so that the business community will be more prepared to fight crime and terrorism threats effectively(Singapore Police Force 2006) .
One of the common methods to ensure this is by surveillance technology and this has significantly helped Singapore to be one of the country with the lowest crime rates .
Opponents of surveillance technology may argue that it overwrites individual's privacy .
However , it is nearly impossible to always protect an individual's privacy as it may overlap with another individual's human right .
In this case , if surveillance technology is not implemented so as to protect individual's privacy , millions of innocent lives may be in danger  .
Furthermore , the surveillance technology is only used for security .
Thus , there is no need to fear when there is no crime done .
In addition , there are laws and regulation that is implemented to prevent the abuse of such technology .
Secondly , surveillance technology has been proven to be effective for social control as it helps to monitor those who needs special attention such as Alzheimer's patients .
Mary Barnes , the president of Alzheimer's Community Care , believes that RFID chip implanted in Alzheimer's patients allow medical facilities and information to be quickly and easily accessible for them (Richford 2007) .
Together with GPS , it is also able to track their location and detect if they are in danger .
This can also be used for other patients that requires special attention like heart and lung disease especially when it involves children and older generation .
This is useful as the caretaker may not be able to attend these patients 24 hours a day .
Thus , RFID help to ease their work but increase the efficiency simultaneously .
One may argue that the RFID chips might have side-effects on the patient's health .
It has been said that the RFID might lead to cancer .
However , there is no strong scientific evidence to show that it is harmful to the patient's health .
According to TIME magazine article written by Morrissey , a study conducted in 2006 showed that 4% of the 1 ,260 mice implanted with RFID developed tumors .
However , none of them are malignant .
In addition , Dr McGill said "Even if you put in a bland piece of plastic , it will produce tumors in rats and mice ,"(Morrissey 2007) .
Furthermore , the RFID tag has been approved by the U .S . Food and Drug Association(Richford 2007) .
In conclusion , the benefits that surveillance technology has brought to the society is far more advantageous than its unclear disadvantages .
"Should the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ?"
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has advanced from industrial and animal tagging applications to being able to track people's movements (Friedlos , 2009; Kanellos , 2004; Masters & Michael , 2006) .
This technology has brought about privacy and security issues (Kanellos , 2004; Masters & Michael , 2006) .
However , the benefits of RFID outweigh these issues .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID enhances personnel management .
Efficient employee monitoring can be accomplished by tagging employees with RFID tags and installing readers within building premises .
Some companies made it compulsory for their staff to wear RFID tags to facilitate personnel identification and access control (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
RFID critics argue that the start-up cost for a fully operational RFID system is high .
Companies have to purchase tags (US $0 .20 - $50 each) , readers (UHF reader: US $500 - $3 ,000) , middleware (may be US $183 ,000) , upgrade system networks and pay installation fees (RFID Journal , 2005) .
However , companies will reap benefits in the long run .
Also , costs will come down as technology improves (RFID Journal , 2005) .
Thus , RFID can be used to improve management .
Secondly , RFID helps to reduce and solve crimes .
RFID can be used to monitor people who may pose a threat to society .
Knowing that they are being spied on , they will have less tendency to commit crimes .
Prison violence was reduced by up to 60% in some United States prisons that had RFID installed (Kanellos , 2004) .
Furthermore , data retrieved from RFID readers can serve as evidence against suspects to solve crimes (Kanellos , 2004) .
Opponents of RFID technology argue that implanted RFID tags cause cancer .
Implanted RFID tags were observed to cause tumours in laboratory animals (Albrecht , 2007) .
This concern is not necessary , because external tags can be used .
Overall , RFID is effective and beneficial in reducing and solving crimes .
Thirdly , RFID allows optimal patient care and safety in hospitals .
Tracking of medical professionals allows them to receive notification immediately when a patient needs help .
Tracking of patients ensures patient's safety by noticing if the patient is at the right place at the right time .
For example , in the United States , South Tyneside District Hospital tagged newborns with RFID tags , and hid RFID readers at exit points (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Unauthorized removal of baby would trigger the alarm thus enhancing baby safety (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Currently , Tan Tock Seng Hospital is using ThermoSensors , a new RFID tag which is capable of patient location tracking and body temperature monitoring (Friedlos , 2009) .
This has enhanced patient care as nurses have more time for other patients and are notified immediately when patient has a fever (Friedlos , 2009) .
Unfortunately , there are several security and privacy concerns .
But , these concerns can be addressed by giving individuals the choice of using RFID technology and freedom to remove tags when desired (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Hence , RFID should be used to enhance patient care and safety .
In conclusion , it is evident that RFID benefits the defense and healthcare sector .
It helps to enhance management , reduce crimes and enable optimal patient care .
Thus , the use of RFID technology to track people should not be stopped .
The use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned
During the recent years there has been an increasing uptake of the surveillance technology .
This kind of technology usually refers to the monitoring of behavior , activities , or other changing information of people and often in a surreptitious manner .
(Wikipedia , 2009) .
And the current technology has made it possible for the surveillance system into a wide-spread use in our daily life , such as electronic payment , supply chain management , and livestock .
(Postnote , 2004) .
But there are also some moral and ethical issues surrounding this technology , like whether this kind of technology such as RFID (radio frequency ID) should be used to track people .
Some argues that the tracking should be banned for it may causes serious outcomes related to the violation of privacy .
But I do not think it is reasonable to forgo this advanced technology for it really plays a great role in the areas related to healthcare and government , and the potential negative impacts brought by can be reduced or avoided if the regulations around it tend to be sounder and sounder .
I will further elaborate on my stand based on the above two aspects .
Second , the problems as regards to the privacy brought by the technology could be reduced or even avoided when the regulations around it tends to be more and more perfect .
In fact , many great inventions and breakthroughs in the humans history have got positive and negative aspects , such as the automobiles which have brought great convenience to people while causing large damages to the environment by emitting pollution gases .
And we just cannot stop using the automobiles .
The only thing we can do is to improve their efficiency and seek new and green power supplies for them to make them as environmental-friendly as possible .
As with the surveillance technology , we have to adopt it while making a great effort to establish a complete and reasonable set of principles surrounding it to make it more acceptable .
We just cannot stop having food even though we are afraid of choking .
In conclusion , surveillance technology has brought great benefits to our life and is accounting more and more in the hospital and government related areas .
And we should try our best to eliminate its negative effects on the privacy field instead of banning its use to tracking people .
http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Surveillance Electronic surveillance in hospitals:A review  ,by Sue Kennedy@2006
The last two decades witnessed drastic development in material science and digital processing technology , which made Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) , an advanced surveillance technology applied in the business and tracking world .
This controversial issue aroused wide concern from society , for RFID made tracking people easier .
While some hold that it intrudes people's privacy intensely , it in fact protects people in certain fields and makes life easier .
Thus , due to the advantages of RFID technology , it should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID can help to protect special groups of people .
For instance , this human use of it can be implanted in the elderly people who are suffering degenerative diseases .
(Surveillance Studies Network , 2006) Since it is so dangerous for elderly people with sick brain condition to get lost , carrying RFID chips enable their families to locate them .
Thus , it not only eliminates danger for those elderly people , but also reduces the worrying time and effort for their families .
Moreover , for some construction project with high fatality rates , obviously we need more accurate and reliable technology to protect workers during the programs .
RFID enables us to provide accurate position of every worker who carries its tag .
Hence , it allows workers to be rescued quickly and reliably in case of an emergency .
This high-tech system was used in the second Gotthard tunnel grogram and other companied like Kronos Titan , Leverkusen (Germany)in the chemical sector for production of hazardous materials .
(Hansen & Gilbert , 2008)
Secondly , RFID is an efficient and reliable surveillance tool to watch people who carry underlying threat .
For the prisoners in custody , it is necessary to watch and track them in case of adding crime .
(Surveillance Studies Network , 2006) Meanwhile , using RFID to keep watching those employees working for high-security areas confers benefits that are clear and compelling .
Hence , it is so necessary and sufficient for us to apply RFID technology to such areas .
In conclusion , RFID as a surveillance technology should not be banned as it protects special groups of people and help to watch people who have potential threat to our society .
Surveillance technology is necessary in today's society (Evans , 2008) , although some people may feel that it is an invasion of privacy (Kanellos , 2004) .
Using surveillance technology to track people has benefitted people in three areas , socially , in the medical field and in the military sector .
It should therefore not be banned .
Socially , surveillance technology is used to track people .
Radio frequency identification (RFID) chips and tags are used to track people .
It is a boon for parents looking for their children amidst a large crowd , like in an amusement park (Fortune magazine , 2004) .
Employers can also track the location of their employees to ensure that they are safe , especially at hazardous worksites (Intelleflex Corporation , 2009) using RFID badges .
Another way would be to implant RFID chips under their skin .
Citywatcher .com , a surveillance company , is one of those companies to have RFID chips implanted in their employees' arms (Gruber , n .d .) for safety measures .
However , RFID chips implanted under the skin are difficult to remove as they could migrate under the skin (American Medical Association , 2008) and not all employees want to be implanted with these chips .
This however is not a problem as many states have banned employers from forcing employees to receive a RFID implant (Jones , 2007) .
Therefore , surveillance technology should not be banned since there are counter-measures in place and less invasive methods like the RFID tags available .

Another sector using surveillance technology to track people would be the medical field .
Maternity wards in hospitals ensure that babies are not swapped accidentally with the help of RFID tags (Fortune magazine , 2004) .
Patients are also given RFID tags to wear so that should they begin to collapse , aid can be given to them immediately (Kanellos , 2004) .
RFID tags are also used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's disease according to Kanellos (2004) to prevent them from getting lost .
The RFID tags are broken once patients are discharged so the bed can be prepared for new patients so waiting time would be reduced .
Consequently , if nurses did not break the tag , disorder might result since the bed is no longer occupied but the housekeeping team is not informed .
Surgeries can also proceed smoothly and timely as both staff and patients can be tracked since they are wearing the tags .
This clearly shows that surveillance technology brings about many benefits so it should not be banned .
Surveillance technology is essential in the military sector to track enemies and to search and rescue soldiers .
Technology like the Global positioning system (GPS) is used to track enemies from the air (Gately , 2009) , while the artesian radar and SPY-1 radar is used to monitor the sea (Evans , 2008) .
All these technologies are to deter and detect enemies so countries are not caught unawares should enemies invade .
However , these systems are not without flaws as it was reported that Korean Air Lines Flight 007 strayed and was shot down in a Soviet no-fly zone (Gately , 2009) .
To address this issue , civilians are now able to use the GPS to ensure that they do no stray into these zones although usage is limited (Gately , 2009) .
Downed pilots are also located and rescued efficiently .
U .S . Air Force pilot , Captain Scott O'Grady was rescued within hours with the help of the GPS (LANDAIRSEA , 2009) .
Hence , these technologies should not be banned as it efficiently locates enemies , save lives and at the same time ensures that civilians are not harmed by the new regulations .
In conclusion , there are some issues about using surveillance technologies to track people in the social , medical and military aspects .
Nevertheless , using surveillance technology to track people has brought about many benefits and there are regulations to ensure that these technologies would not be abused .
Hence it should not be banned .

Surveillance technology refers to the use of technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) to observe the activities of certain people or things , in particular to gather information .
Apart from RFID , there are many types of surveillance technology such as computer , camera , mobile , aerial and biometric surveillance .
Although the use of surveillance technology , especially to track people , has raised many ethical issues because it intrudes people's privacy , I believe that it should not be banned .
However , one has to take note of the limit as in the extent of its implementation and purposes .
If the benefits it can bring supersede the violation of the individual right , then logically it should be implemented .
Firstly , surveillance technology can be used for security and deterrent to prevent crimes .
The concept of human tagging has been widely accepted , but one has to take note on its purpose .
Applied Digital Solution produced sub-dermal RFID tags in late 90s and it has found many applications nowadays .
For those regions where kidnapping are more prevalent such as Mexico , children tagging can actually help their parent identify them after many years or it can serve as a mean to deter kidnapping because parent can locate their children using gadgets (Wired , February 2000) .
However , some may say that it brings back the nightmare of the images of George Orwell's novel with human tagging as RFID takes away the privacy of the person being monitored , but RFID is not being used on the entire population .
It is just used in specific area or person who actually benefits from its application such as in the case of child kidnapping .
The parents have the authoritative rights for the well-being of their children .
Thus , surveillance technology should not be banned but one has to take note of the purpose of its application .
Secondly , the application of surveillance technology has found its use in sports .
With the RFID tag being clipped on runners' shoes , organisers can record the running time of every runner easily and accurately .
It brings great ease to the organisers of the marathon races in which there are so many contestants .
The reason why it is so difficult to track and record accurately in the past is that in such a big event , it may take about one hour for certain runners to even reach the starting point and start the race .
For this case , there is no ethical issue involved so surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
Fourthly , we have seen the application of surveillance technology in health care to tag its patients .
The purpose is to make sure the medical records actually tally with the patients being described .
It can provide information such as patients' allergies and it is extremely crucial to ensure correct association .
Critics may argue that we can also use wrist bands in which there are barcodes on the patients .
However , there is a tendency that one makes mistakes in typing on a keyboard .
Thus , those printed labels are susceptible to errors so it is not that reliable .
Since we have a better technology to ensure the accuracy , I see no reason to ban such surveillance technology .
Moreover , patients are supposed to be monitored so privacy issues are no concern here .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned , but one has to take not of the purposes of its applications .
Its applications in child kidnapping , marathon races , security of a country and health care have brought great benefits to human beings .
The benefits actually supersede the violation of people's privacy or in some case it does not violate at all .
We have seen that the identification technology has progressed in leaps and bounds over the last few decades .
One good example of such applications is the usage of RFID , a cutting-edge technology that uses radio waves for the purpose of tracking and monitoring .
There are however , variety of issue raised associated with the appropriateness to deploy RFID technology to track individuals .
This is primarily due to the fear of privacy invasion , dehumanization , and the social impact of mass surveillance after putting such technology in place .
Nonetheless , despite RFID is still progressing in its infancy stage , it is seen to possess uncapped potential and can be put into valuable uses , especially in connection with hospital- patient identification , anti-theft tracking as well as in government agencies for identification purpose .
Firstly , RFID system can be utilized widely in hospital in-patient identification .The system can be used to monitor the whereabouts of patients and also medical personnel staffs in the hospital .
One good advantage about the device is that it does not require line-of-sight monitoring .
RFID allows health conditions of patients such as blood pressure , heart rate and blood sugar level to be kept in check from time to time with ease .
These records contain both medical chart information and digital photos to minimize the frequency of surgical errors and improve the efficiency of operating rooms during the clinical process .
(Pye ,2008) In addition , implementation of RFID tag is highly useful in tracking the location of Alzheimer's patient .
It ensures a higher level of security and also allows nurses to administer more patients at a time .
Opponents of RFID surveillance may voice concerns over the health hazards posed as a result of over exposure to radioactivity which may lead to cancer .
However , research done has revealed a small and insignificant correlation of cancer risk to RFID .
Secondly , the sophisticated tracking technology can be put into good use in combating theft and retrieving lost items in department stores .
Unlike barcodes , RFID do not need to be placed precisely relative to the scanner .
The adoption of RFID for "logistics units and higher-value , lower volume items" is believed to simultaneously improve the supply chain efficiency as well as prevent property crime .
(Raza , 2008) .
RFID provides tight security that allows merchandise to be tracked effectively .
Whilst some opined that the use of RFID is not favoured due to its expensive nature , its effectiveness is much higher than that of the conventional tracking system .
Thus , it is relatively more cost-saving in a long run .
Thirdly , another application of RFID technology that is currently in use in government agencies is that the setting up of centralized nationwide database that would maintain a complete medical history and other relevant information of a person .
Swedberg (2004) cited that in countries like New Zealand , Pakistan , as well as Malaysia have embedded RFID chips in their citizen's identification card .
Public transportation systems worldwide use RFID enabled system to track and bill use of the services .
RFID chips are also being used in identification cards in corporations and school to control unauthorized access .
One may argue that these can lead to potential infringement of confidentiality should one's personal information leak out .
However , the worries are unnecessary since the increasingly secure and private operations that are being set up could reduce the possibility of unintended access to information .
With all that have been said , the advantages of the usage of RFID clearly outweigh the drawbacks of the technology .
There is a need for social control of higher security and safety .
Nevertheless , RFID remains the least intrusive technology that allows us to achieve the objective .
It is undeniable that there are far-fetched controversial issues surrounding the use of RFID which requires deep consideration by all of us .
One needs to understand the benefits being brought about by RFID in different sectors .
Hence , this labor-saving technology should be utilized optimally as it is capable of bringing numerous benefits and conveniences to the society .
The rapid development of technology has made it possible for a person to track other people by using surveillance technology .
Surveillance technology is a new technology to monitor and find out other people's activities and behavior .
There are many kinds of surveillance technology and RFID is one of them .
RFID is Radio Frequency Identification that uses electromagnetic spectrum to transmit signal so that we can locate the exact position of someone .
However , as a new technology arises , there may be some controversies that follow and RFID is no exception .
On one side , some people think that surveillance technology should not be used to track other people because it intrudes other people's privacy .
On the other hand , some argue that this technology should be used , especially for security reason .
However , because of many detrimental effects that occur , the usage of surveillance technology to track other people should be banned .
On the other hand , some people may think that the usage of RFID to track other people will turn out to be beneficial especially if it is operated for security purpose such as surveillance security camera .
By using this technology , all of the activities that are happening can be viewed through camera so it is important to organize the security of the place (Burnell ,2007) .
The other use of RFID that some people think could bring advantage is RFID microchip implanted inside human body , especially in those who suffer chronic illness such as Alzheimer or Dementia .
This technology will help their family to identify their positions whenever they get lost .
However , in fact , the usage of RFID could increase crime rates .
The hacker can track other people's data far easier , causing numerous unmanaged conditions .
They can take advantage of the information they get by threatening or manipulating others .
Moreover , by being able to track people wherever they go , the tracker can do unpleasant actions to those people without much difficulty .
First and foremost , usage of surveillance technology in hospital can improve the success rate of cure especially for emergency cases .
(Kennedy , 2006) Timing always plays a key role in surgery or even in other processes of curing or healing which the public might not aware of it .
In many cases , the faster the surgeries can be carry out the higher the success rate of the surgeries are .
There are cases which the main reason for surgical failure is that the surgeries did not carry out in time .
Does not it sound pity to you ?
In many cases lives of the patients can be saved if the surgeries did carry out on time .
Surveillance technology provide a good solution for this problem by helping the hospital to shorten the time to locate their staffs , the equipment , and most important the patients .
As tracking of the staffs and the patients is such important in the medical field , surveillance technology should be allowed to use to track people .
Besides that , surveillance technology also can contribute in crime prevention and detection .
({http://www .spygearco .com/blog/index .php/how-to-prevent-crime-using-surveillance/}[HYPERLINK: http://www .spygearco .com/blog/index .php/how-to-prevent-crime-using-surveillance/]) Information provided by surveillance is considered as a strong source of evidence in detection of crime .
For example , police can confirm or disprove an alibi or even can find out the whole criminal process as it can be recorded if there is a surveillance device .
In some western countries like USA , England and others surveillance technology has been widely used to monitor public action , when a crime happen , cob can track down the crime very efficient .
As a result , we can bring down the criminal rate by using surveillance technology .
Last but not least , people find that their privacy is being infringed by the technology so some of them react aggressively and try to ban the technology .
However , coin has two faces we should not emphasis too much at the disadvantages of the technology but should try the best to overcome the problem .
Banning the technology in fact is the worst way to solve the problem .
I believe , with the effort put in by the government , lawmaker , the public and others we will be able to use the technology in a perfect way in near future .
In other words we should show our demand for surveillance technology which work in a better way but not trying to ban the technology .
In conclusion , since surveillance technology has bring a lot of advantages to us and has potential to become less harm to the public in the future we should support the technology as it is one of the way to improve our living standard by lowering criminal rate and enhance medical standard .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Cameras on streets , GPS (Global Positioning System) on vehicles , RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags on products , animals and people , as well as mobile phones on hands are typical in today's world .
We have developed into a surveillance society due to great advancement in technology .
Such technology provides higher security as it facilitates the monitoring and tracking of people and their actions .
However , this has also caused a controversy where some argued that surveillance technology has invaded their privacy to a very large extent .
In my opinion , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned as we must protect ourselves from threats such as terrorism which may potentially have a massive impact on our vulnerable lives .
Firstly , surveillance technology in RFID tagging can be used to track terrorists and criminals .
This increases convenience and efficiency as more criminals can be easily tracked using such tags and their actions can be monitored closely which can help in combating crimes .
On the other hand , RFID tagging can also be used on patients for nurses or doctors to keep an eye on them in case they have inappropriate actions such as moving towards unsafe areas or they suffer from a sudden organ failure .
Therefore , it is crucial for the existence of such technology so that we can live in a safer environment .
However , critics argued that surveillance technology has greatly intruded their personal space where they have this psychological feeling of 'being watched' by others on every single day .
To think of it , would you rather want a safe environment which your privacy may be compromised , or to choose privacy over safety ?
Everyone has different perception on privacy .
Therefore its bias to say that surveillance technology threatens one's privacy to a huge extent .
Furthermore , mobile phones , WI-FI (wireless fidelity) as well as satellites also have the ability to track people's actions .
They are still widely in use nowadays .
Thus surveillance technology has become a necessity rather than a burden as we cannot do without it .
In conclusion , surveillance technology has undoubtedly brought us great convenience despite the fact that one's privacy is marginally sacrificed .
Cameras have aided in many areas such as shops , traffic junctions and even within the household where parents can monitor their children at home while at work , ensuring that their children are safe and sound .
Hence , surveillance technology should not be banned as it is crucial in the modern society where there are threats around us and the only way to prevent such threats is through the use of such brilliant technology .
Surveillance is the process of monitoring the behaviours and activities , usually of people without their permission .
Lots of surveillance tools are invented , such as CCTV (close circuit television) cameras , RFID (radio-frequency identification) , GPS (global positioning system) etc .
Extensive and growing use of electronic surveillance technology has resulted in considerable debate especially the ethical questions concerning privacy .
Although it appears to be breaching the privacy of communities , surveillance technology has in fact enabled to track the public's health , ensured the public safety and monitored the employees in companies .
Therefore , I fully agree that the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
First of all , surveillance technology should not be banned as it has enabled the tracking of health of public .
By means of somatic surveillance , information like heart rate and hormone levels can be translated into data for medical purposes .
The implantation of RFID into the body facilitates the proper identification of hospital patients .
Besides that , it can supply detailed body information to hospitals and then public can alter their behaviours like exercise and diet after the interpretation from doctors .
With the implants , RFID chips may convey the messages regarding health conditions of patients , such as those with epilepsy , heart disease , or mental impairment , especially for those who are unable to communicate effectively with hospital staff about their medical histories or current complaints when they are in need of immediate treatment .
In addition , it also decreases the slight discrepancy of diagnosis by doctor due to the influence of their experiences .
The embedded chip can provide accurate and objective information of patients .
Thus , surveillance technology to track the health of communities aids in reducing the mortality rate due to health problems and also decreasing the misinterpretation of verbal communication by the doctors .
Secondly , surveillance technology can be used by employers to monitor their employees during working hours .
This is very crucial as to ensure that the productivity and the efficiency of workers are kept to a maximum .
For instance , employees might seem to be surfing the web for business purposes at all time , but what they are actually doing is personal business such as online banking , shopping and chatting .
Skiving and loafing of employees cause companies to lose many man hours and resources .
If the behaviour of employees at work is monitored , they will work more efficiently and contribute to the company .
It has been argued that one's privacy might be invaded due to surveillance technology (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , monitoring can take place under suitable circumstances and to an appropriate extent as it is only installed at the working places .
It has also been said that surveillance of employees can affect the relationship between employer and employees (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , this only applies to those minority spending most of the time online doing personal things and do not meet the company's goals .
Using of surveillance technology has no impact for those focusing on work and doing the right thing (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
Furthermore , security issue is very essential for factories manufacturing coins and jewelleries .
Surveillance cameras can trace the movement of the workers .
Suspicious behaviour by the employees can be reviewed by their employers through the electronic records .
This can alleviate the theft rate in the factories .
As a result , surveillance technology can facilitate the employers to monitor their workers with an extent of not breaching their privacy .
Moreover , surveillance technology is vital in ensuring the safety of public .
Through video and satellite surveillance , polices can track the movement of dangerous criminals and terrorists .
Besides that , tracking of missing or kidnapped children (Stump , 2008 , para .1) is made possible too .
With the help of CCTV cameras , the whole criminal processes can be recorded .
By that time , polices are able to trace the culprits' physical appearance and vehicle's number .
Then , the time taken to solve the criminal cases is tremendously reduced , compared with the crime not being recorded .
The video recorded becomes a concrete proof to subject the culprits for sanction .
Eventually , public security is guaranteed .
On the other hand , for those having disease like Alzheimer's disease , surveillance technology facilitate in finding them out if they get lost in somewhere else .
Similarly , those running away from home , possibly caused by family factors or mental problems , can be tracked via CCTV cameras in the shortest period .
This prevents them from doing things that are unfavourable or irrational .
Hence , public safety can be ensured by the utilization of surveillance technology .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned as it ensures the health and safety of public , besides being used to monitor the performance of employees .
If we persist with banning of surveillance technology , public will be exposed to a dangerous environment in which crime will happen frequently .
After that , crime will lead to adverse consequences to the individual , then to the country and finally to the world .
Without the surveillance , the decreased productivity of workers may bring the unemployment issue to the surface again .
Although until now there are still many debates about the ethical issues of surveillance technology , it after all still benefits the communities in many perspectives , so banning of surveillance technology should not be initiated .
"The use of surveillance technology such as Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) to track people should be banned ."
My stand is to control and not a total ban .
The increasing use of technology has done much for mankind .
It has changed many aspects of our lives and has unknowingly penetrated ubiquitously into our society making many of us dependent on it .
Even though technological advances proves to be a marvel as we move faster into the future , it does not only bring about benefits but also negative repercussions if not dealt with properly .
Surveillance has been around for hundreds of years but technology has 'springboard' it to a much higher level .
Due to this drastic change and lack of legislation , many have used new gadgets to their benefits even if it is against human rights .
Of course , surveillance technology does have its benefits to the society in terms of safety and security but does it outweigh the undesirable problems that it brings ?
Tracking of personnel has always been in the spotlight because it steps too much into the boundaries of human rights .
The use of miniature tracking devices to trail the whereabouts of one's 'target' has kept human rights activist in action .
One such example dates back to an article "Challenge over tracking devices" , posted on the 21st of November 2000 by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) , where a security company is taken to court under Britain's new human rights law to remove all tracking devices in their vans .
Of course , the company has its reasons to do so such as tracking their vehicles and also providing better service to their customers .
Yet many have argued that it is against human rights and thus promote the banning of tracking devices .
Undeniably surveillance technologies do overlap with human rights law , but more often than not , the use of these technologies bring about more benefits than negative consequences .
It boils down to the purpose of these technologies and how one uses it .
In conclusion , there should not be a complete ban of the use of surveillance but adequate control by oneself or a governing body to restrict the abuse of this powerful tool .
Surveillance technology and security has become crucial to each country since the terrorist attack in the US on Sept 11 .
Surveillances technology is the use of devices to monitor any behaviour , activities or other changing information that is deemed to be important to any government or personnel's security .
But this has gone too far , with security came the lost of personal privacy .
Own freedom is compromised and with much hesitant , I do not agree that surveillance technology should be use to track people .
Personal privacy is our very own right .
We live our own way and nobody have the right to monitor or dictate our actions .
Why should they ?
Be it the government's security reasons or other excuses , they have no right to impose such a technology on others without our permission .
Public concern for personal and data privacy has also gained momentum in recent years , with government responding by forming an inter-ministerial committee to review the need for a data protection law (Sim , n .d .) .
Secondly , it erodes trust and creates a climate of fear in the person being monitor and the people around them .
Fear is a very strong tool and terrorists use it to create mayhem and destruction in our lives .
Fear causes psychological problems such as anxiety and the lost of a person's confident .
Anxiety is a very difficult mental disorder to cure and it takes a very long time for a person to overcome this but with constant disturbances from knowing that he or she is being monitor , it will become a significant problem in their daily lives .
"Collection of personal data (e .g . , lifestyle information for insurance purposes) also reveals intimate aspects of the self to others within the work environment" (Santon , 2003) .
"Symptoms like palpitations , breathlessness and tense feelings that are serious enough to disrupt their daily routine" (IMH , 2008) will appear in the person .
Lastly , the use of Surveillance technology can be abused by the government and or any agency that used it .
The government can use it to track any opposition to its policies .
Like in the case of South Africa during the apartheid period whereby opposing to the regime was monitor using the surveillance technology .
Thousand of opposition members were arrested and ill treated by the regime .
The situation became better when Nelson Mandela successfully became the president but at the price of he himself was the victim of their abuse .
Greed and corruption sink in when the people at the very top refuse to give up their power and used underhand means to keep themselves in power .
They will do anything and that does include using any surveillance device to monitor their nemesis .
With easy evidence at their disposal , they will use the law to suppress any opposition to their will .
In conclusion , harm inflicted and personal privacy will be intruded , goes to show that Surveillance technology should not be used to track people as it can be abused by the people who used it .
Surveillance technology systems are tools which can identify , monitor and track movements and data .
Previously , the common practice for surveillance has always been through physical means such as prison guards , but in modern times it has been improved and upgraded through image amplification devices such as binoculars , closed circuit cameras and high- resolution satellite cameras (Bogonikolos , 1999) .
Radio-frequency identification tags (RFID) are among the several types of surveillance technologies of today .
It is a type of automatic identification method that is used to track prescription drugs to pets and , in some cases , even humans .
Although these surveillance technologies may provide many potential benefits such as law enforcement , the issue raises a great deal of controversies as well .
Surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
The main concern for this technology is with regards to privacy .
RFID can be deciphered from afar and they contain more information than barcodes (Free , 2007) .
Consumers are at the greatest disadvantage when it comes to RFID technology because hidden placement of tags by companies allows information to be retrieved from consumers .
These tags which are embedded in consumer products could theoretically keep tabs on a person worldwide provided there are readers in certain locations around the globe .
Personal information may be jeopardized by these tags , leaking information like medical history .
These devices threaten to deprive mankind of its mysteries , offering a world where people are only told what the government and large corporations approve of .
Even libraries are rolling out RFID as a means to track books , but the possibility of tracking people carrying the books has not been considered (Free , 2007) .
Another concern of RFID is the health risks that it imposes on humans .
Although the implanted chips can aid in storing valuable medical information that could prevent any misfortune or mistreatments to the patients , the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns of risks like rejection or adverse tissue reaction with any RFID implants (CASPIAN Special Report , 2004) .
Not everyone is able to get an implant without side effects because each person's immunity system differs from one another .
In addition , patients might suffer severe burns .
There's a possibility that the implanted transponder will migrate and travel in the body , causing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) incongruence and electromagnetic interference .
An MRI machine utilizes strong magnetic fields along with pulsed radio frequency fields that may induce electrical currents in conductive metal implants such as the RFID tags (CASPIAN Special Report , 2004) .
Presumably , MRI incompatibility with the tags means that patients possessing RFID implants are unable to undergo this potentially life-saving diagnostic procedure , unless they conduct a surgery and have the tag removed beforehand .
Also , RFID propose the risks of information leak during transmission of information .
The RFID implant uses radio waves to transmit medical and financial account information to reader devices .
One would be concerned that this information will be intercepted; duplicated and abused by others or that the device could be used to track an individual's movements and location .
Proof hackers can clone these RFID chips and hence cause the risk of identity theft to increase .
For example , the United States military were keen on the idea and were amongst the first subscribers of the technology .
Every pallet , carton and big-ticket item being shipped to the military was affixed with a RFID tag (Bogonikolos , 1999) .
With complete product information on a tag , enemies can conveniently extract information off a tag .
The information can then be used to identify the military's strengths and weaknesses and can be used to endanger the country , its soldiers and civilians should the information fall into the wrong hands .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
Although cost for RFID systems in the future will decrease , privacy issues , health issues and security issues will still exist .
RFID still has a long way to go before it becomes a feasible technology to be implemented .
Privacy issues must be given main priority and with sufficient control and attention from all relevant parties , RFID will benefit society as a whole and will not jeopardize human rights .

We live in an age where information proliferates , both in terms of its formulation and its availability .
Modern surveillance technology has constructed a mean for us to gather information readily .
RFID first appeared in 1940 with the primary aim of identifying aircraft for military purposes .
However , as RFID becomes more prevalent in our society , it is now able to retrieve information from almost anywhere , anyone .
Tentatively , with surveillance , security is on whole tightened .
However , whilst maintaining the level of security , surveillance is often seen as an invasion to privacy .
Many would agree that the sophisticated surveillance technology has indeed been beneficial in the security arena especially after the September 11th incident and government has since then diverts their attention to tracking potential terrorists instead of tracking explosive devices or substances .
For instance , in its effort to locate any suspicious character , Britain has over 4 million CCTV cameras installed along almost every street , every corner just to keep track of every individual (BBC News , 2006) .
The implementation of such a system has successfully foiled some of the terrorist's plan .
Furthermore , individual would behave themselves upon knowing that they are constantly being "watched" , leading to a possible decrease in crime rates .
As far as the government is concerned , with the use of surveillance device , security is greatly enhanced and discipline is observed .
Thus , tracking individuals using surveillance technology would result in a safer environment to live in .
Jones , M . (2006) .
Britain is 'surveillance society' Retrieved October 5 , 2009 , from http://news .bbc .co .uk/2/hi/uk/6108496 .stm
On the other hand , some argued that such method has inevitably threatened the most basic human rights to freedom as every movements or speech , for more advanced devices , they made are meticulously monitored .
"Privacy is an inherent human right and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect ."
(Schneier B ,2006) Then , there are individuals who abuse the usage of surveillance technology by sending their partner a gift with RFID attached to it so that they will be able to track the location of their partner and know who they are hanging out with .
Obviously such acts are morally wrong and hence the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned if individual misuse it .
(Lee and Tan , 2007) However , individual should also have their right to security , which in turn allows the intervention of government .
Nation security is altogether far more important then the mere privacy entitled to individual .
RFID is also use to track criminals within the prison , detainees or ex-convict .
The RFID would be able to trace their location and monitor their behavior .
If Mas Selamat bin Kastari was to have a RFID tag , he would not be able to escape and there would not have been so much fear instilled among Singaporean during that period of his disappearance .
By employing such operation , government would thus be able to prevent any possible mishap from happening .
All these boil down to the question "How much privacy are we willing to sacrifice for the sake of a more secure life ?"
(Anderson R , 2007) .
An opinion poll conducted among Americans and Europeans has shown that 75% of the respondents "want more , not less , surveillance" (BBC News , 2007) Furthermore , "If it prevents criminal behaviour or improves its detection I'm all for it ."
(Jones M , 2006) .
Perhaps , the increases in the number of terrorists attack has proven to us that government should also tap on the advantages of current technology to counter those sophisticated attacks carried out by the terrorists .
In conclusion , there should be a balance between maintaining security and protecting privacy .
On the minor scale , it is the individual themselves who are abusing such technology for their own gain .
However , when looking from a broader perspective , surveillance technology would have been the platform to stop any terrorist attacks or crimes from happening .
In addition , since most people recognize the main objective of surveillance technology , such technology should not be banned even if it includes spying individuals .

Surveillance technology is the utilization of electronic equipment such as RFID , GPS , and CCTV to monitor the behavior of individuals or groups .
This technology is widely used in public places for the reason of security maintenance , as well as for the purpose of identification and tracking of information .
For example , CCTV is installed in airports , banks , department stores , and even the streets to prevent crime in those areas , while RFID can be used as access key within an organization , means of managing mobile assets of a company , or tool for identifying and tracking of equipment , staffs , and patients in a hospital .
In fact , there are still a lot of applications to RFID in various fields and industries including security , public transport , healthcare , and e-payment that its popularity is increasing rapidly .
Nevertheless , there are some problems and controversies surrounding the use of such technology despite the convenience it brings to the society .
Most concerns revolve around the issue of privacy and confidentiality since the technology is capable of collecting personal data about a person without consent .
As such , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be carefully limited so that it is not misused to track people or gather sensitive data about a third party .
There are some ways RFID can cause privacy concerns .
RFID tag incorporated into an item can be read from several distances away .
The individual carrying the item may be unaware of the presence of the tag , thus rendering him vulnerable of privacy breaches (Bhaskar 2007) .
Such cases are most likely to happen to a customer purchasing products with RFID tags .
Moreover , if the products are paid by a credit card or in conjunction with the use of a loyalty card , the identity of the customer can be linked to the unique serial number of the tag (Bhaskar 2007) .
This data can eventually be used to find out private information about the customer , which is a serious breach of privacy to the customer concerned .
Therefore , regulations should be made to protect the privacy of individuals , such as the need to indicate the existence of the tags on customer products and the restriction on information gathering .
There are some problematic complications that may arise due to the use of RFID to track people .
For instance , personally identifiable information (PII) such as license plate number of an individual carrying an RFID enabled card or travel document can be read by a third party without his consent since unauthorized RFID reader can read the RFID number from the card or document (US Department of Homeland Security 2008) .
However , some may argue that the benefits of surveillance technology actually compensate the concerns about privacy .
RFID tag embedded into items or products can help owners to track down their valuable belongings should their items be stolen or missing .
RFID also helps to identify disaster victims , and provide effective treatment for patients in emergency situation in a hospital .
While these may be true , without the restriction of the use of the technology , abusive use of the information may cost greatly .
In other words , RFID may be used to track people , but only limited to a certain degree .
For example , it is acceptable to track patients if the patients concerned really need it .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should be restricted only to some special cases , as in the case of a dependent patient in a hospital who needs constant surveillance .
It is a breach of privacy to use this technology for supervising and collecting personal and private information about an individual or group .
Moreover , any third party with appropriate equipment is able to read information from the individual concerned , which may eventually lead to the abusive use of the information .
Therefore , the restriction on the usage of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be wholly supported .
Surveillance technology can be used for instance to monitor the data exchange on network or to observe the activity of someone using a surveillance camera .
One of the examples of surveillance technology is Radio Frequency Identification or RFID .
RFID is a system that keeps track of a tagged object by utilizing radio waves(What is RFID ?) .
However people are mainly concerned with their privacy being violated since they are being tracked down .
It can also gives out the important information on the individual without any permission from the person .
Hence , the idea of spying people by using technology such as RFID has to be banned .
There are two main reasons why RFID should be prohibited .
The first reason is concerned with the idea of individual's privacy (CASPIAN , 2003) .
When someone buys a product that is tagged with RFID , the radio wave can still be detected as long as the chip is still active and in range of detection .
This means revealing the position and behavioral information of the person .
Groups of consumer in UK , France , Germany and Netherland were polled by a consultancy group named Capgemini and 95% of the consumers were worried that the information gathered from RFID could be used freely without their consent by third parties (BBC , 2005) .
This survey indicates that privacy's breach is indeed an important concern for people .

Secondly , the information gathered through RFID can be used in a way that can endanger the life of the individual itself (CASPIAN , 2003) .
In fact , every RFID tag is assigned a unique serial number .
For instance , terrorists with appropriate equipments can target a high-ranking official by setting the bomb to explode as soon as the target is in the detection range .
Robbers can identify rich person just by reading the RFID tag on the things the person buys .
All of these can be done in a radius of few meters and these make it even harder for the person to realize that they are being spied .
These examples illustrate the problem of how the RFID can be utilized to harm people instead of saving them .
Others argue that RFID can be used to stop terrorists by monitoring the nation's food supply , hence keeping the food from the terrorists (Baard , 2003) .
However in this age of digital information , people can easily find an Internet connection and type a few keywords like "remove RFID tag" .
The fact that by using technology not more sophisticated than what is in a cell phone , the RFID tag can be disabled completely (Invoke Media , 2006) .
This shows that the RFID tag is not effective in tracking people particularly the terrorists .
To wrap up the discussion on the controversy of using RFID to track people , the examples above show how ineffective is the RFID system on spying people like the terrorists since the RFID tag can be removed easily .
On the other hand , some group of people can even misuse this piece of technology to harm others for the sake of their benefit .
Moreover , survey by a consultancy group Capgemini shows that the majority of the respondents were very concerned over their privacy's breach particularly on the use of RFID system to track them .
Thus , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .

RFID also known as radio frequency identification is a piece of technology , which makes use of electromagnetic or electrostatic waves in the radio frequency so as to identify or pass the information through the radio wave .
However , should we ban the use of surveillance technology such as RFID ?
Like many other pieces of surveillance technology , RFID also infringes on privacy issue .
In addition , it also possesses some potential hazards to one if one is implanted with the chip .
Yet , there are far more important benefits if we incorporate the use of RFID , hence we must not ban RFID due to the few negative effects that RFID will have on the future .
It is common to hear that most technologies are like a double-edged sword so is the piece of technology , RFID .
Scientists have shown that if the RFID is implanted in the human body , it will interfere with the hospital equipment [Anonymous , 2008] , hence handicapping the doctors in their treatment for the patients .
Thus it is not encouraged to implant a RFID chip .
However , It will be plain ignorant to ban RFID base on this limitation as there are rooms for improvement since it is still at its developing stage .
For the past years , the controversy of surveillance technology infringing one's right to privacy still exists and will continue to happen .
However , there can be some laws pass down to ensure that technologies like RFID are not abuse and use in the proper direction .
For example , like the surveillance camera , peeping toms and other criminals commonly use them for crimes , yet why does the government still allow such technology to be used .
The reasons are that the priority of ensuring the privacy of corporations and the safety of the people are of more importance .
Similarly , RFID , which is more feasible and useful than surveillance camera since it can cover a longer range of area than surveillance camera , should not be banned .
Surveillance technology refers to gadgets that are able to observe and monitor individuals' behavior and activity from a distance using electronic equipment .
CCTV's and RIFD (radio-frequency identification) are some examples of surveillance technology .
With the invention of such technology , controversy over the use of this technology has been increasing .
While some feel that the existence of this technology helps to tackle problems related to tracking people , others are against this technology simply because it is an intrusion into a person's privacy (Greene ,T 2004) .
I believe that this technology should not be used to track people down .
Another point to be raised is that surveillance technology may not be effective in preventing nor reducing crime rates as many people would assume that they do .
With the usage of the surveillance technology it gives people a false sense of security because they feel that with technology looking after them they are sure to be safe .
However this may not be the case because surveillance may only help to catch the criminal after the crime has been committed .
Most of the times information from such surveillance technology is redundant because the information recorded during the crime does not provide enough evidence to arrest the criminal .
Furthermore criminals are being wiser each day; they may outsmart the technology by hacking in to the system to prevent them from being caught .
Therefore it is certainly not a wise choice to use surveillance camera as a replacement of security guards .
Another concern of using surveillance is the health issue .
The usages of certain surveillance gadgets such as RFID being implanted in to the body of individuals are tested to be harmful to the human body .
Humans that are being implanted by these chips have higher incidences of getting cancer (Layden , J 2007) .
Thought the possibility of getting cancer is not 100% but why should humans exposed themselves to a higher risk of this deadly disease ?
In conclusion , I strongly disagree in the usage of surveillance technology because it is a invasion to privacy , it does not really reduce crime rates and it raises a problem related to health issues .
The money used to futher develop this technology and to implement this technology is better spend on more useful area's such as the education and medical .

Rapid development of technology enables people to utilize surveillance technology such ad RFID (radio frequency identification) to track people .
Thus , the controversy over whether or not such use of technology should be banned has been feverishly extended (Bacchetta & Bacchetta , 2005; Marshall , 2009; Sade , 2007; Two stories highlight the RFID debate , 2005) .
Although some people consider such utilization benefits mankind in ways such as security and health care , concerns of loss of privacy and dehumanization , physical risks , as well as problems of identity theft still makes it controversial .
As the banes overweigh the boons in general , such use of technology on people should be banned .
RFID is mainly used on tracking employees and patientsneither is reasonable .
According to a report on July 19 , 2005 (Two stories highlight the RFID debate) , the general workers' union GMB in UK required the European Commission to prohibit the tag of RFID on employees .
As the employees were monitored through RFID and GPS even when using the bathroom , they felt annoying dehumanization and loss of privacy .
Proponents claim that implanting RFID chips makes it possible for employers to watch over who sneaks away even during an unauthorized bathroom break (Albrecht & McIntyre , 2005) .
Though , after weighing the pros and cons , numerous civil rights groups and privacy groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people's right to privacy , including Electronic Privacy Information Center , Electronic Frontier Foundation (Wentworth , 2005) , American Civil Liberties Union (2003) as well as US Department of Justice (2008) .
Thus , it is not acceptable to use RFID to track employees .

Besides undermining employees' rights to privacy , using RFID on patients also remains a big issue .
Advocates of surveillance technology argue that RFID tags provide an alternative to access patients' information and thus , reduce medical errors .
However , based on a CEJA report (Sade , 2007) , the American Medical Association has officially reported on July 17 , 2007 that RIFD devices contain potential physical risks to the user .
Tagging of these small sized devices may allow them to "migrate under the skin" , which makes it hard to extract them .
Moreover , possible electromagnetic interference will result in a lower efficacy of medication .
Hence , the advantage claimed from the proponents is not convincing , and the use of RFID to track patients is also not appropriate .
Apart from the use on tracking employees and patients , use of RFID on consumers also causes problems such as identity theft .
Security experts have warned against using RFID due to the risk of identity theft (Hook , 2005) .
Although advocates have assured the security of tagged peoples' information (Security assurance and RFID technology , 2008) , such assurance is proven invalid when the following case occurred as a counter example .
The METRO Future Store has been reported of loss of loyalty cardholders' personal information due to inappropriate use of technology and inadequate customer disclosures (Scandal: the RFID tag hidden in METRO's loyalty card , 2004) .
Katherine Albrecht , Director of CASPIAN (Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering) , "toured the Future Store on January 31 , 2004" and discovered hidden RFID tags in the store's loyalty cards to shopping carts that track customer movements , as well as RFID tag "deactivation" stations that do not work as claimed (McCullagh , 2004) .
This means not only customers' movements are under detection , but confidential items such as signature and application forms containing personal information are easily accessed via an RFID reader , too .
Such a shocking finding convinces people that the RFID trial is not under secure control and thus should be halted .
In conclusion , using surveillance technology to track people not only brings physical risks to the tagged people , but is also regarded as dehumanizing and unstable .
People who are tagged may face problems ranging from mental and physical discomfort to identity loss .
Thus , it is persuasive that surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned from tracking people .
