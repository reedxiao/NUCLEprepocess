Moreover , by now the research on reducing the cost of this reactor has received significant achievement and the research is still undergoing .
Scientists are still looking forward to more research findings in the coming years .
Many people think that comparing with traditional ways of producing electricity , using nuclear reactor is not safe .
In fact , the SFR is a very safe nuclear reactor operating under low pressure , at low temperature as well .
The operating temperature of the SFR ranges from 500 to 550 , one of the two reactors with the lowest temperature among all the six together with Supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
Moreover the sodium-cooled technique was started to use since the year 1951 .
"It builds on more than 300 reactor-years experienced with sodium-cooled fast neutron reactors over five decades and in eight countries (World nuclear association , 2008)" .
Scientists from Japan also concerned about the chemical reaction between sodium and water .
They add double-wall piping to their Japanese sodium-cooled fast reactor (JSFR) to improve the security of the reactor .
Nuclear weapon and terrorism are always sensitive topics to both government and ordinary people .
Because the waste of the nuclear reactor can be used by terrorists to produce nuclear weapons , many people doubt whether it can provide true safety if scientists can only promise that the reactor is safe during the operation .
However , this is not a problem for SRF .
New design for SRF is likely to have all the neutron action in the core .
That is to say "the new processing technologies will enable the fuel to be recycled without separating the plutonium (World Nuclear Association , 2008)" .
In this case , the waste will all be recycled in the reactor and terrorists will not get a chance to reach the nuclear raw materials .
Closing the nuclear fuel cycle through the use of advanced reprocessing and fast reactor technologies is a good way to improve the security of the reactor and avoid duplication of effort at the same time .
Opponents say that comparing with the other five generation IV reactors , the cost of the SFR is relatively high .
Yes , this is a drawback of the SFR; however , scientists are working hard on it to find out the way to reduce the capital cost of the SFR and they have already received some achievements .
On November 27-28 , 2006 , Mr . Kazuo Mukai , from the Advanced Nuclear System Research and Development Directorate Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) , had an international seminar on "Coolants and Innovative Reactor Technologies" in Cadarache which is a research center for nuclear energy in France .
In this seminar he talked about the JSFR and the achievements Japanese scientists got to reduce the cost of the SFR .
Kazuo (2006) said that by adopting high chromium steel with higher strength and lower thermal expansion , the capacity of the heat exchangers and the heat exchangers and the flow rate in the pipe got enlarged , so that the piping could be shortened and the loop number also got reduced .
In this way , the capital cost of the SFR was reduced .
This is just an example of the received achievements .
The research is still undergoing and scientists have confidence that they will have more findings in the future .
According to The U .S . Department of Energy (DOE) , the sodium-cooled fast reactor technology is one of the most advanced nuclear technologies being researched to date and could potentially be used as an advanced recycling reactor ("U .S . , France" , 2008) .
With the participation of the experts from 13 countries , more achievements will be received during the next decade .
The advanced technology of the SFR will benefit people all around the world in the not far future .
The Chernobyl disaster was one of the worst engineering accidents ever happened in history .
Not many people died that day but thousands of people were exposed to radiation that caused them to suffer severe health problems (BBC News , 2000) .
Unfortunately , the cause of this incident was found to be unnecessary mistakes made by the nuclear plant operators .
People usually say that mistakes are inevitable and nuclear is in fact extremely dangerous so that working with it will always involve a high chance of accidents .
However , there are ways to reduce the possibility of this human-caused accident .
Including psychological factors consideration during the design process is found to be one of the ways to improve safety which might have prevented the Chernobyl incident .
Opponents claim that as a human being , we make mistakes and it cannot be avoided .
I agree to the point that human can make mistakes .
However , it does not mean that mistakes cannot be avoided .
This includes the mistakes made by the Chernobyl nuclear plant operators .
They did not request to maintain the power which caused it to run down rapidly until it was below the permitted safety level (Onisawa and Nishiwaki , 1988) .
This mistake was actually unnecessary since this was not their first time doing the safety test .
The problem lies on the behavior of the plant operators .
They took light of their task since for them this was just another safety test .
They did not have any sense of responsibility and were not aware of the consequences if anything went wrong .
Therefore , during the design process , these plant operators are supposed to be 'designed' as well .
They should be given the required knowledge and should also be warned about the worst thing that may happen if they make even a simple mistake .
In this way , they will be more careful in doing their task and as a result able to avoid making mistakes .
Opponents also state that nuclear power is indeed dangerous for that reason , it is impossible not to have accident while working with it .
Accident is a situation when there is a failure in the interaction between man and machine (Stoop , 1995) .
Therefore , even though nuclear power is certainly dangerous , it can still be safe to work with as long as the interaction between man and machine is designed carefully so that it will not fail .
Again , this shows the importance of considering psychological factors in design process .
Most of the times , while designing a system , engineers are likely to overestimate the ability of the user (Wilpert , 2007) .
As a result , most users are not able to properly use the equipments .
In the case of Chernobyl , the plant operators failed to make the right decision which then caused the reactor to explode .
Instead of following the safety procedure , the plant operators even blocked the reactor's protection system (making it impossible for automatic shut down) in order to keep the test running (Onisawa and Nishiwaki , 1988) .
If the plant operators were familiar with the system and the procedure , they would have known which one was more important and would definitely have prioritized safety rather than keeping the test running .
Thus , in designing a system engineers alone are not enough .
The final argument proposed by the opponents is that psychologists are also humans who can make mistakes just like engineers .
Hence , even with their help mistakes are still inevitable .
The point of involving psychologists in the design process is not because they are better than engineers .
It is rather to balance the engineers' point of view which is usually machine-centered .
Since man and machines are equally important to achieve safety in design , psychologists' role is to concern about the human resources which are usually neglected by engineers .
If both machines and man are well designed , safety will definitely improve and the possibility of accidents will be reduced .
In conclusion , carefully designing a system's safety is useless unless psychological factors are also considered .
Without considering psychological factors , there is a big possibility that there will be a bad interaction between man and machine which will then results in an accident such as Chernobyl's .
Therefore , psychological factors play an important role in reducing the possibility of accident as well as improving the system's safety .
The world has been searching for different sources of energy to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels .
In some countries , they have turned to nuclear power .
Despite producing less carbon footprints , nuclear power is a relatively dangerous source of energy .
One unmistakable example is the 1986 Chernobyl disaster .
Some psychologists have wondered whether the use of psychology in the design process would have prevented the accident .
While opponents reasoned that there is no distinctive link between psychology and engineering design process , the use of psychology could theoretically have prevented the accident through its intervention in the controls and the safety mechanisms design .
Also , use of psychology could counter the underestimation of the number of errors that will form inevitably .
Opponents argue that the use of psychology would not be useful as the chief cause for the accident is the lack of knowledge of the operators .
According to Rich(1986) , the accident was the fault of not complying with strict operating regulations governed by the reactor designers .
However , one way of how psychology could have averted the accident is that the designers could have anticipated that the operators might not understand the physics behind the reactor .
They might have been trained to operate but do not understand the principles behind it .
The design could have incorporated automated controls to reduce the number of errors that could be made .
Leptak(2009) suggests that to maintain a safe operation , there should be fewer autonomous control and more 'redundant automated safety interlocks' .
This is to prohibit safety controls from being bypassed .
This could prove to be an essential part of the design as Stellman(1998) provides evidence that the chief engineer involved actually approved the shutting down of the Emergency Cooling System .
This move compromised the safety of the plant .
Thus , psychology could have indeed changed the reactor plant to a vastly safer environment .

On the other hand , other opponents blame the heavy politico-military factors attached to the Chernobyl reactors .
In Chernobyl(2006) , the writer points out that the reactors were designed and adapted for the production of plutonium for military businesses .
This dual function could have compromised safety of the reactor .
Psychology or the employment of psychologists to assist the design process would thus be futile .
However , this may not be the case .
Psychology understands that almost every action has a causal history which leads up to the root of the problem .
This concept is evident when accounts of the accident reviewed that the operator indifferently disregarded safety protocols .
In fact , Stang(1996) notes that running the reactors at low operating standards was commonplace .
Hence , designers could have could have brought in psychologists to evaluate the design to inhibit such unauthorized practices and to ensure the safety standards are kept high .
In short , the use of psychology could have been used to uphold the safety of the reactors and hence might have prevented the accident .
In contrast , other opponents may argue that the design process is beyond the domain of psychologists .
Instead , only the designer and the engineers have the expertise to partake in the design process .
However , this perception could be wrong as designers make human errors .
Psychology could be used to minimize these errors .
According to Wilpert(2007) , the design process encompasses both social science and the engineering .
In Reason(2000)'s article , he notices a distinctive element that separates high reliability organizations from others .
This element is the consensual agreement that errors can occur anywhere and every stage in should be treated meticulously .
Stang and Liptak have deduced that the designers involved in the Chernobyl reactor did not understand certain aspects of the reactor .
This implies that the design was not given scrupulous care .
Therefore , psychology could be used in the design process and perhaps have minimized the possibilities of accidents .
To sum up , use of psychology could have been used in some phases of the design process .
Psychology could have helped in automating several safety controls , improving safety and enhancing the reliability of the reactor design .
Though the use of psychology could have aided the design process in these three areas , whether the use of psychology would have prevented the accident is really hard to say .
Many factors contribute to the accident .
However , current reactor designers should take the Chernobyl accident as a valuable lesson and do their utmost efforts to prevent such painful and costly incidents from happening again .

Since the introduction of nuclear-powered generators , public opposition was one of the reasons why only limited nuclear reactors have been built in the past .
The public is against the idea of constructing nuclear reactors because they are concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
Their concern arose because of a few incidents that have happened in the past which includes a partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and also the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , which the reactor core exploded and caused the death of 31 people and spewed radioactive debris across Europe (Butler , 2004) .
However , I believe that previews of the nuclear reactors should not influence the decision to fund the research and development of the generation IV reactors as people will be more careful not to let the same incidents happen again with the advancement in technology .
Therefore , I feel that generation IV reactors such as the Supercritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) should be funded for their research and development .
Nevertheless , the first reason that the public is concerned over the funding of generation IV nuclear reactors is that the nuclear reactors will not reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions as compared to natural gas and oil use (Nature , 2008) .
However , this is not the case as there are countries constructing nuclear reactors because it can indeed improve the environment .
For example , reducing greenhouse-gas emissions is the main reason for the endorsement of the construction of nuclear reactors by the UK government (Nature , 2008) .
Furthermore , according to Butler (2004) , the SCWR does not emit carbon dioxide , which is a greenhouse-gas that is soaring because of natural gas and oil generated power plants .
Therefore , such generation IV reactors will certainly improve the environment and should be funded for their research and development .

Another concern from the public opposition is that nuclear reactors should not be used in medical research because they pose a danger to the people using nuclear power for their medical researches .
According to Ruth (2009) , medical isotopes used in the cancer research can be supplied using accelerators instead of nuclear reactors as it is a safer and cheaper method .
However , nuclear reactors should continue to be used to supply the medical isotopes as it can produce the isotopes much faster than the accelerators .
Furthermore , the idea of accelerators to supply the medical isotopes has still not been put to practical use as it still requires further research and development unlike the nuclear reactors , which is already vastly used in medical researches .
This can be shown as many researchers were lamenting on the shutdown of the nuclear reactor located in chalk river , Ontario , and their medical research has to be put to a halt (Nature , 2008) .
Therefore , generation IV reactors will be more stable to maintain the medical research process and should be funded for their research and development .
The last concern from the public opposition is that nuclear reactors are not safe enough to be built as they are under-designed for earthquakes as the earthquake in Japan killed at least 9 , injured 1000 and caused the evacuation of further 10 ,000 people and sparked a fire and caused radiation- contaminated water from the nuclear reactor to spill into the sea (Nature , 2007) .
However , damages done from an earthquake on a nuclear reactor is inevitable no matter how well a building is designed and such damages done are already considered very minimal even though the nuclear reactor in Japan was under-designed to deal with an earthquake of magnitude 6 .8 .
Furthermore , due to technology advancement , the new generation IV reactors are designed to deal with an earthquake of magnitude 8 .0 (Nature , 2007) .
Therefore , the concern of the public opposition over nuclear reactors which are under-designed for earthquakes is unnecessary because the generation IV reactors are strong enough to handle tough conditions already .
To wrap up , I believe that the new generation IV reactors such as SCWR is nothing like their previous generation of nuclear reactors because technology is constantly improving each day to make the nuclear reactors safer to be built .
Thus , the public opposition should look at the new generation IV reactors in a different light and not just based on some of the incidents that had happened in the past .

Computers , television sets and air-conditioners , all these household appliances require electricity to work .
In most countries , fossil fuel power plants are the main generators of electricity .
However , fossil fuels are not a renewable source of energy and will be depleted one day .
Furthermore , according to the recent energy outlook , energy demands in the United States are expected to grow by 0 .5% per year (EIA 2009) .
Governments are well aware of this and have been looking at alternative sources of energy such as solar , wind and particularly , nuclear energy .
However , nuclear power plants pose a danger to the surrounding as a target of terrorists and in the event of a nuclear accident .
Nevertheless , with the new generation IV reactors , especially the sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) which will be the first generation IV reactor to be completed and more efficient in the usage of the nuclear fuel , nuclear energy will definitely be one of the main sources of energy in the future .
There is no denying that nuclear energy is a dangerous source of energy and an example is the Chernobyl accident in 1986 .
It was caused by an error during a safety test and resulted in over 4 ,000 deaths and many more may die due to the radiation from the accident (Nature 2006) .
In recent years , there are also fears that nuclear reactors may be the targets of terrorist attacks .
As a result , the public has been reluctant about the use of nuclear power as a source of energy .
Nonetheless , there are still over 400 nuclear reactors around the world which make up for 17% of the world's electrical consummation (Butler , 2004) .
All of which have improved safety precautions and higher security levels to ensure the safety of the public .
In addition , the new SFR will be equipped with better coolant system to prevent a reactor meltdown and stronger containment structures to guard against terrorist attacks (Smith , 2009) .

Out of the six generation IV reactors , SFR is expected to be the first reactor to be developed .
Therefore , we can tap on the use of safer nuclear energy earlier .
This is mainly thanks to the fact that sodium-cooled reactors are already in operation in Japan and Russia (US DOE NERAC/GIF 2002) .
Thus , less research will be required for the SFR , which also means that the research cost will be reduced .
Furthermore , by choosing the SFR's proven method of cooling the nuclear core , it removes the uncertainties of using new and untested technology which are present in the other reactors .
The SFR is also chosen by the United States as their front runner for generation IV fast reactors due to its strong technology basis (US DOE/NE 2006) .
On top of its technological readiness , the SFR is designed for high efficiency as well .
It recycles nuclear fuel through a process whereby a group of chemical elements called actinides is produced .
Plutonium is also included in this group and it can be used for production of nuclear weapons .
Therefore , to ensure the nuclear non-proliferation , the SFR is designed such that the plutonium cannot be extracted from the nuclear core .
Furthermore , 99 .9% of the actinides will be recycled again .
The SFR will also be using spent thermal reactor fuel from other older nuclear reactors as its initial fuel (US DOE NERAC/GIF 2002) .
All these designs will lead to a more efficient usage of the nuclear fuel and it also helps solve the current problem of the disposal of nuclear wastes .
The truth is , we will one day run out of fossil fuels , hence , we must plan ahead and look for other sources of energy .
And despite its risks , nuclear energy has its significant benefits as well .
Nuclear power plants maybe hazardous , but the new SFR boosts many new safeguards .
It also allows us to utilize more capable generation IV reactors sooner and helps reduce the amount of nuclear wastes .
Therefore , governments should continue to fund these nuclear research projects so as to ensure that we can continue with our way of life even after our fossil fuels run out .

Nuclear Power has been a controversial issue ever since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II .
Over the years , Nuclear power has evolved with the help of technological advancement .
Today , scientists have gone a further step in developing what we know as the Fourth Generation Reactors .
Out of the six new reactors , Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is the most favorable .
It is known for being more environmental friendly and less hazardous .
Nuclear power is encompassed by four main factors .
These factors are economic benefits , security , safety and effects on the environment .
Firstly , the cost of operating and starting cost of a VHTR is truly subjective .
Some may feel that the costs are too high .
According to a survey done by researchers from the Keystone Center , the cost of building a new reactor varied from $3600 to $4600 per installed kW and the operating cost would be about 30 cents per kWh (Benjamin , 2008) .
Naturally , The public would have an impression that VHTR would be much more expensive , comparatively to renewable energy such as solar and wind .
However , this is not the case .
VHTR will be cheaper as cost incurred on transportation of nuclear waste is redundant .
This is because the nuclear waste goes directly to a respiratory which is located within the nuclear plant (Clayton 2009) .
Furthermore , VHTR produces cheaper energy compared to solar and wind energy .
Barry (2009) cites that the capital cost of building a solar plant is 25 times more than nuclear plant and the land area solar plant occupies is 400 times more than nuclear plant .
With cheaper energy , more people are able to afford electricity .
Countries going through industrialization will also benefit from the cheap energy .
In addition , building of VHTR will boost the economy as it creates job opportunities in the areas surrounding the power plant .
Secondly , ever since the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 , the world has heightened global security against terrorism .
Nuclear plants have become prime targets of terrorists .
This is because the plutonium waste that the nuclear reactor produces are ingredients for making nuclear weapons .
Hence , security of nuclear plants is strengthened as well to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons .
If nuclear weapons were to fall in the hands of terrorists , it would pose a great threat to the safety of the public .
However in VHTR , plutonium are spiked with heat producing and radioactive elements (Butler , 2004) .
These elements cause the plutonium waste to increase in temperature such that it is too hot to handle and therefore prevent anyone from stealing them .
Hence , the public does not need to worry about nuclear waste falling in the hands of the terrorists .
Thirdly , safety of the employees working at the nuclear plant and the residents near the plant has to be taken into consideration .
The VHTR is actually an evolution from the present High Temperature-grouped reactor (HTGR) .
In the VHTR , heat resistant materials are used to build the nuclear reactor so that the heat is carefully contained .
Moreover , the heat produced during the processing of uranium is used for hydrogen production and desalinization (Very High Temperature Reactor , n .d .) .
Also radioactive leakage is prevented with the use of corrosion resistant materials .
For example , helium is used as a cooling agent in VHTR as helium is an inert gas and does not provide and hazardous effect .
Finally , as global warming becomes more perilous , governments and several communities are placing greater emphasis on being environmental friendly .
The main environmental concern is the disposal of radioactive wastes .
It is known that these radioactive wastes have very long live shelf and will not decay until a few hundred years later .
Most importantly , the radioactive emission is harmful to human body .
However , in VHTR , an additional processing step is taken to shorten the live span of the wastes and these wastes are carefully contained .
In addition , VHTR produces less nuclear wastes .
This means that there will be minimal chance of weapon proliferation and reduced pollution to the environment .
Compared to other solar plants , nuclear plants actually produce less carbon dioxide .
Barry (2009) writes that solar plants produce 25times more carbon dioxide than nuclear plants .
In conclusion , VHTR is much safer , more environmental friendly , more efficient and is much cheaper .
Hence , we should abandon those pessimistic views on nuclear power and embrace this new source of power .
Nuclear energy has been a hot topic since several decades age .
It is clear and powerful .
As Declan Butler (2004) said that nuclear energy is not a source of carbon dioxide , and with the emissions of the green-house gas now soaring , and the energy demands predicted to double by 2050 , the nuclear option is a finding its way back onto the table .
Besides , nuclear reactors are great power output of electricity and hydrogen .
However , some opposing controversies appear .
Some people hold the opinions that nuclear energy is very dangerous and building nuclear plants requires a large amount of money , etc .
Nevertheless , at present , there is a safe nuclear reactor which is called sodium-cooled fast reactor .
Because of its safety , no waste and powerful output , I support further research and development funding for it .
Some pacifists are sceptical about the safety of nuclear energy also because that reprocessing nuclear waste is controversial as it separates out plutonium , a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons .
Besides , they are worried about that nuclear reactors would become a terrorist target because of the radioactive waste .
Nevertheless , these terrible things won't happen in sodium-cooled fast reactors , because the reaction is within the core and the recycling is closed which means the recycling is not separated out .
As a result , the percentage of plutonium in the waste is reduced effectively .
Besides , the reprocessing can cut the final amount of waste produced .
Moreover , the systems based on mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel are primarily under development in Japan , and their preferred recycle option is an advanced aqueous process; and metal-fuel cycle systems are under development in the United States which use a pyroprocessing recycle as the preferred fuel cycle option .
As a consequence , people do not need to worry about the radioactive waste during the producing .
Except the problem of the safety , the second one is the cost .
The cost of nuclear reactors which consists of the construction cost , operating cost and decommissioning cost are very high .
It is the fact that several billion dollars is needed to get a nuclear reactor going and the sodium-cooled fast reactors are even more expensive than other ones .
However , in order to make the nuclear energy more powerful and safer , the money spent is worthy .
Seen the value of the sodium-cooled fast reactors , many countries are investing in the sodium-cooled fast reactors .
Meanwhile , many engineers are looking for the methods to cut the cost of nuclear reactors .
New plants are designed to be much simpler and quicker to build , reducing financing costs by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars .
In details , the cost can be reduced by reducing the refuelling outages' number , compacting the reactor vessel , sampling the vessel internals , reducing the loop number , shortening the pipes , integrating the primary components and so on .
Thus , we should believe in the bright future of the reducing of the sodium-cooled fast reactors' cost .
Nuclear energy , the most powerful energy in the world , will attract more and more research and develop further and further .
As one of the fourth generation of nuclear reactors , sodium-cooled fast reactor has its own advantages .
It has more factors of safety and it is now under further improvement in many developed countries .
Briefly , sodium-cooled fast reactors are with brilliant prospects and the public do not need to be much concerned about its safety .
Nuclear power plants across the globe are producing about 16 percent of the world's electricity .
However , no nuclear reactors have been built for the past 30 years .
This was partly due to the 1979 incident at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania where a partial reactor meltdown and the reactor core exploding in 1986 at Chernobyl in Ukraine which resulted in casualties and spewing harmful debris across Europe (Butler , 2004) .
This was the result of inadequately trained personnel operating a flawed reactor design without proper regard for safety .
However , the fourth generation nuclear reactors can broaden the opportunities of nuclear energy for use .
Also , the new reactors are designed with the following objectives in mind; economic competitiveness , enhanced safety , minimal radioactive waste generation and proliferation resistance .
In particular , the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and the Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) are outstanding in safety , cost and performance; but the SFR has more benefits than the VHTR .
SFR uses liquid sodium as coolant to lower coolant volume fractionre outlet temperature to approximately 600 C (Roglans , et al 2002) .
As for VHTR , it produces both electricity and hydrogen from only heat and water by applying the steam reformer technology .
This way , temperature at the core outlet temperatures can reach more than 1000 C (Corwin , 2003) .
So , this design is significantly more thermally efficient as its reactor core is able to withstand higher temperature (VHTR's 1000 C to SFR's 600 C) .
It can be therefore be used as a significant source of electrical power and hydrogen generation or as a heat source .
Furthermore , helium is used as the coolant in the VHTR system .
Not only is it advantageous to sodium because it can be subjected to high temperature , it is also efficient in transfer of thermal energy .
Helium will not become radioactive and will not react with other materials .
Therefore in my opinion , VHTR is rated better only in terms of physical protection and performance as compared to SFR .
Safety is another major concern about nuclear power .
The main safety concern has always been the possibility of an uncontrolled release of radioactive material , leading to contamination and consequent radiation exposure off-site (Lacy , 2009) .
Active and passive safeguards features against accidents are to be carefully considered .
To reduce the probability of radioactive elements leaking to the atmosphere or damage to the plants , there must be an emphasis on the human factors pertaining to plant operations .
VHTR employ the method of burying waste into the floor bed of deep oceans in the middle of inactive oceanic tectonic plates .
However , geologists and biologists have expressed concern .
They do not believe this idea of seabed disposal will work .
Even with deep trenches used , it is possible that life forms living in it would bring back the still harmful nuclear waste back into contact with other life forms .
Also , it might be very difficult to safely recover the waste once it has been placed in the seabed .
As this is not the case for SFR , it is rated higher in terms of waste disposal .
SFR is designed for management of high-level wastes .
The systems increase performance requirements by employing a fully closed fuel cycle to reduce repository space (Lineberry , et al) .
This is considered a very effective actinide management strategy .
Next , the cost of new reactors must be competitive in a changing market place of energy demand .
Nuclear energy has to be economically comparable to other energy sources in order for it to be a competitive energy source .
Nuclear energy plants need to be modular or with standardized technical specifications so that plant parts can be duplicated and replaced .
This would be more economical than if each plant is uniquely designed .
As is the case for both the reactor and the fuel cycle , technology development to achieve cost competitiveness is necessary .
A key issue on the SFR system is reduction of cost to competitive levels .
None of the SFRs constructed to date have been economical to build or operate (Lineberry , et al) .
With innovations to reduce capital cost , it can extend to electricity production , given the proven capability of sodium reactors to utilize almost all of the energy in the natural uranium .
In this way , SFR can competitively serve markets for electricity .
In conclusion , plant design should be streamlined for technically sound , robust , passively safe , and low-cost production .
Despite challenges within steps of the nuclear fuel cycle that do exist , it can be solved with improvements in technology and with global cooperation .
Although the advantages of VHTR are the high fuel burn up , SFR performs better in area such as having low maintenance and operating cost , passive safety and potential modular construction .
The tradeoff of increased capital cost against cycle efficiency , VHTR must overcome these challenges , particularly in reactor safety and costs in order to be comparable with SFR system .
In 1986 , the world's worst nuclear accident Chernobyl took place in Ukraine .
The explosion of the Unit 4 reactor core had spread radioactivity across many areas , claiming lives of some 50 emergency workers and leaving health problems , such as thyroid cancer , and psychological trauma on over 5 million people .
(ElBaradei , 2005) Critics have found out that mechanical errors such as the building of Unit 4 was not up to its highest standards and that some of its safety devices were faulty; while the human management of the whole plant was questionable .
(North , 2006) This , therefore , boils down to the question as to whether the use of psychology , both in technical and human terms , during the design process of the reactor would have prevented this accident .
In any design process , the use of psychology covers the areas of safety , usability , functionality and requisite user competencies .
(Wilpert , 2007) Thus , if psychology were to be used in the design process of the Chernobyl reactor , it would have considered the possible technical failures and had used different materials for the construction , such that the radioactivity of the nuclear explosion would have been kept within the plant .
However , in the 1986 Europe , the level of technology and knowledge available was limited and the understanding of the use of psychology was constrained .
This resulted in flaws of the construction in its cooling system and containment structure of the plant itself , leading to the escapade of the harmful radiation into the environment when everything collapsed .

Disregarding ergonomics design principles: Chernobyl .

Introducing psychology in the design process can foresee the possible human errors , such as the operators' incompetent mental state of mind during the operation of the plant .
Safety measures , for example installing auto power shut-off for the reactors in the event of an accident or overlook , would have been taken to assist the operators should any human error occurs .
Having said that , the use of psychology during the process is done on the basis of an ideal situation , where the human labour is of the highly skilled and high capabilities .
However , psychology during the design process fails to consider the lack of appropriate skills and training of the labour employed during the time of operation .
For the case of Chernobyl , the designers admitted that they had not taken into account the possible user-machine interactions , thus leaving this area undetermined .
(Munipov , ND)
Critics have brought out the point that the explosion of Unit 4 was due to the poor management of the whole plant , from the failure to follow certain safety standards , to the design flaws of the reactor and structure to the incompetency of the labour .
(BBCNews .com , 2000) Even if psychology were to be used in the design process of the Chernobyl plant , it would still have overlooked the national culture and working style then .
In the old Soviet Union , the people were taught to be obedient and politically correct .
There were hardly rebuttals from the lower ranks to the senior management even if the former had found anything amiss with the machines or operating procedures .
(North , 2006) Furthermore , the state was practicing the policy of secrecy for 35 years , such that only certain information on safety standards were made known and approved , while the design flaws were always hidden from the light .
(Munipov , ND) Psychology is the study of the mind and if included in the design process , it would be seen from the user's perspective and thus , coming up with an effective design for the end product .
The use of psychology during design process would have minimize the effects of the accident , but would not have prevented it from happening because accidents happen due to the combination of errors on multiple levels , such as the context of time and national culture .
The Chernobyl accident was inevitable due to the various faults made in the different levels of the management of the plant and political factors , and this accident did provide an important lesson for both the human engineering and nuclear power world .

Title: Could the use of Psychology as described in "Psychology and Design Processes" during the design process have prevented the collapse of Nicoll Highway ?
On the 20 April 2004 at about 3 .30pm in the afternoon , a major construction incidence occurs in Singapore , the collapse of Nicoll Highway .
This caused soil subsidence of the immediate surrounding area which resulted in substantial damages on the Nicoll Highway carriageway .
This incidence had also resulted in 4 fatalities and 3 casualties .
The incidence is mainly due to the collapse of a deep excavation work alongside Nicoll Highway .
The main contractor for these works is Nishimatsu-Lum Chang Joint Venture and the client for this Circle Line project is the Land Transport Authority of Singapore (LTA) .
What could have caused this incidence ?
And who should be responsible for it ?
According to the committee of inquiry (Press Release 2005 , Ministry of Manpower) , it was concluded that the incidence was due to inadequate temporary works and design construction errors .
Very often , such mistakes are always link to the negligence and carelessness of human .
Psychological factors play an importance role in the root of this incidence .
It was reported (New Civil Engineer May 2005) that the main contractor , Nishimatsu-Lum Chang used an inappropriate soil analysis model in the early stages of the temporary work design on the highly plastic marine clays area .
The use of such model then leads to serious false predictions of forces and hence undersign in the temporary work which resulted in the fatal catastrophe .
The consequences were due to the carelessness of the engineers then .
According to Land Transport Authority's counsel K- Shanmugam (2005) , he stated that Nishimatsu-Lum Chang maintained that designs were satisfactory even after discovery of minor designs faults and pressure LTA to allow them to continue their excavation activities .
It was observed that the main contractors wanted to avoid troubles and further expenses for rectifications of minor faults , and hence resulted in the negligence .
The committee inquiry (press Release 2005 , Ministry of Manpower) stated that Nicoll Highway collapse was initiated by the failure of the strut- waler support system for the excavation .
However , the committee also highlighted that there were deficiencies in the project management that perpetuated and aggravated the design errors .
Psychological factors in the design processes such as negligence , impatience and carelessness leads to inadequate instrumentation and monitoring works , improper handling of the instrumentation data .
From the analysis of major accidents , we learnt that human's actions always plays a major role in triggering accidents as well as mitigating their consequences .
B . Wilpert (Psychology and Design Processes) .
According to the Committee , it was also discovered that there was a lack of competency of persons carrying out specialized work which resulted in the incapacity of the project management team and supervisory personnel to identify adverse trends in the construction process and implement corrective measures .
The committee of inquiry for the incidence had also pointed out that the temporary works pertaining to deep excavation were not regulated to the same degree as permanent works .
Many of the considerations in the aspect of safety were more leniently treated as compared to those required for permanent works .
As such , the designs of diaphragm walls were not strong enough to support the deep excavation and hence failures occurred .
The lower standards often lead designers to underestimate in their design .
They tend to have a psychological effects of letting down their guards in the designs where the standards are not as strict and often lead to carelessness , negligence and eventually accident .
The Nicoll Highway collapse was caused by the failure of the overloaded temporary structure connection on the level 9 strut-waler .
This resulted in the death of 4 workers .
There are three main reasons for this incident cutting cost on the temporary structure , the lack of concentration at work and negligence in checking the design of the structure due to its temporary identity .
Catastrophic incidents always take a series of mistakes to happen where human errors usually play a main part (B .Wilpert , 2007) .
Thus , the problem lies in whether psychology is important to fuse into the design process .
One of the major reasons for the temporary structure to collapse is the use of a cheaper material which made the structure unable to withstand the capacity to cater for the loads .
Erroneous individual action is crucial link in this chain .
In order to avoid the delay penalty of S$25M , Nishimatsu-Lum Chang(NLC) , the contractor company for constructing Mass Rapid Transport under Nicoll Highway , did not seek their client Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s for approval on replacement of material .
With the intention to complete the project on time , NLC replaced lower- priced material to build the remaining temporary structure when the original raw material had depleted .
Dysfunctional relations with the other organizational party created this problem .
If both NLC and LTA can communicate and negotiate efficiently by extending the deadline , NLC may not resort to risk compromising safety for fines .
In this case , this incident might not have happened .

Workers are required to work overtime to ensure timely completion of the project .
Although the standard legal law sets by Employment Act states that each employee can only work 44 hours per week (Foreign , 2003) , NLC did not oblige to the law .
Therefore , it is necessary to forbid the company from making the workers to work overtime .
Excessive overtime causes them to lose concentration and eventually wear out .
As a result , workers tend to pay less attention to the details and surroundings and are more incline to erroneous action which , in this case posed great dangers .
If anyone is alert , there will have enough time to evacuate everybody from the site before it actually collapsed since it took 1 hour for the first failure of the connection to the total collapse of the excavation (Design , 2005) , the incident might not have happened .
There was no law stating safety rule for temporary structure in 2004 , thus it was not significant to make the temporary structure a very well-built one .
Problems arise where individual organismic perspectives come to play a part .
Assumption has always been made when personnel are doing the 'assuring' job .
In addition with inadequate work team activities make the design process worse .
First , the LTA personnel thought that the contractors 'will' do a good job on designing the structure and do the calculations to ensure it is acceptable and 'assume' that the contractors already did the proper checking for the design .
Assumptions are made in between both parties .
As a result , they missed out 2 mistakes that can be easily spotted .
First mistake is the contractors used the wrong soil analysis at the early stages of the design process .
Second mistake is the contractors miscalculated the capacity of the loads for the temporary structure .
Moreover , when NLC's engineer brought out an alternative analysis models , LTA's engineer rejected because he/she thought that it was overcautious .
Second , the LTA's personnel , due to slothfulness , did not do his/her job on ensuring the safety of building works by performing checks on construction work .
Currently , there already has a set of Safety Control Process (Seetoh Hon Hoy , 2005) for temporary structure to prevent this from happening again .
Even though this incident looks like a system or technical problem , it all boils down to human faults .
Humans are responsible for designing the system , creating and enforcing laws , rules and regulations and regrettably , making mistakes during work .
By having certain degree of psychology knowledge , we are able to understand human weaknesses so that design processes can incorporate with technical knowledge to improve the system .
This can greatly reduce human errors made during work which may able to lessen accidents from happening .

"Times are exciting for nuclear ," says Ronaldo Szilard , director of nuclear science and engineering at the Idaho National Lab , a part of the U .S . Energy Department (Smith , 2009) .
Nuclear power , a breakthrough discovery that was celebrated at the end of nineteenth century , is ironically feared as a tool of destruction today .
Acting like a double edged sword , scientists hailed it as the wonder that can solve current energy crisis while critics believed incidents such as 1986 Chernobyl accidents in Ukraine and 1976 Three Mile Islands reactors meltdown may occur again .
However , due to worldwide soaring increase in carbon emission , a series of new generation IV nuclear generators concepts were proposed .
Lead cooled fast reactor (LFR) was presented as one of them .
Among the six proposed generation IV reactors , three of them belonged to fast reactors .
So what are fast reactors ?
Fast reactors utilized neutrons of much higher energy to cause fission , which differs to present types of reactors that slowed down neutrons using moderator such as water .
LFR is a type of fast reactors that relied on lead as coolant in the reactor .
The ability of it to provide reliable safety , efficient waste management and effective cost minimization enabled itself to have a competitive edge over other energy sources .
Skeptics believed that if nuclear energy replaces oil to further increase its current 21percent contribution of electricity in United States , the nuclear reactors may posed as potential targets for terrorist groups .
In addition , there is still no safe guarantee that these new LFR operate without any malfunction as they have not been presented to the National Regulatory Council for review .
Despite all these factors , general public may not aware of the refined safety measures that these new reactors possessed .
First of all , all generation IV nuclear reactors included passive design that relies on law of nature , which simplifies the current nuclear generator design that has redundant valves and control system .
Therefore , during any emergency process , the required human intervention was minimized .
Moreover , LFR has a comparative safety advantage compared to the other nuclear reactors designs .
Calculation were done to show that LFR has a better safety design mainly because lead served as a better coolant that does not react as readily as compared to sodium and air .
(Kamil Tuek , 2006) In fact , the numbers of accidents that may lead to severe accidents were declining in recent years .
(U . S . NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION , 1998)Thus , with these years of experience in improving the safety aspects of nuclear energy , the new design is deemed to be safe to provide service to mankind .
The waste management was another problematic issue in current generation III nuclear reactors .
An ordinary thermal nuclear reactor was only to extract approximately only 5 percent energy contained in uranium .
(Smith , 2009)That shows the other 95 percent of the energy would ended up as waste and needed to be store in safety for thousands year .
Million tons of radioactive materials are currently sitting somewhere in this world .
Instead of waiting them to lose their radioactivity , fast reactor is able to utilize most energy from the remaining 95 percents energy .
With current nuclear energy wastes sitting in the storage sites , GE Hitachi Company believe the power extracted would be able to meet 70 years energy demands in USA .
(GE Reports , 2009)By supporting the research on LFR , not only it would provide tremendous energy power to the world , it would also solve the headache waste issue that every OECD nations faced .
Feasibility also needed to be analyzed in our discussion .
One of the current LFR research , SSTAR (Small , Sealed , Transportable , Autonomous Reactor) offers a good solution in minimizing the capital cost of building a nuclear reactor .
Its main concept is to develop portable nuclear reactors that are able to provide their services in developing countries .
(Rennie , 2004) "With SSTAR , countries won't need a large nuclear reactor industry to benefit from nuclear energy ," says Craig Smith , a nuclear engineer in Livermore's Energy and Environment Directorate .
Cost of manufacture including materials , expertise requirement and manpower were effectively lessened with this concept .
The future is unknown .
We do not know which researches may ripen before the others .
Any research may come to a dead end due to strained resources .
LFR , a highly feasible solution for earth's energy crisis , has a clear direction and promised future .
It deserves more human and financial resources in order for it to reach maturity stage .
Safe , less waste and more affordable , these are the characteristic of our future energy .
Therefore , we should give our fullest support , as this technology may turn out to be essential for our future generation .
On April 26 , 1986 , one of four nuclear reactors at the Chernobyl power station , Ukraine , exploded .
The explosion went with large amounts of radioactive poison , causing 30 deaths and hundreds of illnesses (World Nuclear Association , 2009) .
This disaster raised great public concern about the safety of nuclear power .
Although we still could not tell whether such accidents would happen in the future , the Very- High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , one of the very recent concepts of the generation IV nuclear reactors , can possibly be a promising plan for the nuclear energy innovation because of its safe design , small environmental impact and relatively low cost .
Opponents argue that the VHTR would have a great explosion potential since the VHTR operates in an extremely high temperature of more than 1000  C . However , there is subtle safety design in the VHTR to reduce the potential of explosion .
One good design is the utilization of helium as the coolant .
Helium is aninert gas .
It will not chemically react with other materials (International Atomic Energy Agency , 1996) .
Unlike water and most other coolants , helium can maintain its non-radioactive property even when it exposes (Institute for Scientific and Technical Information , 2000) .
Another safety design is the temperature-resistant material .
Some promising materials like zirconium carbide can allow the plants perform at the temperature up to 1800 C (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2002) .According to Butler (2004) , a similar high-temperature engineering test reactor in Oarai , Japan , has already successfully operated at the temperature of 950 C . The success of this reactor suggests that more advanced temperature-resistant material can be developed in the near future .
Besides these , other safety designs like the passive heat removal system can also enhance the safety factor of the VHTR .
It can not only cool the nuclear plants fast , but also protect plants from seismic and other external events (Eul , 2006) .

Besides the concern about safety design , sceptics also doubt the environmental impacts of the VHTR .
They say that the non-recyclable radioactive waste in the VHTR reactor can harm the environment and people's health .
Although the waste of nuclear reactors is indeed radioactive , the VHTR reactor design minimises the possibility for radioactive elements to harm the environment .
According to research , the radioactivity for VHTR waste is relatively small compared with other reactors .
The VHTR produces "less heavy metal radioactive waste" and "less plutonium per unit of energy produced" because of the VHTR's high thermal efficiency (Shropshire and Herring , 2004) .It has a high thermal efficiency of over 50% , while other reactors only have a thermal efficiency of 33%-50% (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2009) .Thus , the VHTR is less harmful to the environment .
Some opponents may think that the VHTR would be very costly .
However , recent research supports exactly the opposite conclusion .
The cost for VHTR including fuels and materials , reactor systems , balance of plant , safety , design & evaluation and fuel cycle is relatively low .
The total cost would be around 610 million US dollars , which is the second cheapest among the six Generation IV reactors .
Furthermore , hydrogen produced in VHTR can be commercialised as clean fuel for transportation to make profits (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2009) .
In conclusion , the arguments against VHTR reactor cannot be valid .
As Mr . Butler (2004) said , "Global warming and rising energy needs are rehabilitating the concept of nuclear power .
But if it is the figure in the energy equation , it will need to be cheaper , cleaner and safer" (p .238) .
The VHTR has the advantage of meticulous safety designs , small environmental impact and relatively low cost .
Therefore , the VHTR could be a promising nuclear reactor for the "Nuclear power's new dawn" .

The world's energy consumption is increasing every year .
With rising economic powers such as China and India , the burning of fossil fuel to meet new energy demand simply will not solve the problem of depleting resources on a long term basis .
An alternative to fossil fuel is nuclear energy which has been used since the 1960s .
Still , after many years , there are several factors against building new nuclear reactors .
The nuclear accident in Chernobyl and nuclear weapon proliferation are just two reasons why few reactors have been built in recent years .
However , with more than 40 years of knowledge and experience in nuclear reactors , scientists and engineers have developed research in safe and high performance nuclear reactors known as Generation IV reactors .
Six reactors concepts have been selected for further research by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) .
Of the six reactors , the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) and the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) are often debated among scientists .
Although VHTR is designed to be a high-energy-efficient system , there is evidence that proves MSR is the better concept .
Safety features are one of the main considerations when designing a nuclear reactor .
Proponents of VHTR claim that it has an inherent passive safety features for both the fuel and the reactor (Goethem 2008) .
For example , the core of the reactor will be able to withstand temperatures way above the normal operating temperatures .
In the event of an accident , the probability of a meltdown occurring is minimized .
However , passive safety features are present in the MSR too .
Unlike the VHTR which produces high pressure steam at the core , MSR produces low pressure .
This is due to the nature of molten fluoride salts , which is used as coolant and is mechanically and chemically stable at sea-level pressures (Forsberg 2004) .
In other words the MSR's core cannot have a steam explosion , thus it eliminates the need for additional advance technology to control the high pressure .
Due to VHTR's high temperature and corrosive operating conditions , the materials used must have high dimensional stability and be able to withstand high pressure .
New ultra hard materials that can resist continued high temperatures and intense bombardment by neutrons have to be developed (Butler) .
Practical advantages of MSR's high temperature low pressure cooling result in higher efficiency in removing heat from the core (Fosberg 2004) .
This also implies that MSR does not need to spend additional money developing new materials to withstand the high pressure .

Nuclear Energy The world's population will expand further in the next few decades .
Countries around the globe are all working for a better quality of life , this drives the demand for energy on the hike .
There are various ways generating electricity .
However , if a mixture of energy production options is continued , it will impact the environment adversely and cause climate change in long term .
Therefore we need to produce energy which is clean , safe , abundant and cost-effective .
Nuclear power plants are providing 16% of the electricity in the world which are the largest share provided by non- greenhouse-gas-emitting source (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002) .
It has significantly decreased the environmental impact of energy generation .
Nuclear energy can generate hydrogen which is important for petroleum refinement and can be used as an oil alternative in transportation .
Many countries of the world , both industrialized and developing , believe that nuclear energy can be used to meet their demand because of its sustainability in long-term and absence of environmental impacts .
The concept of Generation IV Nuclear Energy System (NES) is able to meet this demand and is inevitable in implementation .
In 2001 , founding members of the GIF selected six best designs as reactor prototypes for the future (Butler , 2004) .
The GFR (or Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor) system is one of them .
The GFR is primarily developed to produce electricity and is able to support hydrogen production from water .
There are different models and the reference reactor is a 600-MWth/288-MWe , helium-cooled system operating with an outlet temperature of 850 C using a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002) .
With ongoing Research & Development (R&D) for its related technology , the GFR is predicted to be delivered by 2025 .
Though questions have been raised on its pending features of development , the GFR should be chosen as the research prototype due to its performance , safety and economics features .
Features of GFR There has been doubt on the safety of the GFR system .
"The fundamental safety objective is to protect people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation" (Fundamental Safety Principles , 2006) .
Another aspect of safety is the Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR and PP) .
It is also one of the objectives of a Generation IV NES is to "increase the assurance that they are a very unattractive and the least desirable route for diversion or theft of weapons-usable materials , and provide increased physical protection against acts of terrorism" (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002) .
To address this , GFR system has involved measures to enhance PR & PE and has adopted an actinide management to ensure nuclear waste utilization and availability of fuel in long term .
Some people argue that the reprocessing of waste is unsafe .
However , there has not been solid proof of accidents .
Furthermore , new forms of reprocessing will be improved .
Technologically , research on the core design , materials , and fuels is still ongoing .
With the effort of scientists and researchers , the GFR will be safely deployable if the technical hurdles are overcome .
Supporters of other reactors believe that they have better performance .
Research has shown that the GFR system ranks the top for its sustainability (Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor , 2005) .
Like the VHTR system , GFR uses helium as coolant which has a high outlet temperature of 850 C , making it able to split hydrogen from water .
This is ideal for countries largely dependent on oil import because hydrogen is an important oil alternative used in fuel cells .
Reprocessing also enhances the performance as it could cut the final amount of waste up to 96% (Butler , 2004) .
The elements with long half-life are extracted and reused .
Only a small volume of waste is left behind .
Another debatable issue is the cost of building the GFR system .
Each of the six prototype costs about US$1 billion (Butler , 2004) .
However in long term , the cost is justified by the economics-of-scale .
It is also a research emphasis to achieve low system cost (Khalil , n .d) .
For the gas- cooled reactors , this might be done by considering other coolants such as the S-CO2 , replacing the cladding materials and so on .
The world population is increasing rapidly .
At the same time , the quality of living is also higher as the standard rises .
These have caused the demand for energy rising fast .
International energy outlook predicted in 2008 that the world energy demand will increase 60 BTU per year .
According to World Nuclear Association (WNA) , the current energy mainly comes from oil and gas .
These fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources .
As the current fossil fuel reserve is running low , the price of the energy is running high .
Based on data collected by WNA , the production cost of energy from oil is the highest , followed by gas , and the nuclear energy is the lowest among all .
Hence , as the demand for the energy will go up , the research for alternative energy is inevitable .
The current alternative energy sources include solar , wind , nuclear , and biomass .
Judging from the current demand , the only energy which can provide high power output is the nuclear energy .
Hence , scientists are researching the fourth generation nuclear reactor which can provide higher power output , at the same time reduce risks .
However , many people still concern about the risk of the nuclear energy and aftermath consequences which last long to disperse as what happened in the World War II .
In my essay , I shall discuss about the key features of nuclear reactor and its comparison with other alternative energy sources .
Hence , develop argument on whether there is a need for the research of generation 4 nuclear reactor .
It is shown that the fatality of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) is 11 .9 per TeraWattHour energy produced , much lower than the other conventional energy sources .
Another thing to mention about the nuclear power is its green approach .
The nuclear power will not produce any byproduct which can damage the atmosphere like CO2 .
Hence , it is a green energy .
However , people are worried about the waste of the conventional reactor which takes million years to decay .
The new generation 4 nuclear reactor promises excellent solution with its byproduct will decay in just decades .
Also , it will produce hydrogen to use it as another type of fuel .
Hence , the new reactor is more environmentally friendly at the same time reduces people's fear of the waste .
Finally , given that people are worried about the nuclear power , it is much needed that we should research on it so that it will be safer and more efficient for us .
It is a fact that there are thousands of nuclear reactors in operation in the world now .
Hence , we should research a new generation of reactor even more to replace the old ones .
In conclusion , the nuclear power is the solution for the current energy crisis .
By researching the new generation of nuclear reactor , we can enjoy more efficient and safer energy around us .
Further research and development funding for Generation IV nuclear reactor , particularly the Very- High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) , should be supported .
Ever since Mankind has started using fossil fuels for energy , 400 billion tonnes of carbon is released and eventually would raise world temperatures by 13 degrees Celsius (Zoe ,n .d .) .
Global warming became an inevitable issue .
Mankind's hunger for energy is ever increasing , most experts agree that fossil fuels might deplete within the next 50 years (John ,2006) .
Nuclear energy was proposed to be the solution to this critical issue .
There are however , concerns about nuclear power with respect to its safety , economic viability and waste disposal .
Nonetheless , the advantages Generation IV nuclear power , specifically Very-High- Temperature reactor(VHTR) , could provide can offset its high start up cost and overcome its disadvantages .
Thus , further research and development funding for VHTR should be supported .Thesis
In conclusion , the increasing demand of energy would mean that fossil fuels would deplete in the near future .
In addition , continual usage of fossil fuels would increase the emission of greenhouse gases which causes global warming .
The VHTR would be an ideal model to supply nuclear energy to resolve the problems .
There are concerns about producing nuclear energy with regards to its cost , security and performance .
However , the VHTR includes features and benefits that would offset its disadvantages .
Therefore , the VHTR model should be given more funding for further research and development .
Whenever nuclear power is concerned , accident is always the first thing that comes into the picture .
However , people seldom think about how nuclear energy will benefit the world by providing a solution to global warming .
Increasing energy needs and Global warming are restoring the idea of nuclear power .
According to Butler (2004) by 2050 the carbon dioxide level in the air is expected to double causing severe global warming .
Therefore , new sources of green energy are needed to prevent this from happening .
There are many different green energy such as solar energy , turbine generated energy from wave and wind but nuclear energy especially Very High Temperature Reactor can be the most reliable source of energy in the future when security , safety and cost of nuclear power could be resolve .
Security issue against terrorist and use of nuclear weapon is a major concern when we think about nuclear power .
The destructive power of nuclear bombs can be seen in the history of World War 2 , when two atomic bombs are used on Japan killing 220000 people .
As technology become more advance , hydrogen bombs which are deadlier are now available and the world would be in trouble if it is in the wrong hands and effects worst than September 11 may happen .
However this is only possible when we try to integrate the process of recycling nuclear waste , which is not available for Very High Temperature Reactor .
During the process of recycling , plutonium a key ingredient for advance nuclear weapon is produce .
Most countries including The United States has refrain from reprocessing waste and discourage other from doing so too .
Since the very high temperature does not recycle waste the problem that people may misuse the technology will be resolve .
Even if there is recycling of waste convectional reprocessing does not generate weapon grade plutonium and chemical could be use to spike the plutonium to make it too hot to steal or transport .
Safety issue is definitely a concern as the history of the Three Mile Island in 1979 and the Chernobyl incident in 1986 leave a long lasting bad impression of nuclear plant .
During the Chernobyl incident the plant was blew apart in a very short time and cause 31 immediate deaths .
The worst thing when nuclear reactor like the nuclear bomb was not the immediate death but the exposure of human to radiation .
After the explosion the land was to be vacant and non usable and is believed to have increase the number of cancer cases in Europe .
However comparing the number of death cases to those in cave in land mine the number is minimal as cave in usually result in hundred and thousand of death .
One of the reasons of the accident was due to the staff inexperience but for the newer plant there will be more advance safety enhancement and inbuilt automatic safety features that will cool themselves in times of emergency .
Although the cost of building a nuclear plant is very high and the price of the energy generated is higher than those we have in the market , development on nuclear plant is still a necessity .
In the long run the price of the energy generated by coal and oil would skyrocket as the tax for carbon emission increase exponentially .
The development of nuclear plant would prevent this especially the Very High Temperature Reactor .
The very high temperature reactor can generate both electricity and hydrogen and it is 50% more effective than the conventional reactor and it allow countries to be self sustainable in term of energy .
In conclusion , nuclear power is definitely one of the better choices when we are looking for a green source of energy .
Nuclear power is one technology that must be accelerated promoted and relied upon if the world is to stabilize carbon emission at an acceptable level .
Nuclear power plants are not nuclear bombs waiting to go off .

In the modern world , nuclear power is widely used There are more than 400 nuclear power plants operating in 30 countries , which supply almost 17 percents of the world's electricity .
However , without successful generation IV concepts , the nuclear industry will struggle to maintain its current position of generating 17% of the world's electricity ."
There are six types of generation IV reactor .
Many people believe that the sodium-cooled fast reactor is the best of them .
However , after the research , I support the Gas- cooled fast reactor is the better one .
First , for the sodium-cooled fast reactor , it is top-ranked in sustainability because of its closed fuel cycle and excellent potential for actinide management .
Actually , it can make the use of 99% of fuel .
The outlet temperatures in the range of 510-650 makes the resulting thermal efficiencies range from 39% to 47% .
The performance of sodium-cooled fast reactor seems so perfect , however , compared with the Gas-cooled fast reactor , these data is not perfect anymore .
For gas-cooled fast reactor , it is also a closed fuel cycle and the use of fuel can reach 99% as well .
The outlet temperatures in the range of the gas-cooled fast reactor is around 850 , so it makes the theoretical value of its thermal efficiency is 50% .
This limit of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is just 47% .
Second , safety is another important factor .
For the sodium-cooled fast reactor , it is a primary system that operates near atmospheric pressure and important features of the system include a long thermal response time which is a large margin to cool the boiling .
It also offers a high level of safety reliability .
This fact is based on active safety countermeasures for self-controlled shutdown function and cooling function .
However , dynamic simulations indicate that an accidental reduction of flow up to 2-3 can be tolerated (with no control action) without sodium boiling or fuel melting .
From it we can find the most significant part for safety features of sodium- cooled fast reactor is the control action .
Thus , no matter which kind of generation IV reactor , if its system has control action , it is also relatively safety .
Furthermore , the gas-cooled fast reactor also has its own control action of the system .
This control makes the gas-cooled fast reactor can be as safe as the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
Third , the cost of the fast reactor is also significant .
Some evident shows the sodium-cooled fast reactor can reduce the cost of the raw material by changing it .
However , as the sodium-cooled fast reactor was developed later than the other kinds of factors , especially later than the gas-cooled fast reactor , the cost of research and investigation of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is so huge .
Just because of it , many developed countries do not have enough money to afford this expense .
Therefore , it obstructs the application of the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
Compared with sodium-cooled fast reactor , the gas-cooled fast factor is an old one which has been developed and widely used since 1979 .
Its cost of development is far less than the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
It does not need to be changed or improved so much .
The main cost of it is just the annual depreciation which is far less than the development cost of the sodium- cooled reactor .
In addition , we should consider the cost of time of the reactors .
The gas-cooled fast reactor can be used directly at once .
However , the sodium-cooled fast reactor should be checked for several years by the fact .
Therefore , the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor by cost .
In conclusion , even though the sodium-cooled fast reactor is a good type of generation IV reactor , the gas-cooled fast reactor is a much better one .
Compared with the sodium-cooled fast reactor , the gas-cooled reactor has its obvious advantages of performance and cost .
It has the larger thermal efficiency and less cost of expense and time .
Even though the safety of sodium-cooled fast reactor may be better than the gas-cooled fast reactor , it cannot change the fact that the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor in contemporary time , because there is still no way to make the nuclear power totally safe by now .
Therefore , the gas-cooled fast reactor is better than the sodium-cooled fast reactor .
According to the latest energy consumption statistics in 2008 , the majority of energy consumption was still made up of oil , coal and natural gas 34 .8% , 24 .2% and 24 .1% respectively .
However , the fact behind the door is that under the current consumption pace , no more than 50 years the oil and natural gas will use up and the coal reserve can also only sustain 120 years more .
Faced with the unprecedented energy crisis , finding an alternative energy resource has naturally become the top priority issue .
For the present , nuclear energy is gradually playing increasingly vital role in the energy supply due to its high efficiency and abundant raw materials .
However , some of the public are still concerning some of the issues associated with the nuclear energy , for example the cost , safety and performance .
The concern is understanding , since the nuclear catastrophe happened in Chernobyl on 26 April 1986 is still fresh in our mind .
But those disasters are mainly result from the human's wrong operation .
Besides , as Declan Butler said: Global warming and rising energy needs are rehabilitating the concept of nuclear power .
Furthermore , with the six generation IV reactor concept coming out , especially the VHTR , I firmly believe all the difficulties will be settled in the near future .
To begin with , some of opponents will argue that the cost of building a nuclear reactor is too high and the cost mentioned above generally comprises of research , development , regulation , construction costs , and the contribution to the nuclear waste fund .
Frankly speaking , some of this problem does really exist , but we can view it from another perspective , which means comparing its cost with other kind of power plant under all the same factors .
Firstly , the cost of constructing a nuclear reactor is at most 2 to 3 times than the cost of building a heat-energy reactor with the same output .
But the raw material like uranium enrichment used for nuclear reactor is much cheaper both in transport and price under the same amount of energy output .
In addition , unlike the heat-energy reactor , the gas emitted during the operation has a little influence on the environment and global warming .
Lastly , the achievement obtained from the research can also be applied into other fields .
Secondly , numerous public are holding the view that the nuclear reactor is still existing huge potential safety risk .
Reviewing the history , the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island catastrophe indeed witnessed the enormous harm the nuclear reactor could cause .
While the investigation report showed that the direct cause was a series of wrong operations , the result actually didn't have much relation with the nuclear reactor itself .
Currently , the materials applied in VHTR are more advanced and steady compared to the past .
For example , the Carbon-Fibre reinforced Carbon can bear the highest temperature which the VHTR could generate .
In addition , due to the tri-structure-isotropic and its multi layer , the waste will become difficult to crack and release harmful radiation and fission products .
Therefore , the wastes become concentrated and then easily to deal with .
In conclusion , I firmly believe that the huge potential benefits the nuclear reactor creates will no doubt attract more support not only from the government but also public and once the VHTR construction completed , I think the dawn of nuclear energy has also already come .
Global warming has been the main concern of the governments around the world for the past decade .
High carbon dioxide emission has been one of the main culprits for global warming .
Thus there is a need to find alternatives to produce energy instead of relying on the conventional ones .
Although it is not commonly seen , some countries are already using nuclear reactors to produce energy .
These nuclear reactors unlike the conventional power plants , they do not produce greenhouse gases (Gerstner , 2009) .
However , these nuclear reactors also have their own disadvantages such as producing radioactive wastes , high cost and safety issues .
Research has shown that it is possible to have a nuclear reactor that is cleaner , safer and cheaper (Butler , 2004) .
Thus , there should be funding for research and development for Generation IV nuclear reactor .
Some people have the impression from the two major incidents which happened in Chernobyl , Ukraine and Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania that nuclear reactors are dangerous and are against the idea of having nuclear reactors .
The two incidents happened due to high temperature , which leads to the partial meltdown .
This would not happen in the new reactors as they have better cooling systems that will allow the plants to cool down faster when they reached too high a temperature (Butler , 2004) .
In conclusion , there should be funding for research and development for Generation IV reactors .
It helps in coping with global warming by not producing greenhouses gases unlike the conventional power plants .
Although it produces large amount of radioactive wastes , as long as the hybrid reactor could be produced , the wastes would not be a problem .
Furthermore Generation IV reactors are able to produce more energy , thus the cost of the energy would be cheaper .
Lastly it has better system which would prevent similar incidents of meltdown of the nuclear power reactor to happen .
Thus there should be funding to develop Generation IV reactors .
Very high temperature reactor is one of the six Generation IV reactor concepts , which is designed to be a high-efficiency system so that it can supply electricity and process heat to a broad spectrum of high-temperature and energy-intensive processes .
Some of its excellent features had inspired United States to do a lot of research on Very high temperature reactor .
Now , the very high temperature reactor is still in developing .
However , there is much debate over the development of the very high temperature reactor .
Opponents argue mainly about the security and cost of the very high temperature reactor .
Even the opposite opinions exist , it is still necessary to develop the very high temperature reactor .
Opponents argue mostly about the huge destructiveness in an accident and the hidden radioactive pollution .
Some accidents of nuclear power plants , such as the Chernobyl disaster occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant , caused huge panic about the new clear power plant .
However , during that time the nuclear reactors were not well developed .
Researches done by the experts in United State showed that the security of the very high temperature would be improved quite a lot .
First , since the core is composed of helium , whose coolant is dingle phase , and graphite whose thermal inertia is very large , the core becomes very steady and safe .
In addition , fuel of the very high temperature reactor is designed to cycle from ore extraction of final waste disposal and radioactive wastes will be sent to repositories for final geologic disposal which will reduce both the lifetime and toxicity of the radioactive waste .
Therefore , the safety of the very high temperature reactor is improved a lot .
Another reason for opposition is the high cost of the very high temperature reactor .
Given that the cost of the nuclear power plant including very high temperature reactor is very high and it will take several decades to recover from the cost , the opponents think it is not reasonable to use very high temperature reactor .
However , according to the research done by the experts , the very high temperature reactor will be designed in condition that the generation cost will be competitive when compared with other energy sources and the capital investment cost will be low enough for a large number of countries .
Hence , the very high temperature will provide competitive economics .
In conclusion , the reasons against the development of the very high temperature are debatable .
The safety and cost of the high temperature reactor should not be used to limit the development of the very high temperature reactor , on the contrary , they should be considered as challenges to be overcome .
Anyway , the research about the very high temperature reactor shows that the very high temperature is beneficial to the society .
Therefore , the very high temperature should be developed .
In the twenty-first century , the world is developing in a rapid pace that has never occurred in the past .
Countries like China and India keep their GDP up to 8% increase almost every year .
Besides the increase of GDP , carbon dioxide emission is also reaching the highest level compare to the past .
Obvious climate change experienced in many countries and regions remind us that the green house effect is really dangerous to the earth .
We should stop destroying our earth by continue mining and generating electricity through the coal plants .
Nuclear power seems to be a suitable solution .
However , the opponents feel that nuclear power is not acceptable mainly due to safety , cost and its pollution issue .
In fact , by using Generation Four nuclear power plant in coming future , these problems can be solved definitely .
And among all types of the Generation IV nuclear power technology , very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) would be the best choice due to its safeness , efficiency and environment friendliness .
Firstly , opponents of using nuclear power plants argue that nuclear power is not a safe technology .
The reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania seems that nuclear power technology is extremely dangerous to use .
I do admit that some of the public has lost their confidence and trust after this accidence happened .
However , we should understand that the TML used pressurized water reactor which is Generation Two model , the safety concern on that model is much lesser comparing to VHTR which is a Generation Four model .
VHTR make use of helium , an inert gas , as coolant .
It will not react with the VHTR materials nor become radioactive itself .
Hence , it is very safe to use .
Secondly , any supports of traditional power plants argue that the cost of building nuclear plants is much higher than for the coal plants .
Actually , the construction cost of nuclear power plants keeps on reducing in the past few years .
For example , the construction cost for the first third generation reactor , ABWR , built in Japan was 2000 per KW , while the Chinese Nuclear Power Industry has built new plants of their own design at capital costsreported to be$1500 per KW and $1300 per KW at sites in South-East and North-East China recently .
In fact , the VHTR could even produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with other nuclear plants .
In addition , the maintenance and labor cost of VHTR is much less than the coal plants .
With the low maintenance fees , low labor cost and the high output of electricity , the total cost of the VHTR is actually less than the coal plants after a few years of operation .
Thirdly , the opponents of nuclear power plants worry that the disposal of radioactive waste from the plants will cause serious illness or even death to people live or work near the place .
However , the VHTR has a reactor core made of graphite , which possess high stability even in high temperature .
And by using uranium dioxide fuel particles coated with graphite , the reactors will not release radioactive substances even in extreme high temperature .
It has zero waste .
In addition , VHTR is capable of producing hydrogen gas by breaking the molecular bond of H2O .
As hydrogen gas has zero carbon dioxide emission , it has a potential to replace petroleum as a clean fuel for transportation .
So VHTR is environment friendly and the most optimized solution towards green house effect .
In conclusion , it should be evident that the arguments against nuclear power plants are not valid .
Among the generation IV reactors , the very-high-temperature reactor is most likely to be the best choice due to its safeness , efficiency and environment friendliness .
As a good solution towards green house effect , we expect to see a bright future of nuclear power technology and it will be adopt in more countries in next few decades .
The Tenerife runway accident involved the collision of two airplanes , the Pan American (Pan Am) Boeing 747 and the Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KLM) aircraft .
The accident was caused by the lack of the use of psychology during the design process , and could have been prevented , had more psychological considerations been into the aircraft designs .
Both the KLM and Pan Am aircrafts were designed to work under normal conditions .
As such , the aircrafts were not made to be ready for unforeseen circumstances .
The plane could operate , lift off and function , but only under predictable conditions .
Here , we could see that aircraft designers were capable and technically competent in creating aircrafts .
However , the designers failed to understand that aircrafts were to be piloted by humans , and not some fearless beings .
When the aircraft personnel suddenly found themselves in a panic situation , they could not respond appropriately because the aircraft was never built to be put in tricky situations .
However , some people say that the accident was caused due to human error .
Upon realising that there was a crisis , the aircraft crew of each vessel responded without much consideration as to what their actions might lead to .
People then blamed the cause of the accident on the aircraft crew of both sides for badly managing the situation .
Still , the reason behind the cause of the accident cannot be blamed on the aircraft crew .
The aircraft crew reacted the way they reacted because the plane was not built with all the necessary functions for them to react in an unexpected situation .
For example , under low-visibility conditions , there was no way the Pam Am officer could differentiate between a stationary and a vibrating aircraft nearby .
Had strong light-emitting devices been installed on the KLM aircraft , an unambiguous signal would have been sent , leaving the Pan Am officer with a clear signal .
In this situation people cannot say that the Pan Am officer did not do his job because he a kept lookout on the surroundings , but in the midst of the fog , the presence of the KLM aircraft signaled an ambiguous message .
Also , had proximity sensors been installed within the Pan Am aircraft , the whole accident could have been prevented .
The Pan Am officer saw the KLM through the fog and noticed its apparent static state when it was in fact still moving .
If an alarm was sounded upon when safety distance between the Pan Am and KLM aircraft was breached , the Pan Am crew would have steered their aircraft away from hazard .
The undetected KLM aircraft collided with the Pan Am aircraft because by the time the Pan Am officer realised that the KLM was nearing their aircraft , it was too late .
Had he been warned by the ringing alarm of a proximity sensor , he would have gotten enough time to respond and not panic when the impending collision was apparent .
Therefore , psychology has been recognized as an integral part of the design process today .
Students enrolled in the engineering courses in Ngee Ann Polytechnic nowadays are required to study interdisciplinary subjects , one of which includes introductory psychology .
For these reasons , we conclude that the accident in the Tenerife runway could have been avoided , had the use of psychology been applied in the designing .
If designers still persist that psychological considerations are of hardly any importance , then the users of their products may well be put in situations where accidents are bound to occur .
At the beginning of 2002 , 438 nuclear power plants were in operation in 31 countries around the world , generating electricity one billion people .
They account for approximately 17 percent of worldwide installed base load capacity for electricity generation and provide half or more of the electricity in a number of countries .
These reactors are generating electricity in a reliable , environmentally safe and affordable manner without emitting noxious gases into the atmosphere .

We have achieved so much .
However , nuclear power plants sometimes could cause disasters .
Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania; Chernobyl accident happened in Ukraine .
We bear while using nuclear power .
As a result , a new generation of nuclear power- The six generation IV reactors concepts were raised to solve this problem .
Among all these six generation IV nuclear reactor plants , I think Very-high-temperature reactor is the most promising one .
We can use this kind of reactors to solve our energy problems .
Security has always been the most concerned problem which is also biggest trouble in using nuclear power .
For the last few years , very few new nuclear power plants were built .
We are not only concerning the shortage of technology but also considering the danger of terrorists .
Nuclear power could be easily used as weapon because we do not need to consider controlling the bomb , but if we use nuclear power as energy , then we should make it safe for us to operate it .
The big danger hidden in nuclear power plant also makes it as a target for those who want to destroy .
From "Baidu" dictionary , we know that the power released in Chernobyl Accident was about 400 times as big as the atom bomb which US threw in Hiroshima .
We must make sure that there is not a little danger in our building and using nuclear power .
Our new technology used in VHTR nuclear power plant includes simplified safety features that do not rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators .
"Meltdown proof" and can cool themselves down even if anyone shuts off the coolant or power supply .
(Nuclear power's new dawn) Different form the caution we must take in using traditional nuclear power plants , now we can make the most of nuclear power .
In the society today ,there are many ideas or concept that are currently in the stages of research and development .
Some of the ideas and new creations which falls into this category are robotics and hybrid cars .
There are many reasons amounting to the factors which results in the delaying of mass production in the market .
These include lack of technology as well as funding from the appropriate ministries or bodies .
With regards to hybrid cars , prior to the mass production and usage of it , there are some factors with respect to the construction of the vehicle that we have to factor in in order to increase the safety aspects of usage .
Some of the vito factors leading to increased safety levels requires the addition of new features into the vehicle as well as modifications being made to current existing design .
According to Smith(N .D) , hybrid cars are cars that run on electricity source via internal conversion of kinetic energy into electricity .
As it depends mainly on electricity to operate , the cost of a hybrid car is thus not cheap , as compared to vehicles that function on petrol or diesel .
Basically , as stated earlier , it works on the principle of conversion of kinetic energy into charging of batteries .
This is done when cars applied brakes and come to halt .
Upon applying of brakes , the kinetic energy which would otherwise be converted into heat energy due to the presence of friction will be converted into electricity instead and stored in the batteries .
When it stops , no energy is consumed as the engine will switch off by itself and operate upon motion of the vehicle .
The tyres have low resistance with the aim of drafting or cutting air resistance .
The weight of a hybrid car tends to be lighter than a normal petrol-powered car as it is made of materials that are of low density .
Given the structure of the present hybrid cars , there are indeed some areas of safety aspects that are neglected and should be included to increase the safety of users .
However , there are some limitations regarding the improvement of structure for the vehicle to increase safety levels .
These considerations are mainly with respect to the monetary cost of the improved version of hybrid cars as well as the capability of it after the restructure .
According to Weston(N .D)  , the cost of hybrid car is usually more expensive as compared to normal cars .
In terms of cost and fuel savings , it will take several years before one can see the effects of the savings .
Hence , by introducing new features into hybrid cars , it will then increase the costs of the car itself , making it more expensive than the current design models .
As a result , it will decrease the quantity demanded by potential consumers and manufactures may not find it profitable to mass produce it .
Also , according to Robinson(2007 , September 29)  ,with the introduction of more features into the hybrid car , this would means that more electricity would be required to operate the car .
This would then add up to the existing large amount of electricity present in the engine .
We must acknowledge the fact that there is a certain limit to how much electricity can be dissipated in the engine or stored in the batteries .
Too much electricity would pose a danger to the vehicle as a whole in the event of an accident and will also affect the performance of the car itself .
As the design of hybrid cars is in such a way that the motor and batteries are located at the back , too much electricity would also means that larger batteries would be needed .
This would then inevitably increase the size of the vehicle making the back heavier than the front , which is something undesirable as it may lead to unstability of the vehicle .
Some of the measures that could be introduced and implemented to increase the safety aspects of future hybrid cars include using higher resistance tyres or tyres with more grooves .
Currently , the tyres of hybrid cars are of low resistance to draft air resistance .
This poses a danger especially on rainy days or on wet surfaces .
A scientific and logical explanation was given by Serway ,&Jewett (N .D) , whom explained that on rainy days or on wet surfaces , static and kinetic friction would be reduced greatly .
Static and kinetic friction depends greatly on its coefficient , which usually ranges from 0 .5 to 1 .5 .
However ,on wet surfaces , the coefficient would be greatly reduced and vehicles would be more prone to skidding or swerving off-course .
Hence , by using tyres of higher resistance , it will increase the friction between the tyres and road surfaces thus reducing chances of skidding or instability of vehicles .
The inclusion of airbags into hybrid cars are also detrimental to the safety of its users .
In the present market , the size of a hybrid car is small .
Hence , they do not have airbags fitted inside the car .
This poses danger to the driver as well as passengers because in the event of an accident , when the driver jammed down hard on the brakes , the effects of inertia will be very large .
Thus , without the aid of an airbag , the driver and front passenger especially may just crashed straight through the windscreen and incurred serious injuries .
But , with the aid of an airbag , these will be prevented as the effects of inertia which caused the driver and front passenger to crash straight through the windscreen will be cushioned by the airbags .
Installation of earthing device is also necessary to increase the level of safety .
As claimed by Robinson(2007 ,September 29) , there is a large amount of electricity present in the motor of the hybrid car .
Should an accident or collision occurs , it may caused the batteries to be damaged severely .
There is also a danger of leaking or overflowing of electric charges as the batteries are damaged .
As the amount of electricity with respect to our subject is of a substantial amount , hence , it would then pose life dangers to the passengers on board , as well as rescuers .
By installing an earthing device within the vehicle itself , it would then ensure that excess charges are earthed safely to the ground and will not pose life danger to anyone .
The weight of the car also plays a part in ensuring the safety aspect of the hybrid car .
The present hybrid cars are designed light as they use mainly materials of low density to construct the whole vehicle .
This may not be desirable because if the vehicle goes too fast , it may tend to lose its centre of gravity and hence , lose stability .
So , by increasing the weight of the vehicle , the vehicle will be tougher and have a lower centre of gravity .
It will then ensure stability of the vehicle .
The weight of the car can be increased by adopting the several measures mentioned in the previous paragraphs .
In conclusion , there are pros and cons regarding the improvements to hybrid cars in order to increase its level of safety .
However , we must recognize that our safety is of utmost importance and take precedence above anything else .
I hope that in the near future , we are able to do our part for our mother Earth by driving such hybrid cars as it reduces greenhouse gases since it is not driven by petrol or diesel , but at the same time not compromising our personal safety .
Nowadays , people are living longer than in the past and the growth of the world's population is increasing expectedly to around 10 billion by the year 2050 .
Therefore , there is an increasing demand for energy usage throughout the world .
According to the article of Nuclear Power/Nuclear Dawn (The Economist , 2007) , the global electricity consumption is expected to double in the next few decades [1] .
Furthermore , due to the depletion of unrenewable energy such as coal and fossil fuel , the scientists in many countries start to seek for a new source of energy , which is nuclear energy .
Although the potential for the uses of nuclear power energy is great , there are a number of opponents with anti-nuclear sentiment , preventing the construction of nuclear plants in the past few decades in many countries .
Such issues include the safe operations of nuclear reaction As a result , the generation IV nuclear energy system was introduced , which was an improved design from their predecessors , Generation IV reactors are offering significant advances such as clean , safe and cost effective .
Therefore , The very-high temperature reactor (VHTR) was introduced to meet global energy demands .
Firstly , VHTR generates energy in a much simpler way compared to other types of reactors .
It is because it makes use of the thermo-chemical iodine- sulfur (I-S) process , so that hydrogen can be generated from heat and water .
A 600 MW VHTR can produce hydrogen which can supply over 2 billion cubic meters every day .
In addition , the use of steam reformer technology to core outlet temperature allows the temperature reach above 1000 C [2] .
Therefore , the thermal efficiency of the VHTR is 50 percent more compared to the Generation II and Generation III reactors .
With this high core outlet temperature , VHTR enables applications like hydrogen production or electricity cogeneration for petrochemical industries [3] .
Moreover , VHTR is graphite-moderated and uses helium as a coolant for supplying heat and generate electricity) .
In addition , VHTR system is flexible to adopt uranium or plutonium fuel cycles with the enhanced waste minimization .
As a result , it offers various heat processing applications for higher- efficiency electricity production , while preserving the desirable safety characteristics offered by modular high temperature gas-cooled reactors .

In addition , VHTR systems are economically cheap , safe and reliable due to its high hydrogen production efficiency and inherent safety features of the fuel and reactors [4] .
The application of open fuel cycle in VHTR system makes VHTR good at proliferation resistance and its physical protection .
With advanced electricity and capabilities , there are many countries like China , USA and Japan have chosen to develop VHTR systems as its priority .
By adopting the experiences from those countries , VHTR can be upgraded with a lower cost of the implementation .
It is because the construction of more advanced nuclear energy systems often addresses their economics in a variety of changing markets in order to overcome the high construction cost , the VHTR system reflects its potential economically and safely generating power energy such as electricity and hydrogen at a high efficiency without the emission of toxic gases .
Unlike other reactors in Generation IV reactors such as the gas-cooled fast reactors (GFR) and the lead-cooled fast reactors (LFR) , although the LFR and GFR can generate electricity and hydrogen , the power output efficiency is not as high as the VHTR .
Furthermore , the sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFR) and the supercritical-water cooled reactors (SCWR) are able to produce electricity only as their power output [5] .
Last but not least , in addition to hydrogen production , recycling of radioactive fuel in a fuel cycle helps to reduce the amount of nuclear waste compared to those produced by current reactors and generating high quantities of electricity makes the use of VHTR more economically in our daily life .
However , even if there are several advantages for the use of VHTR , a number of disadvantages are still present in Generation IV reactors .
For example , the high overall cost of nuclear reactors and the production of toxic waste are to be mentioned .
The construction of each nuclear plant can cost several billion dollars due to changing regulatory delays , safety scares and multiple subcontractors working on cost plus basis .
All these will lead to huge cost overrun for building a plant .
Moreover , after three year of use , the long-lived toxic radioactive wastes are produced and accumulated .
These radioactive materials cannot be burned compared to conventional reactors .
Instead , these materials are stored near the nuclear plant until it is moved to a permanent facility .
As a result , it is more likely to endanger human life and the environment once the toxic wastes are leaked out .
In conclusion , there are 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries which supply 15% of the world's electricity .
According to the chief economist of International Energy Agency (IEA) , "the world wide generating capacity of nuclear power plants will probably increase from about 370GW today to 520 GW in 2030" (The Economist , 2007) .
Most nuclear plants have longer lifespan of more than 40 years according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
Hence , if the plants can still perform well , it gets extra 20 years extension once 40-year plant licenses expired .
Therefore , these will lead to the high energy outputs which can cater for an increasing demand on the electricity consumption .
A speech given by Lewis Strauss , the head of America's Atomic Energy Commission , stated that "One day nuclear power would be too cheap to meter" [6] .
This goes to show that how great the potential of nuclear power .
Although there are some disadvantages present and the time for the earliest delivery of Generation IV still has years to go , they are just minority problems .
In order to cater for more electricity consumption in the future , there is a need to look for another source of energy , "Nuclear Power" .
With this in mind , more researches and development have to be carried out especially for VHTR system which has been described as a prototype for next generation nuclear plants [4] .
Therefore , I do agree with nuclear power is a new dawn for the next generation and the main focal point for research and development (R&D) should be focusing on VHTR .
Therefore , with the advantages offered by VHTR in terms of security , cost and performance , people should support the construction of Generation IV and further research and development funding are also required for VHTR to be developed .

After the catastrophe that happened at Chernobyl , Russia 1986 , the World start to concern more carefully about the safety and security of nuclear power reactors .
A majority of public have been opposing the development of nuclear plants around their living areas .
As a result , nuclear industry has stepped into the degradation , causing the world energy crisis .
However , nowadays the scientists have proved that with measured cautions , nuclear power could be used to supply alternated energy to the world as the fossil fuels would come to an end soon .
At the same times , there are many evidences show that nuclear power could be considered as the best suggestion to mitigate global warming .
This era is 'Nuclear Renaissance' , and the reasons for the renaissance of nuclear are due to the advanced technology and innovation of human to make nuclear power safer , cleaner with better cost effectiveness .
Hence , with the security systems , modern technology and intelligence of the manpower , I strongly believe that building of nuclear power plant should not be stopped .
First of all , public are against the proposal of building nuclear power plant to supply electrical energy as they are very concerned with safety of the plant .
Questions that come to their mind will be .
"What is going to happen to us if the nuclear plant exploded ?
" , "Do they contain the deadly radioactive particles ?" .
The Chernobyl disaster is one of the nuclear power plant accidents that remind people about how dangerous nuclear reaction can be .
But we have to look at other things like passenger aircrafts .
Accidents happened every now and then , and through these accidents , people learnt and things were improved to prevent the same accidents from happening once again .
For example , the windows of the planes used to have square shape in the past but engineer have changed all of them to round shape to improve the safety of airplanes .
Because of accidents and people found out the solutions to improve safety .
Similarly , new designs nuclear power reactors are there to reduce off-site radioactivity to the minimum if there is accident .
The latest nuclear power plant accidents happened in 1999 , which is more than 10 years ago .
In 10 years , technology is advancing rapidly .
Therefore , I believe that nuclear power plant is very much safer than it was in the past .
The second factor that concerns public is whether nuclear energy is the main contribution to the Global warming and causing climate change .
Researchers stated that at the rate of consumption , fossil fuel can only last for another thirty to forty years .
In deed , the time needed for fossil fuel to regenerate requires million of years under high pressure .
Due to the fact that we are consuming more fossil fuels , natural gas and destroying more trees , it leads to Global warming that caused by the amount of carbon dioxide trapping heat in the atmosphere and the depletion of ozone layers .
However , as evidenced by scientists , although nuclear energy still produce some greenhouse gas emissions associated with the life cycle of uranium , but this is significantly less than the emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels .
Moreover , nuclear power might be "carbon- zero" if the uranium could be utilize in more effective way .
Additionally , Nuclear power is cheap compare to fossil fuel and produces little pollutants compare to fossil fuel .
Therefore , nuclear power can be considered as the best solution as it produce amount of energy but produce little amount of waste .
Some people think that a nuclear power plant is expensive to build due to the advanced technology and the quality of the structures it requires .
In fact , comparing to coal fired and natural gas fire , though nuclear plant initially is expensive to build but it is less expensive to run and has more proven longer-term benefits .
There have been numerous improvements in construction methods in the last few decades and that is fully applicable to the construction of a nuclear power plant .
However some methods required early investment to secure the longevity and security of the plant in the long term .
For a country that does not yet use nuclear power , the introduction and development of nuclear power is a major undertaking .
It requires the country to build the necessary infrastructure so it can construct and operate a nuclear power plant (NPP) profitably in a safe , secure and technically sound manner .
The sustainability of climate , land , energy and water must be secured and managed so that a NPP can be operable profitably and securely throughout its entire life cycle .
In order to ease the worry of public about safety issues of nuclear power , scientists are working hard to come up with the next generation of nuclear reactors which excels in enhanced safety , cost-effectiveness and better performance .
Sodium Cooled Fast Nuclear Reactor (SFR) is chosen here as the model for fast nuclear reactor because of its significant benefits .
SFR has high percentage of the burn - up which means they can "breed" a higher percentage of the fuel than they consume roughly 70-80 percent , compared to 55 per cent for the current generation .
At the same time , SFR concept is significantly good at making full use of uranium effectively .
Beside , SFR has advantage in disposal requirement , in which it is designed to reduce the amount of actinide in order to well manage the high level waste .
Furthermore , another benefit that makes SFR concept a better choice is its safety features .
SFR has higher boiling point , meaning that it requires longer thermal response time , thus it will be a large margin to coolant boiling that minimize the probability of accidents happening at boiling phase .
Last but not least , with the innovative design structure and modern materials , SFR therefore has lower power plant capital cost with higher effective productivity .
In conclusion , I believe there is no reason to delay the developing of this new generation of nuclear reactor concept in order to serve the urgent need of energy all over the World .
From all of the above pros and cons of nuclear energy and nuclear power reactor , we realize that these issues involved developing of these modern techniques are not impossible to solve and why not to commit renewed effort and fresh innovations to get these nuclear power plant get up and going ?
The world energy crisis has already taken place , climate change has become the reality; more than six billions people have to deal with the shortage of food supply . . . As to all energy generation technology , there are advantage and disadvantages with nuclear power .
The world therefore cannot afford to ignore the potential source of low carbon energy provided by these fast nuclear reactors .
The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 in Ukraine was not the only major accident that gave devastating impact to Russia .
In September 2009 , another accident gave Russia a huge hit .
Russia's biggest hydroelectric power plant in Sayano-Shushenskaya had a big explosion accident .
75 workers were killed and one person was reported missing in the accident .
The top industrial safety official in Russia stated that human's negligence was the major factor in the devastation of the accident .
One part of an overstrained turbine unit which weighted 1 ,500 tons snapped off from its restraining bolts and flow 14 meters into the air , causing floods .
Due to flooding in the plant , short circuits crippled the plant and exploded .
It is said that the cost of repairing the damage would be over $1 .2 billion and the duration to recover the damage would take two years .
Accidents are events that involve unintended harms .
Could this hydroelectric power plant accident be prevented if the design of the plant was given more thought about safety ?
Many engineers and experts are debating whether psychology in design processes could prevent accidents from occurring .
Although some contend psychology used in designing can prevent accidents , there are some reasons and evidences to oppose the theory of psychology in design processes can prevent accidents .
Proponents of psychology in design processes claims that psychological thinking is very important in the design processes .
They stated that when engineers or designers design with human psychology in through , they could produce a design that can prevent accidents from taking place .
As Bernhard Wilpert pointed in his article on psychology and design processes (2007) , "a crucial problem of design is to match the designer's mental modal of the object or system to be designed with the mental model of the future user requirements" .
For example , in the case of the hydroelectric power plant accident , humans negligent the warning of the system .
If the system was design in a way that it automatically shuts down when there was a default in the system , the plant's operation would have been stopped and the accident would not have occurred .
Many studies from different accidents such as nuclear and chemical industry showed that between 20% and 50% of accidents are caused by design errors (B . Wilert , 2007) .
Therefore , the proponents think that psychology in design processes could be a solution for accident prevention .
However , this statement is in conclusive .
Accidents cannot be prevented .
Accidents can only be reduced .
Even when engineers and designers design with psychology , accidents tend to happens .
When systems or objects are developed using high technology , they are not purely safe .
People are the one who design safety into the systems .
Humans are not perfect in everything they do .
In the psychology and design processes article (B .Wlpert , 2007) the author has stated that engineers can make mistakes in their design as engineers are also humans .
Hence , it is not possible to prevent accidents .
But contentants pointed that accidents are unaccepted event that happens .
So , they are mainly due to human 'errors' .
If engineers can predict human's behavior , they will be able to design according to human's nature .
The Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (PHERP) is a technique used for works of Human Reliability Assessment (System Reliability Center , n .d) .
The purpose of THERP is to evaluate the probability of a human 'error' taking place throughout the completion of a job .
Predicting human actions during thee operation of object or system , designers and engineers can design corresponding to human actions .
For example , when a worker accidentally places his or her hand into a cutter , the worker will get hurt .
If the engineers and designers can predict that humans can be careless at work sometimes , they will design a cutter that can detect human's hand when placed inside and stop the operation immediately .
Hence engineers can produce better design with more safety if they predict human's behaviors .
Even though predicting human 'error' can help in design processes , but that cannot prevent accidents .
Engineers and designers cannot predict behavior s of every human .
During the prediction , engineers may predict human actions wrongly .
80% and more accidents are caused by human 'error' rather than fully machines or systems .
In the Sayano-Shushenskaya's hydroelectric power plant accident , the main factor that leads to the accident was human 'error' .
The system showed many warning signs about the failure in it .
The bolts that hold the turbines were 90% teared out .
Since the bolts were fatigued , the system was producing noise .
Although the system showed signs of damage , humans were negligent about the damage .
There had been three other major accidents excluding this accident since the construction of the plant .
The previous accidents in 1979 , 1985 and 1988 were caused by spring floods that overwhelmed the dam's capacity .
This shows that the design of the power plant was not stable for generating energy .
Therefore , during the psychological process of thinking , mistakes can occur which results in poor design and lead to accidents .
To close up the arguments , accidents are mistakes with bad consequences .
The Sayano-Shushenskaya's hydroelectric power plant accident would be avoided if the humans had not negligent the warning given by the system .
But psychology can only play a part in design processes to create a better design but not prevent accidents from occurring .
Humans can never work without making error .
With psychology , engineers and designers can design only to reduce human 'error' but cannot prevent human 'error' .
Therefore , accidents cannot be prevented but can be reduced by psychology in the design processes .
Some bad memories will never fade away , like the Challenger accident , which took place in January 28 , 1986 , killing all the 7 astronauts just 72 seconds after being launched into the sky (Challenger STS 51-L Accident , n .d .) .
The common explanation for this painful accident is that O-ring joint problem leads to the leakage of fuel and eventually results in the explosion of space shuttle .
(NASA-STS-51L , n .d) However , this technical failure is only the surface reason .
What causes the failure of the O-ring is due to the irresponsibility and ignorance of the person in charge .
Hence , by applying psychology to the design process , which means individuals involved in the design process can make commitments to their tasks and make decisions out of consideration , the chance of accident prevention might be largely enhanced .
To begin with , the leading person in the design process should consider the practicability of the whole system , and hence makes the pragmatic plan and approach .
In the case of Challenger accident , the management committee made an inaccessible schedules and 'modify the technical and procedural standard' for the engineers (Craig L . Howe) .
Without sufficient time given , how could those managers expect the high qualitative component parts of the space shuttle to be produced ?
Even though some of them would probably argue that they were not familiar with engineering process , they could not refuse to take the blame .
In this respect , the use of psychology during design process requires them to make a schedule based on practicability after consultations with engineers , which will help to guarantee each individual process of the system to operate well .

The second perspective to illustrate why psychology is an essential factor to avoid the occurrence of the accident is that engineers who produce numerous tiny component parts could minimize 'erroneous actions' by applying psychology in their design (Wilpert .B , 2006) .
For instance , because of the limited time , the engineers working for Challenger space shuttle failed to comply with the criteria of producing individual high qualitative parts of the space shuttle (R . P . Feynman , 1996) .
In order to finish their tasks promptly , engineers threw away their occupational ethic .
The basis of psychology is completing one's own task in high quality , yet this basic requirement is sometimes ignored by people , and consequently , extremely painful accident is triggered .
The contrary viewpoints tend to attribute the O-ring problem to a simply technical failure that the 'factual account' of the accident is "frozen , brittle O ring" which causes the leakage of fuel and induces the exploration of the space shuttle Challenger (D .Vaughan , 1996) .
However , it is just the surface cause of the accident .
The deep reason behind is the insufficient low-temperature testing of O-ring which conceals the potential risk from engineers .
It is not an excuse for them to quibble that they have no idea of the quality of O-ring because they have not collected sufficient data to prove that the O-ring cannot stand low temperature .
It is a problem of engineers' attitude that no one bothers to detect that 'apparent' problem .
Unfortunately , the launch date of the Challenger space shuttle was extremely cold and this error turned out to be fatal (McConnell , M , 1987) .
Apart from the engineering errors , psychology should also be taken into account with respect to safety issue .
The management committee of the Challenger space shuttle actually got a warning report about the high risk before the launch .
They were informed that the O-ring might fail to seal the fuel tank due to the low temperature .
However , in response to such a crucial warning report , they put it aside and left it to chance (The Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster , 2009) .
It was a totally irresponsible action .
Conceding that officials in NASA may have been used to high risk operation and there are certain times when the system needs to operate at high risk (Feynman , Richard Phillips ,1992) , the managers cannot straightaway ignore the problem just because the chance for the accident to take place is slim .
Their underestimation of the danger resulted in the Challenger accident directly .
If psychology could been used in their decision , if they could have thought more about their work which related to the safety of other people and the outcome of the entire program , if they really have had the sense of responsibility which results from the essence of their job , they would not rush their work and make irresponsible decision .
Thus psychology helps to evaluate the danger of the event correctly and avoid the accident to occur .
In sum , instead of technical shortcomings , the accounts of the Challenger disaster are largely due to the ignorance and irresponsibility of both the engineers and programme managers .
Conceding that all human beings may make mistake in the unfamiliar field , and certain constraints may affect people's actions and decisions , however , we cannot deny that the importance of psychology during the design process .
By applying psychology , we can avoid certain mindset and learn to be more responsible and considerate .
Therefore , psychology helps to prevent the engineering accident and design failure .

Owing to the public's concerns about the safe operation nuclear power , research and development , funding for nuclear power was rather minimal .
More recently , environmental concerns and rising energy demands are putting nuclear power back into the energy equation .
However , if nuclear power is to win the approval of the previously disapproving public , it will have to be more cost-effective , environmentally-friendly and almost void of security concerns .
Keeping this in mind the pioneer nations of nuclear power have come up with a few generation-IV reactor concepts (Butler , 2004) .
The earliest concept that is going to be introduced is the Sodium- Cooled fast reactor concept , which requires relatively new low pressure and temperature to operate and recycles its nuclear waste .
Examining the public's concerns with respect to the Sodium-Cooled fast reactor will give us a useful insight on the potential of nuclear power .
However , nuclear power would never be a major source of energy simply because its drawbacks far outweigh its advantages .
One of the most critical factors while considering the various power sources is cost .
The general public will only approve of a power source if it is cost-effective .
An obvious advantage of nuclear power is the massive amounts of energy it can generate .
For instance , a single nuclear plant can generate four times as much energy as a coal-powered plant in its lifetime (Max , 2009) .
Sodium-Cooled fast reactors are also able to recycle spent fuel rods .
Moreover , analysts have estimated Uranium to last us for at least another century (Leipoldt , 2007) .
Uranium is not so expensive to mine as its ores are found near the surface of the earth .
All these suggest that nuclear power is actually very energy-efficient and cost effective .

However , the capital needed to set up a nuclear plant is extremely high .
This can be attributed to a few factors .
Firstly , nuclear plants , according to the safety standards set by authorities , must have a 'cordon area' of at least 30km .
Setting aside such a vast amount of land just for one nuclear plant is clearly not feasible .
Secondly , machinery required in nuclear plants is extremely costly because it has to be constructed with high precision to prevent any form of nuclear leak .
Thirdly , substantial testing that needs to take place to prevent any accidents will also add to the escalating costs .
Governments under-insure nuclear plants to make it cost- effective so as to cater to the public .
Nuclear plants are indeed high-risk considering the huge capital outlay by the authorities .
Therefore , nuclear power , in terms of cost , is not exactly a viable option even though its very energy- efficient .
Another critical factor that needs to be considered is how environmentally- friendly the energy source is .
Although this factor does not involve the public , recent studies have shown that the public is increasingly aware of the environmental problems and are prepared to take measures to arrest the slide .
Nuclear power is usually lauded as the "environmentally-friendly" energy and rightly so too .
Nuclear energy does not emit toxic pollutants in the atmosphere nor does it emit combustion by-products like carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas that punctures our ozone-layer further , giving rise to global-warming .
Carbon dioxide is the reason for about half of the global warming experienced by Earth (Kallen , 2005) .
In comparison with burning fossil fuels , it has to be said that nuclear power is far more environmentally-friendly .
The final factor that we are considering is the safety of the public .
Firstly , it is almost impossible to build something that is perfectly safe .
The chance of a failure , although minute , is still present .
The consequences of any accident are vast .
If there is a leak , these radioactive substances can kill at high doses and cause cancer and birth defects at low doses .
Sodium-Cooled reactors recycle the nuclear waste so it is highly improbable that nuclear waste will end up in the wrong hands .
However , one can never be too sure .
The information on creating "dirty nuclear bombs" is readily available in the Internet and in several books too .
So there could be mass destruction if terrorists somehow get hold of uranium and decide to make nuclear bombs .
Finally , nuclear power might give rise to strained relation between nations .
For instance , if a country is utilizing nuclear power , neighbouring countries might view that country as a military threat .
Therefore , nuclear power , although very environmentally- friendly , invokes many security concerns amongst the public .
In conclusion , the public might be tempted to switch to nuclear energy because nuclear energy , like wind energy and light energy , is environmentally friendly and very energy-efficient .
However , nuclear power still raises many concerns with regards to cost and security .
Until these concerns are eradicated , other safer and cheaper sources of energy would be preferred ahead of nuclear power .

Nowadays , with the threat of green house effect and the increasing need for energy , people are urgently looking for new energy resources .
Nuclear power , as a powerful new energy , stands out with its high energy-generating potential and relatively low emission of green house gas , such as carbon dioxide .
However , considering the nuclear plant accidents happened in the past few decades , the public is very concerned about the security issues and high cost of nuclear plants .
Some people are even calling for a stop on the usage of nuclear power .
Arguments rise on whether we should continue researching on nuclear energy or not .
In my opinion , we should not stop the research and development on this powerful new energy resource .
Instead , we should believe that nuclear power has a bright future .
Some people may say that nuclear plants have very high risks .
They say that it is technologically impossible to build up a 100% secure nuclear plant .
Every nuclear plant must have a possibility to face operation failure; with the number of nuclear plants increases , the sum of the possibility increases as well .
If there is a nuclear leak or an exposure , the harmful radiation will kill a lot of people1 .
Their argument seems to be persuasive , but they forget the fact that every energy workspace has a chance to face failure .
According to Davis (2006) , the average death in coal industry in only one country , China , has reaches 8 ,000 per year , not to mention the death and injury rate all over the world2 .
Additionally , Cohen (2009) made a calculation to show that nuclear plant accidents were not serious and the probability of nuclear plant accidents was very low: only if there were 25 fuel melt-down per year , might nuclear power become as dangerous as coal burning , but the fuel melt-down rate was actually less than 0 .00005% .
Moreover , the Generation = 3 \* ROMAN III reactors which we are using now and the Generation = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors which are under research and test , use the design called ''defense in depth" .
Every reactor has several back-up systems .
If there was something wrong , the first back-up system would start to work to limit the harm .
If the first back-up system failed , another back-up system would take the place , etc .
Certainly , it is possible that all the back-up systems fail in the same accident , but the probability is extremely small3 .
Therefore , we should believe that modern science and technology can ensure the security of nuclear plants .
In addition , there are people worrying about the sustainability of nuclear power .
According to the theory , uranium is the necessary energy source , yet the quantity of the element uranium on the earth is very limited .
If we keep using the current technology , the supply of uranium may only last 30 to 60 years depending on the needs for energy1 .
However , this kind of calculation is not accurate .
It is because the heat efficiency in current nuclear plants is only 1% , which means 99% of the energy generated by nuclear plants is wasted4 , but Scientists have already found out ways to increase the heat efficiency .
In VHTR's prototype , the electricity generated is 50% more than the current nuclear plants5 .
Furthermore , a Chinese engineer , Wang Hongqing , has found out the technology to increase the heat efficiency from 1% to over 60%4 .
As a result , we can extend the life of nuclear power by at least several hundreds of years .
Another concern about nuclear power is that the radioactive waste is very hard to be dealt with .
The waste needs to be carefully kept away from people for several thousand years .
In addition , nuclear waste may become tools for terrorists , which is very dangerous .
However , one of the concepts of the Gen = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors , very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , can solve this problem .
In the design of VHTR system , the radioactive uranium and plutonium will run automatically into the recycle so that it can offer an enhanced waste minimization6 .
Therefore , there will be no need to worry about the nuclear waste reprocessing .
Furthermore , it is much easier for us to develop nuclear technology than explore other new energy resources .
People have already had a relatively mature technology on nuclear power .
We have known the theory and been aware of the process .
What should we do is to develop the technology other than spend much more time and money exploring a totally new field .
This turns out to be the truth .
Within a few years , people have come up with the concepts of the Gen = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors .
These concepts overcome many difficulties and make a lot of improvements which can make nuclear power "safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation-resistant"5 .
In addition , the Gen = 4 \* ROMAN IV reactors will achieve more than what we expect .
The new nuclear plants will not only generate huge amount of electricity , but also a considerable amount of hydrogen which is also a prosperous and useful green energy .
In conclusion , we should not be afraid of the failures or difficulties .
Instead , we need to try our best to overcome any difficulties and improve our technology .
We should have faith in ourselves and believe that nuclear power's new dawn is coming .
There are many engineering accidents happened in the past and now they are still not avoided .
Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion is one of the incidents occurred on 26 April 1986 .
This accident killed 30 people and the radioactive effect has caused 56 fatalities till the year of 2004 (WNA , 2009) .
The main cause of the most accidents is directed to operators' error .
It can be insufficient knowledge of operators , inadequate training of operators , poor design and poor communication among team members .
However , further investigations showed that these could be prevented at the initial stage which was at the design stage .
In the journal written by Wilpert (2007) , the use of psychology in the design process could help to prevent accidents from happening or at least minimize the damage from the accidents .
It is currently encouraged to all design process especially in engineering design to have psychology knowledge involved .
A design engineer is also a human , thus he/she may make mistakes at the design stage too .
This could be noticed from the design being corrected after an accident and even including the operation manual .
In Chernobyl nuclear plant , reactor unit 4 had a very high positive void coefficient which led to a rapid increase of power when there was steam generated (Chernobyl , n .d .) .
This was very dangerous when excess steam was produced; especially this system was not incorporated with good safety features .
After the incident occurred , the reactor was modified to have much lower positive void coefficient .
From this point , it showed that the reactor was an error design product .
Furthermore , the accident could have been prevented if designer had done it right at the beginning .
As Wilpert (2007) suggested , psychology , in fact , could help the design process to consider on how human mistakes could be prevented or at least reduced .
If the designer could have thought the fatal effects from the reactor explosion , he/she would have thought the possibility causes and conditions , thus the designer might not use such a high positive void coefficient and more appropriate safety features would be integrated .
Wilpert (2007) also mentioned that the most common problem encountered in everyday design product including engineering product is the different perspective between designer and user .
Designer usually thinks that user may know how to use the product by reading through the manual provided .
This is also experienced by design engineers .
They make assumption that operators would know how to handle the equipments when the process is offset , thus a potential safety features are not necessary .
On the other hand , operators assume that designers have set all the equipment in such a way that is easy and safe for operation .
In worse condition , alarms would be triggered and equipments would be shut down .
As a result , in most accidents , operators would be pointed as the main cause of the accident .
Insufficient knowledge and training of operators result in panic under offset condition and also violating the normal procedures .
It occurred in Chernobyl disaster where the operators shut down the cooling system and removed control rods in order to maintain the power level for carrying out the test .
When there was a surge of power , they tried to put back control rods , hoped that power level could be lowered .
In fact , it did not happen as expected; the power increased dramatically and explosion occurred .
When psychology is incorporated in design engineer's thoughts , this accident could be prevented .
Psychology could lead the design engineer to be aware of others either in physical or mental behaviour (Wagner , n .d .) .
Design engineer would try to see the situation from the perspective of operators .
As a result , easy-understood manual will be provided , more accurate safety systems would be installed and sufficient training and sharing session between design engineers and operators would be conducted to have common opinions instead of assumptions .
In fact , psychology had been used in the past for improving human behaviours by selecting , training and motivating the operators in industries .
However , this might have been avoided due to time constraints and financial limit which result in insufficient time for design engineers to analyse the design and looking for other cheaper materials for substitution .
As a result , one small mistake of a worker could lead to a huge damage to the plant and also to the surrounding environment especially for nuclear plant .
Therefore , nowadays there is an encouragement to have human scientists (psychologists) in the design team (Wilpert , 2007) .
Psychologist is not only a scientist seeking knowledge for others to use , but also a technologist who is actively involving in the planning and design man-operated system (Taylor , 1957) .
In other words , system design is an applied psychology because of its human reference; by converting design engineers to psychologists or at least having psychology knowledge may help in design process as they would take into account of human behavior .
A correct design at the beginning stage is very important to prevent accident .
Most of the accidents occurred because of human errors either done by operators or even designer at the design stage .
As design engineers and operators are human beings , psychology could have been integrated in the design process to analyse possible errors from the design and human behaviours .
Moreover , with psychology knowledge , a design engineer would be capable of predicting the situation under worse condition .
Hence , system would be incorporated with proper safety features to prevent accident .
With the introduction of the Generation IV reactors in 2001 , a fresh wave of debate on Nuclear Power was brought up .
The common topics like safety , security and cost and performance are once again discussed .
The goals of Generation IV reactors are set towards sustainability , economical viability , safety and reliability , resistance to proliferation risks and protection from external attacks (Cogeneration Technologies , 2002) .
With these goals , six new models are introduced (see Table 1) , of which Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) should be further developed comparative to the other .
The reasons being that VHTR addresses the worries of public against nuclear power , such as safety , pollution and cost and performance issues .
There is a need for our world to move towards nuclear energy due to three reasons .
Firstly , the tremendous increase in consumption of energy due to growing population and development of nations .
Secondly , the depletion of natural resources is at a much faster rate due fore mentioned reason .
Lastly , the increased concern for global warming in recent years .
With these three reasons , it is thus wise for us to move towards relying on nuclear power for energy and support it , especially with advance technology where Generation IV reactors are so well developed as shown below .
Currently there are only about 400 nuclear plants worldwide and one of the most important concerns that hinder the development of nuclear power is its safety problem .
Nuclear plant operates at extremely high temperatures and it relies heavily on coolants to reduce temperature .
Any malfunctioning of the cooling agent will have devastating consequences when the nuclear plant melts .
However , VHTR addresses this problem by using helium as its coolant , which can reach extremely low temperatures (Butler , 2004) .
As such , the temperature of the core is maintained at a low temperature to deter melting .
In addition , Helium itself is an inert gas , which will not react with the radioactive waste or substances in reactor .
This is much safer compared to Sodium-Cooled reactor , since Sodium is explosive in contact with air or water .
Therefore , VHTR is operating safer compared to other reactors .
However , one concern would be that Helium is a natural occurring element with limited quantity that would soon deplete pushing price higher (James , 1996) .
Hence the research and development of VHTR should also look into other alternatives so that the reactor can continue to function in the event of Helium's depletion .
VHTR is also an environmentally friendly plant as its main emissions are electricity and hydrogen , in fact , it does not produce any material waste as compared to other reactors .
Hence , it does not contribute to the worsening of Global Warming .
Hydrogen produced is recycled within the plant itself for further production and there is also a maximization of resources .
Therefore , VHTR makes a cleaner Nuclear Energy .
Although the VHTR is environmentally friendly , there is an unavoidable leakage of radioactive waste .
These effects are serious as it can cause extreme damage to the human body and environment .
Such wastes can affect the environment for as long as 100 decades .
For instance , the meltdown of the Three Mile reactor in USA has resulted in the land being inhabitable for more than 20 years (Butler , 2006) .
However , it is known that for VHTR , such waste will stay in the atmosphere for a few decades compared to the norm of about a millennium .
VHTR is thus a better reactor .
Apart from safety and environmental issues , Nuclear Energy should be encouraged due to its lower costs in the long run .
Although the initial startup cost of building a plant is high , the cost is spread over a larger consumption area .
For example , the world's largest nuclear plant can produce electricity to 16 million households , which is the equivalent of 16 ,000 largest wind turbines (Hans , 2006) .
Hence energy costs are reduced when spread over a larger consumption area , which is especially important in the light of rising oil prices .
A possible problem to lower energy costs could surface as the price for raw materials for Nuclear Energy increases .
Uranium , which is used to power Nuclear Plants , is a naturally occurring element .
Hence , it may deplete and that would push prices up .
At the moment , the price has increased by more than 3 times to US$168/kg (Sevior) .
The R&D group of VHTR must then look into this issue so that the benefits that Nuclear Plants bring do not end up being a liability .
In conclusion , I feel that the development of VHTR should not be hindered by the problems mentioned above .
Although there may be many valid concerns , VHTR is the best in safety and performance .
However we should not be complacent and continue to improve and foresee future problems that the VHTR may develop in the future , so that Nuclear Energy continues to be viable and safe .
Presently , they should look into the problem of cooling agents , as well as other alternatives for Uranium .
These reactors are likely to be relied on as a possible source of energy for at least the next two to three decades (James , 1996) .
Other than such technical problems we should also look into the possible human misuse in Nuclear Energy and take caution not to let any disaster happen .
Table 1(7)
For quite some time now , there has been concern among the pubic over the safe operation of nuclear reactors .
This has caused us to oppose new nuclear plant projects .
Our dependence on fossil fuels necessarily needs to reduce because of its depletion and possible exhaustion in the near future and also due to the harmful effects on the environment by using them .
This makes shifting to alternative sources of fuel inevitable .
Newer ideas and technological improvements are possible if the necessary funding is directed towards the research of nuclear power and technologies like them .
Since , nuclear power does not affect the environment as drastically as fossil fuels , if its waste is well managed , and provides much higher ration of power to the amount of fuel used , it is the most feasible fuel source available to us .
Of the various nuclear power plant technologies , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is the safest .
Implementing this reactor for power production is an achievable goal to set for a sooner transformation to nuclear power .
Since the VHTR uses helium as a coolant , it can go to temperatures of up to 10000C as compared the 3000C of the earlier reactors as the earlier reactors use high pressured water as their coolant .
Another fascinating fact is that the VHTR's waste goes back to its repository and that it can produce hydrogen from water due to its high working temperature .
The above mentioned facts distinguish the VHTR from the Generation III reactors and define reactors like the VHTR and the VHTR itself as a "model of the Generation IV reactors" (Clair , 2005) .
Even after these many safety features , as mentioned above , it is hard for lay men to get over the dreadful accidents that took place in the Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 .
Moreover , the possibility of being able to make nuclear warheads and other weaponry from the active plutonium created in the power plants coupled with the trouble of nuclear waste disposal has maintained the our dilemma .
This has setback the testing and case-based application of new nuclear technologies , though they actually can make a difference .
The first opposing factor is that , there have been accidents in many technologies that man has developed through time .
The Chernobyl and Three Mile Island incidents are no different from a normal technical error .
These errors are prone to happen in any technology with the level of complication as the nuclear technology .
But , it is to be noted that these errors are fatal and long lasting .
This has been taken into consideration always by scientists , but mistakes happen .
But in the Generation IV reactors safety is as important an issue as implementation of new technologies .
The VHTR , being "passively safe" (Hansen , 2008) , is self sustained in case of emergency by shutting itself down safely .
The present scientific advancements and engineering precision ensure the above mentioned safety feature of the VHTR .
There will be no more of nuclear spill , loss of human lives or even an injury for workers within the nuclear plant in case of in-plant emergency .
Waste Management .
(2007 , November) .
Retrieved October 29 , 2009 , from World Nuclear Organization Web site: http://www .world-nuclear .org/education/wast .htm
The second opposing factor is the problems that are anticipated if high grade plutonium is being produced .
In the conventional reprocessing method , uranium and plutonium are separated effectively .
This is costly and also gives manageable weapons grade plutonium as an outcome , which is not desired .
The new form of reprocessing adds more steps to the earlier process; "converting long-lived wastes to elements with shorter half-life periods" (Butler , 2004) .
This reduces storage time .
Along with the above , it also promises to "create plutonium spiked with heat-producing radioactive elements to make it too hot to handle" (Hansen , 2008) .
The third concern considered , is the nuclear waste disposal .
The above re-processing method actually converts the long lived isotopes to elements with lower half lives .
This is advantageous for waste management too .
These short lived elements need to be stored only for a few centuries compared to the three hundred or more centuries the earlier waste needed to be stored for  .
In VHTR however , since waste is sent back to the repository , there is absolutely for the waste recycling process .
The recycling is done only for the completely used uranium fuel  .
The above mentioned facts state that the newer technologies are much ahead of the older ones .
Accidents are sure to be a thing of the past .
There will not be the problem of terrorism due to stolen plutonium or induced accidents in nuclear power plants .
Moreover , there is a requirement of research in these technologies , as there is the risk of exhaustion and harmful effects due to the excessive use of fossil fuels .
Amongst the available technologies , the VHTR is the safest as mentioned above .
Thus , it is evident that by funding the research of VHTR and the technologies that VHTR needs , there can be a turnover in nuclear technologies .
This is the most feasible short term option open to the world .

Nuclear power plant technology started from 1950s .
Even though it developed very fast in the past decades , it is facing a big problem now that nuclear output is worldwide shrinking .
This is partially because of horror left by the disasters of 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , and of 1986 at Chernobyl , Ukraine (Butler , 2004) .
Now people are more concerned about the safety instead of the benefits of nuclear power .
Therefore they keep on object against nuclear technology .
In order to change the negative situation of nuclear power , in 2001 , the Generation IV International Forum( GIF) leaded a new starting of developing next generation nuclear energy systems which are " safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant" (Butler , 2004) .
There are six designs are believed to be the best prospects (see Table 1) .
Based on the goals for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is expected to be a better choice than other five reactors .
This essay will evaluate this new reactor focus on three aspects: safety , sustainability and economics .

First , VHTR has very good safety features .
But only from the table , Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) system seems to be the safest among the six reactors , because of its not very high temperature and low pressure .
Especially the primary system operates at essentially atmospheric pressure (Lineberry & Allen , 2004) .
There is another safety feature of SFR that a secondary sodium system is a buffer between the primary system's radioactive sodium and the power plant's energy conversion system .
It is true that these two safety features provide SFR operating safety , but it is still dangerous when core exposures or coolant does not work .
For VHTR , safety is definitely guaranteed because of its inherent safety characteristics which can cool itself down in the event of an emergency .
Since VHTR has refractory core , low power density , low excess reactivity uninsulated steel vessel , it is easy to remove passive decay heat from core through the natural processes of radiation , conduction and convection (McCreery & Condie , 2006) .
Therefore the VHTR's limit core temperatures are retained in the ceramic fuel particles without the necessity for operator Intervention .
Secondly , VHTR is environmental friendly and sustainable .
There is still some experts' stance on Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) System .
On one hand it can minimize the waste of fuels since it has a closed fuel cycle .
On the other hand , LFR has a long-life battery as the refueling interval usually is 15 to 20 years (Generation IV Nuclear Reactors , 2009) .
Nevertheless VHTR will be more sustainable than LFR as the Ultra-long life VHTR systems can be developed with minor actinides (MA) .
MA is a fuel component , which can help develop new fuel cycles and keep sustainability of a fuel source .
As a result , VHTR can keep on operation for long lifetime without intermediate refueling .
Furthermore the environmental impact of VHTR is positive , since both roust fuel and coolant (Helium) do not release significant radiation .
Last but not the least , VHTR is designed to be a highefficiency reactor , meaning that it can help to make great economic profit .
On the other hand , scientists support Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) because both its coolant and fuel can use same liquid salts to save materials .
And MSR operates in closed fuel cycle to avoid waste the fuel and coolant .
Unfortunately , MSR has a death-blow , the resulting corrosion of reactor components after long-term chemistry and handling of molten salt .
As mentioned that VHTR acts as high efficiency design , besides normal production of electricity it also supplies heat with core outlet temperature of 1000 Celsius (Forsberg , 2008) .
With the heat , it is efficient to process petrochemical industry or sea water desalination .
And the most important application is hydrogen production .
Since hydrogen is one of the clearest energy in the world and it is not easy to produce , the heat produced by VHTR can help to solve this big problem .
In addition , compared with conventional plants , VHTR also can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel (Butler , 2004) .
As a result , VHTR can provide a more economic energy to meet the demand of the world .
In general , it is valuable to research and develop VHTR to meet the goals of new generation in future , since it has significant advantages among the six Generation IV reactors .
First it has advanced safe design , which can automatically cool itself down when accident without additional operating system .
Secondly , VHTR has high sustainability and is also environmental friendly .
Last it provides a more efficient system , thus the economic benefits from it cannot be neglected .
Therefore , choosing VHTR to be a new energy supply is the best choice .
Two years ago on 1st August , 2007 , an accident that shocked the world happened .
The I-35W Mississippi River Bridge in the US state of Minnesota collapsed suddenly , "killing at least 7 people" .
There were at least 60 casualties and 50 vehicles thrown into the water .
(BBC News , 2007) .
The bridge was built in 1964 and officially opened to traffic in 1967 .
It consists of 8 lanes moving in two directions and is used by 140 ,000 cars a day (Minnesota Department of Transportation , 2007) .
The bridge "had been inspected annually since 1993" and "the last fracture critical inspection was in 2006" (Minnesota Department of Transportation , 2007) .
With regards to this incident , many might argue that the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
Psychology is defined as "the science of mind and behavior" (Psychology , n .d) .
Hence , supporters to the use of psychology might argue that the use of psychology during the design process means to improve the thought process and reinforce engineering ethics .
This might have reduced the chance of the accident happening .
However , to say that it would have prevented the whole accident , I would see it as too extreme .
Firstly , supporters to the use of psychology may argue that "a deficiency in engineering ethics is found to be one of the root causes of an engineering failure" (Department of Materials Science and Engineering , University of New York at Stony Brook , 2008) .
The use of psychology during the design process might be able to improve engineering ethnics , thus , reducing the chance of an engineering accident happening .
However , there are many other causes which might lead to an engineering accident .
Below are some statistical data on the causes of failure:
9) Others  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3% (Department of Materials Science and Engineering , University of New York at Stony Brook , 2008)
For the above data , we can classify them under two categories of factors - psychology or non-psychology .
Base on the definition of psychology mentioned in paragraph 1 , Factors 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 and 8 can be classified under psychology and it adds up to 40% .
Supporters to the use of psychology might argue that this is a high percentage; hence the use of psychology in the design process would have prevented the accident .
However , this is not true .
Non-psychology factors add up to 60% which is more than psychology factors .
Moreover , the use of psychology during the design process will not reduce these 40% to 0% .
Therefore , we can see that the use of psychology might reduce the chance of an accident caused by engineering failure but would not prevent it .
Secondly , supporters to use of psychology may argue that the use of psychology in the design process will improve the thought process of an engineer , thus improving the design and safety of the product which could prevent accidents from happening .
However , I would like to make use of an analogy .
To say that the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident would be as good as saying that if you studied hard and memorised everything , you would be able to prevent mistakes during the exam .
However , we all know that this cannot be true .
By studying more , it only reduces the chance of making mistakes during exam but definitely not prevent it .
Similarly , the use of psychology might reduce the chance of engineers making mistakes in their design .
However , it does not mean that they will not make mistakes as they are still factors like human error which cannot be eliminated through the use of psychology .
In the article Psychology and design processes , the author mentioned that all human beings make mistakes , including engineers .
"Design engineers may make mistakes , too , namely in their designs" (Wilpert , 2007) .
Therefore , whether or not there is the use of psychology during the design process , it is inevitable that engineers make mistakes .
Hence , it is inevitable to prevent accidents from happening .
Lastly , many times in life after an incident has happened , be it serious or minor , the two words that are most commonly heard would be 'if only' .
However , no one can guarantee that the incident would not have happened even if more precautions had been undertaken .
Instead of thinking whether accidents of the past could have been prevented , why not think of how to greatly reduce the chance of future accidents happening ?
The use of psychology might be one direction to go towards .
However , no matter how safe the end product of an engineering design may be , unforeseen circumstances will still occur .
Hence , I believe that the use of psychology during the design process would not have prevented the accident .
In conclusion , I do not deny the fact that the use of psychology to improve engineering ethics and refine the thought process involved in the design stage helps in reducing the occurrence of accidents .
However , there are still many factors that cannot be eliminated through the use of psychology .
Therefore , I believe that the use of psychology during the design process would not have prevented the collapse of the Mississippi River Bridge on 1st August 2007 .

The supercritical water reactor is one type of generation IV reactors .
Till now , all the six types of generation IV reactor are under the research of Generation IV International Forum (GIF) , which consists of thirteen countries all over the world (U .S . DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee , 2002) .
As one of the most practical generation IV reactors , the supercritical water reactor has many advantages over the generation III reactors such as the higher efficiency .
However , there are still a lot of concerns mainly about the safety issue , the complicated configuration and the waste production .
But in my opinion , the supercritical water reactor is actually simpler , safer and has less nuclear waste compared to the generation III reactor which we widely use nowadays .
Many people may think that the generation IV reactor is much more complicated and expensive to build .
Furthermore , all of them use the quite new concept which is not practical at all (Butler , 2004) .
Actually , for the supercritical water reactor , it is not correct .
The supercritical water reactor is based on the light water reactor we use nowadays and becomes simpler in the configuration because that it uses the supercritical water as the moderator and the coolant (Mori , 2005) .
The supercritical water is the light water under the great pressure above its critical point .
In this condition , the steam of the light water will have the same density and can be mixed with the light water .
In the lighter water reactor , the light water will boiling in the core vessel so that it produce a lot steam as bubbles in the light water , so that the light water reactor needs a lot of equipments to control these bubbles such as steam generators , steam separators and dryers (Idaho National Laboratory , 2007) .
In the supercritical water reactor , all these components can be eliminated so that the supercritical water reactor can be much simpler and easier to build .

Another concern about the safety issue is very common .
The supercritical water reactor is working at much higher temperature(500 C) and pressure than the generation III reactor(Butler , 2004) .
It is a dangerous operating temperature in the concept of today .
In fact , due to the higher temperature and pressure , the reactor can , however , be safer .
At first , the whole concept of the supercritical water reactor is based on the light water reactor which has already used for years .
The technique is already mature .
The supercritical water is also used in different areas for a long time , so that the supercritical water reactor can be a practical innovation and it is very safe .
Secondly , as I mentioned above , the steam has the same density and can be mixed with the liquid , so that the whole moderator have the nearly same density everywhere .
It will be much easier to control the pure liquid compared to the liquid mixed with the bubbles .
Actually , these voids in the liquid are chaotic and can be very dangerous because that the liquid and the steam have totally different properties .
Lastly , the special supercritical water property also makes other procedures can be easily controlled such as cooling part (Magnus , 2006) .
The supercritical water reactor can be safer compared to the light water reactor .
There are still a lot of people worrying about the nuclear waste of the supercritical water reactor (U .S . Envioromental Protection Angency , 2004) .
Some of the reactors need to depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste which will separate the plutonium which can be used to make nuclear weapons .
Nevertheless , the supercritical water reactor will not depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste , thus it will not separate the plutonium (Butler , 2004) .
Besides , the supercritical water reactor is can also be developed with a fast neutron spectrum due to the neutron will be only partly moderated in the supercritical water .
Being a fast neutron reactor will split the long lived actinides , destroying the most long lived nuclear waste through nuclear transmutation , which will greatly reduce the nuclear waste it produces and increase the efficiency of the reactor (GIF , 2007) .
From these two points , we can see that the supercritical water reactor does well in dealing with the nuclear waste .
Although the supercritical water reactor is still under the research , it has already shown a lot of advantages .
It successfully resolves the public doubts about the safety , configuration and the waste production and gives us a bright and promising future of the nuclear power .
I believe that the generation IV reactor will break the energy source composition and bring us to a new age of nuclear power .

We are on the brink of time whereby the global warming will affect the earth severely if we don't act appropriately .
The world population is 6 .8 billion to the current date and is increasing rapidly (US Census Bureau , 2009) .
In order to provide electricity to the increasing population , governments around the world have to build more power plants to maintain undisrupted power supply to the cities .
U .S . EIA , Energy Information Administration , estimated that up to 65% of energy sources for the power generators come from oil and coal (Hong , 1994) .
These conventional power generators contribute to the increasing trend of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere , important factor for global warming .
In order to stoop global warming , we must reduce carbon dioxide production .
One alternative way will be the Nuclear power .
Nuclear energy is produced from the fission of uranium elements in the nuclear reactors which produce massive heat .
This intense heat can be converted into energy source and distributed as electricity .
There are some public concerns regarding the safety and security of nuclear plants .
But accidents occurred in the past were mainly because of lack of skilled workers and security (Major , 2008) .
In the new Generation IV reactors , the possibilities of accidents will be minimized by allowing the reactors to run at high temperatures up to 1000 degree Celsius (Butler , 2004) .
Among the six technologies mentioned , very high-temperature reactors concept has most potential to be a break-through in nuclear technology and therefore its research should be further supported and funded .
Oppositions concern that melt-down of nuclear reactors will occur in the long run .
They also point out that the operating temperature of current generation generators are high .
For example , in the Chernobyl accident , the reactor melted down and exploded because of overheating inside the cores of reactor .
The radioactive materials from the reactor was spread out to the surrounding areas which caused radiation poisoning and The main advantage of Very-High-Temperature-Reactor , VHTR , is that the reactor can operate in the extreme temperature up to 1000 degree Celsius (Generation IV , 2006) .
This is achieved by using Helium as a coolant instead of water .
Helium can withstand high temperature and it is inert gas so it won't react with other materials (VHTR , 2008) .
Other new technologies can only operate up to 600-800 degree Celsius (Butler , 2004) .
This fact makes the VHTR more thermally efficient than other types of reactors .
As it can withstand high temperature , melt-downs will not occur so frequently .
Therefore , it would be beneficial to concentrate our research into this VHTR technology .
Nuclear plants can reprocess waste products from reactors to get back up to 95% of raw materials to reuse .
Proponents claim that nuclear reprocessing will lead to serious complications such as nuclear race and terrorism .
It is because reprocessing can produce plutonium which is use in nuclear war-heads .
United States prohibits reprocessing and also encourages countries not to reprocess the waste materials (Butler , 2004) .
Reactor technologies such as Gas-Cooled and Molten Salt Reactors involve reprocessing which is not suitable with current regulations about plutonium .
So , researching into these technologies will raise conflicts among countries .
In the VHTR technology , waste directly goes to repository which involves no recycling or reprocessing .
Therefore , it clears the concerns of public as well as governments around the world .
The transportation sector alone will cause the demand of oil and fuel up by 78% at the year of 2025 (Butler , 2004) .
Therefore , we cannot solely depend on our fossil fuels for this problem .
There are alternative source of fuel in the market nowadays .
The most popular one is Fuel cell which is made from hydrogen .
Some technologies like Supercritical and Sodium-water-cooled reactors are unable to produce hydrogen .
On the other hand , VHTR technology has both electricity and hydrogen output .
While electricity can be used to power up houses , hydrogen can be converted into fuel cells which can power up automobiles and vehicles .
Fuel cells have theoretical efficiency of 80% compared to diesel which is only about 40% (Crea , 2004) .
Therefore , we can be rest-assured that future nuclear reactors like VHTR can meet the industrial demands and thus its research should be funded .
Among the six technologies described in Butler's Article , Very-High-Temperature-Reactor Technology best fits the requirements and expectations of nuclear technology .
The thermal efficiency is the most important element of VHTR compare to other technologies .
Combined with the non-reprocessing nature of this reactor , VHTR will become a choice of technology for engineers and governments to focus their attention to develop .
In addition , hydrogen power output of VHTR is an additional incentive that VHTR is worth researching .
In conclusion , VHTR has very promising path to be the generator of the future and we should channel our efforts to further develop and research the technology to be able to use broadly .
By 2030 , the world demand for energy is predicted to rise by about 50 percent and by 2050 , it will be doubled .
This prediction indicates that we need to find alternative source of energy in order to continue our daily life .
Clearly , it seems that the nuclear power is a good alternative .
However when we talk about nuclear , people will usually associate it with radiation , wastes and missiles .
Also public opposition was given as one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries .
With the increasing demand for energy and prices for fossil fuel , the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) comes out with the new concepts of the Generation IV nuclear reactors .
These reactors have the potential to provide safe base-load electric power with negligible pollutants (Hansen , 2008) .
Out of the six generation IV reactor concepts , I consider that the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of the best concepts for further development of nuclear reactor .
Opponents of the public of nuclear energy are worried about the safety of nuclear power in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the Chernobyl accident in 1986 .
Another issue is the problem of managing those radioactive wastes that are generated during the operation of nuclear reactors .
However , the generation IV reactors are able to burn existing prolonged nuclear waste , produce only a little amount of waste that will last for decades only (Hansen , 2008) .
These wastes are stored into a special concrete storage cylinder to prevent the radiation from leaking to the environment .
Besides that , the nuclear reactor design strategy of generation IV reactors for preventing accidents and mitigating their potential effects is defense in depth (Cohen , n .d) .
This will mean that there will always be a backup system to limit the harm done if something fails .
If that backup system should also fail , there will always be another back-up system to replace it .
In VHTR , helium is used as the coolant instead of water .
Since Helium is an inert gas , it will not chemically react with any material .
Furthermore , exposing helium to radiation does not make it radioactive , unlike most other possible coolants like water .
Opponents mention that the cost of building a nuclear plant will be very expensive due to the high capital costs and licensing uncertainties associated with the construction (Goswami & Kreith , 2008) .
Other costs include fuel cycle cost as well as waste management costs which result in higher electricity cost .
These costs do not include in other power generation technologies such as coal power station .
Yet the costs for nuclear power generation have been dropping significantly over the last decade .
The decline in the cost of electricity by nuclear energy is the result of decline in the cost of nuclear plant fuel , operations and maintenance , improved technology .
With increased research and development along with adoption of nuclear power generation by more countries , the cost will be reduced even further .
Lastly , the final argument made by the public is that there are many alternative cheap , clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and tidal .
Also it is possible to switch to using coal or natural gases to produce energy once fossil fuels depleted .
Yet these clean energy sources have their limitations too .
For instance , solar energy is produced when the sun is shining .
During the night or bad weather , the expensive solar equipment will be useless .
Also the amount of electric energy produced from this technology is far less than current power plants .
It is not feasible to build many solar or tidal powers all around the lands and seas .
On the other hand , Nuclear energy does not have all these limitations .
Fuel sources for it are virtually unlimited and could last much longer than fossil fuels .
Nuclear energy is also regarded as one of the clean energy available today as it doesn't produce any pollutants that contribute to environmental problems .
It is possible for nuclear to be the mainstream energy production when combined with other renewable energy such as solar power .
Nuclear energy also offers higher electric power efficiencies than the current power production .
Moreover due to VHTR's high operating temperature of above 1000 C , it offers the potential for cogeneration of electricity and hydrogen , alongside process heat applications ("Very-High-Temperature Reactor" , n .d) .
Generation IV nuclear reactor concepts offer significant enhancements in sustainability , safety and reliability and economics over currently energy production technologies .
VHTR is the better one among the six nuclear reactor concepts as VHTR allows for the cogeneration of both electricity and hydrogen .
Nevertheless , the high operating temperature and pressure and corrosive operating conditions of the VHTR require materials that surpass the limitations of current nuclear reactors (Generation IV Nuclear Reactor Comparisons , 2008) .
Therefore , great deal of further research and development is needed in order for it to be commercially deployed by 2030 .
As quoted by Patrick Moore , Greenpeace co-founder , "It is a big mistake if we lump nuclear medicine in with nuclear weapons .
In retrospect , is that because we were so focused on the destructive aspect of nuclear war and technology , we used to think that all nuclear were evil ."
No nuclear plants have been ordered in United State as a result of public's misconception that nuclear powers are highly vulnerable until recently , it is necessary , that people become more aware of the magnitude of climate change as a result of global warming phenomenon .
By general consensus , booming demand of electricity , increasing prices for coal and fuel have driven the development of nuclear power in recent years .
The availability of Uranium and the dwindling fossil fuels have made nuclear power more feasible as people want to maintain natural resources .
To keep up with globalization , we should seriously consider the study of Generation IV concept reactors , which promise higher efficiency of output as an alternative source of energy .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) , an international association that carry out research and development required to establish the performance and feasibility of the next generation nuclear reactors , have identified six nuclear systems employing different type of reactors , coolant , waste cycle technologies .
However , each reactor has its pros and cons in term of security , cost and performance .
Opponent proposed that nuclear powers are highly vulnerable as nuclear reactors have the probability of becoming terrorist target .
The incidents of core melt-down at Three Mile Island in March 1979 and the explosion and fire at Chernobyl in April cast a melancholy over the nuclear industry and it raised public fear of catastrophe .
In order to sway nuclear-adverse public , the Generation IV concept's reactors need to yield less radioactive waste at terrorist-proof facilities .
In term of security , reactors that do not reprocess nuclear waste are favored as plutonium waste , a key ingredient for developing advanced nuclear weapon , will not be generated .
To abstain nuclear proliferation , the other four reactors were eliminated , left with only two designs - very high temperature reactor (VHTR) and supercritical-water reactor (SCWR) , which would able to operate without having to reprocess and recycle plutonium waste .
Besides , Generation IV reactors employ nuclear materials , which are less suitable , or less prone to diversion for use in nuclear weapon .
For example , by increasing the radiological intensity of materials , it is hard for people to handle it without severely expose to radioactive if highly specialized shielding equipment is not used .
On the other hand , in term of performance , very high temperature reactors operate at temperature around 900 C , allowing more efficient conversion of heat electricity .
Besides , VHTR can be used to separate hydrogen from water thermodynamically at the operating range of temperature 700-900 C . By using fuel cell , hydrogen gas can be converted to electricity , replacing the uses of fuel or gasoline .
Statistics show that VHTR are able to yield 50% more electricity from the equivalent amount of fuel compared to conventional plants .
However , to function at such high temperature , helium gas , instead of water must be used as its coolant .
Inert helium gas provides another level of redundancy to the safety of the reactor as it acts as a non-reactive cooling medium .
These factors have combined and made the VHTR number one choice , outbidding the SCWR .
In term of cost , Generation IV reactors are designed to be economically viable .
The generating cost should not be too high but competitive as compared with other energy source .
On the other hands , the capital investment cost should be sufficiently low for developing nuclear system .
Some critics that VHTR's building cost are relatively expensive as compared to SCWR .
This is because the design of the cycle for SCWR is pretty simplistic as it does not require the use of jet pumps , pressurizes or dryers .
One of the greatest aspects about SCWR is the implausible small size of reactor itself , as compared as other reactors of Generation IV .
Nevertheless , some countries such as the United State and France prefers the VHTR rather the SCWR .
In spite of the fact that cost of building for VHTR is relatively higher , two products are generated for the price of one .
Besides , the VHTR deployment is earlier than most of the Generation IV reactors , which is aimed to be on the year of 2020 .
The United State energy bill would provide a sum of USD 1 .1 billion to build a research prototype at Idaho lab .
In short , VHTR is the best choice among the six Generation IV reactors .
In term of security , it produces no waste , especially plutonium , as waste goes directly into repository .
In term of cost , VHTR able to generate electricity and hydrogen for the price of one , which is estimated to be roughly $1 billion .
In term of performance , VHTR generates electricity at efficiency as high as 50% .
VHTR is likely to be the most advanced concept in terms of practical experience as Japan already operating a similar high temperature reactor at Oarai .
Nonetheless , VHTR faces material constrain as the materials use to design reactor must be able to withstand continued high temperature , intense bombardment in nuclear proliferation and corrosive reagents .
Therefore , it is ideal that GIF should start siphoning funds to conduct intensive researches on nuclear power plants .
Nuclear energy has always been shrouded in controversy .
The debate on whether nuclear power should be utilised is due to the highly unpredictable materials used to generate energy and its multiple safety issues .
It is widely regarded as a cheap alternative source of electricity to alleviate the pressures of fossil fuels depletive nature .
Two new ideas for reactors that can exploit the power of the nucleus are the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR)and the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) .
MSRs are generation IV reactors that use molten salts such as fluoride salts to prevent system overheating .
The salts are combined with fissile materials such as uranium in a mixture .
The MSR operates at a low temperature and pressure , and have efficient waste recycling methods .
The VHTR , however , uses helium as a coolant and operates at a high temperature and pressure , without any form of waste recycling .
As such , I am in favour of the MSR over the VHTR .
Though the VHTR possesses commendable qualities , the MSR is a better investment as a generation IV reactor .
First and foremost , the cost of building a VHTR is much cheaper than that of a MSR , it being 30% cheaper to build as compared to the MSR .
Though the costs incurred are higher for the MSR , it compensates by raising its efficiency .
At 1000 C , the MSR projects a yield of 60% while the VHTR only garners just over 50% in yield .
Moreover , the MSR saves fuel by reusing it .
It utilises Actinide Management (Pickard & Forsberg , 2002) that allows for efficient recycling of fissile fuel .
The VHTR , instead , uses a once-through fuel cycle that does not reuse waste material .
Fuel has to be replaced constantly .
With both recycled fuel and higher efficiency , the MSR saves cost making it cost saving in the long term .
Though changing the molten salts will come across as time consuming and uneconomical , technological advances in that area can further reduce cost by making it fully automated .
Secondly , the VHTR has high efficiency in converting heat to electricity .
As a result , the VHTR need not use liquid to gas exchangers , unlike the MSR .
However , heat is hard to contain and is easily lost to the environment .
The VHTR is a thermal reactor while the MSR is a fast reactor .
In a thermal reactor , fast neutrons are slowed down to produce heat .
In a fast reactor , it optimises the high speeds of the neutrons instead .
Since it would be practical to use the already fast speeds of the neutrons , slowing them down will produce a lot of heat in the VHTR .
The MSR , though it includes the liquid to gas exchanger , this generates $4 .5 mil per percentage increase in efficiency .
(AIAA , n .d)
Thirdly , the VHTR employs stringent security measures to combat intruders .
The whole perimeter is under 24 hour surveillance by armed guards .
Furthermore , in an event of a nuclear leak , they have a system distributing iodine pills to residents within a 10 mile radius .
Though these are impressive , the round-the-clock security cannot protect against attacks like crashes and the time taken to deliver the pills may be far too long to prevent much damage .
The MSR however , employs measures such that little or no fissile materials are emitted .
The MSR is highly protected from nuclear proliferation due to its clever waste recycling of fission materials .
It converts Uranium-233 into unusable fissile material by adding Thorium .
This cycle bypasses the stage where Plutonium-239 is produced .
(Andre , 2009) Instead it produces a variety of Plutonium isotopes that cannot be used to make nuclear weapons .
Without weapons grade plutonium in the purest form , it reduces the effectiveness of explosions .
U-233 is more radioactive compared to the conventional U-235 used today .
As a result , the usage of U-233 has also posed concerns to both staff working in the MSR .
More funding is needed to safeguard the staff handling fissile material .
U-233 also damages electronics , and thus , not feasible in a bomb .
However this additional safety cost incurred would be well spent if the threat of nuclear proliferation can be obliterated .
In conclusion , though the VHTR has admirable qualities , the MSR seems to be better in terms of efficiency and security of nuclear material .
In the long term , the MSR saves money by recycling its waste and is more efficient as compared to the VHTR .
Technological advances can make the MSR automated in certain sectors and prevent health issues to people working in the vicinity .
Using nuclear power is the harnessing of energy released from the nuclear fission of uranium atom .
This energy released is used to turn the turbines in the nuclear reactors and generate electricity from them .
There are new generations IV reactors which are proposed to provide better output and safer mechanism in operating them .
With this features taken into consideration , the thought of building the new generation IV reactors is getting more real .
However , the possibility of a core meltdown cannot be denied judging from the accidents like Three Miles Island and Chernobyl(Butler ,2004) .
Therefore , the concept of generation IV reactors should not receive further research and development funding due to three factors , security , cost and performance .
Scientists and engineers have created safety mechanisms which cause the reactors to cool themselves in the case of terrorist invasion(Butler ,2004) .This will mean that the efforts terrorists try to cause a deliberate accident will be futile .
Moreover , protective double fences are built around the perimeter of the nuclear reactors to prevent the terrorists from entering the premise .
Heightened security measures have been taken to ensure that the defence is not breached as well .
However , with the introduction of dual use technology , the supercritical-water-cooled reactors can be used as a possibility of military use of civilian nuclear power technology to make nuclear bombs .
Dual use technology refers to the making of nuclear bombs and the harnessing of energy from nuclear power .
After an intentional meltdown caused by the terrorists , the nuclear core will explode and radiation will be spread throughout the country .
As a result , people around the vicinity will suffer from cancer caused by the radiation( BMJ ,2005 ) .
In addition , nuclear waste can be sabotaged and used as radiological weapon if left unprotected .
Examples of this case include an incident in Russia in 1999 , where workers tried to sell five grams of radioactive material on the market .
Another incident was in 1993 where Russian workers were caught red-handed trying to sell five kilograms of enriched uranium(Information on Nuclear Smuggling Incidents ,n .d) .
When the concept of the super-critical-water-cooled reactors is introduced , it will be much cheaper to build compared to the other conventional ones .
It is cheaper because of the reactor's efficiency and simpler design which just uses water as a coolant and it is readily available(Butler ,2004) .
Moreover , the introduction of this concept will produce electricity that is as cheap as those produced by coal and gas .
However , the cost of building nuclear reactors has to be evaluated first before even starting to build them .
(Foulke and Burnett ,2005) .
It is expensive to build a new nuclear reactor , taking into consideration the area of land needed , the cost of buying the nuclear fuel for energy processing , the cost of the coolant and the cost of the construction materials .
In the U .S , sixty-three billion dollars is needed to build a new reactor and the maintenance and the operating costs are not included in it(O'Reilly ,2007) .
The money invested can be used to improve healthcare or even the harnessing of other forms of energy like solar energy to produce electricity .
The building of nuclear reactors is not necessary for smaller countries in Asia like Singapore .
This is because nuclear reactors have a safety zone buffer of thirty kilometres and Singapore has a radius less than that .
Therefore , the cost needed to build the nuclear reactors can be used for other uses .
The supercritical-water-cooled reactors run at temperatures which are higher than the normal nuclear reactors which means that more efficient conversion of heat to electricity(Butler ,2004) .
However , the performance of the nuclear reactor is dependent on the temperature of the reactor core .
This means that if the temperature of the day is higher than usual , the performance of the nuclear reactor will drop .
This is because the temperature of the reactor core is affected by external factors such as weather .
The performance also depends on how much electricity is output compared to the energy being needed to run the whole system .
For the supercritical-water-cooled reactors , very high pressure is needed to prevent the water coolant from boiling at temperatures up to five hundred degree Celsius(Butler ,2004) .
The stealing of nuclear waste raises a possibility of selling them on the market , causing a breakthrough in technology and more nuclear bombs to be made .
The cost of building a nuclear reactor is very expensive compared to the harnessing of other forms of energy .
The cost of the building does not include the cost of fuel , building materials and the cost of land needed to build the reactors .
With the increased in outside temperature , the performance of the nuclear reactors will drop as it is dependent on the temperature of the nuclear cores .
In conclusion , the supercritical-water-cooled reactors should not receive further research and development funding for it , the rise of terrorism and the making of nuclear bombs from nuclear waste make nuclear reactors a controversial issue .
Cries of terror and bloodcurdling screams filled the night air as the familiar dome shaped structure in the distance began to glow amber red .
In a flash , it was all over , all there was left was rubble .
All signs of life were obliterated and everything razed to ground zero .
This may just be a typical scenario in the event of a nuclear explosion .
The Chernobyl accident that happened in 1986 had caused people to resent the development of nuclear power .
Many antinuclear groups such as the Greenpeace organizations have sprung up overnight to rally against the development of nuclear power for the fear of the recurrence of such nuclear catastrophe .
To date , many countries spearheaded by the GIF (Generation 4 international forum) have already launched their plans to the construction of some generation 4 nuclear reactors on their native soil , with promises of a more efficient and cleaner reactor concept .
However , the large capital needed to even construct a single nuclear plant would mean that we should choose the best design among the six .
Needless to say , there are many factors that should be taken into consideration which would include safety , cost and performance .
A good nuclear reactor concept would be one which strikes a balance between cost and performance without compromising the safety aspects .
Firstly , what distinguishes the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) as compared to the other designs would be that it does not provides only energy , which can be converted to electricity , but hydrogen as a byproduct as well .
The hydrogen fuel can be useful in powerful cars in the near future when the natural fuel runs dry as oil depletion is rapidly increasing at an alarming rate of 5 percent per year(S Korpela , 2006) .
The designs of such vehicles are already underway by major car manufacturers such as Honda and are in the testing phases .
Critics may consider the use of hydrogen irrelevant to future society since there are already electric cars in place .
However , it is an undeniable fact that most people do still depend largely on fuel to run , imagine planes powered by electricity , though it may be possible in the near future , it may not generate the power equivalence of hydrogen fuel given the same storage space .
Moreover , electric cars require long periods of time to recharge compared to hydrogen .
Therefore , this reactor has multiple benefits apart from mere electricity output and may be a better choice to contemplate .
The next fact that VHTR outshines the other reactors in is safety .
Safety is highly regarded as one of the most important reasons in the decision of the final nuclear reactor concept .
In all aspects of nuclear technology , safety should be monitored regularly and stringent safety standards adhered to by all the generation IV nuclear plants .
However , the VHTR is passively safe , meaning there is no need for human intervention to ensure that the reactor shuts down properly in the event of emergencies .
The entire safety procedure is fully automated and hence will put the VHTR a notch above the rest of the nuclear reactor concepts .
Playing the devil's advocate , the VHTR operates at a scorching temperature of a thousand degrees centigrade which would be a major worry for the consequence would be unimaginable lest an accident occur .
Causes of accident range from human error to external sabotage , hence , being hard to control , it is impossible to tell when an accident would occur as it need not be caused by external proliferation but instead by the operators themselves .
Therefore , with the passive fail safe devices in place , operators need no longer worry about any protocol when the panic button is pressed but instead the system will take care of itself .
Though true to a large extent , many of the generation IV reactor concepts are eradicating the sources of error instead of trying to minimize the extent of the damage done should a tragedy befall .
Furthermore , the contingency plan for the VHTR is completely mechanical and the chances of a failure due to human arbitration drop to a minimal .
This demonstrates the superiority of the VHTR as compared to the other generation IV concepts .
In conclusion , the VHTR would be clearly a preferred choice as compared to the other reactors .
As all the reactors require capacious sums of funds to construct any of the generation VI nuclear plants we examine the overall performance and the safety aspects of the VHTR as compared to the other concepts .
The VHTR is a better choice due to its capability to generate hydrogen gas which can be used as fuel and due to its excellent fail-safe concept which may prevent an adversity should it arise .
More resources should be allocated to further research and develop Generation Four (GIV) nuclear power reactor as it can provide clean and safe energy at reasonable price .
Although nuclear power as a source of energy has its disadvantages , it must be noted that no single source of power supply is perfect .
Given the advancement in current and future technology , it makes sense to invest in GIV reactor in providing for our growing energy demand .
We should support research and development of GIV reactor as it provides safe and clean energy and its cost will be reduced with further advancement in technology .
Very few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades as the general public is extremely concern about its safe operation , especially after the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl which sent fear and created negative opinions on nuclear power among the public .
Despite the two major accidents , nuclear power is actually very safe .
Although 56 deaths had resulted from the Chernobyl accident , it is pale in comparison to the 5000 deaths annually due to coal mining activities (Moore , 2006) .
In fact , the Three Mile Island incident was a success story where radiation was contained safely within the containment vessel .
Furthermore , almost all nuclear related accidents were linked to human error which can be eliminated with the use of automation .
Besides eliminating human errors in operating a nuclear plant , the automatic system will mean that no operators will be endangered as all processes , including emergency procedures , will be done automatically .
In principle , the GIV reactors are "meltdown proof" with its multiple automatic backup systems .
And even in the case of an accident , it will be cooled down automatically (Butler , 2004) .
The Chernobyl was an accident waiting to happen , the early model of the Soviet reactor which had no containment vessels were no longer operating .
The safety performance of nuclear plant has improved through the years .
From about 2 safety-significant events reported per plant per year to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1990 , the number has improved to less than one tenth of that by 2000 (Lake , 2009) .
The automatic GIV reactor will definitely boost the safety standard of nuclear plant further .
Another concern from the public on nuclear power will be its cost .
Given a price tag of more than US$ 1billion dollars in building a nuclear plant (Benjamin , 2008) , some will argue that it is more economic to use fossil fuel or other forms of energy .
It is true that building a nuclear plant is expensive but with more research and development in it , the cost will be lowered in the near future with better design .
Although there are other promising renewable energy sources available , they are not fully reliable .
Energy such as wind and solar are unpredictable , they cannot fully replace big base-load plants such as coal and other fossil fuel .
While fossil fuel is expensive and suffers from price volatility , cost of nuclear power is relatively stable and low at around 2 cents (US$) per kilowatt-hour , comparable to those at gas-fired plants , as nuclear plants buy their uranium fuel at an agreed price three years in advance (Whitman , 2007) .
In addition , better technology will lower the unit cost of generating nuclear power .
For example , the US has not built any new nuclear plants for the last two decades , yet the amount of electricity produced from nuclear has increased by about 8% annually as the industry becoming more efficient (Lake) .
Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) , one of the concepts of GIV reactor , will be operating at around 1000 C instead of the 330 C in current model of reactors .
With higher operating temperature , efficiency of the plant will be increased .
Comparing to the conventional nuclear plant today , VHTR is expected to produce 50% more electricity (Butler) .
Besides safe and economic , nuclear power is also environmental friendly as it does not produce any greenhouse gases such as Carbon Dioxide in the case of fossil fuel burning plants .
The spent fuel rod used in nuclear power plant can be reprocessed and reused , this reduces the amount of nuclear waste that need to be stored permanently .
In summary , nuclear power is reliable , green and affordable .
Previous accident such as the Chernobyl is highly unlikely to reoccur given the current high standard of safety .
With the forecast that we will need 40% more electricity by 2030 (Whitman) , accepting the practical advantages of nuclear power is both environmentally and economically sensible .
Hence , we should support further research and development of GIV reactors .
Electricity is the most important source of energy in modern times .
In order to generate enough electricity for all the human beings , numerous tons of coal and barrels of oil are burnt every day .
However , according to energy statistics from the World Coal Institute , more than 66% of the electricity is generated from fossil fuels , namely coal , gas and oil .
An urgent problem confronting us nowadays is that most of the fossil fuels that are widely used will be exhausted in decades or few centuries .
Known economically workable oil deposits and coal deposits will be exhausted in 2050 and in 2158 respectively .
Besides , people have suffered a lot from global warming , acid rain and air pollution , which are all largely related to the consumption of fossil fuels in the electricity generation industry .
What was worse , electricity demand is increasing dramatically due to speeded economic development worldwide .
It is estimated that electricity demand will have doubled by 2030 .
Under such harsh circumstances , many energy experts strongly advise that we should approach other new energy sources , such as bio-energy , solar energy and wind energy .
Nuclear power is also a promising alternative that we should not overlook .
Till now nuclear scientists and engineers have already put forward the new six generation IV nuclear reactor concepts .
Molten salt reactor is one of them and it adopts a molten salt mixture as a coolant in its reactor core .
Here is an evaluation of the MSRs in terms of performance , safety , waste and cost , compared to traditional nuclear reactors .
In conclusion , it is quite reasonable for us to consider doing more research on and commercialise the molten salt reactor concept , as well as other types of generation IV reactors .
In retrospect to our history , when some new techniques were developed , they all had the priority .
It was and also is consensus that new technology means our future development .
As a cutting-edge technology , nuclear power should get more support and be on the way to prosperity .
The fossil fuels on the Earth are towards exhaustion soon , we have to take precautions before it is too late .
* Performance
Molten salt reactors adopt molten salt mixture as a primary coolant , instead of traditional molten sodium coolant .
This modification allows the reactor to run at higher temperatures , which means higher thermodynamic efficiency .
And there is no high pressure steam in the core either , thus the mechanical stress is reduced .
In many designs of MSRs , the nuclear fuel is dissolved in the molten salt itself .
As a result , the preparation of the ingredients , uranium or thorium , are simplified and reactor structure can be quite easy to handle .
* Safety
Unlike solid-fuel fast reactors , fast-spectrum MSRs have large negative temperature and void coefficients because as the temperature rises or voids are formed , the fuel is expelled from the reactor core .
This is a unique advantage of MSRs compared to traditional solid-fuel reactors (Charles W . Forsberg , 2007) .
[2] There is no high pressure steam in the core and the molten salt is of low pressure .
We won't worry about fire hazard or explosion hazard .
Thus the molten salt reactors are considered inherently safe because they are chemically stable .
They do not react rapidly with moisture or air because the fuel salt does not burn in air or water .
However , in traditional nuclear reactors or solid-fuel reactors , there is always boiling water or molten metal as coolant involved , which dramatically reduces their safety level .
Besides , since the nuclear fuel is often dissolved in the molten salt , in case an accident happened , most of radioactive materials would not be dispersed into the atmosphere and spread to the environment nearby .
And there is also a passively cooled storage which can secure the reactor by dumping the fuel to the cooled tanks if there is a leak .
* Waste
As is mentioned above , the molten salt reactors are operated at high temperatures and low pressure , thus utilization of the fuel is significant , which in turn means that there will be less waste produced during the process .
According to the modern design of a molten salt reactor , the fuel chosen is often thorium , which means the nuclear process in a molten salt reactor involves a thorium cycle .
The thorium fuel cycle can potentially burn all the actinides that generate most of the radioactive waste after use , compared to the traditional uranium-238 and plutonium cycle .
* Cost
Thorium is three times more abundant in nature compared to uranium and occurs mainly as 'fertile' .
[3] It is widely used as the fuel in MSRs , so this can commercially reduce the cost in terms of fuel source .
Thanks to its different operation that involves molten salt , a MSR eliminates the fuel enrichment and fuel fabrication , both of which are major expenses for traditional reactors .
Molten salt reactors can be built in small sizes , yet also operates very well .
The cost is reduced and business risks are not so high as those of the traditional reactors .
They are much easier to become commercially available .
On April 12 , 1981 , the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight , Columbia - the first space shuttle in the world successfully launched .
Unfortunately , after flying a total of 27 times , Space Shuttle Columbia died at a very young age during re-entry on February 1st , 2003 .
According to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB)'s final report , the direct cause of the accident is a breach in the heat shielding panels on the shuttle's left wing , which was caused by a suitcase-size piece of insulating foam's hitting with around 240m/s relative speed 81 .7 seconds after launch (Columbia Accident Investigation Board , 2003) .
The breach allowed the heated gases entered the initial structure and finally resulted in the disintegration .
Space Shuttle Columbia disaster is one of the most serious engineering accidents throughout the history .
It alerted and re-emphasized us how important the safety design is .
Meanwhile , safety in work systems is always a critical point of applied psychology and industrial efficiency (Munsterberg , 1913) .
Based on Collins COBUILD Advanced learner's English Dictionary , psychology is the scientific study of human mind and the reasons for people's behaviors (2006) .
Human beings' actions are involved in every major accident (Wilpert , 2006) .
Accordingly , there exists a controversy that whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident .
I believe the answer should be affirmative .
In the article "Psychology and design process" , Mr . Wilpert acknowledged that the social perception of psychology and the social science was the main reason why people cannot accept psychology as a useful method to improve the safety of systems in designing process (2006) .
Same as in the Columbia issue , a lot of people just focused on the physical cause of the accident and arbitrarily claimed that it was only the engineering errors that result in the final disaster .
It seems that the people above believe they can ensure the safety by just solving the existent problems .
However , I have to say that these people are so short-sighted that they did not find the fundamental solutions .
It is true that every time we can fix the known errors after the accident .
Nevertheless , it is just a kind of useless latter-wit .
On the contrary , with the help of psychology , we can actually analyze people's minds and behaviors in order to find and deal with any potential problems in time .
In the following paragraph , I will focus on two aspects to explain my viewpoints , viz .
Design of the Space Shuttle and problem solving decision .
Insulating foam is used for covering the External Tank in order to keep a relatively high temperature .
However , the foam is not that firm; the mechanisms can cause them to shed .
Moreover , it is ironic that this kind of imperfection was well known by NASA and caused shuttle damage on every prior flight .
It is true that everything in the world cannot be perfect .
Nonetheless , NASA management did not predict the serious consequence and wrongly thought it was an acceptable risk .
Even today , six years after the Columbia accident , NASA still do not solve the falling foam problem (Young , 2006) , and the officials still say there is no need for a heightened concern (Hays , 2009) .
If some psychologists can communicate with the management officials and teach them to think in a more critical way , the results would not be catastrophic .
Sometimes it is impossible to prevent problem occurring , but we can still solve the problem .
Once again , NASA disappointed us .
After the launch , engineers asked NASA management to visualize the damage many times , but NASA never responded and did not give any resolution since they did not believe the damage would be so severe .
This kind of psychological problem as being irresponsible is really unforgivable .
Even one board member Feynman questioned why the management was so confident in the machinery (1986) .
With the help of psychology , we can thoroughly improve the management system effects by solving official's psychological problems .
After all , to be more precise and realistic is the basic need to make problem solving decisions .
Tragedy had already happened , and we cannot change past .
However , we must learn something to prevent such things occurring again .
Psychology has the function to guide people to understand technological imperfections and give effective problem solving decision .
At least in the Columbia issue , I am very sure the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .
As the mankind has entered the 21 century , the need for fuel has become increasingly pressing , which has exceeded the amount of fuel required in the past century by most 50 percent .
To solve the complex function of the world's need for more fuel , the solution lies in , as suggested by scientists and engineers worldwide , the generation IV nuclear reactors , which are capable of generating the power needed at a far more efficient rate compared to the contemporary power plants .
There are altogether six designs for the generation IV reactors while this essay will focus on one of them named very-high-temperature reactor or VHTR in short and expound on the reasons why it is worth all the researches and money put into it .
Generation IV reactors are designed to achieve certain goals , some of which involve generating clean and efficient energy , replacing fossil fuel and increasing resource utilization .
The VHTR is specially designed to achieve these goals because it can withstand core temperature as high as 1000 degrees , even the highest among all the generation IV reactors .
Having established some common understanding of the VHTR , there are basically three reasons why the VHTR should receive continuous funding and research .
First and the most concerned reason of all is that the VHTR guarantees a high degree of safety .
Being graphite-moderated and helium-cooled , it doesn't melt easily due to the extremely high melting point of graphite nor does it allow any corrosion of the chamber as helium is a very inert gas which is resistant to reactions that lead to corrosive substances .
This property should well fend off the critics using the meltdown accidents that happened at Three Mile Island and Ukraine , as the possibility of such accidents happening to a reactor able to function properly at 1000 degrees is insignificant .
Secondly , the VHTR produces energy in a very efficient manner .
The VHTR allows for more than 50% of more electricity to be produced from the same amount of fuel intake compared to the conventional reactors .
It burns up to 65% of uranium compared to only 5% for conventional reactors .
As the non-renewable resources are running out , the VHTR provides an excellent alternative solution to energy generation .
Thirdly , the VHTR produces a by-product , hydrogen gas , which is considered as another environmental-friendly source of energy .
At high temperature (700-900) , H2 is split from water and can be further utilized as fuel for transportation and factories .
This reduces burning of fossil fuels , like oil , which generates toxic gases .
This property , which can never be reached by the current reactors , serves to preserve the environment by replacing the contaminating fossil fuels using hydrogen gas .
Despite the fact that the VHTR brings tons of benefits to the mankind , there are certain negative facts which impede the officials from making up their minds on the funding .
The cost issue is certainly the most depressing thing among all .
For each nuclear reactor , an astounding amount of one billion has to be pumped into the construction .
As predicted , a generation IV reactor design is not to be realized before 2030 .
With some degree of uncertainty over the possibilities of putting a VHTR into operation , such a huge bill is difficult to be issued anytime soon .
Moreover , alternative solutions of fuel are not necessarily constrained by generation IV reactors as sources like solar power which require much less funding than the reactors are being intensely researched upon .
Hence the realization of VHTR is not as cost competitive as those alternatives .
Another problem is that the researches into the materials required by the containers and pipes are not going to produce useful results in the near future .
Due to the fact that the VHTR should withstand extremely high temperatures , the materials for the chamber must be ultra hard and corrosion resistant , many times better than those that we have already discovered .
These two problems , together with a few others , may disrupt further researches into and funding for the VHTR .
However , scientists and engineers worldwide have come together and discussed on the solutions to the problems .
As for reducing the cost of construction , the government can impose a carbon tax on the citizens and therefore use the tax revenue to fund the researches .
Moreover the cost of over-night construction can be cut off , which will save up a great deal of money .
There are more cost cutting plans to be made .
As for the materials , scientists have already found Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) alloys and fibre reinforced ceramic , which are very hard and corrosion resistant materials .
With this remarkable breakthrough , there will sure be more new materials to be discovered .
In conclusion , for the long term consideration , the VHTR is worth the researches into and money spent on it as it not only generates energy highly efficiently but produces a by-product which is also a source of clean energy .
The fact that the potential problems will be well dealt with should further strengthen people's belief in the VHTR .

From statistics , 20% to 50% of incidents , including failures , accidents and near-accidents , were caused by poor designs (Wilpert , 2007 , p . 296) and these figures were actually underestimated for two reasons .
The first being that single design errors tend not to cause mishaps because of the defense- in-depth designs in many installations of complex and high-hazard nature .
The second reason is simply because some design errors were picked up and corrected before any mishaps could happen .
However , in both cases , it was highly probable that there were occurrences of some form of failure due to poor design .
By incorporating psychology into engineering design processes , failures and incidents can be prevented , if not , minimized .
This essay will argue how the incorporation of psychology into design processes could have prevented the major engineering accident , in the case of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant mishap on March 28 , 1979 , which was a "snowball effect" , caused by a minor and simple fault .
First of all , opponents of this psychological approach towards engineering design insist that the faulty valve was the key factor and main cause of the incident , and that psychology could not have prevented it .
However , operators could have picked up this fault if the design of the instrument gave clear and proper signals .
In this case , the instruments that were used did not (U .S .NRC , 2009) .
Consequently , it resulted in a "Design Induced Human Error"(Nelson & Associates) , and this led to an aggravation of the situation .
It can be seen that if psychology was incorporated into the design of the instruments , the engineers of the instruments could have anticipated such a problem and included a device to alert the operators in a case when the valve and its related parts fail .
Secondly , opponents may also argue that this accident was caused by human error , because the operators failed to trace back the fault to the valve , leading to an aggravation to the point when emergency signals were shown .
In this event , operators picked up signals that caused confusion (U .S .NRC , 2009) .
Operators then made the best judgments and took the best actions based on whatever information they could obtain .
These judgments and actions were correct with respect to the information that was shown on the instruments .
Therefore , this is yet another "Design Induced Human Error" (Nelson & Associates) .
Once again , if psychology , in the form of cognitive ergonomics , had been implemented in the design process of the instruments to improve the human-machine interface , errors and misjudgments could have been reduced (Budnick & Michael , 2001) , and events like this would not have happened .
The final two arguments brought forth by the opponents may be the poor quality of machinery parts that led to the malfunction of the valve , and the inadequacies in the training of operators .
These arguments pointed out by the opponents are in actual fact very related to psychology and are factors part of Organizational Ergonomics (International Ergonomics Association , 2009) .
By looking at the system as a whole , that is , to include the managerial departments , we can see that if psychology was employed in the design and planning processes of how the plant is run , proper schedules for checks on machineries and also re-training can be planned .
By predicting such problems , measures can be taken before an accident can happen .
It is evident that psychology is able to reduce and also prevent errors by applying to both the micro and macro aspects of design processes of a system .
As we can see from the case of Three Mile Island , by anticipating problems that operators would face , the instruments could have been more accurate and reliable , which will then allow operators to remedy the fault straightaway .
In addition , by employing psychological approaches and methods , planners will be able to foresee problems that may arise .
The planners can then come up with appropriate schedules not only for regular checks on machineries , but also for retraining and refresher courses .
In conclusion , it is not uncommon for engineers and planners to commit mistakes and neglect what they think are not important .
Thus , by employing psychology , whether it is hiring a psychologist or just the employment of psychological approaches , problems that used to be unpredictable can be foreseen .
Improvements and enhancements can then be implemented pertaining to these problems and , as a result , lower the chances of accidents happening .
The nuclear reactor meltdown in Chernobyl in the year 1986 has became a dark age in the implementation of nuclear power .
Since then , nuclear power was often thought to be dangerous and therefore undermining the benefits that it can bring about .
In his article , Butler (2004) states six generation four reactor concepts including the sodium cooled fast reactor , which is much safer compared to older generations of nuclear reactors .
Therefore , technology can reduce the risks of nuclear power and therefore ensuring the safety of it .
Thus , the implementation of nuclear energy to generate electricity should be encouraged .
Firstly , the reactor meltdown accident in Chernobyl , 1986 has became a reason to prove that nuclear power is dangerous and should not be encouraged .
However , the accident occurred in the year 1986 and there has been no similar major accidents since then .
Thus , it can be observed that technological advancements can increase the safety of nuclear power .
Donald (2004) indicates that the accident in Chernobyl was allowed to happen because the reactor was not placed in a containment building , therefore allowing the nuclear radiation to be released into the atmosphere , causing huge losses in human lives .
Donald (2004) also states that the Chernobyl accident would not happen in other nuclear power plants as they are all placed in a containment building .
This is the main reason as to why the reactor meltdown accident in Three Mile Island did not cause any deaths or injuries .
Therefore , it can be shown that technology can be used to reduce the dangers of nuclear power .

Secondly , nuclear power plants were often thought to be much dangerous than other sources of electricity generation due to the unstable nuclear reactors .
For example , coal burning generators and hydroelectric power plants .
However , this is not true as advancements in technology has allowed nuclear power plants to be safer than any other types of power plants .
The sodium cooled fast nuclear reactor which Butler (2004) states , produces only electricity and no other outputs ,it also has a low operating temperature of 550 degrees Celsius and pressure compared to older generations of reactors .
Furthermore , other types of power plants produce harmful gases like carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide .
Donald (2004) also states that third generation nuclear reactors are already able to reduce possibility of a nuclear reactor meltdown from 1 in 20 ,000 to 1 in 800 ,000 .
Donald (2004) also states that there were more deaths in other types of electricity generation plants than nuclear power plants .
For example , hydroelectric power plants caused 110 times more deaths , coal 45 times and natural gases 45 times respectively .
NS & T (n .d) states that unlike fossil fuel or natural gases , uranium is mined and is in solid form , therefore it will not cause problems such as spillage during transportation , unlike the liquid fossil fuels and gaseous natural gases , which are considered as old -age forms of raw materials for generating electricity .
Thus , we can observe that technological advancements in nuclear power can allow it to be safer than other kinds of nuclear power plants .
Lastly , nuclear waste disposal are often thought to be as one of the most important reasons impeding the safety of nuclear power plants .
However , due to recent technological advancements , nuclear waste disposal has become much safer .
The sodium-cooled fast nuclear reactor which Butler (2004) lists can allow most of the nuclear wastes produced after the generation of electricity to be recycled for a large amount of times .
Therefore , reducing the amount of nuclear wastes produced and thus reducing the dangers of nuclear waste disposal .
Both Parta (n .d) and Donald (2004) have state in their articles that nuclear power produces small amount of nuclear waste , the size of an aspirin tablet per person's electricity consumption per year .
Therefore , due to the small amount of nuclear waste produced from nuclear power plants , and the ease of recycling the already small amount of nuclear waste due to technological advancements , nuclear waste disposal is much safer than before .
In conclusion , due to technology , misconceptions on the accident of Chernobyl can be cleared and future similar accidents can be prevented .
Furthermore , technology has allowed the generation of nuclear power to be much safer than other forms of power generation .
Moreover , the disposal of nuclear waste has become much safer due to technological advancements .
Thus , opposition of implementation of nuclear power should be reduced and nuclear power should be used as the new source of energy .

The Insider (2003) "At some time between 2010 and 2020 , the world's supply of oil and gas will fall below the level required to meet international demand ."
Oil and gas are currently important contribution to electricity in our everyday lives .
Unless we find alternative sources for oil and gas , our economy will most likely collapse the day we run out of them .
Nuclear power , an alternative source of electricity , could be the answer to this major problem .
According to a statistic by the "World Nuclear Association (2009)" , about 15% of the world's electricity generation comes from nuclear power .
Despite being the most prominent replacement for coal and fuel , nuclear reactors received strong opposition from the public masses .
The public's main concerns of nuclear reactors are the high cost of nuclear plants and nuclear research , the hazard that it poses and whether the nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases .
Nevertheless , further research and development funding is needed for generation IV reactor concept , namely the "Very-High Temperature" reactor .
As cited from Idaho National Laboratory (2009) , the Very-High-Temperature Reactor or "VHTR" is a helium-cooled reactor which is graphite-moderated , with a one time uranium fuel cycle .
It uses high core outlet temperatures that enable hydrogen and electricity production .
Firstly , detractors claimed that nuclear reactors and their corresponding researches cost lots of resources and money , so much that it is not economically worth taxpayer's money to build and research nuclear technologies .
According to statistics from "The Virtual Nuclear Tourist (2005)" , taking fuel , capital , operation , maintenance and waste related costs into considerations , coal cost 29 .1 $/Mw-hr while nuclear power cost 30 $/Mw-hr .
The difference in momentary value between conventional coal processing and nuclear power is not that big a difference .
Furthermore , "Very-High Temperature" reactors do not need to spend any money on waste recycling as all the waste goes directly to the repository .
This means that the cost of this technology is about the same , if not , lesser than conventional coal processing .
Gwyneth Cravens (2007) , Power to Save the World , New York: Knopf Publishing Group .
Secondly , opponents doubt the safety of using nuclear reactors and the possible hazards that it might pose .
Ever since the Chernobyl accident , many fear that history will repeat itself .
They are worried that the safety of their children will be at stake .
According to history , there have been only two major reactor accidents due to civil nuclear power , namely the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
As referred from the World Nuclear Association (2008) , these two accidents are the only two in the 12 ,700 reactor-years of commercial operation of in 32 countries .
Moreover , ever since the Chernobyl accident which happened in 1986 , the standards for safety in nuclear reactors have greatly increased .
Unlike the past , nuclear reactors now come with equipments that prevent operational disturbances which will in turn develop into problems .
In addition , sub systems are also implemented to detect problems and prevent significant radioactive releases .
All these new implementations come in all generation IV reactors , including the "Very-High Temperature Reactors" .
Thirdly , critics questioned if nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases and claimed that nuclear power will never be able to replace coals and fuel in the near future .
As stated , nuclear reactors are already generating about 15% of the world's electricity needs .
According to the World Nuclear Organization (2008) , a single average nuclear power reactor generates about 12 .4 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy .
Generation IV reactors , namely the VHTR , generates not only electricity , but also hydrogen .
Hydrogen is much needed in motor vehicle industries where future vehicles will most likely run on hydrogen fuels when coal and oil eventually runs out .
As stated in the book by Gwyneth Cravens (2007) "wind and solar power , while important , can meet only a fraction of the demand for electricity" .
When it comes to electricity generation , there are no other alternatives that come close to coals and fuels other than nuclear power .
Nuclear power will most probably be our main source of electricity generators once coal and fuel runs out .
It will be a better option to spend money on researching nuclear power prototypes now , rather than to wait till the epic scene where there is not enough electricity to go around to support the growth of the world .
Hence , it is of utmost important that research and development funding is provided for Very-High Temperature reactors .

Robotic surgery is the use of a mechanical device to assist surgery in place of a human being or in a human-like way .
Even though it is in its early stages , robotic surgery is set to revolutionize surgery .
Today's technology is focused on developing 'robot-assisted-surgery' but , gradually , robots are becoming more sophisticated and diverse .
One of such system is the Da Vinci Surgical System .
It is a system that enables surgeons to carry out operation with better precision .
The Da Vinci System has been used for a variety of surgical procedures including surgery for prostate cancer , hysterectomy and mitral valve repair .
Despite the many benefits such 'robot-assisted-surgery' brings , surgeons around the world are skeptical about how such technology can truly benefit mankind .
Many of the surgeons around the world are concerned with the inadequate training among practitioners when using the system .
Cases of lives loss have occurred due to the inadequate amount of practice with the new systems .
"The more you do , the better you're going to get ."
Said Dr . Kevin Zorn , chief of urology at Weiss Memorial Hospital at the University of Chicago (Debra , 2009) New and inexperienced surgeons can be subjected to rigorous training before using the system on their patients .
Dr . Kevin Zorn stated that it would take at least 20 attempts before one can become familiar enough to do the surgery safely .
(Debra , 2009) Robot-assisted-surgery can also be incorporated into the medical education system to expose new surgeons to such technology at an early stage to further reduce the issue of inadequate training .
As the system is still in its infancy stage , future improvements of such safety issues can be made to include technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) , where the system are allowed to correct errors done by the surgeon during the procedure .
One other concern will be the dent a surgical robot will have on the hospital's financial budget .
Most hospital does not have the budget to purchase equipments costing more than $500 ,000 .
Most claim that the cost of the machine (hefty at US$1 .5 million dollars) will result with patient being unable to afford the increase in surgical cost .
However , when expensive equipment is used more frequently , it becomes more economical .
Ash Tewari , Director of Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer-Urologic Oncology Outcomes at Brady Urology Foundation of the Department of Urology , says that sitting at the console , in a relaxed position , enables him to do more procedures than he could if he were standing upright over a patient .
(Charles , 2007) Also , as the use of the robotic system reduces the recovery time needed , the average stay of the patients is reduced to 3 to 4 days as compared to 7 days .
(Kristen , 2005) Therefore , the hospital will be able to handle more patients , reducing the cost needed from patients for the surgery .
According to the study , with proper experience in both techniques , there is no advantage in applying Da Vinci Surgical System .
(A .A , 2005) This raised issue of whether is there a need to move to a stage of incorporating robots into the operation theatre .
With uncertainties of whether the safety and cost will be resolved , are they worth the risk to adopt when there are no clear advantages in them ?
"Try to use chopsticks through a very small hole .
You're not going to be very good with them .
But if you have a robot that can project the dexterity of your hands through a small incision , then you can do complex things" , cited Dr . David Yuh , assistant professor of surgery in the division of cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore .
(Kristen , 2005) In comparison to traditional approaches , the robotic system will have greater surgical precision , increased range of motion , improved dexterity , enhanced visualization and improved access .
These will benefit patients in having less pain , less risk of infection , less blood loss , fewer transfusions , less scarring , faster recovery and a quicker return to normal daily activities .
(Intuitive Surgical , 2009) For example , most heart surgical procedures are done through the sternum , a flat bone of the rib cage .
This method of operation causes much distress and pain to the patient as compared to if it is done using the Minimal Invasive System (MIS) approach .
However , human limitations do not allow a smooth MIS procedure when it comes to heart operations .
This is where the improved dexterity the robot offers becomes handy .
Robotic surgical system will be the step medical authorities have to take for the better of mankind .
It should be evident that arguments regarding safety , cost , as well as better performance are addressed .
Instead of shunning away , we should learn to be receptive and reach for greater height in both the medical field as well as the robotics field .
"If you are looking at the future , it's hard to envision a hospital not offering robotics ," said Robert Glenning , chief financial officer at the Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey .

Experts have predicted that with the current ever-increasing usage of energy , the fossil fuels on Earth will be used up in the next fifty years .
Alternative forms of energy have to be developed to solve this issue .
Nuclear energy is one of the alternatives which can be used .
The very high temperature reactor (VHTR) is a Generation IV reactor concept which operates at around 900 to 1000 degree Celsius .
It has a higher efficiency than the conventional coal reactors .
However , there is much dispute over the usage of nuclear reactors .
Safety issues and costs are the main reasons for the public to oppose the usage of VHTR .
Even with these arguments , there is still a need to develop VHTR as a source of energy for the future .
Thesis
The public are afraid that the high temperatures in the nuclear reactors will be a major hazard for the people working in and those living near the reactors .
People fear that the high temperatures will increase the possibilities of having an explosion in the reactors .
VHTR uses helium , an inert and fireproof gas , as the coolant instead of water used by the conventional reactors .
Thus , it will not result in steam explosion , which can happen in reactors using water as a coolant .
In addition , VHTR is designed to work under high temperatures .
It has a reliable safety backup system whereby in case of machinery failures , the reactor will submissively fall to a safe energy level , without damaging the reactor vessels or the fuel spheres , allowing corrections to be made safely (MIT , 2003) .
Hence , this shows that safety precautions have been set to prevent accidents .
On the other hand , instead of being a threat , the high temperatures can be used to produce hydrogen , which can eventually be converted into electricity for the public , making VHTR more efficient compared to coal reactors and even some of the other Generation IV reactor concepts .
In short , the high temperatures will not become a threat to the public as safety measures are taken to prevent accidents; instead , the high temperatures can be used to improve the efficiency of VHTR .
The high initial start up costs is also a crucial factor in the opposition of VHTR .
According to Butler (2004) , it costs about US$1 billion dollars to build a nuclear reactor .
Hence , it has to have relatively lower operating costs to stay competitive with fossil fuel reactors .
In fact , VHTR can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with conventional reactors (Butler , 2004) .
Hence , being a much more efficient reactor , it lowers the operating and capital costs .
It is also stated that VHTR can generate electricity at prices that are comparable with coal and gas .
Furthermore , VHTR does not emit greenhouse gases .
Currently , global warming is one of the most serious issues in the world .
By cutting down on greenhouse gases emissions , it will eventually have a long term benefit for the public .
The risks of greenhouse effects should also be taken into consideration in the decision to use nuclear energy .
The high start up costs cannot outweigh the detrimental effects on the Earth by greenhouse gases .
Moreover , although in the short run , companies running VHTR may incur losses , in the long run , they will be able gain profits .
Therefore , high initial investments should not deter companies from setting up VHTR , as there will be long term gains for the public .
Finally , opponents of nuclear reactors fear that plutonium which can be found in nuclear waste will be used for terrorism .
Plutonium is an element which can be made into nuclear weapons; it is only available when the nuclear waste is reprocessed .
However , according to Butler (2004) , VHTR does not reprocess nuclear waste .
As a result , plutonium will not be separated out from the waste .
This can ease the fears of the public that terrorist will make nuclear reactors their potential target .
In brief , nuclear weapons cannot be made without plutonium; as a consequence , VHTR will less likely be a target for terrorist .
In conclusion , the arguments against the setting up of VHTR are debatable .
The adverse effects of global warming cannot outweigh the costs of setting up VHTR .
Furthermore , the accidents due to high temperatures can be prevented with sufficient safety measures in place .
Instead , the high temperatures can be used to increase efficiency of the reactor .
Fears of the use of plutonium to be made into nuclear weapons can also be eased as the nuclear waste in VHTR is not reprocessed; consequently , plutonium will not be separated out .
Therefore , further funding for the research and development of VHTR should be made available as VHTR will bring long term benefits to the public .
With the explosion of global population , the world is demanding more energy than ever .
Non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels will soon be depleted within decades and we need to find new sources of energy to sustain the global civilisation .
Current renewable sources such as solar power , wind power and hydroelectric power are not sufficient to keep up with the growing demands .
Hence nuclear power is becoming a more viable option as it produces consistent output of electricity in large amounts .
However , conventional fears and concerns from the public that radiation , risk of nuclear explosion and nuclear meltdown can have catastrophic impact on the environment and public health .
Furthermore , the consequences of it not so well-known and researched on yet as nuclear technology has not been around for a very long time .
But in reality , burning of fossil fuels for energy are damaging the environment and public health too , which may , to a certain extent , causes even more damage than a safe operating nuclear power plant .
Nuclear power is a feasible choice to meet the demands of the world energy needs as the output is highly efficient and consistent out of all the renewable sources , new generation nuclear reactors are safer and cheaper to operate and are more secure not just with the heavy fortification but also simplified fail-safe mechanisms which can automatically prevent disasters triggered by accident .
The cost of power generation by nuclear means is still higher as compared to that of fossil fuels .
And this in turn , leads to higher market prices for electricity generated by nuclear means .
But in the long run , nuclear power may even be cheaper .
One of the leading concept of generation IV reactor , Very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , uses advanced technology to increase the efficiency of electricity generation by 50% (Butler , 2004) .
This allows the reactor to lower the cost of production by producing 50% more electricity with the same amount of input , since nuclear reactors does not require consistent inputs of fuel frequently as compared to fossil fuel plants which requires constant inputs of fuels to burn .
The VHTR is designed to be a highly efficient system and is able to supply process heat to industries that require high-temperature , energy-intensive and non-electric processes (Idaho Laboratories , 2009) .
The VHTR concept is based on what is judged to be the minimal risk technology that will achieve commercial functional requirements to provide an economically competitive nuclear heat source and hydrogen production capability (Idaho Laboratories , 2009) .
This in turn saves energy that is needed to power these industries .
Conventional fears of catastrophic nuclear accidents can be put to rest with the new generation nuclear plants which use the latest technology to ensure maximum safety .
Nuclear power is safer with new technology that saves production cost .
New generation reactors are designed to be "meltdown proof" which cools themselves down in the event of an accident (Butler , 2004) .
It incorporates a simplified safety features without relying too much on sophisticated backup systems and competent personals , and thus any attempt to sabotage the facility will be in vain .
The best part of this is that all will be done without human intervention .
Hence the plant will be very safe even if an accident occurs .
The security of a nuclear installation is of utmost importance given the threats of sabotaging by terrorists .
All nuclear installations around the world are heavily fortified with security personnel and defence mechanisms , hence the nuclear plants will be safe and secure .
Concerns from the public regarding the implications of radiation exposure of an operating nuclear plant are all but unfounded as ironically , conventional fossil fuel plants emit more pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide which causes acid rain , carbon dioxide which causes global warming .
This in fact causes more damage to the environment than a safe operating nuclear plant which has no emissions as all radioactive fuels are kept in containers with thick lead walls to prevent any radiation leakage .
Statistics show that there are more deaths due to overexposure to these pollutants .
Apart from the Chernobyl accident , and subsequent major accidents , radiation released during normal operation have been found to be almost undetectable as compared to natural background radiation (Gabbard , n .d) .
In fact coal combustion produces carbon dioxide and other greenhouse and also sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides , which are harmful to human health , are responsible for acid rain .
And there is another shocking fact: releases from coal combustion contain naturally occurring radioactive substances such as uranium and thorium (Gabbard , n .d) .
All in all , nuclear power is not exactly more hazardous than conventional power plants given the newer generation of nuclear plants which promises maximum safety and security with enhanced efficiency .
With continual research and advancement of nuclear power technology , the nuclear reactors of the generations to come will be safer to operate , more efficient and are accident-safe due to more sophisticated automatic shutdown mechanisms .
Public concerns over safety and nuclear proliferation have retarded the growth of nuclear technology .
According to Butler (2004) , "the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine" have convinced the public that nuclear technology is extremely dangerous .
Besides , there were questions over proliferation of uranium and plutonium waste to generate Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) .
Moreover , renewable energy technologies such as wind , biomass , geothermal and solar energy have proven to be effective in achieving electricity production with small carbon footprints (MIT , 2009) .
However , on the other hand , the Generation IV International Forum envisions nuclear as the best alternative for coal and has proposed six best prospects for the reactors of the future , known as Generation IV reactors (Butler ,2004) .
Amongst all , the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) proves to be promising with advantages such as passive safety , flexibility , higher efficiency and non-proliferation of nuclear waste .
The VHTR should thus be accepted as the next generation of reactor and funds should be allocated for the research and development of the VHTR .
First of all , oppositions of nuclear technology have argued that nuclear power is unsafe due to its radioactive and explosive nature , and a leakage or accident is likely to cause severe damages and even deaths .TS In the context of VHTR , though explosive and radioactive in nature , it is able to prevent radioactive materials from escaping in the event of a leakage or accident .
This is commonly termed as passive safety design .
The VHTR uses helium as a coolant for the reaction and helium is extremely inert towards radioactive materials .
The core is composed of prismatic graphite , and has high heat capacity and structural stablility at high temperature and pressure .
This was demonstrated in a test conducted in Beijing when a prototype of VHTR reactor , HTR-10 , is able to shut down with no cooling gas (Next Big Future , 2008) .
However , there is still a possibility that human error might occur and in an event of a nuclear accident , consequences are detrimental to people living around the area .
This has been illustrated by the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accident .
Secondly , nuclear power is not as cost competitive as compared with coal and natural gas (MIT ,2009) .TS Based on a study conducted by the MIT , with reference to year 2007 , it is estimated that electricity generated by coal cost $0 .062 per kilowatt hour , and electricity generated by natural gases cost $0 .065 per kilowatt hour; electricity generated by nuclear power cost $0 .084 per kilowatt hour (MIT , 2009) .
Though expensive , VHTR is able to generate H2 which is useful as a non-polluting fuel to generate large amounts of energy .
Many countries are betting on H2 as the next generation of fuel and the VHTR complements the situation .
Thirdly , oppositions of nuclear energy have also questioned the performance of nuclear technology .TS According to Butler (2004) , the VHTR is able to squeeze out 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel comapred with conventional plants (Butler , 2004) .
In addition , the heat generated by VHTR can be applied to most of the industry fields and its gas turbine system can generate electricity at an efficiency of 50% .
This is 17% higher than existing nuclear plants with electricity output of 33% (Japan Atomic Energy Agency , no date) .
Thus , the VHTR offers a higher efficiency conversion of heat to electricity as compared to conventional power plants and perform better than existing nuclear plants .
Lastly , opponents argued that reprocessing of nuclear waste gives countries an excuse to proliferate raw materials for advanced nuclear weapons .TS Among the six design reactors as proposed by the GIF , the Supercritical- water-cooled Reactor (SCWR) and the VHTR are be able to operate without having to depend on the controversial processing of plutonium (Butler , 2004) .
This reduces the possibility of countries proliferating nuclear raw materials for WMD .
In conclusion , the VHTR offers good prospect to be the next generation of reactors .
The flexibility and higher efficiency of VHTR allow it to be competitive in the near future .
Furthermore , non-proliferation of plutonium through VHTR process reduces the production of WMD .
However , the threat of nuclear accidents still persist and it is up to our own engineers to further resolve this threat .
Thus , funds should be provided in this case to strengthen the passive safety design in VHTR reactors .
We live in an era of rapid development .
With the development of science and technologies , the demand for energy is keeping increasing .
Nowadays , power sources have become the focus of attention in the world .
In recent years , a new type of power source , nuclear power has sparked a heated controversy .
Some people think nations should cease doing further research and development funding for nuclear power because it will brings some serious problems on safety , security and costs .
However , as the matter of fact , the advantages of further development of nuclear power are more than the disadvantages , so further research and development of this power source should be supported .
First of all , opponents state that nuclear power has some safety problems .
First , they say that the generation IV actors are very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) , which react in both high temperature and pressure .
It is very dangerous because nuclear reactors are very likely to explode under the condition of high temperature and pressure .
Second , the key element of the nuclear power Plutonium is a radioactive metal element , which would release large number of radiation in decay and reactions .
The radiation would do harm to human health in the long-term study .
Whereas , to the problem of high temperature and pressure , scientist put forward some corresponding improvements in generation IV reactors .
First , we take fluoride salts as the coolant for molten salts reactors in the reactions .
The fluoride salts are "thermodynamically stable (i .e . , they do not decompose upon heating)" and have the good effect of cooling CITATION WFo07 \l 2052 (W .Forsberh , Peterson , & Zhao , 2007) .
Moreover , comparing with other generation IV reactors like Gas-cooled fast reactors and Supercritical-water-cooled reactors , the pressure for molten salts reactors is low .
Furthermore , the molten salts reaction facilities are made of thick reinforced concrete .
Reinforced concrete has the characters of firmness and anti high temperature .
This kind of material can absorb radiation produced by the plutonium , so that the radiation will be greatly reduced .
Therefore , the high temperature and pressure in process and radioactivity of the element are not big problems to affect nuclear power research .
Besides the safety , some people also concern the security of nuclear power .
Since most reactions of generation IV reactors are waste recycling reactions , the main element Plutonium may be stolen in the process of recycling .
Plutonium is also can be used to make nuclear weapons , it is possible to be stolen by some terrorists .
Thus , it would be a big danger for the world .
However , to this concern , many nations and international institutes in the world have put many efforts on security enhancement and have made some achievements .
To instance , National Nuclear Security of U .S has the Defense Nuclear Security program which is "responsible for securing the nuclear weapons and components , and hundreds of tons of special nuclear material in all forms , shapes and sizes" CITATION Nuc09 \l 2052 (Nuclear Security) .
In the future , there will be greater development of the nuclear security system to protect against the waste stealing and nuclear terrorism .
In addition , opponents state that the high cost is also a problem of further research for nuclear power .
It is not only very costly to build a nuclear power plant , but also , the cost for waste recycling process is extremely big .
However , in fact , to do long-term perspective , nuclear power would be relatively less costly .
For example , there is a research to compare the cost of nuclear power and the cost of the most common power resource , coals .
Researchers point that taking 40 years as a period , even though nuclear power is more costly than coal power in the first 7 .5 years , it will be cost saving in the rest 32 .5 years CITATION Sol06 \l 2052 (Solbrig & Bnedict , 2006) .
Moreover , nuclear power can generate much more energy thaN the coal power and is more friendly to environment .
Hence , considering long-term interests , people should encourage further research for nuclear power .
In conclusion , further research and development funding for nuclear power should be supported .
In the further study , scientists and engineers would come up with the more solutions of the problems people concern in the safety , security and cost .
In the future , nuclear power would be an important power resource in the world .
As global warming is intruding our daily life , the public begins to keep an eye on the green house emission , which have increased 70 percent since 1994 compared to the pre-industrial times (GEN 4 international forum , 2008) .
In the international forum of nuclear energy system 2008 , the panel puts forward that nuclear energy is the option that provides "clean" energy which emits no green house gas .
On the other hand , with the concern of the natural resources shortage , more and more people are in favour of the nuclear energy because it kindles the hope of solving energy crisis .
It seems that nuclear energy points to the way to meet future energy demands without destroying the environment .
Nowadays the focus is turned to how to ensure the nuclear energy is safer , more economic-benefited and efficient than other energy choices .
Within the six methods of the fourth generation of nuclear energy reactor , some may argue that the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) should be applied considering its high efficiency and security .
This essay will focus on the view that Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) is the prior option to meet the safety and efficiency criteria after the comprehensive analysis .
First of all , safety is always the primary concern when introducing a newly developed technology .
The researchers who are in favour of VHTR argue that the resource of VHTR , helium - an inertia gas with low chemical activity is much safer than sodium , the coolant of SFR .
If the sodium leaks from the core then there could be a tremendous explosion .
This could be a serious threat to safety .
Although it is true that sodium is relatively active , there is an extra loop in the SFR producing process in order to prevent the accident (Carlsson , Tucek , &Wider , 2005) .
Moreover , there are several cycles in the process of SFR and each individual is segregated .
Therefore it is hardly that the reactor will leak out .
Besides the chemical behavior , the operating condition is another element responsible for the safety .
According to Carlsson , Tucek and Wider's conclusion (2005) , the probability of incurring the accident of losing coolant is proportional to the operating temperature and pressure .
VHTR requires quite high operating temperature at 1000 Celsius and pressure .
On the contrary , SFR is best performed under low pressure and only 350 to 500 Celsius degree (Butler , 2004) .
Hence the operating conditions make the SFR practically safe as a result of the low possibility of incurring the losing coolant accident .
Lastly , there is no separate plutonium generated in all processes of SFR , which is a highly radioactive and toxic element .
As a result , the proliferation can be controlled .
Apart from the safety of nuclear power , the high efficiency is another factor that prompts the researchers to promote SFR method .
The Department of Nuclear Energy of University of California , Berkeley (2009) , announced that the thermal efficiency of SFR could be upgraded to 47 percent resulting from the reheat and inter-cooling process design , which is a breakthrough in terms of the efficiency of energy conversion .
Unlike the VHTR , the SFR utilizes metallic fuel with neutron spectrum , which is capable of transmuting the raw materials to green energy efficiently .
Not only is the efficiency the breakthrough , but also the recycle of resource is very remarkable .
The recycle model of SFR is unique and the best among the six methods in the fourth generation .
As part of the waste of SFR can be re-utilized again as the resource of the reactor , the whole process acts like a self-supply system .
This quality can solve the resource shortage problem of the majority of energy supply methods .
Also , the recycle concept best explains the green technology .
The columnist Butler (2009) from Washington Times brings up the idea that the U .S . should give the green light for nuclear energy .
To support the idea , Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor is the ideal method representing the essence of nuclear energy , secured safety and high efficiency .
It is better to embrace the dawn of the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor instead of fearing the future it brings .
The world's energy is going towards depletion , and many countries are seeking other alternative energy sources .
To meet future energy needs , a framework in research for Generation IV nuclear energy systems have been agreed on by 10 countries , which later combine to form the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) to develop future-generation nuclear energy systems (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 1) .
Very-High-Temperature Reactor , also known as VHTR in abbreviation , is one of the six Generation IV reactors selected by GIF .
There are claims against building VHTR due to safety issues relating to materials .
Critics also claim that there are potential dangers in operating a reactor and disapprovals on high cost to build a VHTR .
Nevertheless , these arguments are not true and VHTR technology should be adopted as it is designed to benefit the society .
First of all , opponents who object in building VHTR claim that people are worried about the materials that need to withstand temperature up to 1000oC and high pressure (about 50 atm) .
This argument is not true as scientists and experts have done research on the materials needed to withstand the requirements currently .
Chen and some associating scientists (n .d .) had already done some investigations on X-ray absorption and synchrotron X-ray for analysis of VHTR- materials (The Applicability of Synchrotron X-ray Analyses for VHTR Materials , pp .
1-13) , while Bill Corwin (2003) mentioned that demonstrations had already been done to 900oC and above 1000 psi (approximately 68 atm) (Materials for Very-High-Temperature Reactor , p . 13) .
Shuwen "Eric" Wang (2005) also pointed out that a new coating material zirconium carbide has been found (p . 6) .
With the scientists' strong commitment and dedication and strong foundation in research , suitable materials will be expected to be found in due time .

People are worried about the potential dangers brought by operating the nuclear reactor; however , the design of VHTR has assured people the improvement in its original gas-cooled reactor's safety features .
Helium gas is introduced as a primary heat coolant because of its chemically unreactive properties (Shuwen "Eric" Wang , 2005 , p . 9) and has good thermal properties .
According to GIF (2008) , VHTR is recognized in terms of safety features of fuel and reactor .
Passive heat removal system is developed to simplify the operation of the reactor , which requires no short-term human intervention (Shuwen "Eric" Wang , 2005 , p . 9) .
In addition , Shuwen Wang (2005) also pointed out that "improved control rods and reserve shutdown systems are capable of terminating fission process to control reactivity" (Very High Temperature Reactor Safety Characteristics , p . 10) .
These affirmations hold true that potential dangers are minimized dramatically .
Lastly , although critics claimed that the cost is high to make this design to work in real life , we can get many benefits .
In fact , VHTR ranked the second in the lowest cost among all Gen IV reactors , consuming about $670M (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 52) .
This is the reason why most of the people prefer VHTR to other Generation IV reactors .
Water-cooled reactors today run at about 300oC .
On the contrary , VHTR runs at about temperature of 1000oC and thus allows more efficient conversion of heat to electricity (Butler , 2004) .
Butler (2004) mentioned that "VHTR is able to produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with conventional plants" (Nuclear power's new dawn , p . 238) .
In addition , over 2 million cubic meters hydrogen gas can be yielded per day (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 48) .
VHTR system is highly ranked in economics because of its high hydrogen production efficiency (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , 2002 , p . 22) .
From these evidences , we could say that operating VHTR will bring a lot of benefits to people in future .
In conclusion , arguments about insufficient materials , dangerous operation and not beneficial in building VHTR are not affirmed .
Hopefully , VHTR technology will be completely adopted because it brings benefits and advantages to the society .

Chernobyl nuclear accident is one of the most terrible disasters in the history of engineering development .
This accident happened on April 26 , 1986 , when the Number 4 reactor of the nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine exploded .
The result is that 300 Megacarriers of radioactive isotopes was injected into the atmosphere and millions of people died immediately or consequently .
More than twenty years have passed while an issue has always been controversial , which is whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident .
In other word , if we can clear all the human factors of the accident , would the accident be prevented ?
The people supporting this point of view argue that the design errors play important roles that lead to the accident and these errors can be removed with psychology to avoid the accident .
However , other people show the opposite opinion by saying that no matter how well psychology is involved to concern safety problems in design , the accident will always happen since human knowledge and experience are limited .
In my point of view , psychology can help prevent the accident .
The view that support the use of psychology could have prevented the accident shows that the design errors directly cause the accident and removing these errors would remove the accident .
As Wilpert (2007) states , safety of engineering design depends on three things , namely , effective process , production control and failure avoidance .
However , the Chernobyl reactor , reactor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalniy (RBMK) , was designed with problems of all these three aspects .
Firstly , in the RBMK reactor , the process of insertion of rods , which are to regulate the reaction speed , is inefficient and there is no fast rod for emergency .
It takes 20 seconds for a full insertion and this is too slow to prevent the core from running away when the reaction is under the unstable mode (Frot , 2001) .
Moreover , the rods are designed with graphite tip which , when first inserted , will increases the reactivity .
Secondly , the production control of RBMK is poor .
The core of the reactor is unstable at low power .
When the accident happened , the reactor was at a test of low power , working with only a quarter of full power .
Thirdly , the RBMK reactor has almost nothing to prepare for out coming gases .
Without either a system to filter exhaust neither gases nor a containment structure (Frot , 2001) , the release of radioactivity could quickly spread in all directions and causes more serious results .
As analyzed , by removing the errors above , the accident can be prevented .
Hence psychology should be functional for preventing the accident .
However , the opposite side announces that whatever we can do with psychology would not prevent the happening of the accident .
The main support of this point of view is that human knowledge and experiences are limited and we cannot avoid all the mistakes even if we have excellent psychology .
Twenty years ago , nuclear power engineering had just developed and engineers lacked experiences .
Moreover , the experiences and development may come from testing or even accidents .
The opposite side actually argues with not very concrete reasons since almost all the design errors that causes the Chernobyl accident are within human ability at that time .
First of all , this error had already been noted three years before the Chernobyl accident , but it was not removed by any designer (SFEN , 1996) .
Secondly , the instability of the reactor RBMK had already been known by the engineers at that time , but the warning did not change anything (Segodnio , 1993) .
For the third factor , the containment for leaking gases is not a complicated structure and what they should do is no more than investing some more money to build it .
For the facts mentioned above , we can conclude that the accident actually could be prevented if the designers gain good enough psychology that concern much for safety problems .
All in all , the use of psychology could play a role to prevent the happening of the Chernobyl accident .
How we wish that the designers of the Chernobyl reactor RBMK had gain good psychology , so that they would not use the unstable core , the ineffective control rods and the inflammable moderator , and would kindly design an enclosed containment for exhaust gases .
Nuclear power is nowadays universally acknowledged as a clean and economical energy source , and it is needed to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels which are limited due to geographical reasons and environmental concerns .
However , there were two serious reactor accidents in the history of civil nuclear power: Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 .
The latter one caused 31immmediate death and both spewed a heavy dose of radiation which has far-reaching negative effect on the ecosystem in vicinity .
Thus , to enhance safety , scientists and engineers are obligated to investigate into the incidents and find out the causes .
Like what Bernhard Wilpert once stated , it is never a single component failure that leads to accidents (Safety Science , 2007) .
One of the influential factors is the human error .
Targeting on this issue , the concept of "passive safety systems" has been proposed in the field of nuclear power .
Different from the active systems , theses passive ones require no operator intervention and merely rely on utilizing the gravity , natural convection (natural circulation) , materials' expansion on heating and other physical laws .
So far , although there have been several concerns raised on these systems , such as the understanding of their reliability , limited opportunity to manage events , etc . , they are reliable  , economical and safe to operate .
Opponents think reliability of passive safety systems are not that well understood compared with active safety systems .
However , this opinion should not be counted as a ground to refuse to apply these passive systems in nuclear power plants .
Active ones are widely understood and accepted because they have been used long enough to be observed and tested on .
Meanwhile their shortcomings are also exposed gradually in application to nuclear power plants .
That is why experts work more on substitutions , such as passive safety systems and a combination of both .
The design procedure of the new ones also experienced large amounts of trials and errors and they are more advanced than the previous ones .
When faced with doubts , passive safety systems will prove their reliability in the long run .
Another concern is that if a nuclear power plant has an entirely passive system , there is no or very limited opportunity to manage events or post the incident and perhaps operators will not be able to turn valves off remotely .
Nonetheless , director of reactor systems of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd . claimed that the design was robust and relying on gravity can possibly gain a ten-fold increase in safety than traditional pumps and valves (Mayson R . , 2002) .
Moreover , the objective of passive safety systems is to completely eliminated core degradation in the design (A .K .
Nayak , R .K . Sinha , 2007) which makes the reactions much reliable and back-up systems are set available to avoid totally reliance on only one kind of system .
Thus , the danger coefficient is greatly reduced .
Due to the fact that passive safety concept offers an opportunity to effect a large simplification (in the form of reduction of human intervention and external source of power) , costs on the construction of nuclear power plants are cut down significantly .
As in a virtuous circle , the saved capital can then be put into more research use and equipment maintenance .
Therefore , safety is ensured step by step .
In summary , passive safety concept rely more on forces of nature , and this approach increases the reliability and predictability of how the plants behave under various circumstances .
Even though the doubts and concerns following also deserve much attention from the scientists and engineers , application of passive safety systems is definitely reliable and economical .
To apply them not only can improve the safety issue , but also opens up bright prospects for nuclear power .

As a major controversy about spreading atomic technology in the world in generating electricity , public safety concerns have accompanied the development of nuclear energy since its birth .
The reasons for this centre round the issues of safe operation , radioactive wastes and nuclear weapons .
Since the Chernobyl accident has left a shameful scar on the history of nuclear power usage , it is understandable why some people think that living near to a nuclear power plant is equal to having a bomb buried in the back yard .
However , despite the catastrophic events caused by violating the safety regulations , nuclear plants are actually much safer compared with other coal-fired plants in both the senses of occupational fatalities and industrial accidents .
Referring to the Generation IV Reactors , apart from the double-walled container and the radiation-proof material that rap the whole reactor up , all the radioactive parts are physically submerged underwater to prevent any undetectable leakage .
Simultaneously , the highly sensitive and fast reacting monitoring system has also enabled engineers to handle all the emergencies before it is too late .
All these efforts made by engineers have contributed to ensure a far better safety record for nuclear power plants than any other means of generating electricity today , and definitely they will be safer tomorrow than today .
Another significant drawback , perhaps is the greatest problem which often associated with nuclear energy , is that of nuclear waste disposal .
In early days , rich countries like USA transported the potential danger to nations in Latin America through paying them for lands to bury its radioactive wastes .
Such an environmental unfriendly and inhuman approach soon begot fierce censure from the public voice for its selfishness .
The problem for today , however , is that "there is a huge information gap between specialists on the exposures from nuclear power and the public" (Ilan Lipper & Jon Stone .
(1998) .
Nuclear Energy & Society .
Retrieved September 28 , 2009 from www .umich .edu/~gs265/society/nuclear .htm) .
There is a huge misunderstanding that the radioactive waste is more dangerous than waste from other types of power system .
Byproducts like NOx and toxic metals in coal-fired power plants can also disrupt local ecology forever if they are not correctly dealt with .
In addition , as described in Nuclear Power's New Dawn , all the wastes and byproducts created by the generation IV reactor can be recycled to minimize its damage to both mankind and the environment , and the very-high-temperature reactor is even designed to achieve the goal of zero-emission !
Thanks to the advancing technology , combined with the fact that the average radiation we human received from peaceful nuclear fuel cycle is only 0 .1 percent of the inevitable exposure to natural radiation resources and building materials (Nuclear Energy & Society) , nuclear energy will definitely provide mankind with tremendous benefits that can never be achieved by other types of power .
One more major drawback of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is that it has allowed the production of nuclear weapons .
As Einstein has said before , "I don't know what weapon will people fight with in world war three , but I know that they will use stones and sticks in world war four" .
The destructive power of nuclear weapon has long been a threat to the entire human being .
As concerning the 911 disaster , terrorists may possibly target nuclear facilities or use radioactive materials for massive destruction .
From my perspective , in cases like these , it is not the double-edged nuclear technology to blame , but the hands that touch it .
This is an unavoidable dilemma for the advance of science and everyone has to accept the unforeseeable risks when they are enjoying the benefits .
Overall , nuclear energy holds bright prospect as a front edge technology that would allow us to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels , occupying less land yet generating more power .
However , in order for the industry to reach its full potential , we must find ways to address the problem of safe operation , waste disposal and security issues as well .
There is a rising demand for energy today .
With the concerns of global warming and depletion of conventional energy sources , investment in generation IV nuclear reactors seems to be a good alternative .
However , public opposition has been evident ever since Chernobyl and Three Mile incidents , which had exposed the potential danger of nuclear reactors (Butler , 2004) .
One of the G .IV reactors , Supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SWCR) listed in 'Nuclear energy's new dawn' (Butler , 2004) is safe , environmentally friendly , and low cost .
Therefore , despite the public concerns on safety , public health , and budget , I believe that one should support further research and development funding for generation IV nuclear reactors as it may be the energy source that prevents our planet from disaster such as catastrophic climate change .
Firstly , the SCWR is safe .
One would claim that there is no perfect machine in the world .
Therefore , a failure in nuclear system allows radioactive substances to escape from the nuclear reactor .
The consequence is devastating .
This can be seen in the Three Mile Island accident (1979) .
Moreover , plutonium from recycling of nuclear waste from nuclear reactors can be used to produce nuclear weapon (Butler , 2004) .
With these in mind , nuclear reactors pose great threat to humanity .
On the other hand , generation IV nuclear reactor is safe to operate as it can contain the radioactive material when accident occurs (Butler , 2004) .
Moreover , generation IV nuclear reactors are free from nuclear proliferation .
According to Gerald and George (2006) , the by-product , plutonium is difficult to be used as materials for making of nuclear weapons , and the nuclear technology in near future allows the plutonium to be unsuitable for making nuclear weapons .
Therefore , generation IV nuclear reactors such as SCWR are very safe for producing energy .
Secondly , nuclear energy is clean and helps in preventing global warming .
Critics argue that nuclear reactors generate nuclear pollution and can do little help in containing the amount green house gases .
According to an article , the environmentalists say that much of the green house gases come from the use of conventional energy source , which cannot be replaced by other sources at the moment (Nature , 2008) .
This is because nuclear plants are not able to generate energy at the same cost compare to conventional method .
However , nuclear energy is completely clean .
According to Butler (2004) , nuclear energy gives zero green house gases , and would help to ease energy demand and contain global warming if more intensive researches are carried out in this area .
Therefore , developed countries need to increase funding to accelerate the development of generation IV nuclear reactors to allow it to replace conventional energy sources such as coal and gases in the near future .
This trend can also be seen from countries around the world investing on nuclear research such as UK , France , and China (Butler , 2004)
Lastly , SCWR gives a low cost of production of energy .
The opposition of nuclear reactors criticize that nuclear energy is expensive due to the huge cost required in research and development .
They also argued that are alternative methods like solar and wind power can be implemented .
However , nuclear energy is in fact one of the least expensive energy sources .
According to Moore (2006) , in 2004 , the average cost of generating energy from nuclear reactor was comparable with conventional methods in the US .
Furthermore , advanced research will bring the cost down in the future .
According to Butler (2004) , S .C .W .R is cheap due to its simplistic design compare to generation III reactors .
Also , wind and solar power are intermittent and unpredictable .
They are unable to replace big base-load nuclear plants such as coal like generation IV nuclear reactors do .
Therefore , nuclear energy is the only viable substitutes .
In conclusion , we should increase funding for research and development for generation IV nuclear reactors .
Nuclear energy is the best substitution for coal and natural gas .
Current emissions of carbon dioxide from automobiles and industries are furiously contributing to global warming .
Nuclear energy would be able to clean the air and reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Furthermore , I believe that the generation IV nuclear reactors will be very safe as our technology is improving daily .
The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) was initiated in 2000 (World Nuclear Association , 2008) with the aim to build Generation IV nuclear reactors that can provide energy that is more efficient and environment friendly .
This will help to improve the standard of living in one country as unemployment and poverty have been a constant issue for many developing countries around the world .
Due to the high poverty rate and low funding from the government , electrical energy is not available in most parts of the country especially in the rural areas .
One example of a developing country is Kosovo in southeast Europe sharing borders with Serbia and Macedonia .
Statistics shows that in 2007 , the unemployment rate in Kosovo was at 40% with 37% of their population below poverty line (Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] , 2009) .
Therefore , developing countries should first handle unemployment and poverty in rural areas rather than provide huge funding to build Generation IV reactors .
It is understood that with the building of Generation IV nuclear reactors , it will generate a large amount of jobs like hard labour during construction phase and highly skilled engineers for day to day maintenance and operation .
Day to day operation jobs are the key to solve unemployment issue as it provide long term employment opportunity in the country .
However , this may not ease the problem of unemployment problem in a country like Kosovo with high unemployment rate .
As 16 .5% of Kosovo's population in the agriculture sector indicating that the locals are mainly of low education level (CIA , 2009) .
This will result to have more foreign highly skilled engineers being employed for the daily operation jobs .
Therefore , constructing Generation IV reactors will only benefit the country mostly in the hard labour work during construction phase that provide short term jobs between 3 to 5 years but not in a long run .
Poverty is often link with the problem of unemployment in one country .
Initial study indicates that with the high operating temperature of Generation IV reactors , it will generate hydrogen and electricity (Bulter , 2004) .
The hydrogen gas is believed to a future source of fuel which can be sold to other countries as another source of income .
However , the income will not be useful to the locals as it will not be directed to them .
Developing countries should provide long term and stable jobs for their people .
In this case , alternate source of energy like solar energy could be considered as the price of solar panels are on a decline (Solarbuzz , 2009) instead of spending billions of dollars building Generation IV reactors .
Solar energy is also environmental friendly like nuclear power and is free with the sunlight predicted to continue to radiate energy for another 5 billion years (Arnett , 2009) .
This will be a good solution as it provides stable job and also ensuring that energy is aplenty for a long time .
As the maintenance of a solar energy plant requires many low knowledge based technician , this will help to create long term jobs for the locals .
This in turn will help to ease the problem of poverty and unemployment in developing countries .
Developing countries should solve the problem of high unemployment rate and poverty within the country as priority rather than to build a generation IV reactor .
The initial cost of building a generation IV nuclear reactor is a multi billion dollars project .
Furthermore , the Generation IV reactors are still in the research stage (Bulter , 2004) which suggested that there are still plenty of questions and uncertainty that link to the safe operation before it can be consider complete .
Therefore , funding should be directed to other energy source like solar power where solar energy are environmental friendly and free (Energy Information Administration , n .d) .
This will create many low knowledge based job for the developing countries as the local citizens are not highly educated .
As building a nuclear reactor might result to have more foreigners to be employed than the locals as it is a high knowledge based job .

Nowadays , the energy problem gradually becomes a burning issue among the whole world .
Coal , oil , and other energy resources are less and less .
People start to fix their attention on nuclear energy .
In fact , nuclear energy now has been one of the main energy sources to generate electricity in many countries .
For instance , the United States now obtains about 20 percent of its electricity from 104 nuclear reactors .
The concept of new generation of nuclear reactorsgeneration IV , include these following six systems: gas-cooled fast reactors , lead- cooled fast reactors , molten salt reactors , sodium-cooled fast reactors , supercritical-water-cooled reactors , and very-high-temperature reactors .
All these six systems represent nowadays' nuclear energy advances in sustainability , economics , safety , reliability and proliferation-resistance .
Among all these reactors , the concept of supercritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) is the most suitable concept for funding and development .
The use of supercritical coolant would allow for a more compact design , since steam generators , dryers , circulation pumps and pressurizers would not be needed , hence achieving a better economy .
And it is also promised to have higher thermal efficienciesapproximately 45% versus the current 33% of light water reactors .
This system presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design .
Therefore , it is feasible to design such a kind of nuclear reactor .
However , SCWR faces some resistances .
Some people argue that its operation condition is highly required and there is potential hazard and worry of nuclear terrorism .
In spite of these opposing views , these problems can be solved through developed techniques and theories .
One of these opposing points is about its highly-required condition .
High temperature (510--550) and very high pressure (about 25 MPa) is required for SCWR .
This condition requires high-quality materials , and consequently , much money would be spent on research to find these materials .
Nevertheless , there indeed exist some advanced materials that can satisfy these requirements .
And many new successful studies are going on .
One of the ideal materials is the alloy MA956 .
It has excellent oxidation resistance up to 1370(2400) and significant creep strength up to its usually high melting point of 1482(2700) .
Thicker sections may be used up to 1370(2500) .
Corrosion-resistance is excellent for this material .
Therefore , material is no longer a problem .
Furthermore , SCWR is promised to supply low-cost electricity , and simpler design can minimize the cost , too .
Thus it is acceptable and worthy to spend some money on the further material research .
As we mention the simple design above , many people's common opposing view is that lacking some kinds of designs may cause some unexpected dangers , since the design is still on paper .
But we should have known that we do not just use water as coolant only this time in SCWR .
In fact , many generation III reactors , such as advanced pressurized water reactor (APWR) , advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) , economic simplified boiling water reactor (ESBWR) , involve water as coolant .
The design and structure of the reactor are quite similar , and therefore we are very experienced in the design .
This system , as I mentioned before , presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design .
The eliminated design like circulation pumps , steam generators and steam separators would not affect the safety factor at all , while the eliminated pressurizers and dryers may affect a little .
However , we can assume that experienced experts in this field can overcome such little obstacle .
Since nuclear waste separates out plutonium , which is a key ingredient of nuclear weapon , many people may be concerned about terrorists' attacks on nuclear power plant or accidental explosions .
Security enhancement has already been made since the day nuclear energy was born .
We improve these security devices day by day .
By now , these techniques are very advanced .
Scientists have added steps to lengthen stored time of waste .
In fact , there are fewer accidental explosions in recent years .
And of course we specially make security systems to minimize the nuclear radiation if the plant is attacked by terrorists .
Besides , defending systems are enhanced and increased when a plant is built .
To conclude , despite these opposing arguments , SCWR has an absolutely promising future for the nuclear energy .
Therefore , it should be encouraged in further research and development funding .
As fossil fuels are non-renewable natural resources , it is unwise to be too dependent on it as our main source of energy .
Being non-renewable , the price of fossil fuels would only get more expensive as time passes .
Moreover , as burning fossil fuels to generate energy releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere , it would be ideal to find a replacement source of energy as early as possible to lessen the global warming effect .
All these major factors have lead many countries to start looking for alternative sources of energy to replace the usage of fossil fuels .
One of these alternative sources would be using nuclear power .
Currently , nuclear power is rejected by the public due to its risk of operation , cost and performance .
However , the new developments of Generation IV reactors show promises as future source of energy .
In order for these new generations of reactors to take over as sources of energy , resources must be invested into it before these ideas can turn into reality .
Out of these Generation IV reactors , the VHTR seems to be the most ideal to be invested for development .
In order to fund the development of the VHTR , support of the public need to be gained through evaluation of its security , costs and performances .
One major concern of the public on nuclear power plants is the plutonium waste produced during reprocessing .
Plutonium is a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 240) However , VHTR is one of the few nuclear reactors that do not produce plutonium waste .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 239 , Para .3) Moreover , energy generation through VHTR does not produce greenhouse gases like the burning of fossil fuels , reducing global warming indirectly .
Therefore , public concerns on plutonium being produced to make advanced nuclear weapons would no longer be valid .
In order for the VHTR nuclear reactor to be ideal for commercial production of energy , a lot of research is needed .
The funds needed for this research would be very costly .
However , if there is no other new sources of energy , the increasing energy demand would make the cost of oil and coal much more expensive in the long run .
The energy demand from US transport alone will cause the nation's oil imports to soar by 78% by 2025 .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 239 , Para .1) Hence , by investing in the research of VHTR , there will be less reliance on oil and coal for energy , making the costs of energy usage more stable and affordable .
The most major concern of the public on nuclear power plants would be its safety .
Nuclear power plants are dangerous as any human errors could result in leakage of radioactive substances , damaging the environment as well as causing deaths .
From past experiences on nuclear power plants , memories of accidents of partial reactor meltdown in 1979 and explosion of reactor core in 1986 would only cause the public to be more sceptical towards them .
(Nature Vol 429 , Page 238 , Para .4) In order to prevent history from repeating itself , the new generation of reactors would use simple and effective safety measures that do not depend on complicated systems .
They are designed to be human independent whenever an accident occurs .
With this safety feature , accidents due to human errors could be prevented and would no longer be an issue .
In addition , the VHTR uses materials that have low reactivity and high temperature endurance .
(wapedia , page 4 , Para 2) One example would be the usage of helium as the coolant which has no reactivity effects .
(wapedia , page 3 , Para 1) With all these aspects of safety taken into consideration , the public should be ensured that nuclear power plants would be a safe source of energy .
To sum it all up , the many concerns the public has on the past generations of nuclear reactors that lead to catastrophic accidents are addressed in VHTR .
The problem of plutonium waste being produced in past nuclear reactors is no longer present in VHTR .
The probability of human errors that lead to accidents are also largely reduced through human independent safety features .
Moreover , due to the rising cost of using fossil fuels , the cost of researching in VHTR has become more worthwhile in the long run .
Therefore , VHTR should be further researched and funded for a better tomorrow .
Due to the rising demand of energy and the need to solve the problems in the design of current reactor , generation IV reactor has been developed .
It is developed to improve the performance of previous generations of reactors .
The nuclear powers that produced from the generator can offset other primary fuels in many applications other than the production of electricity .
The new Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) concepts focus mainly on sustainable nuclear power , with very efficient resource use and so little wastage .
It has a very strong focus on (passive) safety .
The GFR system features a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium .
The reactor is helium-cooled with an outlet temperature of approximately 850  C . It uses a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency .
Several forms of fuel are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures .
The GFR's fast spectrum makes it feasible to utilize available fissile and fertile materials (including depleted uranium from enrichment plants) .
"This high flux level generally translates into a very high fission rate , and as a result the power density in a fast reactor core is usually very high , typically of the order of 300 MW/m3 , which is 3 to 4 times higher than in light water reactor (LWRs) ."
(Van Rooijen , 2009) .
Furthermore , through the combination of a fast neutron spectrum and full recycle of actinides , GFRs minimize the production of long-lived radioactive waste isotopes , and can be designed for minor actinide management from used up fuel .
Finck .P (2006) , Future of nuclear Energy and the role of Nuclear Data .
Peter Rullhusen , Nuclear Data Needs for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , the international workshop .
In common with other fast reactors , GFRs also have the exceptional potential , due to the hard neutron spectrum , as sustainable energy sources using the fissile materials , and could then minimize nuclear waste .
The design of GFR development strategy is to take full advantage of the Very High Temperature Reactor development (VHTR) .
The two reactor concepts use a common coolant (helium) and high temperature to maximize the thermal efficiency for electricity generation and enhance prospects for hydrogen generation .
The design of GFR is for no off-site radioactivity release and would require the efficiency , simplicity , robustness and reliability of systems and physical barriers .
However , high temperature of VHTR has limited the use of available metallic components for the heat utilization or power conversion systems .
When VHTR is at 950 C , the lifetime of available high temperature alloys will be reduced .
As a consequence , components being exposed to high temperatures may have to be replaced every 15-20 years if no better materials can be qualified .
In comparison , GFR require less visual inspection than VHTR since it produced relatively lesser heat .
Also , in building of the VHTR , there will only be countable choices of building materials that can be used since they must have the ability to withstand very high temperature .
Thus , the construction of VHTR reactor will definitely be more costly as compared to GFR .
Hence , it is relatively cheaper to build GFR than VHTR .
Moreover , GFR is more environmental friendly as it has an advanced recycling technology that reduces the number of waste as compare with the VHTR .
